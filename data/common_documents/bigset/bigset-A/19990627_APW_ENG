<HEADLINE> Summit Means Little to Brazil's Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- From his brick hovel high in the  
Santo Amaro slum, Elinaldo Pereira can see the arrival of 
presidents and prime ministers at the Museum of Modern Art just 
below. But the gulf between their worlds is as wide as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	While world leaders discuss free trade and political ties at a  
summit at the museum starting Monday, Pereira will trudge down the 
hill to the city center, where he makes a modest living taking 
photos of soldiers stationed in Rio to send home to their 
sweethearts. 
</P>
<P>
	If free trade between Europe and Latin America could mean an  
additional $5 billion for this continent, it means little to 
Pereira and 100 million Brazilians -- about two-thirds of the 
population -- who earn $228 a month or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the people here, the summit's not going to change  
anything. We call it the 'seminar of nonsense,''' said Pereira, 32. 
``Maybe it will help the big guys, but for us nothing ever 
changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pereira admitted he didn't know much about what was going on  
down below. But he had heard that the possibility of a free trade 
agreement with Europe -- whatever that was -- could be bad for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I hear, all of this is going to make Bill Clinton  
jealous because we can buy things from other places and not just 
the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of Rio's poor and disenfranchised, the summit is at  
best an opportunity to air their gripes. Everyone from union groups 
to gay groups to unemployed health inspectors plan to protest 
outside the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many say the city is trying to sweep the ``other Brazil'' under  
the rug, removing homeless from the streets and painting over the 
graffiti on walls and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Rio Mayor Luiz Paulo Conde denied that the city was hiding its  
poor but admitted it had spent some $12 million to spruce up for 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will see how the city has improved. There are people  
coming here who were here for Eco '92 and they will notice the 
change,'' said Conde, referring to the Earth Summit that brought 
more than 100 world leaders to this city in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But miles away on Rio's poor north side, where shantytowns  
litter the hillsides and the foul smell from the polluted Guanabara 
Bay hangs heavy in the air, Roque Paixao Silva says things have 
only gotten worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen so much unemployment, so many factories  
closing,'' said Silva, who makes cheap plastic sandals that he 
sells out of a stall. 
</P>
<P>
	For Silva, 34, the summit only means that police have moved into  
his slum and that the violence should decrease for a few days. 
After that he expects everything to return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what they're here to talk about, but if there's  
any help for Brazil it will come from outside,'' he said. 
``Politicians here only know how to exploit the people.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Planting Program Hampered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- When Europeans began settling the South, a  
blanket of longleaf pines stretched 60 million acres from Virginia 
to Texas. Four centuries later, only 600,000 acres remain and a 
federal planting program designed to revive the species is hampered 
by a seedling shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Longleaf pines were the region's original pines, but over the  
years the trees have been felled to make room for homes, roads and 
farms. Meanwhile, other pine species -- some that came from other 
regions -- have crowded the longleaf out of forests they once 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Unique to the Southeast, longleaf pines provide homes to dozens  
of plants and animals, including the endangered red cockaded 
woodpecker and the indigo snake. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government, through the Conservation Reserve  
Program, or CRP, offered monthly payments to landowners -- from $30 
to $55 per acre -- to plant longleaf pines on former farmland. But 
no one consulted Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Longleaf seed production peaks about every five to eight years.  
Currently, production is in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little longleaf seed available,'' said forester  
Russ Pohl, who works at the Georgia Forestry Commission's 
reforestation office in Macon. ``So even if you had the nursery 
space, it would be hard to find the seed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's tree nurseries will produce about 2.5 million  
longleaf seedlings this year. Georgia landowners need about 37 
million, and production at public and private nurseries ``won't 
even meet half of that,'' Pohl predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Hatten, the state's CRP coordinator, said 2,700 Georgia  
landowners have agreed to plant 74,000 acres of longleaf pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the landowners won't be able to get seedlings until next  
year. ``It's going to delay some of the planting and some of the 
landowners might lose a little enthusiasm,'' Hatten said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CRP was started in 1984 to reduce soil erosion. The U.S.  
Agriculture Department paid farmers to plant pines in the South and 
grasses in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Through last year, more than 8,500 Georgia landowners had signed  
up, planting about 350,000 acres in loblolly, slash and other types 
of pines. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage is causing uncertainty for many landowners, said  
Albany forester Doug Hall, whose company anticipated the shortage 
and locked in a supply for existing customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have called me that are not our clients who  
want trees,'' he said. He refers them to an entrepreneur who 
anticipated the problem and had 1 million seedlings grown under 
contract. But even that supply may have dried up by now. 
</P>
<P>
	State nurseries in Georgia, Alabama and Florida predict tight  
supplies of all types of pine seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials blame the drought last summer that killed many newly  
planted seedlings. They also note that the industry has not fully 
recovered from a seedling shortage last year. Landowners who had to 
scale back reforestation were hoping to catch up this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lazenby, the Georgia Forestry Commission's executive  
director, said he doesn't believe the shortage will have a major 
impact on Georgia's $19.4-billion-a-year forest industry. But it 
could mean a setback for individual landowners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to wait a year and lose at least one  
growing season,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Smokers' Landmark Suit Goes to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jurors in the first smokers' class-action lawsuit  
to go to trial are expected to begin deliberations Monday, 
following eight months of testimony in the $200 billion lawsuit 
filed on behalf of up to 500,000 sick Florida smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member jury will be asked to decide whether the nation's  
five biggest cigarette makers and two industry groups are 
responsible for injuries smokers claim they suffered because they 
couldn't quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry contends smokers should have known the risks of  
smoking and are responsible for their own decision to light up. 
Tobacco officials also deny allegations they purposely made more 
addictive cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	If jurors find for the plaintiffs, damages would be determined  
in a separate phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are enormous,'' said anti-tobacco activist and  
Northeastern University law professor Richard Daynard. ``They're 
enormous for the defendants much more so than for the plaintiffs. 
If they lose this case, there are lots of other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye imposed a gag order barring lawyers  
and parties from talking about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards of lawsuits settled by states have gone into state  
treasuries. In this case, the smokers themselves are seeking 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, the husband and wife team  
representing smokers, used thousands of tobacco documents released 
after Minnesota settled its case against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokers are suing Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson, Lorillard, Liggett, the Council for Tobacco Research 
and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Rio Summit Leaders Seek Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) --European and Latin American leaders  
will try to forge a new strategic partnership at their summit 
opening Monday, hoping to counterbalance the political and economic 
dominance of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Key among the issues for the leaders of 48 European, Caribbean  
and South American nations during the two-day summit will be a 
Europe-Latin America free-trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big chance for Europe and Latin America,'' said German  
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at a pre-summit gathering of 
ministers Sunday. ``We should use this historic chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is an idea, however, whose time may not quite have come.  
</P>
<P>
	There had been talk of linking the 15-nation European Union and  
Mercosur, the South American trade bloc that includes Brazil, 
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and associated members Chile and 
Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, the EU has backed away from laying out a  
timetable to negotiate the link-up. Earlier, proposals were being 
floated for starting negotiations in 2001 and finishing them by 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the EU-Mercosur  
negotiations will have to proceed at the same pace as the 
multilateral efforts within the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe is the No. 1 trading partner and the No. 1 investor in  
Latin America. The agreements that will be reached here will 
strengthen our relations and presence in Latin America,'' Matutes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new trade agreement with Latin America would introduce a new  
balance to U.S. influence, Matutes said. ``The good relations of 
the United States with Latin America do not have to exclude the 
existence of good relations between the EU and Latin America,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers were working Sunday on the summit declaration  
to be finalized by the leaders, which is expected to deal with a 
variety of issues, including human rights, terrorism, drugs and 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers agreed on language for the declaration mentioning  
the need to control the movement of capital, Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Jose Alfredo Graca Lima said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Brazil and Chile contended that making it harder  
for capital to jump from country to country would reduce the world 
economy's volatility and curb the spread of crises. Brazil was hit 
hard when the Asian financial crisis shook South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct European investment in Latin America doubled from 1996 to  
1997, reaching $17 billion. Spain accounted for a third of that 
amount, followed by Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	EU exports to Latin America reached $52.4 billion in 1997,  
double the 1987 amount. EU imports from Latin America totaled $38.1 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Sea Life Said Threatened by Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Noise from supertankers, oil exploration and  
new military sonar equipment scrambles the communications systems 
of sea life, forcing changes in migration routes and breeding 
grounds, a new report warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing Russian roulette with our oceans, and we can't  
afford to do that,'' said Joel Reynolds, senior attorney with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group 
responsible for the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, scheduled to be released Monday, says underwater  
noise pollution could alter the ocean habitat and calls for a 
harder look at how noise affects sea creatures as well as stiffer 
regulations to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a serious problem. The problem is, we don't know how  
serious it is,'' said Roger Gentry, acoustics team coordinator for 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees most marine 
life in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was ``a pretty fair summary'' of the issues that  
acoustics experts in government, the military, academia and the 
environmental movement have struggled with as they assess how noise 
affects sea life, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean noise is similar to the visual effects of strip malls and  
electrical wires on dry land, according to Cornell University 
bioacoustics expert Christopher W. Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Clark's studies have suggested that the effects of two  
high-profile ocean-noise emitters could be less dire than 
environmentalists feared, he also urges caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just went out and listened in the Channel Islands,  
you'd be appalled,'' he said. ``Those places off San Francisco, off 
Los Angeles -- you're just in the middle of an acoustics traffic 
jam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those three sites, as well as Monterey and San Diego bays, are  
pinpointed in the study as having high levels of underwater noise 
and abundant sea life. Environmentalists are calling for special 
efforts to reduce noise in those locations. 
</P>
<P>
	In dark sea waters, mammals such as whales and dolphins appear  
to use their hearing -- much as humans use sight -- to seek out food, 
find mates, guard their young and avoid predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Man-made noise may harm marine mammals, especially since sound  
travels faster through water than air. Whales sometimes change 
direction during migration to avoid noise and abandon their 
traditional breeding grounds, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	However, research is too new to say definitively whether these  
behavioral changes may harm mammal populations in the long term, 
said Clark and Gentry.

<HEADLINE>  Gay Pride Celebrated With Parades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some marched in evening gowns, some in leather  
thongs, some danced to disco music and some had political messages. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 30th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, when patrons of  
a gay bar in Greenwich Village fought back against a police raid, 
members of the gay community turned out Sunday to celebrate their 
pride with parades in Manhattan, San Francisco, and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, some parade-goers complained of heavy-handed  
treatment by police officers who ejected a group with a slogan 
criticizing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and forced another set to cut 
short a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Floats rolling down Fifth Avenue carried gay gospel singers,  
AIDS activists, and a disc jockey named Billy deMace who told 
spectators: ``We're going to play a song in memory of our friends 
who died of AIDS and hate crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' began to play, a drag  
queen dressed in a black evening gown lip-synched the words. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those watching was a group called Parents and Friends of  
Lesbians and Gays. ``To have my mom out here is a joy,'' said Frank 
Jump, 40, with his arm around his mother. ``I came out to her at a 
young age, and we've been coming to the parade together for 20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1969 Stonewall Riots are commemorated around the world as a  
watershed for gay rights, and the bar, the Stonewall Inn, is being 
added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Gay 
Pride Parade began in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berlin this weekend, rainbow flags flew, marchers threw  
feathers to the crowd and half-naked men wearing bird costumes 
danced in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, Phillipines, marchers carried placards reading:  
``Same sex, same love.'' One Filipino gay man, Edgar Mendoza, told 
reporters: ``We are doing this event because we are proud of what 
we are, we are proud of how God made us to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, leather clothes, feather boas, and platform  
shoes mixed with shorts and T-shirts. A half-million spectators 
stood five-deep along the parade route, and marchers ranged from 
members of a gay veterans' group to a contingent from an antique 
auto club for gays. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade was interrupted early by an unscheduled contingent  
from Act Up! The activists carried signs including ``Sex Doesn't 
Kill'' and ``Open the Baths,'' referring to the city's recently 
revitalized controversy over public bathhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainbow-striped banners and feather boas decorated the winding  
streets of Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood on Sunday. Candace 
Gingrich, the lesbian sister of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
and a speaker at the Chicago event, said the parade showed how far 
acceptance of homosexuals has come. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in New York, Giuliani marched, as he always does, with Log  
Cabin, a gay Republican group. The group's legislative director, 
Robert Hasek, heralded New York City's domestic partnership policy, 
which provides health insurance and other benefits for same-sex 
partners of city employees, as ``the best of any in the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor waved and smiled as he walked the route, saying:  
``It's a wonderful celebration. I'm here every year.'' Some in the 
crowd applauded, but others booed. Gay activist Bill Dobbs 
complained that City Hall has spent too much time shutting down 
porn shops and too little time fighting AIDS. He handed out cards 
reading: ``Stop Giuliani's Sex Police!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across from St. Patrick's Cathedral, a dozen members of Dignity  
-- a group for gays who are Roman Catholic -- prayed for acceptance 
by their church. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every other parade, the cardinal is on the steps greeting  
people,'' said Brendan Fay. ``It's always sad for me to see the 
doors shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A block away, Randall Terry, leader of the anti-abortion group  
Operation Rescue, protested. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you repent, God will forgive you!'' he shouted. Drag queens  
blew him kisses in response. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of gay firefighters called Fireflag marched for the  
first time as a fraternal organization officially recognized by the 
city. A half-dozen male ballet dancers leapt their way down Fifth 
Avenue, while square dancers swung their partners. The Brazilian 
Rainbow Group featured towering Carmen Miranda-style headdresses 
made from fruit and flowers, and men in colorful saris walked with 
the South Asian Lesbian and Gay Group. Salim Patel, costumed as Ra 
the Sun God, was covered head to toe in gold body paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freedom to be different,'' said Grand Marshal Joan Nestle,  
``is a freedom for all of us.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Rocket Failure Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A breach in the combustion chamber of a Pratt &AMP;  
Whitney rocket engine is probably the reason why a communications 
satellite was sent into the wrong orbit last month, Boeing Co. 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	A computerized reconstruction of the event indicated that ``an  
explosive-type event'' in the chamber was caused by a breach during 
the launch using a Delta III rocket May 4 from Cape Canaveral, 
Fla., said a Boeing statement issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Reck, engineering director for Boeing's expendable  
launch systems program in Huntington Beach, Calif., said the next 
goal is to determine the cause of the breach. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second launch failure in as many attempts with the  
Delta III. The first ended in self-destruction of the rocket 
because of a guidance malfunction in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has firm customers for 18 more launches with the Delta  
III. The next is set for this fall.

<HEADLINE> Woman Found After 11 Days in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A woman missing for nearly two weeks in  
the Alaska backcountry was found alive by a hiker in a steep 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Headrick, 30, was discovered Saturday lying under a plastic  
tarp by a man hiking to a mining cabin near Hope, a thinly 
populated area about 20 miles south of Anchorage, Alaska State 
Troopers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Headrick was reported in good condition Sunday in an Anchorage  
hospital. She had been dressed in light clothes when she 
disappeared June 15. She had last been seen a few miles from where 
she was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The movement of Headrick's arm under the tarp caught the hiker's  
eye, Trooper Sgt. Nils Monsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She moved her arm as if she was summoning aid,'' Monson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Libby Headrick said: ``This is the happiest day of  
my life ... The first thing she says to me is, 'Mom, I'm so sorry. 
I know you must have been so worried.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Headrick was last seen wandering along the Seward Highway.  
Her car had run out of gas about six miles away.

<HEADLINE> Doles Urges Crack Down on Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth  
Dole wants to withhold federal money from public libraries that 
don't close ``pornography-permitting loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, in a bid today to enter the family values debate,  
says libraries should install computer software that blocks access 
to pornographic sites on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has passed a bill that reduces federal money to  
libraries that don't install the software in computers used by 
children. In an appearance near Seattle today, Mrs. Dole was 
arguing that the measure also should apply to computers used by 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pornography is off-limits to children but it is readily  
accessible to adults. That's wrong,'' the former American Red Cross 
president said in a draft of a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was sending a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., urging them 
to close ``pornography-permitting loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't let pornography slip in through an electronic  
backdoor,'' she said in the draft remarks. ``This isn't about First 
Amendment protection. It's about values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, ranked second behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush in  
most Republican presidential polls, has distinguished herself from 
the crowded GOP field by embracing modest gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said her actions today mark a new phase in her campaign,  
as she begins to outline her family values agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Several new public polls suggest a growing concern among voters  
about moral leadership in America. One survey gave Republicans a 
lead of nearly 20 percentage points over Democrats when asked which 
party best represents the values of faith in God, personal 
responsibility, ethics and honesty.

<HEADLINE> TWA Has Big Plans for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines officials have big plans  
for the future, but first they must weather continued financial 
struggles and a spate of labor disputes that have, at times, 
threatened their company's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days after TWA reached a tentative agreement with its  
biggest union earlier this month, the company announced plans for 
an uncharacteristic expansion in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing was coincidental, but the two events illustrate the  
company's dual efforts to fend off a labor war and then broaden its 
horizons. 
</P>
<P>
	The first is a prerequisite to the second, company officials  
know. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA is counting on labor peace to spur the productivity  
improvements it needs to generate more revenue and climb back into 
the black after a decade of annual losses. 
</P>
<P>
	And should that peace be realized, the airline will embark on a  
new strategy to remake its operations and image. The plan, set to 
be formally announced in early August, is dubbed Vision 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan involves TWA expanding beyond its historic hubs in St.  
Louis and New York and developing two to three focus cities, 
starting with San Juan. Service there will increase from three 
flights a day to 15 on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA is hoping the new routes will help boost its share of the  
U.S. market, which has slipped to just 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make some changes in the way people think about  
us,'' said Mark Abels, vice president for corporate communications. 
``We need to think about our brand image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although TWA's expansion plan includes adding flights from  
Lambert Field and New York, the emphasis is on routes that bypass 
those historical connecting points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we have to get bigger,'' Abels said. ``We put the  
fleet plan in place to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another element of the plan is training, especially training  
front-line workers about how to talk to customers and how to handle 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of TWA's new strategy will depend partly on external  
factors. Fuel prices are rising, and securities analysts are 
projecting that seven of the nation's 10 top airlines will post 
lower year-over-year earnings in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Capacity also is rising as airlines step up deliveries of new  
jets, putting more pressure on fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, TWA and outside analysts say the labor agreements it  
has offered three employee groups represented by the International 
Association of Machinists will stretch the airline to its financial 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those contract agreements, announced June 13, came after the  
union threatened a selective strike over the Fourth of July 
weekend. Some industry analysts publicly questioned whether TWA 
could survive such a move. Now they're questioning whether it can 
survive the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Jenkins, a professor at George Washington University,  
said in a study earlier this month that unless TWA finds a way to 
boost revenue at a faster rate than the rest of the industry, it 
will have a hard time keeping its end of the bargain with workers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 16,000 mechanics, baggage handlers, flight attendants and  
other workers are voting on new 18-month contracts. The proposals 
would boost hourly wages by 11.5 percent to 23.5 percent but still 
leave workers below their peers at other major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratification meetings have been tense -- a fist fight broke  
out Thursday in Kansas City -- and even union leaders say privately 
that the vote could be close. 
</P>
<P>
	The length of the proposed contracts would guarantee that the  
two sides would be back at the bargaining table within a year.

<HEADLINE> Lloyd Urges Wimbledon To Lose Grass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- John Lloyd has some advice for Wimbledon -- dig up  
the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The former British Davis Cup player insists a more even playing  
surface will improve the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament would be a lot better off with the demise of  
grass,'' he wrote in a newspaper column for the Independent On 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of tennis would improve by leaps and bounds, it  
would be three times better to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said the backlash from converting the world's premier  
grass-court tournament into a synthetic court event would be 
short-lived and the essence of Wimbledon would survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not meant as a snub to Wimbledon, which is the  
greatest event in the sport, but it is not the grass at Wimbledon 
that makes it so special,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Digging up the grass would cause a slight blip and then it  
would be quickly forgotten. Wimbledon would be so much better on a 
medium-paced surface.''

<HEADLINE> Proposed Implant Settlement Facts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts about proposed settlement between Dow Corning Corp. and  
lawyers representing thousands of women who say silicone breast 
implants hurt them: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women whose conditions qualify them for disease payments could  
receive $12,000 to $300,000 for the most serious medical 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women who want to settle immediately and don't intend to file  
a disease claim could get $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Both groups can also get $5,000 for implant removal surgery  
and $20,000 for ruptured implants. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women would have up to 15 years to file a disease claim and up  
to 10 years to file a claim for implant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Certain women with breast implants made by other U.S.  
manufacturers involving Dow Corning material may qualify for up to 
40 percent of an expedited or disease payment. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women who choose not to settle would maintain their rights to  
a jury trial. All claims from these lawsuits would have to be paid 
from a $400 million pool. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Attorneys' fees are limited to 10 percent of the first $10,000  
paid, 22.5 of the next $40,000 paid and 30 percent of any payment 
over $50,000.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Winner Bertelli Dies at 78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- Angelo Bertelli, who won the Heisman Trophy  
in 1943 while at Notre Dame, died Saturday at his home of brain 
cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelli won college football's highest honor during a season  
shortened by his serving in the Marine Corps. He played six games 
for the Fighting Irish before being called to active duty in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	At Notre Dame, Bertelli went from being a tall, skinny 165-pound  
fourth-string tailback to its first T-formation quarterback. He 
also was the school's first of seven Heisman winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelli's shortened season at Notre Dame was undefeated with a  
collective score of 261-31. Bertelli had completed 70 percent of 
his passes, 25-of-36, for 512 yards and 10 touchdowns with only 
four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly been a very prominent person in our athletic  
program. When you win an award of that stature, it's not as though 
you disappear,'' Notre Dame athletic spokesman John Heisler said 
Sunday. ``It wasn't uncommon to see him back here despite the fact 
that he lived in New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame athletics director Mike Wadsworth said he was  
impressed with Bertelli's willingness to help the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``Angelo was always very humble and a person generous with his  
time to Notre Dame students and to the university, responding on so 
many occasions when, because of his celebrity, he was called 
upon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a captain in the Marines, Bertelli played  
professional football for the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America 
Football Conference. A knee injury ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in West Springfield, Mass., Bertelli operated a  
liquor store in Clifton for 48 years. He also served as director of 
the North Jersey Automobile Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Gilda; two sons, Michael of  
Allendale, and Robert of Hoboken; two daughters, Lauren Bertelli of 
Waldwick, and Judith Wry of Manchester, Conn.; two sisters and five 
grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be held Wednesday at 9:15 a.m. at the  
Bizub-Quinlan Funeral Home, 1313 Van Houten Ave., Clifton, N.J. A 
funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. at the St. Andrew the 
Apostle Roman Catholic Church at 400 Mount Prospect Ave., Clifton. 
Visiting hours are Tuesday from 2 to 4 p.m., and 7 to 9 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Face Uncertain Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Knicks said their goodbyes  
Sunday and drove off into an uncertain summer, unsure whether 
management will make big changes to try to improve the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're going to do something. If not, then I think  
we can win with whoever's here,'' guard Latrell Sprewell said. ``I 
think we have all the components here, we just need to play 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 48 hours after their loss to the San Antonio Spurs in  
Game 5 of the NBA Finals, the Knicks held their final team meeting 
and cleaned out their lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some left with their belongings in fancy leather luggage, others  
departed with plastic garbage bags over their shoulders. None left 
with a feeling of total satisfaction after advancing so far in the 
playoffs but failing to put up a good enough fight against the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guards Charlie Ward and Chris Childs said they were both  
unsure whether they'll back next season. It has been no secret 
around the league for a long time that the Knicks would like to 
upgrade at that position, but very few top-notch point guards will 
be available this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility would be for the Knicks to select a point guard  
with the 15th pick in Wednesday's draft, especially if Jason Terry 
of Arizona or William Avery of Duke falls that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Brandon of Minnesota, Nick Van Exel of Denver and  
Sherman Douglas of the Los Angeles Clippers are among the available 
free agents, but the Knicks have no salary cap room and would have 
to make a sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want a change, it's on them,'' Childs said. ``We made  
it to the finals, we just didn't win it. What more can you want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy and team president Dave Checketts are  
expected to meet soon to discuss the team's future and the 
turbulent events of the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy will likely ask for a greater say in future personnel  
moves, something he didn't have when general manager Ernie Grunfeld 
was revamping the team. Grunfeld was demoted by Checketts in 
mid-April when the Knicks were in jeopardy of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Player personnel director Ed Tapscott is among the candidates to  
take over the GM duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure everything will come up,'' Van Gundy said. ``I know  
Dave's in charge, but I don't know what his plans are. I'll wait 
until I talk to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks proved in the postseason that they can win with an up  
tempo, guard-oriented offense built around the talents of Sprewell 
and Allan Houston. They expect to have a healthy Patrick Ewing back 
at center when the 1999-2000 season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing missed the final nine games of the playoffs with a  
partially torn Achilles' tendon. New York was 4-5 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of hearing all that stuff that the team's better off  
without me,'' Ewing said before driving off in a white Mercedes. 
``My role is not going to change. My role is going to be the 
same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out of all the Knicks, the one who stood around and talked the  
longest before climbing into his car was forward Marcus Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	After being the most maligned member of the team before having a  
strong postseason and earning a starting spot during the finals, 
Camby was feeling a sense of vindication as he stood in the 
sweltering sun and summed up his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely tough sitting there on that bench knowing  
that you were well deserving to go out there and play. I had to be 
patient, and now that I've had time to look back on the season, it 
was fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I proved my point out there on the court, I proved I'm able to  
be a starter or play significant minutes off the bench. Most 
important is that I want to win. What San Antonio did Friday night, 
that's what we want to do next season.''

<HEADLINE> Big Day To Kick Off Wimbledon Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Boris Becker's emphatic return, Jim  
Courier's emotional revival and Jelena Dokic's extraordinary rout 
of Martina Hingis set up a Super Monday of matches starting week 
two of Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	If rain doesn't intrude on the sunniest Wimbledon in years,  
Centre Court will be a showcase of impassioned clashes beginning 
with Britain's Tim Henman trying to avenge a Davis Cup loss to 
Courier. 
</P>
<P>
	John McEnroe caught the mood of that much anticipated match, and  
fanned some flames, by accusing Henman and his teammates of choking 
against Courier in the Davis Cup two months ago on an indoor court 
in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Henman said he ``desperately'' wants to beat Courier, and the  
American said he's eager to feed off the energy of a crowd that 
will be against him from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier was hospitalized and given an intravenous drip for  
dehydration during his five-setter Friday. He said he's completely 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams and Anna Kournikova, the two most photographed  
and followed women in the tournament, will be up next on Centre 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Anna that I like grass,'' Williams said after hearing  
that Kournikova disparaged her chances to win Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, the 31-year-old three-time champion back for his last  
hurrah, then takes on Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open 
champion, in a duel of classic serve-and-volleyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to play halfway,'' Becker said. ``It's all or  
nothing. That's the way I've been playing all my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the other themes of the first week -- the record run of  
five qualifiers into the round of 16 -- will by played out in the 
Court One stadium, where former champion Andre Agassi starts off 
against the so-far unbreakable serves of Australian journeyman 
Wayne Arthurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthurs has faced only six break points against his serve in  
three matches, and brushed them all away. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time women's champ Steffi Graf follows against another  
qualifier, Kim Clijsters of Belgium, before an ace-a-thon between 
Greg Rusedski and Mark Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	Court 2, the dreaded ``Graveyard of Champions'' where Richard  
Krajicek was buried by qualifier Lorenzo Manta on Saturday, gets a 
shot at five-time and defending champ Pete Sampras when he meets 
Canada's Daniel Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
	Court 2 should also be packed for the duel between Dokic and  
Mary Pierce, after an opening match pitting No. 3 Lindsay Davenport 
against Barbara Schett.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Draw Fans From All Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Erica Stoloff bit into the hamburger in  
the back seat of the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the U.S. flag flying 
from the driver's window. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the car, her father tended the portable grill in the  
parking lot on a hot Sunday afternoon a week before the Fourth of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	An American scene for an American team playing in Foxboro  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why I'm here is right there,'' said Bob Stoloff of  
nearby Canton, pointing to his 16-year-old daughter. ``She's a big 
soccer nut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, three hours before the United States began its 3-0  
win over North Korea to finish the opening round of the women's 
World Cup with a 3-0 record, the black-haired girl with silver 
braces bounded out of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to go crazy,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A raucous group of middle-aged Italians seemed well on their way  
to that destination a short distance away. Four of them each held a 
corner of an unfurled American flag, while the most vocal had an 
Italian flag draped around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a double treat: Italy played Mexico in the first game  
before the United States took the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love Italy, but we're rooting for the U.S. since Italy is  
out of contention,'' said Ralph Parziale, a stocky 52-year-old with 
a thick gray mustache. Later, he had reason to smile as Italy won 
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a blue Italian soccer shirt, then lifted it to reveal a  
white T-shirt with the letters U-S-A and an American flag printed 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the second game,'' he said, ``we pull the Italian shirts  
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Parziale, who emigrated from Italy to the United States in  
1961, and his friends continued their parade through the parking 
lot, blowing a whistle and clanging a cow bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia also was represented.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fantastic opportunity for women to demonstrate their  
skills at a world level,'' said Steve Vuletic, 28, of Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was a Jamaican who kicked a yellow-and-white soccer  
ball around with his daughters Teja, 11, and Alexia, 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World Cup is good for the sport,'' said Everett Hay, 37,  
who played soccer in his native country. ``It's going to get the 
women involved, and that's good, because there are a lot of 
countries where women don't play soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's an assistant coach on his oldest daughter's soccer team in  
Randolph. The head coach, Mark Jacobs, also was there with his 
daughter, Leah, 11, who confessed to a hatred of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she grows up and her husband says, `Let's go to the  
ballgame,' she'll say, `You mean the soccer match?''' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's match was the first of the Americans' first-round games  
not attended by a capacity crowd. There were 50,484 fans in the 
58,868-seat stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty-thousand people. That's nothing to shake a stick at,''  
U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry said. ``They were as loud as the 
79,000 we had in New York'' for the opening 3-0 win over Denmark at 
the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was just awesome,'' said Shannon MacMillan, who had  
a goal and two assists. ``They gave us a lift whenever we got 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the anthems of North Korea and the United States were  
played, the Americans took off their yellow caps, went to the edge 
of the stands and tossed them in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throw them up here,'' said Zach Dewhirst, sitting in the upper  
level. Dewhirst, 21, of Sharon and a four-year soccer starter at 
Tufts University, wore a T-shirt with the message: ``I wish I was 
Property of the U.S. Women's National Team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the field, a group of about 600 fans was split into three  
vertical sections of about 200 each -- the one on the left wore red 
T-shirts, in the center white T-shirts and on the right blue 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	And one young fan had his face painted in similar vertical  
stripes with the letters U-S-A on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the game began and the crowd roared when Mia Hamm unleashed  
a 25-yard shot that bounced off Korean goalkeeper Kye Yong Sun's 
chest and over the end line for a corner kick -- a solid play by 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tournament demonstrates that women can play at the  
international level,'' said Carrie Taylor, 26, a former University 
of Michigan soccer player who lives in Cincinnati. ``I'm hoping 
this will translate to a women's professional league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another fan, 16-year-old Alyssa Eaton, had sprayed blue color in  
her hair and was wearing a white jersey with Hamm's No. 9 on it. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her family moved to Springfield from South Dakota in  
1991, the year the first women's World Cup was held in China. The 
Americans won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where we come from, there wasn't much soccer then,'' Alyssa  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure,'' said her mother Lynn, ``there is now.''

<HEADLINE> Victim Describes Killer's Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The only known survivor of an attack  
blamed on the man suspected of being a rail-riding serial killer is 
working hard to overcome the trauma, the woman's mother says. 
</P>
<P>
	While police nationwide search for the assailant, the young  
woman is studying abroad this summer, her mother told the Lexington 
Herald-Leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping there will be enough physical evidence from the  
other crimes to convict him without her having to testify,'' the 
woman's mother told the newspaper Saturday in a telephone interview 
from her home in another state. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper does not identify victims of sexual assault or  
their family members. The woman was a 20-year-old University of 
Kentucky junior studying finance at the time of the Aug. 29, 1997, 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Her boyfriend, 21-year-old Christopher Maier, also was attacked  
and died on the ground next to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old Mexican, is wanted for  
questioning in connection with five killings in Texas, two earlier 
this month in Illinois, where he faces capital murder charges, and 
the killing of Maier. An uncle in Mexico says the fugitive's real 
name is Angel Resendiz Resendiz. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article published in this summer's issue of the national  
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority magazine, The Key, and obtained by the 
Herald-Leader, the young woman describes how she and Maier were 
ambushed as they walked along railroad tracks near the University 
of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	A man appeared out of the bushes ``and stuck what appeared to be  
a knife into my boyfriend's side and demanded money,'' she said in 
the article. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, who the woman has identified as Resendez-Ramirez,  
became angry when they told him they didn't have any money, and 
tied them up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember being petrified. We were doing everything he told  
us to do, praying that he would not hurt us, but he fatally struck 
my boyfriend and them came over to me,'' the young woman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington police Sgt. Mark Barnard called Maier ``a real  
honest-to-God hero,'' saying he offered the attacker money, his 
car, ``anything just to let her live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assailant struck Maier in the head with an object before  
beating and raping the young woman, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer said the young woman pleaded with her attacker to  
help Maier. The man walked over to Maier and then said ``we won't 
have to worry about him anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He beat the woman again, breaking her jaw and eye socket and  
cutting her head and neck. The woman passed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she came to later, she was covered with shrubs,'' Barnard  
said. ``He left her, thinking she was dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As she recovered, the woman wrote, ``I wanted to crawl in a hole  
and never come out again, but that would have meant that I let this 
monster take me away.''

<HEADLINE> Diego Segui Misses Kingdome Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Ancient Mariner wasn't in Seattle for the  
Kingdome's farewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Diego Segui, Seattle's Opening Night pitcher in 1977, missed the  
final game, won by the Mariners 5-2 Sunday, because there was a 
mixup with his plane ticket in Kansas City, where he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
	When Segui got to the Kansas City airport Sunday morning, the  
ticket was there, but it wasn't paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	So he turned around and went home.  
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, first baseman David Segui, Diego's son, was upset  
that his father couldn't be in the Kingdome to throw out the 
ceremonial final pitch to former Mariners catcher Bob Stinson, who 
was behind the plate on April 6, 1977, in ceremonies after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hurt,'' David Segui told reporters before the game.  
</P>
<P>
	David's son Cory, 7, was used as a substitute to throw the last  
pitch in the Kingdome. Cory threw a hard strike to Stinson and the 
crowd applauded admiringly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so important that I do something like this,'' David Segui  
said of Cory's trip to the mound. ``I do everything I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui went 0-for-3 with an intentional walk.  
</P>
<P>
	Diego Segui also pitched for the Seattle Pilots in 1969. The  
Pilots moved to Milwaukee in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners spokesman Tim Hevly called said it was a mixup.  
</P>
<P>
	``We sent out nine plane tickets to former players and eight  
were used,'' Hevly said. ``I don't know what happened.''

<HEADLINE> 'Big Daddy' a Big Hit at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forced fatherhood beat out a jungle bachelor  
and a swinging superspy at the weekend box office, as Adam 
Sandler's ``Big Daddy'' moved past ``Tarzan'' and ``Austin Powers'' 
for the top spot with $41.2 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tarzan,'' the animated version of the man living in the  
jungle, moved to No. 2 with $23.5 million, and ``Austin Powers: The 
Spy Who Shagged Me'' dropped to No. 3 with $18.5 million during 
what could have been one of the biggest non-holiday weekends ever, 
said Paul Dergarabedian, a film industry analyst with Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 12 films have earned about 1 percent more than the top  
12 during last weekend's banner showing, according to preliminary 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of big films out there and the audience is  
expanding,'' Dergarabedian said. ``We're seeing astronomical 
numbers. There are films out there for every type of audience, 
combined with very effective marketing campaigns means very big 
numbers for all the films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coming Fourth of July weekend promises to be one of the  
biggest box office weekends ever, Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Big Daddy,'' Sandler plays a 32-year-old New York City  
tollbooth worker forced to grow up when he must care for a 
5-year-old orphan boy, played by identical twins Cole and Dylan 
Sprouse. 
</P>
<P>
	As a new father, Sandler combines his two film personas -- the  
juvenile clown of ``The Waterboy'' and the likable romantic of 
``The Wedding Singer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite mixed reviews, Sandler's efforts have always drawn fans.  
``The Waterboy'' brought in $39.4 million during its opening 
weekend last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy'' had the second-biggest opening for a comedy, just  
behind the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, which opened with $54 million 
two weeks ago. It was also the biggest non-sequel comedy opening 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the quirky sequel with Mike Myers  
returning as both the international man of mystery and Austin's 
bumbling nemesis Dr. Evil, has become the highest grossing film 
ever for New Line Cinema. Its three-week total of $150.8 million 
beat the studio's previous biggest hit ``Rush Hour,'' which brought 
in $144 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Big Daddy,'' $41.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Tarzan,'' $23.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $18.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The General's Daughter,'' $15.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $14.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Notting Hill,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Mummy,'' $2.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Instinct,'' $1.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``An Ideal Husband,'' $1.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Matrix,'' $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Padres' New Park Beset by Setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres were riding high in  
October, reaching the World Series for only the second time, with a 
new downtown ballpark on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds of up to 65,000 rocked Qualcomm Stadium for each playoff  
game. Thousands filled city streets for a downtown parade even 
after the Padres were swept by the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Still playing on the emotions of fans, the Padres hit a home run  
two weeks later when voters approved a $411 million downtown 
ballpark, which club officials said was imperative to their 
financial survival and to keeping them in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Things looked good.  
</P>
<P>
	Now everything seems an uphill grind.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite pledges that a new ballpark would allow the team to  
retain key veterans, there were big changes. Star players Kevin 
Brown, Greg Vaughn, Steve Finley, Joey Hamilton and Ken Caminiti 
were traded or allowed to leave as free agents within 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have helped put the team at the bottom of the NL West --  
although they have won eight straight games -- and slowed Tony Gwynn 
in his pursuit of 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	On the ballpark front, the Padres are facing the political  
version of a rain delay. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named  
the city's downtown warehouse district one of America's 11 most 
endangered historic places, helping opponents who wanted the 
ballpark site moved or to at least save turn-of-the-century 
buildings within a 26-block ballpark development district. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of a citizen's  
group and said the city and the Padres violated state law by 
proceeding with land condemnations and utility work before an 
environmental impact report was finished. Those aspects of the 
project were ordered stopped until the city council certifies the 
report in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the county grand jury accused Mayor Susan Golding with  
civil misconduct for securing $4 million in tourism marketing funds 
for a hotel-motel group in exchange for their endorsement for the 
ballpark measure last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The action against Golding has no legal influence on the  
ballpark project, but the culmination of events since the World 
Series has raised public suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything was laid on the table, the vote might be  
different,'' said Mike Hardy, co-owner of a tattoo shop. He voted 
for the ballpark, mostly because he's a lifelong Padres fan, but 
now he has doubts about the project's costs and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond J. Keating, who authored ``Sports Pork: the Costly  
Relationship between Major League Sports and Government,'' isn't 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start playing politics and get the government  
involved, sorry, this is the penance involved,'' said Keating, 
chief economist for the Washington-based Small Business Survival 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits and delays are common, but usually the projects wind up  
getting built. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, taxpayers are still on the hook for a good portion  
of it,'' Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42,000-seat Padres ballpark will be financed through $225  
million in city bonds, repaid from a tourism tax generated from 
hotels, some yet to be built; $115 million from the Padres; $50 
million from the city's land development agency; and $21 million 
from the Port District. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballpark is the centerpiece of a $1 billion downtown  
development plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres majority owner John Moores formed JMI Realty to purchase  
about 85 percent of the property needed for the ballpark project 
and to oversee development. He said recent developments won't stop 
the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``There inevitably will be litigation by people who don't care  
about the environment, but will try to achieve something in the 
courts they never achieved at the ballot box. But we're not about 
to give up,'' said Moores, who moved here from Houston after making 
a fortune in the software business. 
</P>
<P>
	No one's sure if the judge's 90-day delay will be enough to push  
back the ballpark's 2002 opening. Some in city government are 
worried because changes have to be made at Qualcomm Stadium as a 
condition for hosting the 2003 Super Bowl, and the work is easiest 
done if the Padres have left. The Padres currently share the 
stadium with the NFL's Chargers.

	U.S. Cost of Kosovo Conflict: $4B  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO's 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia  
cost the United States as much as $4 billion, according to private 
and congressional estimates. Annual peacekeeping and reconstruction 
expenses are expected to run nearly as high -- and that assumes the 
United States will honor President Clinton's pledge that ``not a 
penny'' will go to rebuild Serbia's roads and bridges while 
Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic remains in power. U.S. Air 
Force B-52 bombers launched 90 air-launched cruise missiles, which

	BELO POLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Stripping homes down to the

The pillaging of Belo Polje was the latest in what a Serbian 
Orthodox Church leader said is a systematic campaign of violence 
that is driving out even the few elderly, frail Serbs still 
remaining in the western city of Pec and nearby villages. Ethnic 
Albanians say the village was a stronghold of the most violent of 
Serb policemen who preyed on Kosovo Albanians during the war.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers in both parties say President  
Clinton's proposal to reform Medicare is ``too ambitious.'' 
Administration officials, previewing the president's plan, said all 
39 million Americans covered by Medicare could get prescription 
drug benefits without bankrupting the program and at ``very little 
cost'' to taxpayers. Lawmakers, though, urged limiting the new drug 
coverage to the working poor. Republican leaders generally have 
supported the idea of providing government-subsidized drug benefits 
only for those near the poverty level. The administration says many 
Medigap policies are a major financial burden for the elderly.

	BOSTON (AP) -- The American Hospital Association says 99 percent

year. Most hospitals insist they're not worried about Y2K, even 
though they're crammed with sensitive equipment that would seem 
vulnerable to the Year 2000 glitch. The industry says it has been 
working for years to make sure New Year's Day is just another day

	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- With hopes growing for renewed  
negotiations, Syria insisted today it could not make peace with 
Israel without the return of the entire Golan Heights. The election 
in May of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister has raised 
expectations that long stalled negotiations between Syria and 
Israel could resume. Syria long has demanded a complete Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel occupied in the 
1967 Middle East war and later annexed.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo have  
been unable to restore order or stem the flow of Serbs fleeing 
ethnic Albanians seeking revenge. Burning and looting continued 
unabated yesterday throughout the province. Ethnic Albanians set 
fire to two mansions owned by leaders of the Gypsy community. Many 
ethnic Albanians accuse the Gypsies of collaborating with the Serbs 
during the Yugoslav crackdown against them that ended with this

	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- One of Slobodan Milosevic's opponents  
says the Yugoslav president has been offered asylum in China if he 
is ousted. A German newspaper yesterday quoted former Belgrade 
Mayor Zoran Djindjic as saying that he expects Milosevic will cave 
into political pressure and will resign. Djindjic said he had 
``indications'' that Milosevic has an offer to flee China, but did 
not elaborate. Meanwhile, the U.S. has offered a $5 million reward 
for information leading to the arrest and delivery of Milosevic and 
others who have been indicted by the international war crimes.

of Germany's national policy. The documents will go on display 
beginning Tuesday at the Skirball Cultural Center, a Jewish 
cultural museum, Skirball president Uri Herscher said yesterday. 
The Nuremberg Laws, signed by Adolf Hitler on Sept. 15, 1935 ``for 
the safeguard of German blood of German honor,'' prohibited 
relations, marriage and cohabitation between ``Aryans'' and Jews. 
They also defined citizenship in the German Reich and mandated

<HEADLINE> Angles Put Luke on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim outfielder Matt Luke was placed  
on the 15-day disabled list Sunday with a partially-torn oblique 
muscle in his right side. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke, the 10th Angel currently on the DL, injured himself making  
a throw Friday night against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke, who missed the first two months of the season with a  
left-side injury, was batting .438 in eight games since his return. 
</P>
<P>
	To take his roster spot, the Angels recalled left-hander Mike  
Holtz from Triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels also said that starter Tim Belcher sustained a  
fracture of his right small finger when making a tag play at the 
plate in Saturday night's game against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher covered home at the end of a rundown of the A's Ryan  
Christenson, who barreled into him in an attempt to dislodge the 
ball. Belcher held onto the ball for the out, and returned to take 
his warmup pitches before the fifth inning, but walked off the 
field before making a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels will not make a decision on Belcher's status until he  
is examined Monday by hand specialist Dr. Norman Zemel.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Blasts Banks Over Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Despite introduction of the single  
currency euro by 11 European Union nations on Jan. 1, banks 
continue to charge fees of 3 percent and more for money exchange, 
raising the ire of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and consumer 
protection activists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper said Sunday that  
Schroeder was especially upset by the practice affecting travelers 
during the tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the vacationers feel that we have a real currency with the  
euro. Fees for money exchange at their current level are 
euro-unfriendly and no longer justified,'' the newspaper quoted 
Schroeder as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Most banks deduct 3 to 4 percent for exchanging money. Dresdner  
Bank for instance has a basic fee of 3 percent. In other words, if 
a German tourist to Italy exchanged 100 marks ($53.39) for lire, it 
would cost the same as if he had exchanged 200 marks ($106.82). 
</P>
<P>
	Manfred Westphal, financial expert for the Bonn-based Consumer  
Central Working Group told the newspaper the fees were far 
overpriced and ``endangered trust in the euro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's old-fashioned robbery,'' the report quoted Volker Pietsch  
of Berlin's Consumer Protection Office as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed one of the arguments for starting the single currency was  
that it would eliminate exchange rate fees, since all member 
nations would be dealing with the same currency. That has happened 
at top banking and business levels, where deals have been conducted 
in euros since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	However, euro currency in bills and coins won't be available for  
everyday consumers until 2002 -- and commercial banks have continued 
to charge money exchange fees -- even though the 11-nation 
currencies remain fixed against the euro, eliminating the past risk 
of fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange rate risk is eliminated for the banks. That's why  
many customers find it hard to understand why exchange rate fees 
have remained relatively unchanged,'' Edgar Meister, a director at 
the German Central Bank told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> EPA To OK New Fluorescent Bulb Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Citing health concerns over mercury pollution, the  
Environmental Protection Agency will approve a new rule that bars 
the dumping of fluorescent bulbs into landfills and encourages 
their recycling, an agency official has confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, expected early this week, is a victory for  
recyclers and environmentalists who decried a plan backed by light 
manufacturers to allow the bulbs to be thrown into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	It will end nearly a decade of debate within the EPA over how to  
treat an estimated 600 million bulbs thrown away each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the common sense way to go about environmental  
protection,'' said the official, who spoke Friday on condition of 
anonymity. ``You get the most protection and it's the most cost 
effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule is aimed at large firms and government agencies  
that buy fluorescent lamps in bulk and account for the vast 
majority of disposed bulbs. It could eventually spawn recycling 
programs for homeowners who toss lamps into the household garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the EPA classifies fluorescent bulbs as a hazardous  
waste and requires they be recycled or thrown in special hazardous 
waste landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	But enforcement has been spotty, according to Michael Bender, a  
consultant to the Association of Lighting and Mercury Recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that until EPA finalizes this rule the states  
have taken a wait-and-see attitude and are not enforcing the 
regulations,'' he said. ``There has been a lot of confusion out 
there, and this is going to clear up the confusion and make it 
easier for customers to understand the best things to do with 
lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule will apply to mercury-containing fluorescent,  
mercury vapor, sodium vapor and metal halide lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	A naturally occurring metal, mercury accumulates in fish and  
becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. In humans, 
the neurotoxin can slow fetal and child development and cause brain 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, more than a dozen states -- including Massachusetts --  
require that fluorescent light bulbs be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules would continue to classify the bulbs as a  
hazardous waste but would also loosen tough standards for record 
keeping, storage and transportation of bulbs destined for 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from two major light bulb manufacturers -- General  
Electric Lighting and OSRAM Sylvania Lighting -- have maintained 
that the hazardous waste label is an overreaction to what is 
essentially a minuscule environmental threat from mercury-bearing 
lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bleasby, director of industry relations and standards at  
OSRAM Sylvania, said that recycling fluorescent bulbs is 
cost-prohibitive, given the abundance of recycled mercury from 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In drawing up the new rule, the EPA considered draft studies  
conducted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Florida EPA 
concluding that broken fluorescent bulbs at landfills are strong 
sources of mercury pollution that can linger for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Bleasby said the studies are flawed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any draft study they have, I can provide you two more that say  
the exact opposite,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Scream' Evidence Barred From Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The boys were obsessed with the horror movie,  
``Scream.'' They talked about it many times to each other and with 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them said that the slayings depicted were ``cool,'' and,  
on the way home from one of many viewings, he told a pal: ``It was 
a perfect way to kill somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the boys, Mario Padilla and Samuel Ramirez, began talking  
about real killings that would replicate those in the 1996 Wes 
Craven film in which teen-agers are slaughtered by killers obsessed 
with horror movies. A Grim Reaper costume and a voice changer are 
used to terrorize victims. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses at a preliminary hearing in December,  
1998, the 16-year-old Mario and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel, 
spoke of ``doing a Scream'' or ``busting a Scream,'' terms 
indicating that they would duplicate the movie's mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned to buy costumes and a voice distorter box like the  
one in the film. Mario talked about going on ``a killing spree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 13, 1998, the two boys burst into Mario's home where the  
youth grabbed his mother from behind as she sat at her personal 
computer. With Samuel holding her down, Mario used at least four 
different knives and a screwdriver to stab his mother, Gina 
Castillo, 45 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old woman died after calling 911 and gasping out the  
words, ``My son, he's 16, he just stabbed me. I'm bleeding. Oh, I'm 
bleeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, there were no costumes and no voice distorter.  
And at the trial now under way in Compton Superior Court, a judge 
has forbidden any mention of the movies, ``Scream'' or ``Scream 
2,'' the sequel which opened in 1997 and became an instant box 
office hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimizing the volatile issue of youngsters and movie violence,  
Judge John J. Cheroske sealed all evidence, barred cameras from his 
courtroom and issued a gag order blocking participants from talking 
to the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court orders that any and all 'Scream' evidence is  
excluded from this trial,'' Cheroske said in a written ruling. 
``The court orders that this case is not to be referred to as the 
'Scream' murder case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheroske gave no public reason for his ruling, but it's unlikely  
to affect the outcome. The defendants, who are being tried as 
adults, have given authorities tape recorded confessions. Mario 
admits stabbing his mother. Samuel admits holding her down. Their 
lawyers do not deny the pair's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario Padilla killed his mother,'' attorney Paul Golub told  
jurors. ``It was a brutal and horrible crime. I'm not going to sit 
here and say anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motive provided to jurors is vague. Deputy District Attorney  
Carol Rose said in opening statements that Mario was upset about 
being assigned chores by his mother and that he wanted to steal 
$150 which was stored in a small bank beside the crib of Mrs. 
Castillo's newborn daughter. It was known as ``the baby's money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press obtained the 1998 preliminary hearing  
transcript before it was sealed by Cheroske, and it shows that the 
prosecution once planned to make the trial a showcase for the 
effects of movie violence on teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a movie called 'Scream' that came out in the  
theater, and the evidence will show that Mario saw the movie many, 
many times and became somewhat obsessed with the movie and involved 
(his cousins) in a plot to reenact the murders in the movie,'' Rose 
had said in her opening statement at the hearing last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 'Scream' came out and the boys had seen it many times,  
'Scream 2,' a sequel, came out and there will be evidence that that 
was seen a couple of times before the first murder was actually 
perpetrated,'' the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to her, they planned to kill Mario's mother and  
stepfather and then move on to kill two girls who had been the 
subjects of threatening calls and letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario pleaded no-contest last week to charges of making  
terrorist threats against one of the girls in calls allegedly using 
a voice distorter. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most chilling pieces of testimony at both the  
preliminary hearing and this week's trial was the account given by 
Aaron Hernandez, a friend who said he encountered Mario and Samuel 
at a local arcade shortly before Mrs. Castillo's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Mario) said they were going to go over and kill his mom  
because it was a perfect day to do it,'' Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Was there further conversation?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was being asked to participate,'' Hernandez said calmly. ``I  
said no.''

<HEADLINE> Real Quiet Wins Gold Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Real Quiet, the 4-year-old colt that  
just missed winning the Triple Crown last year, found running room 
on the rail and edged ahead in the final strides Sunday to win the 
$1 million Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden for the first time by Jerry Bailey, the Bob  
Baffert-trained Real Quiet finished a half-length in front of 
Budroyale, who edged Malek by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero was fourth and last in the smallest Gold Cup field  
in the race's 60-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the thin field, Real Quiet was boxed in early in the  
stretch before Bailey took the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness 
champion to the inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet caught Budroyale and Malek beyond mid stretch and  
just barely overtook them. 
</P>
<P>
	All four carried 124 pounds, and Real Quiet was clocked in 1:59  
3-5 for 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sent off at 4-5, Real Quiet paid $3.80 and $2.40. Budroyale,  
ridden by Garrett Gomez, paid $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no show wagering because of the small field.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hobos Resent Serial-Killer Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- They were transients riding the rails across  
America -- hobos who gave each other colorful names like Frypan Jack 
and Slow Motion Shorty. 
</P>
<P>
	Buzz Potter remembers the days when these boxcar-riding nomads  
were welcome to knock on his mother's door looking for jobs or 
handouts. Those days, he said, are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Potter, president of a loosely knit group called the  
National Hobo Association, is worried about Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez, a rail rider who is suspected of being a serial 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calling him the 'hobo killer,''' Potter says with  
disgust. ``It's giving us a bad name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bad name or not, Potter acknowledges that times have changed for  
hobos, that today ``anybody who'd see two grimy guys at the back 
door would bolt the door and call 911.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No firm numbers on hobos are available. Union Pacific agents  
detained about 97,000 people for trespassing last year, releasing 
most with a warning, says spokesman Ed Trandahl. Officials at other 
major railways say they have similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But the category of trespassers includes rail riders as well as  
people who illegally walk across company property, and the railways 
wouldn't give breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Resendez-Ramirez has traveled the country  
extensively on freight trains. He has become the object of a 
nationwide manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been charged with the two slayings in Illinois and is  
suspected of a 1997 Kentucky killing and five since last fall in 
Texas. The crimes occurred in homes near railroad tracks, and 
fingerprints have linked Resendez-Ramirez to at least some of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said that although rail riding is often associated with  
the Depression, jumping on trains without a ticket has never really 
gone away. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad officials still detain people for trespassing, and  
there's still an annual Hobo Convention at Britt, Iowa, where 
old-timers, modern-day rail riders and fans can swap tales. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, however, not many people who jump a freight fit the  
image of homeless, rootless hobos living on handouts and camping in 
hobo ``jungles'' alongside tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway workers are concerned that there seems a growing  
interest in the hobo life, partly among adventure-seekers armed 
with credit cards and train schedules out for a two-week trip. 
Others include undocumented immigrants who are traveling to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter, one of those who admits he occasionally hops freights,  
says the public has the wrong impression of rail riders. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be more careful out there. There's no doubt about  
that. But I know more guys who have Ph.D.s who ride freight 
trains,'' says Potter, who lives in Nisswa, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm head of 3,400 guys who wouldn't hurt a flea,'' he says. In  
addition to true hobos, the late author James Michener was a 
member. The association even has a Web page. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, railways reported 522 trespassing-related deaths,  
according to the Federal Railroad Administration. That number also 
includes suicides and pedestrians hit by trains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly a problem -- and it's totally unsafe,'' says  
Richard Russack, a spokesman for Burlington Northern &AMP; Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	Loners by nature and well aware of the illegal nature of what  
they do -- even it's mostly a misdemeanor violation -- most rail 
riders are reluctant to talk publicly about what they do. 
</P>
<P>
	One who will talk is Duffy Littlejohn, author of ``Hopping  
Freight Trains in America.'' He estimates that he's ridden nearly 
500,000 miles on freight trains since 1970, but he's also a lawyer 
living in San Luis Obispo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Why does he do it? ``There's danger. There's thrill. There's  
risk because it's illegal,'' says Littlejohn. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a rich, rich American tradition, riding the rails,''  
Littlejohn says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We celebrate the tradition. We have a campfire and drink the  
wine. And most of us ride the trains once in a while to keep our 
hand in it,'' Potter says. ``But it'll never be the same.''

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Celebrates NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have their NBA title  
and trophy, and now they've been treated to a Fiesta-style parade 
and party. 
</P>
<P>
	Players, their families and team officials rode decorated barges  
along the San Antonio River on Sunday as thousands of fans cheered 
the team's championship victory over the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is spectacular,'' guard Steve Kerr told the crowd as the  
parade began. ``Thank you so much for helping us celebrate. This is 
phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 230,000 people, some packed 10 deep, lined the  
downtown River Walk to view it. 
</P>
<P>
	After the river ride, the players received a tumultuous  
reception at a rally in the Alamodome. Organizers distributed 
40,000 free tickets for the 40-minute event. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's first championship made an even bigger fan out of  
Marco Cancho. 
</P>
<P>
	``Them winning and the atmosphere today, it made me get season  
tickets,'' for next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fete was reminiscent of the Fiesta celebration that takes  
place in San Antonio each April and features river and street 
parades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no doubt they would win it. They're awesome. I just want  
to scream, I'm so happy,'' said Betty Morin, one of the fans along 
the river as the motorized barges inched along the concrete-lined 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	Although admission to the event was free, some restaurants along  
the banks charged up to $50 for river-view seats. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first title for the Spurs, a former American  
Basketball Association team that came to this city from Dallas in 
1973 and joined the NBA three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first barges in the river parade carried former Spurs  
players dating to the 1970s, including George ``Iceman'' Gervin, 
James Silas and Johnny Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Other barges carried mariachi musicians, Mexican folk dancers  
and the Spurs mascot, the Coyote. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs along the route included: ``Twin Tower Power,'' a  
reference to 7-footers David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Point guard 
Avery Johnson and Robinson were aboard one of the last barges 
carrying the Larry O'Brien championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding the trophy over his head, Robinson was singing and  
dancing to the James Brown song ``I Feel Good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using a loudspeaker, Robinson told the crowd, ``It feels good,  
everything came together this year perfectly. All over the world, 
they've got San Antonio on their lips, baby, so enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, on another float, was greeted by fans chanting, ``M-V-P!  
M-V-P!'' He acknowledged the praise by smiling and waving. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Noyola summed up the celebration as: ``Awesome!''  
</P>
<P>
	``The heat was intense but the atmosphere was so alive,'' Noyola  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio defeated the Knicks 78-77 Friday night at Madison  
Square Garden in New York to win the best-of-7 NBA Finals in five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans watching the game in sports bars and at private parties and  
homes throughout the city erupted into celebration after the 
victory. Thousands jammed downtown streets on foot and in cars, 
waving Spurs banners, honking horns and shouting cheers for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	That celebration lasted until about 3 a.m. Police reported no  
major problems despite the size of the crowd.

<HEADLINE> Brazil 3, Germany 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- On the last play of the game, Brazil tied  
the score. Almost as important, the Brazilians won't have to play 
the United States in the next game. 
</P>
<P>
	Maicon drove home a 12-footer after a free kick in the fourth  
minute of second-half injury time, lifting the Brazilians to a 3-3 
tie with Germany Sunday and first place in Group B in the Women's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The tie means Brazil will play the second-place team from Group  
A in the quarterfinals, while Group B runner-up Germany will likely 
face the tournament favorite U.S. team on Thursday at Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The result also eliminated Italy from contention for a  
quarterfinals berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans, though exhausted in the heat and humidity, appeared  
headed for victory until Brazil made a final push in injury time 
that gave Sissi, who earlier scored her tournament-high sixth goal, 
a chance for a free kick to the right of the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi's kick was headed twice in the box, once by a teammate and  
once by a German defender, before it fell to the left foot of 
second-half substitute Maicon, who drove the shot past goalkeeper 
Silke Rottenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 2-1 at halftime, Bettina Wiegmann and Steffi Jones scored  
early in the second half to give the Germans the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann celebrated her 100th international appearance with a  
penalty shot to the left of goalkeeper Maravilha in the 47th 
minute. The penalty was awarded when Prinz was yanked down by the 
left arm by defender Suzana. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones then drilled an 18-yard shot off the foot of defender  
Elane in the 58th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a match that pitted Brazilian flair vs. German precision,  
Germany scored first when Maren Meinert made a nice 40-yard run 
down the middle of the field and passed left in the penalty box to 
Birgit Prinz, who netted in the eighth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil tied the game in the 15th on Katia da Silva's 17-yard  
strike into the upper left-hand corner of the net, then took the 
lead on Sissi's 28-yard free kick around the left side of the wall 
in the 20th.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Lifts Ban on Owning Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq has lifted a ban on owning and  
exchanging hard currency, a move intended to halt the deterioration 
of its national currency, Al-Jumhuriya daily reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolutionary Command Council's decree, announced Saturday,  
allows Iraqis and foreigners to use hard currency only for dealings 
within the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree, which takes effect immediately, also allows  
nonresidents with foreign-currency accounts to take all their money 
and interest out of the country when they close their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was previously against the law for both Iraqis and foreigners  
to own and trade foreign money except when dealing through the 
Central Bank of Iraq. The ban was imposed to protect the country's 
hard currency reserve, which has dwindled due to sanctions imposed 
on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was initially against revoking the ban, but  
announced its acceptance in early June after the Iraqi currency 
dropped to 2,250 dinars to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the government allowed its two banks, Al-Rafidain  
and Al-Rashid, to sell the dollar at 2,000 dinars, and the price 
has remained constant for the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank's official rate still stands at the pre-Gulf  
War level of $3.20 to the dinar, and hard currency revenues 
collected by government offices must be turned to the Central Bank 
for depositing at the official rate, which has remained constant 
for 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Groundskeeper Watches Grass Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Eddie Seaward twists his face into a  
grimace when a racket is stabbed into Wimbledon's soft turf. And 
certain players make the Englishman cringe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some are more heavy-footed than others,'' he said. ``You've  
got people who drag their toes when they're serving, dragging 
little bits of turf from behind the baseline onto the court so it 
looks untidy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He begs off the next question.  
</P>
<P>
	``No names, sorry, no names,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But what really irks the man who tends to the most famous grass  
in tennis is the English weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is still the rain,'' said Seaward, in his  
10th year as the head groundskeeper at the All England Lawn Tennis 
and Croquet Club. ``It's that wonderful thing we have a lot of in 
England. Rain is the big bugbear all the way through the 
tournament. And the last few have been pretty bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, at this Wimbledon, rain has been nowhere in sight.  
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon is a complex of 34 tennis lawns -- 20 for competition  
and 14 for practice. That's 7 1/2 acres to cut, seed, roll and keep 
puddle-free for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your family,'' said Seaward, who works out of a series of  
sheds, a storehouse for machinery and ``Please Keep Off The Grass'' 
signs nuzzled alongside Court 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, it's high tech vs. the unpredictable English summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Lasers level the courts and a machine thumps away testing wear.  
The soil is scientifically uniform, seed research is ongoing and 
the grass is mowed daily to a one-third of an inch crewcut. And 
there's an experiment with ultraviolet light to beat stadium shade 
and England's long, dark winters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon is theater and Seaward is the stage manager, working  
alongside the director -- referee Alan Mills. The 56-year-old 
groundskeeper sports a blazer, gray flannel trousers and a club tie 
but is more at home in rain gear. 
</P>
<P>
	He's tense on opening day and exhausted by the finish.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always glad when the first day is over,'' said Seaward,  
who directs a staff of 150 during the tournament. ``At the end you 
feel dead. You're absolutely shattered. ... But while there's a lot 
of stress, there's also a lot of buzz about the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario has won four Grand Slam events but never  
on grass at Wimbledon. She offered a famous quote a decade ago 
that's been fodder ever since for losing players departing the 
slick, quick lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grass is for cows,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Players a few years ago criticized Centre Court, which was  
saturated by rain and constantly covered. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't like to hear it, but you just get on with the job.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stiff upper lip?  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you could say that,'' Seaward said.  
</P>
<P>
	Translucent rain covers were introduced a year ago, allowing the  
grass to be covered for three days with 97 percent of light still 
seeping through. Huge fans were bolted to Centre Court and Court 1 
to boost air circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather may be English, but much of the grass comes from  
Dutch seed. Iron is added a few days before play for a brighter hue 
of green. 
</P>
<P>
	The club budgets about $8,000 a year on seed. Seaward estimates  
he spends about $6,500 annually to maintain each court plus labor 
and machinery costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Special lawn mowers cost about $6,500, and Wimbledon has 15. A  
ton roller costs the same, and Wimbledon has six. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing we can do about grass thinning, but it wears  
evenly and players get used to the change,'' Seaward said. ``We 
manicure the court, but there's nothing artificial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll ever find a grass that doesn't eventually  
wear,'' he added. ``But we're always reaching as close as we can to 
perfection.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Little Value in Kids TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One in five television shows aimed at young  
people has little or no educational value, a research group 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of  
Pennsylvania, which has tracked the quality of children's 
television since 1996, says there are more shows available for 
children -- 12 percent more in the 1998-99 season than in the 
previous season -- but their educational value is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still substantial confusion about what constitutes  
educational programming,'' said Annenberg research fellow Kelly L. 
Schmitt, author of one of four studies being released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shows such as ``Duck Tales'' and ``Hercules'' were offered by  
stations to satisfy the educational needs of children, even though 
syndicators and networks claimed they were not designed for that 
purpose,'' Schmitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies evaluated the quality and quantity of children's  
television in 1998, as well as parents' and children's opinions and 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the increase in the number of children's  
programs is due mostly to a Federal Communication Commission rule 
that helps broadcasters speed their license renewal by airing a 
minimum of three hours a week of educational and informational 
television for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The report finds 21.2 percent of these programs offered little  
or no educational value. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows such as ``NBA Inside Stuff'' and ``Peer Pressure''  
continue to receive the educational and informational label even 
though they contain minimal educational content, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was some improvement: Researchers judged 26 percent of  
the 1998 shows to be ``low quality,'' compared with 36 percent in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of the shows classified educational under FCC  
guidelines were ``highly educational,'' 45.5 percent were judged 
``moderately educational,'' and 21.2 percent were ``minimally 
educational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--28 percent of children's shows contained four or more acts of  
violence, and 75 percent of these high-violence programs did not 
carry the FV, or fantasy violence, content rating for children's 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--45 percent of children's programs contained one or more  
instances of problematic language and 12 percent of programs had 
one or more instances of sexual innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	--6 percent of programs for children are available in prime time,  
when children are most likely to be in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	--27 percent of local educational productions reported to the FCC  
in 1997 and 1998 no longer are on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	--84.1 percent of parents ``strongly'' or ``somewhat'' favor the  
V-chip technology, which allows them to block certain shows from 
television sets. Also, 51.4 percent of parents say they would use 
the V-chip ``often'' if they had one. 
</P>
<P>
	--13,6 percent of parents and 24.5 percent of children had a  
``positive'' opinion of what is on television for children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Parents report their children spend, on average, 3.25 hours per  
day watching television or videos and 48.2 percent of the children 
have television sets in their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only 35.4 percent of parents are aware of the FCC labeling of  
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The national survey covered 1,269 parents of 2- to 17-year olds  
and 303 of their children, ages 10 to 17. The margin of error was 
plus or minus 2.9 percent for the parent's survey and 5.7 percent 
for the children's survey.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Rally Turns Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- Indian activists say they regret that a  
march to protest two unsolved killings turned violent when a group 
of demonstrators began looting and setting fire to an area store. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-hour American Indian Movement rally by about 350  
demonstrators began peacefully Saturday on the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation, but it got out of hand when the procession reached 
Whiteclay, Neb., after a call by one of the leaders, Dennis Banks, 
to reclaim the area as part of the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This rally was to carry the message that injustice has to  
stop,'' said Regina Brave of Albuquerque, N.M. She said the rioting 
by the small group ``doesn't represent the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidica Young Man, of Oglala, said, ``destroying property is  
not our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the disturbance, Banks told the crowd: ``We're going to  
take that `Welcome to Nebraska' sign and move it two or three miles 
south.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen young men knocked the sign over and carried it  
about a quarter mile to the south end of Whiteclay and dropped it 
in the middle of the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a group stormed VJ's Market, throwing merchandise onto the  
street, and setting two fires. The fires were quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone also threw rocks at law officers when they arrived. At  
least two news photographers were roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the issues at stake are alcohol sales in Whiteclay.  
Stores in the tiny town, population 22, sell $3 million of beer a 
year. Some have asked the state of Nebraska to pull those liquor 
licenses because the town is so close to the reservation, where 
alcohol sales are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	People on the reservation have also said they have been poorly  
treated by business owners and law enforcement in Whiteclay for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Banks said he didn't intend to set off violence.  
</P>
<P>
	``It (the statement about the sign) wasn't meant to incite  
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks led the march along with AIM leaders Russell Means and

<TEXT>
<P>
	GATESHEAD, England (AP) -- Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie wasn't  
thrilled with his performance. Yet he won easily at the British 
Grand Prix on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing in wet conditions, the 26-year-old Olympic 10,000 meters  
champion sprinted the first lap in 54 seconds to grab a lead and 
then burst home to win the Emsley Carr Mile in 3 minutes, 52.39 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected more than this ... but I could not run faster,''  
Gebreselassie said. ``The first lap was okay, the second and third 
were a little bit slow. I'll try to run faster in Oslo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's John Maycock was second in 3:55.70, and Russia's  
Andrey Zadorozhnyi finished third in 3:56.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebreselassie, who set world records in both the 5,000 and  
10,000 meters in June last year, said he was using his first 
appearance at Gateshead as a warm-up for another assault on the 
5,000 meters record. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of distance running, with 15 current or previous world  
records, will try for another record in Oslo on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	British hurdler Colin Jackson, who recorded the world's fastest  
time in the 110 meters hurdles this year on Saturday, completed a 
double by winning the sprint hurdles on Sunday in 13.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 meters, world champion Cathy Freeman returned  
from an injury layoff to run a season-best 50.66 and edge Nigerian 
Falilat Ogunkoya, ranked world No. 1 in 1998, who ran 50.73. 
</P>
<P>
	After trailing early, Freeman came back and held off Ogunkoya  
over the final 30 meters. Jamaican Tracy Barnes finished third in 
51.51.

	Freeman said the race was difficult but essential for her  
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Iowa UAW Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa United Auto Workers Union  
endorsed Vice President Gore on Sunday, the second show of support 
from organized labor in recent days for the Democrat's White House 
bid in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsements give Gore the organizational muscle of the  
biggest players in the state's labor movement, an important asset 
for Iowa's leadoff caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the largest union representing Iowa state workers --  
Council 61 of the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees -- came out in support of Gore's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsements indicate organized labor is beginning to fall  
in line with Gore despite occasional differences with the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get everyone going in the same direction,'' said  
Rod Blouwer, a vice president of the Iowa UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	The union represents 35,000 to 40,000 active and retired members  
in the state and is politically very active. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very significant development,'' said Gore spokesman  
Chris Lehane. ``They have a history of producing at the polls for 
candidates they back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFSCME bargains for 23,000 state workers, has 12,000 active  
members and is perhaps the biggest single force in Iowa Democratic 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of the unions to organize voters is essential for  
the precinct caucuses in February because candidates must turn out 
supporters for a full evening at a neighborhood meeting rather than 
just delivering voters to the polls for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore faces opposition only from former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley, and is ahead in most early polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the disagreement labor has had with the administration  
has been over trade deals unions argue encourage shipping U.S. jobs 
overseas; the administration defends the agreements as boosting 
free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	At an Iowa UAW meeting this spring, Gore faced tough  
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some discussion about trade,'' he said, noting that  
Gore had referred to the issue in his speech formally announcing 
his candidacy. Gore had said he wanted to assure there were labor 
protections included in new trade deals, Blouwer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that's been a lifelong agenda item for us,''  
he said. ``We're not against Bill Bradley, we're for Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, a Des Moines Register Iowa Poll found GOP Gov.  
George W. Bush of Texas is favored by 40 percent of likely 
Republican caucus voters. Elizabeth Dole, a former president of the 
American Red Cross, drew 13 percent support while publisher Steve 
Forbes had the backing of 10 percent of respondents. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen percent of likely caucus voters said they were  
uncommitted or not yet sure which Republican would be their first 
choice for the GOP nomination if the caucuses were held now. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other candidates each received 5 percent or less in the  
poll 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted June 13-24, surveyed 397 registered Iowa  
voters who say they definitely or probably will attend the 
Republican caucuses. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Man Denies Killing Yosemite Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRACY, Calif. (AP) -- A man being questioned by investigators in  
the slayings of three Yosemite sightseers said in a jailhouse 
interview Sunday that he didn't kill any of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't kill anybody,'' Eugene ``Rufus'' Dykes told The  
Associated Press from a glass booth at Deuel Vocational 
Institution. ``If I was involved, it wasn't through my knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes, who is serving a year for an unrelated parole violation,  
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also refused to discuss any information he has provided to  
the FBI task force trying to unravel the slayings of Carole Sund, 
her daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent and case spokesman Nick Rossi said Sunday he would not  
discuss statements made by any individuals interviewed or 
questioned by the task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, whose Eureka family has made millions in real estate,  
was taking her 15-year-old daughter and 16-year-old Argentine 
friend on a trip through the Sierra foothills to Yosemite National 
Park when they were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were last seen alive Feb. 15 at a lodge on the western  
fringe of the park. The bodies of Mrs. Sund, 42, and Ms. Pelosso 
were found about a month later and far to the north, burnt beyond 
recognition in the trunk of their torched rental car. Juli Sund's 
body was found a week later and miles away, hidden in a thicket off 
a lightly traveled mountain highway. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the case but investigators have said  
they are confident that most of those responsible for the crime are 
already behind bars on unrelated charges. They will not identify 
suspects or say how many there are. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement sources have said that Dykes, his half brother,  
Michael ``Mick'' Larwick, and other members of a looseknit band of 
methamphetamine-using ex-cons are the focus of the FBI task force 
and federal grand jury proceedings in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes and Larwick were arrested a week apart in March after  
standoffs with Modesto police. Dykes was later charged with being a 
convicted felon in possession of drugs and a gun. Larwick has 
pleaded innocent to shooting and injuring a cop during his standoff 
and is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Larwick, 42, has declared his innocence in the Yosemite case.  
</P>
<P>
	Dykes, 32, who has a record of meth possession, unlawful sex and  
weapons convictions, is currently being held in solitary 
confinement at DVI.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- While most drivers were relaxing before  
Sunday's Save Mart 350 Winston Cup event, Jeff Burton was in the 
restricted seating area at Sears Point Raceway, shaking hands and 
signing autographs among the youngsters in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids can't just go to autograph sessions. We try to make  
things a little easier for them,'' he said. ``It makes you feel 
like you're doing something a little good for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The devotion to kids, and especially ones with disabilities,  
runs in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, a 10-year-old boy with cerebral palsy got a call  
from Jeff Burton's brother Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngster, a fan of heavy construction equipment, was being  
shown the biggest vehicles at the Caterpillar factory in Peoria, 
Ill., through the Make-a-Wish Foundation when he excitedly spotted 
Ward Burton's Caterpillar-sponsored Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar set up the phone call.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our parents taught us compassion,'' Jeff Burton said. ``I know  
my mother would have done anything in the world. She's kind of 
passed that on to us and it's our responsibility to keep that 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	THE BOSS GOES TO WORK:@ Rusty Wallace's crew chief Robin  
Pemberton, who gave up over-the-wall duties last year following 
surgery on both knees, was pressed back into action Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuffle began when rear tire changer Mark Armstrong flew  
back to Gastonia, N.C., for the birth of his first child. 
</P>
<P>
	Front tire carrier Ben Leslie took over his spot and Pemberton  
moved to the front. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a boy for Mark and Lorie Armstrong.

	ON THE MEND:@ Stock car legend Richard Petty had to watch his  
son Kyle's race on Sunday from a hospital bed in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed out at his home on Wednesday after losing nearly 40  
percent of his blood when a bleeding ulcer ruptured. The bleeding 
was stopped on Thursday, but doctors want to conduct some 
additional tests, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Petty, 61, the most successful Winston Cub driver with  
200 victories and seven championships, retired from competition in 
1992 to manage the family's Petty Enterprises.

</P>
<P>
	UNHAPPY CAMPER:@ Derrike Cope, mired in 42nd place in this  
year's Winston Cup standings, is understandably upset about the way 
things aren't going with his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were behind at the start of the year and we haven't caught  
up, and the other guys aren't waiting for us, obviously,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're behind power-wise, we're behind areodynamically.  
Overall, we're just not a high-grade race team at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cope's Chuck Rider-owned Pontiac failed to make the cut in six  
of the first 16 races of the season and took the last 
non-provisional spot on the grid this weekend by a scant 0.157 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just behind all the time and management's gonna have to  
do some things,'' he said. ``We have no points, we have no 
provisionals so we're behind the eight-ball the whole time. We've 
got to get more proficient, get ourselves up in the Top 25, the Top 
28. Then we can start to progress.''

<P>
	TOUGH WEEKEND:@ Winston West Series driver Butch Gilliland was  
hoping for a double at Sears Point. It lasted just a dozen laps. 
</P>
<P>
	His Chevrolet broke down eight laps into Saturday's  
Featherweight Southwest Series when the transmission went out. 
</P>
<P>
	His Winston Cup Ford lasted half as long on Sunday before its  
engine let go with a puff of smoke on the fourth lap.

<HEADLINE> Quakes May Endanger Calif. Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At least 1,000 public school buildings in  
quake-prone areas of California may have structural deficiencies, 
and thousands more have failed to undergo seismic inspection since 
being built decades ago, according to a report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 20 years, officials have launched programs to  
upgrade the safety of hospitals, universities and state buildings. 
Yet efforts to do the same for the 60,000 public school buildings 
across California have failed, primarily because of a lack of 
money, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking care of grown students but we are neglecting  
children who can't help themselves in an earthquake,'' said Vilas 
Mujumdar, operations chief for the Division of the State Architect. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly passed a bill this month seeking $500,000 for  
a statewide report to identify ``the most vulnerable school 
buildings.'' The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation in 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seismic Safety Commission, a panel of 17 state-appointed  
experts, has for years pushed for an examination of older public 
schools. The study would cost between $3 million and $5 million, 
and repairs could run $2 billion to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some local school districts question the need for the study,  
saying their buildings are strong enough to survive future quakes 
and the repair costs would be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at the University of California, Berkeley Graduate  
School of Journalism conducted a survey of the state's public 
school buildings for the Times. Questionnaires were mailed to all 
201 school districts and 98 responded, representing nearly a third 
of California's 5.8 million public school students. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings, which cover more than 15,000 buildings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Just one in four districts have voluntarily inspected all or  
nearly all of their buildings for earthquake resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Half of the districts have not examined their pre-1976  
buildings, which seismic experts say could be most vulnerable in an 
earthquake. This includes 11,000 structures in Southern California 
and San Francisco Bay area districts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dry rot, damaged roofs and other maintenance problems are  
present in more than 3,000 school buildings, which state officials 
contend could make the structures more vulnerable to serious quake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ninety percent of the responding districts have tried to  
reduce nonstructural hazards such as falling light fixtures, but 
half have not completed the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, most local school district officials believe their  
buildings can do well in the next big earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weathered the 1987 Whittier earthquake, which was a 6.0,''  
said Chit Bao, maintenance director of ABC Unified School District, 
based in Cerritos. ``The buildings withstood it without damage. ... 
Anything past that is God's will.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Union To Begin Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Some of the very issues that resulted in a  
walkout four years ago will resurface when the Machinists Union and 
Boeing Co. begin to negotiate a new labor contract this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The big ones are job security, health insurance benefits and  
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some union members are talking about the possibility of  
a strike, both sides say they are optimistic this round will be 
smoother than the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 strike, which lasted 69 days, disrupted production and  
angered airline customers who had to wait on late deliveries of 
airplanes. Members also went on strike in 1989 for 48 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some say it is too early to speculate how these talks  
will end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody really wants to go on strike,'' said Russell Booth, a  
42-year-old sheet metal worker. ``But if that is necessary to keep 
what we have now, that's just what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talks will formally open in Wichita on Tuesday, when the union  
will present its proposal. The two sides will meet periodically 
before around-the-clock negotiations begin in Seattle on Aug. 15. 
The current agreement expires Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has 49,300 members, including 11,500 in Wichita.  
</P>
<P>
	More than half of union members -- 58 percent -- said their jobs  
were not secure at all, according to a union survey released last 
week. And 37 percent felt their jobs were only ``somewhat secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union members see subcontracting and outsourcing of work as the  
main threat to their jobs, the union survey showed. About half of 
all work is performed by outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Boeing is cutting thousands of positions company-wide  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials also want to discuss the possibility of  
nontraditional work weeks in a bid to slow the growth of labor 
costs. The change would mean work crews would be on the premises 
seven days a week, 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Many machinists don't like the idea, saying that it would cut  
overtime and that working weekends would hurt family time and make 
child care arrangements difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also seeks to negotiate improvements in early  
retirements and provide cost of living adjustments to future 
retirees, while preserving its existing benefits package, under 
which the company pays the entire health insurance premium for 
workers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company is concerned about rising health  
care costs. It formed a team with the union four years ago to hold 
medical costs down.

<HEADLINE> More Bald Eagles Nest in New England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- There's a bald eagle housing boom  
along the middle stretch of the Connecticut River, with six active 
nests reported this spring from northern Connecticut to southern 
New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The eagles, which had disappeared from southern New England by  
the turn of the century, are not only making a comeback in rural 
areas, they are edging into the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've managed to settle just about every bit of protected  
greenspace along the river in Massachusetts,'' Tom French, who 
heads the state's endangered species program, said recently. ``The 
problem is there is just not that much cover left along the 
river.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In West Springfield, a pair of bald eagles are happily raising  
three chicks in a three-year-old nest behind an auto transmission 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The eaglets are the second generation to be hatched along the  
river since a state reintroduction effort produced its first chick 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighboring states are also benefitting. Eagles now nesting on  
the river just over the Connecticut and New Hampshire borders were 
chicks hatched in Massachusetts, French said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagles usually add to the same nest year after year, but  
sometimes they seem to like a change. A pair in Hadley, for 
example, also have a nest on the Northampton side of the river that 
they used last year. And one pair at the Quabbin Reservoir has six 
nests. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has counted 11 active eagle nests, up from nine last  
year, including five pairs at Quabbin Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	While bald eagles are flourishing along the Connecticut River, a  
popular pair of peregrine falcons that tried a downtown Springfield 
bridge apparently didn't fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists have been unable to locate the nest or chicks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This site is very marginal. It's really not safe for the  
birds,'' said French, after using ropes to climb underneath the 
Memorial Bridge and check the girders. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be easy for a chick to tumble from the nest and drown,  
he said. ``And I fear that's what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time in 11 years that a pair of peregrine falcons  
have failed to raise chicks in downtown Springfield. For eight of 
those years, they nested on a 22nd-floor ledge of an office 
building where their activities were televised by the local cable 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists suspect it was an April 1997 blizzard that prompted  
the birds to seek the uncertain shelter offered by the low bridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland catcher Mike Macfarlane, who  
sprained both of his thumbs on one play Saturday night, went on the 
15-day disabled list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Macfarlane sustained the injuries when he was bowled over by the  
Anaheim Angels' Steve Decker in a tag-play at the plate in the 
sixth inning of the A's 5-4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Macfarlane held onto the ball for the inning-ending out, but had  
to leave the game with one out in the seventh. X-rays taken after 
the game confirmed the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Macfarlane's spot on the roster will be taken by catcher Ramon  
Hernandez, recalled from Triple-A Vancouver. Hernandez has never 
appeared in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Accused in Skater's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A county prosecutor is accused of driving  
into a Roller-blading couple, killing the husband, and continuing 
to drive a half-mile with the body on his car before running away 
to steal another car. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Harnisch, 39, was charged with first-degree assault. His  
family had earlier called police when Harnisch left home, saying 
the Orange County prosecutor is manic depressive and had not been 
taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin J. Quirk, 40, died Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Quirk, who was slightly ahead of her husband, received a  
glancing blow and minor injuries, police said. The two were skating 
Saturday afternoon on a trail that is prohibited to cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped Harnisch after he fled the scene on foot, then  
allegedly stole a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arraigned before Quirk died and charged with first-degree  
assault. Harnisch was being held without bail on the recommendation 
of his boss, District Attorney Frank Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch was hired as an assistant district attorney in 1997,  
and before that worked 10 years as a prosecutor in the Manhattan 
District Attorney's Office.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Library Gets $1 Million Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEBANON, N.H. (AP) -- The staff at the tiny West Lebanon Public  
Library is reeling from a gift of more than $1 million from the 
estate of a couple who lived in town for some six decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty stunning,'' said Susanne Robb, the library's  
director. ``We all just walked around in a daze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James and Willena Kilton both died last summer, about two months  
apart. James Kilton ran his family's pharmacy near the library for 
nearly 40 years and often chatted with library patrons who came to 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb said the gift, which was announced by the library  
Wednesday, has been put in an interest-bearing account while 
officials decide what to do with it. The Kiltons mandated that the 
money be used only for capital improvements.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pitcher Layana Dies in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Former major league reliever Tim  
Layana, a member of the 1990 Cincinnati Reds World Series 
champions, died in a car crash. He was 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana, who also pitched for the San Francisco Giants, died  
after he was ejected from his Chevy Blazer that was broadsided by 
another car, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana and three passengers were traveling at around 4:15 p.m.  
when they tried to make a left turn. A 1982 Mercedes was passing 
slower traffic and broadsided Layana's Blazer. The Blazer flipped 
and Layana, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	His passengers -- Michael Layana, 37, Gregory Hoel, 34, and Bruce  
Taylor, 35 -- were treated at Kern Medical Center and released, said 
nursing supervisor Erlinda DeLaCruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana's relationship to Michael Layana was not immediately  
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the Mercedes -- Michael Ryan, 19, of Lake Isabella  
-- and his passenger, Richard Welty, 18, were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana was most recently living in Culver City and was a  
baseball coach at a private Catholic school in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees drafted Layana in the third round in 1986  
out of Loyola Marymount. He spent four seasons in the Yankees' farm 
system before being taken by the Reds in the minor league draft 
before the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was 5-5 with a 4.56 ERA and two saves in 78  
career relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1990 with the World Series champion Reds when  
he went 5-3 with a 3.49 ERA and two saves in 55 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana was part of the Reds' bullpen nicknamed ``The Nasty  
Boys,'' which led Cincinnati to the World Series title. Layana was 
not on the postseason team that swept the Oakland Athletics in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana pitched one game for San Francisco in 1993 and never made  
it back to the majors.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Carrying placards and shouting slogans,  
15,000 Colombians marched in downtown Bogota on Sunday to demand 
the release of more than 1,200 people held by kidnappers. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate and most of  
those currently held are in the hands of guerrillas, for whom 
ransom abductions are a major revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom For All The Kidnapped'' read a banner carried by  
relatives of 16 people still held by the rebel National Liberation 
Army, or ELN, from the April 12 kidnapping of an Avianca domestic 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The ELN holds a total of 63 people from mass abductions that  
also include a May 30 raid on a Roman Catholic Mass in the western 
city of Cali and the June 6 attack on a fishing expedition in the 
Magdalena River delta.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Celebrated writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez  
checked himself into a Bogota hospital last week suffering from 
exhaustion and should be released in four or five days, his wife 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1982 Nobel literature laureate, hospitalized Thursday, was  
undergoing a series of tests to determine the cause of what the 
Fundacion Santa Fe clinic called ``a syndrome of general fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Mercedes Barcha, would not specify the exact nature of  
the 71-year-old writer's ailment. She called ``false'' a local 
television report that doctors had found a tumor and were doing a 
biopsy to determine whether it was cancerous.

	Six years ago, doctors in the same clinic removed some small  
cancerous tumors from the lungs of Garcia Marquez, a former smoker.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez said Sunday he  
was alarmed by reports that a July 25 ballot to elect a 
constitutional assembly might be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez's comments were prompted by a report in the El Universal  
daily quoting the head of the National Electoral Council as saying 
the election may be delayed because Chavez and others are violating 
a law that prohibits them from promoting specific candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	A postponement ``would be a coup d'etat,'' Chavez said on his  
weekly radio call-in program. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt who has made  
writing a new constitution the focus of his governing agenda, says 
he will defy the council's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The president says a new constitution is needed to clean up a  
corrupt political culture. His critics say he wants to use it to 
concentrate power in his hands.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Criticism Nixed in Summit Text </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Condemnation of a U.S. law that  
punishes companies doing business with Cuba has ``mysteriously'' 
vanished from a statement to be signed by European and Latin 
American leaders, diplomats said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Helms-Burton Act was to be cited in the Declaration of  
Rio, a list of agreements among the more than 40 leaders to attend 
the two-day Latin American-European summit. The text condemned the 
application of one country's laws against another. 
</P>
<P>
	Willy Stevens, a spokesman for the Belgian government, was  
stumped. ``It was in there and then mysteriously disappeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans had successfully pressed for specific mention of the 1996  
Helms-Burton Act, which punishes companies that do business with 
Cuban interests that involve seized U.S. property. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the clause was still there, but the reference to  
Helms-Burton was not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what strange mechanism was used to suppress  
it,'' Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said, adding 
that the Cubans would try to reinstate it. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said he was  
``satisfied and content'' because the document clearly condemned 
the principle behind the act.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- If this was CART's final race here, it went out  
with a splash. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rains brought out a long yellow flag on the race track and  
thousands of umbrellas in the grandstand during Sunday's Medic Drug 
Grand Prix of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The slippery and wet conditions made for treacherous driving on  
the 2.1-mile course, which was already a bumpy ride for racers 
since it's laid out on airport runways and taxiways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like ice out there,'' said third-place finisher Michael  
Andretti. ``On the backstretch part of the track, it was as bad as 
it can get. I've been in worse conditions, but it was pretty bad. 
It made for exciting racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, cars were spraying water behind them like power  
boats on Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out of the first turn it was unbelievable,'' said Gil  
De Ferran, who finished second to rookie Juan Montoya. ``Cars were 
skating around in the standing water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was barely one-third into its scheduled 100 laps when  
the skies darkened and opened up over Burke Lakefront Airport. At 
first, there were just some minor spins but before long four 
drivers -- Tony Kanaan, Jimmy Vasser, rookie Tarso Marques and 
Mauricio Gugelmin -- were all knocked out by rain-related accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanaan and Vasser had already crashed into the tire barrier at  
turn eight when Marques came upon them and also went into the 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had started to rain pretty heavily and we were planning to  
come in on the next lap for rain tires,'' Marques said. 
``Unfortunately, I was having problems downshifting since the start 
of the race so I couldn't slow down in the corner and slid into the 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the rain stopped, drivers and their crew chiefs had to  
decide when to have the treaded rain tires changed for slick ones 
used in dry conditions. But with some parts of the course wetter 
than others, that decision was nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it started to shower, we put on slicks but unfortunately  
we had to come in for rain tires a lap later,'' said Roberto 
Moreno, who finished 10th. ``After the downpour, I would get 
completely soaked every time I went through turn one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Unser Jr. had another problem. With moisture fogging his  
helmet visor, he couldn't get a clear look at the track or traffic. 
At 150 mph, that's a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to make a stop to change the faceplate on his helmet.  
When Unser arrived in the pits, one of his crew members began using 
an air wrench on the driver's head like he was changing a tire. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	GOODBYE, CLEVELAND?:@ CART's inability to renew its contract  
with promoter, International Management Group, means the 18th Grand 
Prix of Cleveland could be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, for one, would miss the Cleveland stop.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very disappointed if we didn't come back here,''  
said Andretti, the 1991 champion, who has finished in the top three 
five times. ``The side-by-side racing, there is no better road 
course for the fans. And you're probably seeing the best fans in 
the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IMG, which has been negotiating with the rival Indy Racing  
League, NASCAR's truck series and the SCCA's Trans-Am series, has 
scheduled a Tuesday news conference to address future plans for the 
event.

<P>
	ANOTHER NEVES BREAKDOWN:@ For the third straight race,  
mechanical troubles prevented Helio Castro-Neves from finishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro-Neves was forced to pit early in Sunday's race with a  
turbocharger problem. He quickly returned to the track but came to 
a stop on Lap 19 with a broken throttle cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just today, it was a bad weekend,'' Castro-Neves  
said. ``I had a really good car this afternoon. We came back from 
the first problem, and I was going for it. All of a sudden, I 
didn't have any throttle and had to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro-Neves, in his second season with CART, qualified on the  
pole but completed just 30 laps at Milwaukee on June 6 when a 
turbocharger failure sent him out. Then at Portland, a week ago, he 
qualified second but was done after 40 laps with electrical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of mishappenings,'' he said. ``But that's racing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Castro-Neves, who drives for Hogan Racing, is ranked 15th in  
overall points despite leading 126 laps this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want is one chance,'' he said. ``We really need some  
luck right now.'' 
</P>

	SUPER-SUB:@ Moreno finished 10th to earn PPG Cup points in his  
fifth consecutive event as Mark Blundell's replacement for PacWest 
Racing Group.

<P>
	Blundell, who fractured a vertebra in his neck in a May 4  
testing accident at St. Louis, is expected to return for the July 
11 Texaco/Havoline 200 at Elkhart Lake, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moreno is doing an outstanding job, the sooner he gets out of  
my car the better,'' Blundell joked while watching Moreno during 
Sunday's race. 
</P>

                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEAVING HIS MARK:@ The tire marks from 1998 champion Alex  
Zanardi's post-race donuts near the finish line are still visible a 
year after he spun his car in circles when he became Cleveland's 
first back-to-back winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi, who defeated Michael Andretti to win in '98, left CART  
following last season to return to the Formula One circuit. He was 
replaced by Montoya.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Angry on China Spying Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators reacted bitterly Sunday to a report  
the Clinton White House knew of Chinese nuclear espionage earlier 
than it has acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really shouldn't go on'' said GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of  
Utah, who plans to run for president. ``I'm sick of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, another GOP presidential aspirant,  
accused the administration of covering up and ``misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Clinton supporter, Sen. Joe Lieberman, accused the White  
House of ineptitude because it apparently knew of security problems 
in the country's nuclear weapons laboratories a full two years 
before President Clinton was told. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back at it, this is critical enough ... that the  
president should have been informed. There's no question about 
it,'' said Lieberman, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House acknowledged Sunday it was alerted to suspicions  
of Chinese espionage in 1995 but did not learn about details until 
1996, as the administration has maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese spying in U.S. weapons laboratories began in the  
mid-1980s during the Reagan administration. It went undiscovered 
until scientists determined in 1995 that China had gained access to 
the United States' most advanced nuclear warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch and other Republicans accuse the administration of  
ignoring evidence of the leak partly because of illegal Chinese 
campaign contributions to Democrats for the 1996 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Sunday that in July 1995, Hazel  
O'Leary, then energy secretary, told then-White House Chief of 
Staff Leon Panetta and other officials about evidence that China 
may have stolen nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Word filtered out to other officials in ensuing months, the  
newspaper said, citing interviews with current and former 
officials. It said a new report on the case issued by the 
president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board refers to meetings 
among Energy Department, CIA and White House officials in the 
second half of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, deputy national security adviser in 1995 who now  
holds the top job, has said he did not tell Clinton of the matter 
until Berger was briefed thoroughly in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the White House denied any formal interagency contact  
over the issue before April 1996, when the Energy Department first 
briefed Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsel Jim Kennedy said prior discussions of the matter -- such  
as the July 1995 contact -- constituted preliminary and informal 
notification. O'Leary's talk with Panetta, Kennedy said, was 
``simply an informal heads-up to the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, appearing with his Senate colleagues on ``Fox News  
Sunday,'' said there is ``no doubt that there was some tremendous 
lapses or even, frankly, misconduct in government, that we need to 
know all the facts. But I don't know if we'll ever know it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,  
said much of the truth already is known. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration knew in 1995, the national security  
adviser knew that this was going on, and they chose to continue to 
fight for the election rather than for the American people,'' Hatch 
said.

<HEADLINE> Man Says He Fathered Baby To Kill It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- On Father's Day, Amy Shanabarger found her  
chubby-cheeked infant son, Tyler, face-down and dead in his crib. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later -- just hours after the tot's funeral -- Ronald L.  
Shanabarger told his wife he'd killed their son. The next day he 
gave police a confession saying that not only did he kill the boy, 
he planned the crime even before the child was conceived as a way 
of exacting revenge against his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler didn't die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as the coroner  
had ruled, Shanabarger said. He confessed to suffocating the 
7-month-old with plastic wrap. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was revenge because Amy, before they were married,  
had refused to cut short a vacation trip to comfort him when his 
father died in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shanabarger said he planned to make Amy feel the way he did  
when his father died. He married her, got her pregnant, allowed 
time for her to bond with the child, and then took his (boy's) 
life,'' according to an affidavit prosecutors filed to support a 
murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger, 30, who begged officers to shoot him after he  
confessed on Wednesday, was charged with murder. He is being held 
without bail pending a court appearance Monday for an initial 
hearing. An attorney will be appointed for him at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson County Prosecutor Lance Hamner said he hasn't decided  
whether to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger said in his confession that on the evening of June  
19, he wrapped plastic wrap around his son's head and face, then 
left the boy's nursery to get something to eat and brush his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes later, he said, he returned, removed the plastic  
and placed Tyler face down in the crib before he went off to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shanabarger, 29, had been working that night at her job as  
a cashier at a grocery store. When she came home she went straight 
to bed, assuming that Tyler was asleep, and found the boy's body 
the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger, who worked at a tire retreading center, told police  
he confessed because the image of his son's face, flat and purplish 
from rigor mortis, haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's confessed at least three times, Police Chief  
Harry Furrer said in an interview Sunday. Each time, the story has 
been the same -- that he hatched his plan because he was enraged by 
his then-girlfriend's refusal to cut short a cruise and return home 
after his father's death in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shanabargers were married the following May.  
</P>
<P>
	Detectives who have interviewed relatives confirmed that  
Shanabarger had long resented Amy's refusal to cut the cruise 
short, Furrer said. ``Their statements substantiate his 
confession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Randy Maynard, a volunteer chaplain for Franklin  
police, accompanied police to the couple's home in this town south 
of Indianapolis on Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	While most parents of children who die from SIDS are weeping and  
consoling each other when authorities arrive, Maynard said 
Shanabarger was cold, distant and offering no comfort to his 
sobbing wife. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Mrs. Shanabarger's parents arrived later that morning,  
Shanabarger gave his father-in-law a gift-wrapped commemorative 
knife as a Father's Day present, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really struck me as odd.''  
</P>
<P>
	Maynard said he's still troubled by the image of Tyler's tiny  
face. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a beautiful boy, even in death, he was just the most  
beautiful boy. I'm still getting goose bumps thinking about this 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger's father-in-law, Robert Parsons, wears a tiny gold  
cherub pin to remind him of his grandson. He won't discuss his 
son-in-law, but says his daughter, an only child, is devastated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a little boy, he played, he laughed, he loved. We loved  
him dearly and that's what this is all about,'' said Parsons, 52. 
``We don't want vengeance, but we do want justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neil S. Kaye, a forensic psychiatrist who specializes in  
investigating infanticide cases committed by fathers, said he's 
never heard of a similar crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times people say this or that crime was just too  
complicated of a plan to be anything other than a sign of pure 
wickedness,'' said Kaye, of Wilmington, Del. ``But science would 
say otherwise, that this man was delusional and you have to wonder 
about his overall mental state, his mental capacity.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Union To Begin Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Some of the very issues that resulted in a  
walkout four years ago will resurface when the Machinists Union and 
Boeing Co. begin to negotiate a new labor contract this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The big ones are job security, health insurance benefits and  
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some union members are talking about the possibility of  
a strike, both sides say they are optimistic this round will be 
smoother than the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 strike, which lasted 69 days, disrupted production and  
angered airline customers who had to wait on late deliveries of 
airplanes. Members also went on strike in 1989 for 48 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some say it is too early to speculate how these talks  
will end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody really wants to go on strike,'' said Russell Booth, a  
42-year-old sheet metal worker. ``But if that is necessary to keep 
what we have now, that's just what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talks will formally open in Wichita on Tuesday, when the union  
will present its proposal. The two sides will meet periodically 
before around-the-clock negotiations begin in Seattle on Aug. 15. 
The current agreement expires Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has 49,300 members, including 11,500 in Wichita.  
</P>
<P>
	More than half of union members -- 58 percent -- said their jobs  
were not secure at all, according to a union survey released last 
week. And 37 percent felt their jobs were only ``somewhat secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union members see subcontracting and outsourcing of work as the  
main threat to their jobs, the union survey showed. About half of 
all work is performed by outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Boeing is cutting thousands of positions company-wide  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials also want to discuss the possibility of  
nontraditional work weeks in a bid to slow the growth of labor 
costs. The change would mean work crews would be on the premises 
seven days a week, 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Many machinists don't like the idea, saying that it would cut  
overtime and that working weekends would hurt family time and make 
child care arrangements difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also seeks to negotiate improvements in early  
retirements and provide cost of living adjustments to future 
retirees, while preserving its existing benefits package, under 
which the company pays the entire health insurance premium for 
workers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company is concerned about rising health  
care costs. It formed a team with the union four years ago to hold 
medical costs down.

<HEADLINE>  Rio Summit Leaders Seek Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) --European and Latin American leaders  
will try to forge a new strategic partnership at their summit 
opening Monday, hoping to counterbalance the political and economic 
dominance of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Key among the issues for the leaders of 48 European, Caribbean  
and South American nations during the two-day summit will be a 
Europe-Latin America free-trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big chance for Europe and Latin America,'' said German  
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at a pre-summit gathering of 
ministers Sunday. ``We should use this historic chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is an idea, however, whose time may not quite have come.  
</P>
<P>
	There had been talk of linking the 15-nation European Union and  
Mercosur, the South American trade bloc that includes Brazil, 
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and associated members Chile and 
Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, the EU has backed away from laying out a  
timetable to negotiate the link-up. Earlier, proposals were being 
floated for starting negotiations in 2001 and finishing them by 
2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the EU-Mercosur  
negotiations will have to proceed at the same pace as the 
multilateral efforts within the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe is the No. 1 trading partner and the No. 1 investor in  
Latin America. The agreements that will be reached here will 
strengthen our relations and presence in Latin America,'' Matutes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new trade agreement with Latin America would introduce a new  
balance to U.S. influence, Matutes said. ``The good relations of 
the United States with Latin America do not have to exclude the 
existence of good relations between the EU and Latin America,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers were working Sunday on the summit declaration  
to be finalized by the leaders, which is expected to deal with a 
variety of issues, including human rights, terrorism, drugs and 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers agreed on language for the declaration mentioning  
the need to control the movement of capital, Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Jose Alfredo Graca Lima said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Brazil and Chile contended that making it harder  
for capital to jump from country to country would reduce the world 
economy's volatility and curb the spread of crises. Brazil was hit 
hard when the Asian financial crisis shook South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct European investment in Latin America doubled from 1996 to  
1997, reaching $17 billion. Spain accounted for a third of that 
amount, followed by Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	EU exports to Latin America reached $52.4 billion in 1997,  
double the 1987 amount. EU imports from Latin America totaled $38.1 
billion.

<HEADLINE> John Reportedly Seeking $40M Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Elton John, the big-spending singer who  
accumulates homes, fabulous jewels, top-of-the-range wigs and 
luxury cars as fast as he makes hits, is seeking a $40 million loan 
to pay off bills, The Sunday Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	John is negotiating with a London finance house, Samuel Montagu,  
and has agreed to sign over income from future hits as well as 
proceeds from old ones, the newspaper said, quoting unidentified 
sources in the City, London's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer, who reportedly spends up to $400,000 a week on  
credit cards, will also offer his homes in England, France and the 
United States as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	John, 52, needs most of the money to clear loans outstanding in  
Britian and the United States, including an $11 million overdraft 
with an English bank, and a loan of nearly $4 million, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	John, knighted after ``Candle in the Wind,'' his reworked song  
for Princess Diana's funeral, has had a chart success every year 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times estimated his fortune at $256 million, on a par  
with oil heir Sir John Paul Getty II, and his income in the five 
years to 1996 at $131 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the spending: 20 cars, including an Aston Martin, a  
Rolls-Royce and a Jaguar XJ220, although he seldom drives; his 
estate at Windsor, west of London, has improvements like three 
lakes and a swimming pool, and then some -- five Victorian gardens 
and a stable block in the style of a small castle for his donkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton spent up to $800,000 on one day in commissions to an  
interior designer,'' the newspaper quoted John's biographer Philip 
Norman as saying. ``He can go through Cartier with a supermarket 
trolley.''

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Ready for Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The end of the year is nearing and you have a few  
days off at New Year's. This might be the time, you think, to get 
that aching rotator cuff repaired or take care of the tummy tuck 
you've always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Think again. Do you really want to be in a hospital full of  
complicated electronic gizmos on the very day the Y2K computer 
problem is supposed to strike? The day much of the computer world 
could go dark? 
</P>
<P>
	Most hospitals insist they're not worried, even though they're  
crammed with sensitive equipment that would seem vulnerable to the 
Year 2000 glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals also rely on thousands of suppliers who could be  
individually vulnerable to Y2K, jeopardizing delivery of everything 
from Jell-O and bedpans to electricity and anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem stems from the inability of older computers to  
tell the difference between the years 2000 and 1900. The fear is 
that computers nationwide which control electricity, water, banking 
information, prison locks, payrolls, elevators and gas pumps will 
shut down when they read ``00,'' resulting in widespread chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the industry says it has been working for years to make  
sure New Year's Day is just another day in hospitals everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Hospital Association says 99 percent of hospitals  
are fully Y2K compliant, or will be by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hospitals will be prepared because it's an issue of patient  
safety,'' says Fred Brown, AHA chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some health care providers are taking precautions.  
</P>
<P>
	A recent issue of Horizons, the newsletter of health insurer  
SecureHorizons, advised patients not to schedule elective 
procedures for the first few days of January 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it wise to take an `expect the best; prepare for the  
worst' approach,'' Horizons wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The AHA calls such steps unnecessary.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very comfortable being a patient in a hospital on  
Jan. 1,'' Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
	The AHA said that even if some Y2K-related problems arise, Jan.  
1 is both the holiday and a Saturday, a time when few elective 
procedures would be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed Y2K  
readiness among state public health agencies late last year. It 
looked at 10 public health functions potentially vulnerable to Y2K 
problems, such as lab equipment or biomedical devices with 
date-sensitive microchips. Scores of critical machines, including 
defibrillators, cardiac monitors and heart-bypass machines are 
sensitive to time and date. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found readiness averaging 77 percent among the 29  
states that responded, which represented 75 percent of the U.S. 
population. The CDC repeated the survey this month and expects to 
announce the results by late July or early August. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 percent of hospitals responding to an AHA survey  
expressed concern about not being prepared for Y2K, but 61.9 
percent cited lack of information from suppliers as the No. 1 
barrier to achieving total Y2K compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The AHA says it's working with the Food and Drug Administration  
to ensure that hospitals get that information. An FDA site on the 
World Wide Web now offers compliance data on medical products from 
thousands of companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is some nervousness out there.  
</P>
<P>
	When querying critical suppliers, hospitals say they sometimes  
find themselves dealing with vendors' escape clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the letters that companies send back to us, they want to  
give you an indication on how Y2K-compliant they are, but they 
leave a little gray area because they rely on others as well,'' 
says Christopher Bunnell, Y2K coordinator at Franklin Memorial 
Hospital in rural Farmington, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	At Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, information  
technology specialists began preparing the hospital for Y2K in 1997 
and more recently began working with suppliers of critical services 
to ensure the lights stay on and the water flows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utilities was a big concern for us,'' hospital spokesman Jim  
Noga says. A meeting with water and power company officials helped 
ease his mind. ``My confidence level has gone up substantially in 
terms of their readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the realm of crucial care systems, the nation's massive  
health care bureaucracy is also making preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the Medicare providers surveyed this year by the  
Department of Health and Human Services say their billing and 
medical records systems are already Y2K compliant. Of those not yet 
ready, more than 90 percent of hospitals and 70-84 percent of other 
provider groups believe their billing systems will be compliant by 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	On the government side, HHS reports that 282 of 287 critical  
systems were compliant as of April 30. That apparently ensures that 
the agency which reimburses doctors and hospitals hundred of 
millions of dollars annually for Medicare and Medicaid expenses 
will be able to keep the money flowing when the calendar flips to 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Rockport, Maine, the Y2K problem hit early. The Penobscot  
Bay Medical Center's computer for accounts payable went on the 
fritz at the end of the hospital's fiscal year, March 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Sargent, the hospital's Y2K coordinator, says she never  
knew what exactly choked the computer, but workers had to write 
checks by hand for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're back to normal now,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Rio Summit Leaders Seek Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Challenging the traditional  
economic and political dominance of the United States in the 
Western Hemisphere, European Union and Latin American leaders say 
they want to forge a new trade partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	At a two-day summit in Rio de Janiero today, four dozen  
European, Caribbean and South American leaders will discuss a new 
free-trade zone and relations between the two continents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big chance for Europe and Latin America,'' German  
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Sunday. ``We should use this 
historic chance. We are closely related by history, politically, 
culturally and economically, with Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creating a new trade zone is a long-term prospect, closely tied  
to World Trade Organization talks that will take years, but the 
leaders are anxious to start the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a lot more stability and democracy in this region,''  
said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok. ``It is important that the EU 
tries to strengthen the relationship to show that we value the 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 European Union nations and the Mercosur countries --  
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and associate members Bolivia 
and Chile -- are expected to announce that they will open free trade 
talks. An organizational meeting was to be held in November, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the talks will start  
in earnest only in mid-2001 and will not be completed until after 
global free trade talks have been concluded under the auspices of 
the Geneva-based WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations will be complex, but I am convinced they will  
allow for an intensification of our trade relations,'' Matutes said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit participants also are trying to reach agreement on  
steps to control the movement of capital -- an issue that is of 
particular concern to Brazil, which was among the nations hit 
hardest by the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Brazil and Chile contend that making it harder  
for capital to skip across national boundaries will reduce the 
world economy's volatility and curb the spread of financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	EU figures show capital flows from Europe to Latin American  
nations reached $73 billion in 1997, up from $26 billion two years 
earlier. Direct European investment in Latin America doubled from 
1996 to 1997, going to $17 billion with Spain accounting for 33 
percent, followed by Britain with 20 percent and France with 14 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	EU exports to Latin America reached $52.4 billion in 1997,  
double the 1987 amount, but well above EU imports of $38.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, diplomats said Sunday that the condemnation of a U.S.  
law that punishes companies doing business with Cuba has 
``mysteriously'' vanished from a statement to be signed by leaders 
at the summit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what strange mechanism was used to suppress  
it,'' Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said, adding 
that the Cubans would try to reinstate it.

<HEADLINE> Primary Season a 50-Yard Dash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The scramble by states to gain more of a voice  
in picking presidential nominees is turning what used to be a 
grueling primary season marathon into what one analyst calls ``a 
50-yard dash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States have been edging primaries and caucuses earlier in recent  
elections, but California's decision this year to move to early 
March helped open the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When California moved, that shook everybody up,'' said Bill  
Jones, California's secretary of state. California's primary was in 
June for many years before switching to late March in 1996 and even 
earlier this time. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the states, representing three-fourths of party  
convention delegates, will hold primaries and caucuses between the 
end of January and March 14 -- before many voters typically start 
paying attention to the November election. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, comparable because no incumbent president was running,  
states with just under half the delegates held primaries or 
caucuses in a similar stretch of six weeks, elections officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly it's a national mess,'' William Galvin, secretary of  
the commonwealth in Massachusetts, said of the switch to earlier 
contests. ``It's a civic catastrophe about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Campaigns have started excessively early,'' said Galvin, who  
is leading an effort to change the system. ``People on the streets, 
across America are not engaged. This is being left to the big 
contributors, political activists and campaign strategists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telescoped primary schedule, combined with expected record  
campaign fund raising, could give a huge advantage to front-runners 
like Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Republican Gov. George 
W. Bush of Texas. And it may give them an incentive to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a 50-yard dash, you can't stumble and still win,'' said  
political analyst Charlie Cook. ``This helps front-runners who 
don't stumble but could really penalize a front-runner who does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin is pushing for a rotating regional primary by 2004 that  
would allow a different region to lead off the process each 
presidential election season and give voters more time to consider 
the choices. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials are recruiting support for that plan and want  
the backing of the Republican and Democratic parties. The parties 
want a say in the process but have not committed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, some states are still jockeying for position near the  
front of the pack, traditionally led by Iowa's caucuses and New 
Hampshire's primary. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Democratic Party rejected challenges to the  
leadoff positions of Iowa and New Hampshire by Michigan and 
Washington state, but it has several other requests pending. The 
scramble should wrap up in the next few weeks as national parties 
try to settle on a schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana plans a Republican caucus, similar to the one it held  
in 1996, several days before Iowa. Iowa elections officials are 
reassured by the heavy attention their state is getting from the 
front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel like we're breaking tradition. Do they (Iowa  
officials) think they're going to be first forever? That's 
un-American,'' said Louisiana GOP chairman Mike Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire lawmakers are working to give their election  
officials the flexibility to move their primary to late 1999, if 
necessary, to hold the cherished spot as the leadoff primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in many states acknowledge civic self-interest is  
driving the stampede and say an early primary is crucial for 
building excitement and the state parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Virginia is the mother of presidents, it is the selector  
of none,'' said David Hummell, a Republican official in Virginia, 
where the GOP agreed to hold a primary at the end of February 
instead of choosing delegates at party events several months later. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Democrats want to move their primary up  
several weeks to Feb. 19. Party chairman Dick Harpootlian said 
Democrats want to hold their primary the same day as Republicans. 
He conceded the crunch may not be healthy but said the elections 
process is changing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that the electronic media dominates this  
process,'' Harpootlian said. ``Going from state to state and 
showing the flag is getting irrelevant. The candidates can appear 
on a national news program and voters get to know them better than 
going to the fish fry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the leading candidates and those trailing use the  
same phrase -- ``double-edged sword'' -- to describe the impact of 
the crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend toward front-loading is making Iowa and New  
Hampshire more important,'' said Brian Kennedy, political director 
for Lamar Alexander, Republican former governor of Tennessee who 
has spent months organizing in both states. ``It's a tremendous 
opportunity -- the way to win California is to become famous by 
winning Iowa and New Hampshire.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Wants Spy-Hunting Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the wake of allegations of Chinese  
espionage, the FBI, with the approval of Attorney General Janet 
Reno, is planning to create a new division for hunting spies, 
government officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of a government-wide review of U.S.  
counterintelligence operations following indications China gathered 
classified military secrets from U.S. nuclear labs. Extensive 
breaches of security at the labs go back two decades, say critics 
of the labs on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in government. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno signed off on an FBI plan in recent weeks to split the  
functions of the national security division into two parts, 
counterterrorism and spy-hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, counterespionage would have its own new  
division, said the officials, who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Intelligence Committee was briefed on the plan  
Wednesday, said one official. The proposal was first reported on 
Saturday in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cold War ended, counterterrorism functions were added  
to the FBI national security division, giving counterespionage less 
of a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said that the CIA and Pentagon are engaged in  
reviews of their own aimed at possible improvements in 
counterintelligence efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The across-the-government review is recognition that the United  
States must deal with espionage threats not only from countries 
intent on stealing military secrets, but economic espionage 
targeting many different kinds of technology, said the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and the Justice Department have been hit with criticism  
for their handling of the investigation of nuclear lab scientist 
Wen Ho Lee, who is suspected of helping China acquire thermonuclear 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee denies spying and China denies stealing U.S. nuclear  
secrets.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Spill Reported in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FERNDALE, Wash. (AP) -- An oil tanker spilled crude oil into  
north Puget Sound waters Sunday afternoon, the U.S. Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The size and extent of the spill was not immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokeswoman Shelly Freier in Seattle said the Arco  
Texas was off-loading Alaska crude oil at a refinery near Ferndale 
in Whatcom County when ``something happened to the loading arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ship drifted away from the dock and tugboats had to retrieve  
it, Freier said. She said the flow of oil was stopped and efforts 
were started to contain the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two refineries in the Ferndale area. One, belonging to  
Arco, is located at Cherry Point. The other, a Tosco refinery, is 
at nearby Neptune Beach. It was not immediately clear at which 
refinery the spill occurred.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wine Sells for Record Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Perhaps driven by millennium party  
preparations, an anonymous collector is paying a record amount for 
a California wine. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of nine bottles of 1941 Inglenook Cabernet Sauvignon sold  
for $58,600 on Saturday during the Zachys-Christie's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	At about $6,500 per bottle, it was more than four times the  
previous per-bottle high for a California wine, according to the 
auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have attributed (the high prices) to so many people  
preparing for the millennium. Fine quality wines and champagne are 
going to be needed'' for celebrating the end of the 1900s, 
Christie's spokeswoman Beth Shepherd said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1941 Inglenook recently was named on of the top 10 wines of  
the 20th Century by Wine Spectator magazine, Christie's said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was about the same price that a French wine, a 1900 Chateau  
Margaux, brought last month at a Zachys-Christie's auction in New 
York. Last year, a single bottle of a rare Australian wine -- a 1951 
Penfolds Grange Hermitage -- sold for about $12,600.

<HEADLINE> Cardio Kickboxing Has Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beginning cardio kickboxers may discover that  
the martial arts exercises fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves that they have to do may be tougher than the  
exercisers anticipated and may leave them injured, aerobics experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get in over your head,'' said Richard Cotton, chief  
exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise, a San 
Diego-based group that certifies exercise trainers. ``Twisting, 
kicking and dynamic stretching are considered higher-risk moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although some people are in decent shape before they start  
classes, others join because they have seen exercise video ads on 
television ``and are expecting miracles in a few weeks,'' said Tim 
Rochford of Sandwich, Ill., a founding board member of the American 
Council on Martial Arts, a certifying group for martial arts and 
cardio kickbox instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise programs offer weight loss, improved endurance, and  
greater strength, coordination and flexibility. ``It's a great 
workout and, if it's done properly, anybody can get the benefits,'' 
Rochford said. ``But it's not going to happen in a few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The workouts can be intense. Cardio kickboxing can burn up to  
800 calories an hour, compared with up to 400 calories an hour in 
an average step aerobics class, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those cardio kickboxing beginners who already are trained  
in martial arts may underestimate the endurance their new activity 
requires, Rochford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The workout also requires coordination, dexterity and  
flexibility. And beginners who try to match the explosive jabs, 
hooks and kicks of more experienced classmates may injure their 
knees, elbows and shoulder girdles, Rochford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Locking out joints with fully extended kicks and punches  
increases the risk of a joint injury, he said. This especially is 
true toward the end of class, when people are more likely to be 
tired and their technique can become sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	However, instructors and students can minimize the risk and  
maximize the rewards of fitness and self-confidence by proceeding 
slowly, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Instructors should offer new students an orientation focusing on  
teaching the movements and techniques, not on speed, Rochford said. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, the new student can work up to class speed, he said.  
``It's almost like progressing through the belt levels (in martial 
arts), he said. 
</P>
<P>
	New students should realize their limitations and not push  
themselves to keep up with the rest of the class, said Kathie 
Davis, executive director of IDEA, a San Diego-based organization 
of health and fitness professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	They also should check out the class by watching a few lessons  
before they join, Davis said. ``Look for something that is simple 
and that isn't extremely fast,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, check the qualifications of the instructors, looking for  
certifications and experience in exercise class leadership and 
martial arts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginners should limit classes to no more than three times a  
week, Davis said. At the start, once a week should be enough, to 
leave time for strength and stability training on other days, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new students should pay special attention to exercises such  
as rope jumping, which work their feet and legs. And they should 
wear crosstrainer shoes rather than running shoes, because cardio 
kickboxing requires a lot of side-to-side and pivoting movements. 
</P>
<P>
	And beginners might want to consider a martial arts class  
instead of cardio kickboxing, Davis said. ``Learning in a 
traditional martial arts class allows you to go at a slower pace, 
and helps you to practice the right techniques,'' she said. 
``People make a mistake when they feel they have to learn it so 
fast. In a traditional martial arts class, it could take you a year 
to learn the proper technique. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Habitat Changes Worry Bird Lovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- In late spring, the cerulean warbler  
builds its nests of moss and bark in the treetops of a 15,000-acre 
wooded area about 60 miles north of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of the tiny, bright-blue songbird have dipped as  
housing developments and loggers encroach on its Pocono Mountains 
habitat, but birders say they are more concerned about the 
condition of the warbler's winter home 2,000 miles away in southern 
Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the 200,000-acre Podocarpus National Park -- its rainforst  
home for eight months a year -- is largely undisturbed, each year 
the warbler finds more cattle farming taking over what was once 
lush woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of winter habitat is the biggest threat to birds of  
North America,'' said Douglas Meyer, a spokesman for The Nature 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The cerulean warbler and about a dozen other migratory birds of  
concern to biologists are at the heart of a partnership between 
park officials in Ecuador and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, arranged by The Nature Conservancy, aims to  
preserve birds' dual-hemisphere habitats by encouraging officials 
to share advice, research and eventually ideas about how to 
preserve the land where their common birds live. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar links have been established between southern Ohio's Edge  
of Appalachia park and the Programme for Belize, and Connecticut's 
Devil's Den Preserve and Jamaica's Blue and John Crow Mountains 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you protect only one of the areas, it is not enough to  
ensure their survival. You must protect both areas,'' said 
Edilberto Romero, who is the partnership director for Programme for 
Belize in Belize City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nature Conservancy, based in Arlington, Va., is a nonprofit  
land preservation group that owns or manages more than 10 million 
acres of wildlife preserve in the United States. In Pennsylvania, 
it buys about 1,000 acres a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two decades, the group has expanded overseas,  
working with local community groups and environmental organizations 
to protect more than 55 million acres of land in 22 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the conservancy started the Wings of the Americas  
program to better protect migratory birds by helping them at both 
ends of their journey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania-Ecuador project started this year. In  
Pennsylvania, the conservancy is doing bird counts, as well as more 
research about what makes a good area for the birds to live so 
members can decide what land they need to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you could say that in doing this work, connections  
have emerged between places that may otherwise seem to be 
completely unconnected,'' Meyer said. ``In the case of the Wings 
program, the connection is, of course, the shared species of 
migratory birds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservancy's program is targeted at less than 100 different  
birds common in the six parks. Most of the birds are not endangered 
but are considered at risk because they require the kind of deep 
interior forests that are gradually disappearing in North America 
in favor of smaller fragmented woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials expect the partnerships to help hundreds of other  
birds that travel between the United States and South America. 
About one-quarter of the 4,000 species residing in the Americas are 
in decline or dangerously scarce, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientific data says that the time to act is now to keep  
them from becoming endangered. This is a more proactive approach to 
conservation,'' ornithologist David Mehlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnered parks are scrambling to learn more about their  
shared birds and exchange technical advice and experience. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Edge of Appalachia park in Ohio shares at least  
52 migratory bird species with the Rio Bravo Conservation 
Management Area in northwest Belize, but the birds were not well 
documented in the Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the coalition began in 1997, Ohio officials have helped  
Belize birders conduct better counts and surveys, and The Nature 
Conservancy has arranged donations of binoculars, inflatable boats 
and outdoor gear. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the South American parks are ahead of their  
U.S. counterparts in community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belize, neighbors are cloning wild orchids for sale without  
killing the flowers currently growing. In Ecuador, officials have 
set up a timber bank so limited logging can continue under park 
supervision to protect long-term growth in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania birders are especially concerned because migratory  
birds spend fewer than four months in the Poconos during their 
breeding season and the rest of the time in South America or en 
route, said Pocono Mountains program director Bud Cook. It is those 
Southern Hemisphere locations that are most vulnerable to 
devastation. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to exploit natural resources to survive, if  
that's all they know,'' Cook said. ``So, you talk about how you can 
develop resource-based activities (and incentives) that will keep 
the forest alive. And you hope it works.''

 *Mary Brogan    	
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mary Brogan, the wife of Lt. Gov. Frank  
Brogan, died Sunday of breast cancer. She was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan often had called his wife ``my partner in life.'' The two  
were high school sweethearts in Cincinnati, where Mrs. Brogan was 
born. They married in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brogan earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education  
and a master's degree in education from Florida Atlantic 
University. She began her career as a third-grade teacher at Port 
Salerno Elementary School in Stuart and later worked as an 
assistant principal at both Port Salerno and Pinewood Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
	On orders of Gov. Jeb Bush, flags were lowered in her memory,  
including those at the state Capitol, the Old Capitol building and 
the Florida Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Columba and I are saddened beyond words at the loss of Mary  
Brogan,'' the governor said in a statement. ``We have lost a true 
friend, Frank has lost a true partner and the people of Florida 
have lost a true public servant with a big heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Brogan was elected education commissioner in 1994, the  
couple moved to Tallahassee, where Mrs. Brogan worked as an 
educational consultant at Florida State University. 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed with cancer in March 1997. After a mastectomy,  
she learned the cancer had spread to her bones and underwent a bone 
marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Following intensive treatment, Mrs. Brogan was cancer-free for  
about a year. Late last year, however, it returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brogan has worked recently to promote breast cancer  
awareness. She led a women's 5K race to benefit breast cancer and 
made calls of support to breast cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Brogan's mother died of breast cancer in October 1996.  
Mary Brogan's mother also died of cancer at the age of 54. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her husband, she survivors include two sisters.

 *George Papadopoulos    	
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Former Col. George Papadopoulos, who rose  
from obscurity to become the feared ringleader of Greece's 1967-74 
military dictatorship, died Sunday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately announced by hospital  
officials, but Papadopoulos had been under medical care for three 
years for a degenerative muscle disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Imprisoned and chronically ill, Papadopoulos had been out of the  
public eye for years. But his name still stirred intense emotions 
among Greeks, especially the thousands of leftists and 
intellectuals who fled into exile during the junta or endured 
imprisonment and persecution at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Papadopoulos masterminded the bloodless 1967 military coup that  
toppled the parliamentary government after years of political 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
	Papadopoulos was toppled by his military police chief, Brig.  
Dimitris Ioannides, in November 1973 after a student uprising was 
quelled by army tanks. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence 
was later commuted to life.

<HEADLINE> Italy 2, Mexico 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- With nothing to gain, Italy and Mexico  
played a spirited Women's World Cup match Sunday, with the Italians 
taking a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In oppressive heat before a crowd eagerly awaiting the game  
between the United States and North Korea, the Italians and 
Mexicans ignored the fact both could not advance to the 
quarterfinals. With Mexico playing long ball and Italy using a more 
precise buildup, both teams threatened as much as could be expected 
in muggy 92-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy (1-1-1) got goals from Patrizia Panico in the 37th minute  
and Paola Zanni in the 51st, both on shots goalkeeper Lenny 
Quinones misplayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Panico scored with a brilliant move on which she put the ball  
between defenders. But her shot was low, right at Quinones' hands, 
and it sneaked through into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The second goal was a 20-yard lob by Zanni's left foot that  
sailed over the outstretched hands of Quinones. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy threatened a few more times, and Mexico also created some  
decent opportunities, but could not finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico (0-3) performed far better than in losses to Brazil (7-1)  
and Germany (6-0), the teams that finished atop Group B. Several 
times, striker Maribel Dominguez threatened off long passes, 
including a chip over goalie Giorgia Brenzan that tipped off the 
crossbar and sailed over the net in the 35th minute.

	CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- Angelo Bertelli, who won the Heisman Trophy  
in 1943 while at Notre Dame, died Saturday at his home of brain 
cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelli won college football's highest honor during a season  
shortened by his serving in the Marine Corps. He played six games 
for the Fighting Irish before being called to active duty in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	At Notre Dame, Bertelli went from being a tall, skinny 165-pound  
fourth-string tailback to its first T-formation quarterback. He 
also was the school's first of seven Heisman winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelli's shortened season at Notre Dame was undefeated with a  
collective score of 261-31. Bertelli had completed 70 percent of 
his passes, 25-of-36, for 512 yards and 10 touchdowns with only 
four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly been a very prominent person in our athletic  
program. When you win an award of that stature, it's not as though 
you disappear,'' Notre Dame athletic spokesman John Heisler said 
Sunday. ``It wasn't uncommon to see him back here despite the fact 
that he lived in New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame athletics director Mike Wadsworth said he was  
impressed with Bertelli's willingness to help the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``Angelo was always very humble and a person generous with his  
time to Notre Dame students and to the university, responding on so 
many occasions when, because of his celebrity, he was called 
upon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Berwanger, who won the first Heisman Trophy -- in 1935 while  
at the University of Chicago -- was at a weekend gathering of 
Heisman Trophy winners in Omaha, Neb., when he learned of 
Bertelli's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just knew that he had cancer. It was all over. We had been  
expecting it, but you don't like to hear it,'' Berwanger said, 
adding that he and Bertelli had developed a friendship over the 
years through the Heisman gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bertelli was the third oldest surviving Heisman winner,  
after himself and 1936 winner Larry Kelley of Yale. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a captain in the Marines, Bertelli played  
professional football for the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America 
Football Conference. A knee injury ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in West Springfield, Mass., Bertelli operated a  
liquor store in Clifton for 48 years. He also served as director of 
the North Jersey Automobile Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Gilda; two sons, Michael of  
Allendale, and Robert of Hoboken; two daughters, Lauren Bertelli of 
Waldwick, and Judith Wry of Manchester, Conn.; two sisters and five 
grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be held Wednesday at 9:15 a.m. at the  
Bizub-Quinlan Funeral Home, 1313 Van Houten Ave., Clifton, N.J. A 
funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. at the St. Andrew the

<HEADLINE> Clapton Admits Abusing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rock legend Eric Clapton in a tell-all interview  
published Sunday was quoted as saying he was so addicted to alcohol 
and heroin in the 1970s that he raped his wife -- part of a life 
without thought for others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that when I was a full-blown, practicing alcoholic,  
everyone used to walk around me on eggshells,'' Clapton, 54, was 
quoted as telling The Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when I just took sex with my wife by force  
and thought that was my entitlement. I had absolutely no concern 
for other people at all, and I think that what happens in a family 
is everyone starts to doctor their own roles to make it bearable to 
live that way,'' he was quoted as adding. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton was interviewed in Antigua, the Caribbean island where  
he founded Crossroads, a clinic to treat drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton, who has not remarried since his 1988 divorce from Patti  
Boyd, retreated to Antigua after his four-year-old son fell to his 
death from a New York skyscraper in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Clapton, who says he no longer regards himself as a  
musician, sold 100 of his guitars at an auction at Christie's in 
New York, raising more than $5 million for the charity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Clapton was quoted as saying he started taking  
drugs as an art student. By 1969 he was drinking two bottles of 
vodka a day, and by 1974 was spending $2,400 a week on heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a drinker and a druggie this (Antigua) was heaven for me  
because you could get every drug you wanted and every other person 
you met was an alcoholic,'' Clapton was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He first sought treatment in 1982 and was finally cured in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	Crossroads treats locals free and charges $8,800 a month for  
foreign patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I know I touch people with music ... But there's  
nothing quite like what happens between one alcoholic and another -- 
that's somehow a deeper thing.''

<HEADLINE> Four Found Dead in Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Four people, including a police officer,  
were found dead Sunday, and a neighbor was charged in the slayings, 
Kentucky State Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Todd Wedding, 27, was charged with four counts of murder,  
said Bryan Pitney, spokesman for the state police's Madisonville 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedding lived next door to two of the victims, Joey T. Vincent  
and his wife, Amy, Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities responded Sunday morning to a call reporting  
gunshots at the Vincents' home and found Vincent, 29, and Mrs. 
Vincent, 22, dead in the driveway, Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon further investigation, authorities found the bodies of a  
man and a woman in a field three miles from the Vincents' home 
Sunday afternoon, Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their identities had not been released pending notification of  
relatives, but they were neighbors of the Vincents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we have a good solid motive ... but right now  
I can't discuss what that motive may be,'' Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedding was lodged in the Daviess County Jail, and bond had not  
been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey Vincent was an eight-year veteran of the Greenville Police  
Department and also was a minister at New Cyprus Baptist Church.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Worries Fuel Solar Power Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Chris Mueller says she's been concerned about the  
environmental impact of her own energy consumption for years, but 
it was the so-called millennium bug that prompted her to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller is installing a solar energy system in her home to  
reduce her reliance on power generated by burning coal -- and as a 
backup to make sure a Y2K-related power failure won't dampen her 
New Year's cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``A gear kind of clicked,'' said Mueller, a social services  
worker who lives 25 miles north of Harrisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Others nationwide apparently are of a like mind. Solar electric  
companies around the country are reporting spikes in sales 
attributed partly to people feeling Y2K jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of people who have a grand-scale vision of  
systems going down and people who've been concerned about this for 
a long time and think the time's right,'' said Ron Kenedi, vice 
president of Golden Genesis Co., a manufacturer and distributor of 
solar electric systems based in Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem, or millennium bug, may occur in computers and  
microchips programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a 
year; they may malfunction if they misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe the bug will cause the nation's power grids to  
crash when clocks strike midnight on Jan. 1, leading to blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the East Coast (power grid) is more susceptible than  
the West Coast because it's older. We don't know which system will 
have problems. Hopefully it's no system. But whatever happens, I'll 
still be running on my system,'' Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Power companies say they have the situation under control.  
Utilities say a nationwide test of their systems on April 9 
revealed no serious problems. But only backup communication systems 
were tested, not generators or transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The next major drill is planned for Sept. 9, a day that experts  
say could foul up computer systems early because they may read the 
date ``9-9-99'' as an error message. 
</P>
<P>
	Some authorities expect any Y2K electrical problems to be  
minimal, comparable to the brief outages following storms. Wallace 
Reynolds, a spokesman for Arizona's Salt River Project, the 
nation's third-largest utility company, said customers will need 
nothing more than a flashlight and a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some aren't reassured and that's where the alternatives  
come in. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenedi said sales at Golden Genesis were up 40 percent last  
year, as several thousand more customers purchased solar systems. 
This year, sales are on track to increase by 70 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden Genesis advertises solar systems that range from $1,599  
for a 1100-watt system -- enough power for lights, a refrigerator, 
entertainment systems and a computer during short power outages -- 
to $8,199 for a ``Y2K Survivor System,'' a complete power system 
that includes a propane-powered refrigerator-freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies also see Y2K as an opportunity to promote  
products they have long believed in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's Y2K or ice storms, we now have the technology to  
solve backup power problems that we didn't have in the '70s. Y2K 
has conveniently put us on the radar screen for backup power,'' 
said Bill Roush, the owner of Solar Electric Systems of Kansas 
City, who has sold solar systems for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Lauzon of Northern Arizona Wind &AMP; Sun in Phoenix called  
the recent rise in interest unprecedented in two decades of 
business. In the past year, sales have swelled to about $4 million 
from about $3 million, Lauzon said. He's also increased his staff 
to 12 people from eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that a large part of the business is Y2K-related, and  
some people are using hype and scare tactics. I try to emphasize 
that, Y2K or not, it's always a good idea,'' Lauzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Alan Bunnell, a spokesman for Tucson Electric agreed,  
citing environmental concerns associated with fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that people are interested in alternative energy. We  
hope that will continue even beyond the Y2K issue, because 
alternative energy holds a lot of promise,'' Bunnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said solar has a long way to go, noting that only 150  
megawatts worth of solar panels are manufactured worldwide each 
year. By comparison, Tucson Electric has the capability to produce 
1,700 megawatts through conventional means for about 325,000 
households and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Morgan of Indianapolis, who sells solar and other  
energy-saving products on the Internet, said he's surprised by 
who's buying backup power. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're business people and doctors. There are very few  
'survivalists' at all. And many of them are computer types, which 
worries me. I keep wondering what they know that I don't know,'' 
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Novotny is one of those ``computer types.''  
</P>
<P>
	He is building a wind-powered system for his home in Tracy,  
Calif., and he plans to add solar power, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotny, a former electrician, he says he is wary of the  
millennium bug. ``The grid may not be there. Even if a portion goes 
down, there may be a chain reaction that occurs,'' Novotny said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Am I a doomsayer? No. But there will be a bit of a  
disruption.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was modestly higher against the yen  
early Monday ahead of a closely watched U.S. Federal Reserve 
meeting. Japanese stocks rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.88 yen in early trading, up 0.36 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.43 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 110.49 points,  
or 0.63 percent, to 17,547.01 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average closed down 191.80 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's modest strength came as  
traders awaited the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee 
meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC is widely expected to nudge up interest rates to keep  
potential inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy at bay. Higher 
interest rates make a nation's currency more attractive to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.74 yen, down  
from 127.09 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher on buying from  
foreign investors as an advance on Wall Street boosted sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
17.73 points to close at 10,552.56, marking its first gain in five 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.96 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,412.37. The 
TOPIX closed down 1.72 points, or 0.12 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7750 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.17 yen from 100.21 yen.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame RB Marion Motley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pro Football Hall of Famer Marion Motley, a  
bruising fullback for the Cleveland Browns and one of the first 
black players of the modern era, died Sunday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley had been fighting prostate cancer for at least a year. He  
died Sunday morning at his son's home in Cleveland, Hall of Fame 
spokesman Joe Horrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley, a 6-foot-1, 240-pound fullback, rushed for 4,720 yards  
in nine professional seasons in the All-America Football Conference 
and National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NFL in rushing with 810 yards on 140 carries in 1950,  
the Browns' first season in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley was also the AAFC's leading career rusher with 3,024  
yards. Along with fellow Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham and 
kicker Lou Groza, the Browns won the AAFC championship all four 
years the league existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall of Fame has lost a dear friend in Marion Motley, not  
only because he was a member of the Hall, but he was also longtime 
Canton-area resident and a good friend to all. He will be sorely 
missed,'' Horrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley was versatile for a big fullback. Sometimes called ``Otto  
Graham's Bodyguard'' for his blocking ability, Motley was also a 
receiving threat out of the backfield, catching 85 passes for 1,107 
yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marion was a great player. My dad always felt Marion was the  
greatest back he ever had,'' said Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike 
Brown, whose father, Paul Brown, coached Cleveland from 1946-62. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Brown may have been a great runner, but Marion was a  
better runner. He could really run. He was a complete player. He 
was a great blocker,'' Mike Brown said Sunday from his home in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first two seasons with the Browns, Motley was also a  
solid linebacker before he specialized on offense when the Browns 
split offensive and defensive players. He also returned 48 kickoffs 
for 1,122 yards -- 23.4 yards per return. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Motley, pro teams in the modern era didn't have black  
players. The Browns made history in 1946 when they signed Motley 
and teammate Bill Willis. That same season Kenny Washington and 
Woody Strode, who were also black, signed with the NFL's Los 
Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had a number of black players in the 1920s, but an  
unspoken ban left them out of pro football in the '30s and '40s 
until Motley signed with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley was slowed late in his career by knee injuries. He took  
the 1954 season off and attempted a comeback in 1955 with the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, but retired after carrying the ball just 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Brown said he remembers his father trading Motley to  
Pittsburgh because he was ``over the hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And when Pittsburgh came to town, Marion had a big day,'' Mike  
Brown said. After the game, Motley joked that he played well 
because ``it was easier to run down hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motley is survived by a brother and sister and three sons. There  
was no word Sunday on funeral arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Nets Center Concerned About Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Some of the muscles in Jayson Williams'  
broken right leg have been slow responding to treatment, raising 
concerns about the future of the New Jersey Nets' All-Star center. 
</P>
<P>
	The usually upbeat Williams voiced his own concerns Sunday while  
serving as the host for a charity fund raiser for two children's 
groups at his large estate in Hunterdon County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some days I feel a lot better about my leg and some days I'm  
not as confident as I felt before,'' said Williams, who broke his 
kneecap and tibia and tore a meniscus in his knee in a collision 
with teammate Stephon Marbury in a game against Atlanta on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	During a five-hour surgery, Dr. Russell Warren put a plate and  
five screws in the leg and repaired the meniscus. A bone graft from 
Williams' hip was needed to repair the kneecap fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams started walking again about a month ago, but his  
progress has been slow since. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of my muscles have atrophied and it's hard to get the  
muscles to really get going again,'' said Williams, who also needs 
to have surgery on his left thumb next month. 
</P>
<P>
	After being the host to a party for 800 people on Sunday,  
Williams admitted he would be able to do little on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He might be able to do a little rehabilitation, some light  
squats, leg presses and electric stimulation for his muscles. The 
ones that are giving him trouble are those near his hamstrings. 
They have not responded well in rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the doctor is a little baffled,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	While concerned, Nets general manager John Nash said doctors  
told him from the start that Williams' rehabilitation could not be 
judged until September. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know, he is not ahead or behind schedule,'' Nash  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who vowed shortly after his surgery to be ready for  
training camp, is definitely not as optimistic as before. He also 
doesn't look as toned as before. His weight is down 15 pounds and 
there is a noticeable limp when he walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just curious to see me run and jump,'' Williams said.  
``Walking around, like the doctor said, he can put me back together 
walking around. I want to know how my leg is going to feel when I 
run and jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is hoping to do that at the end of July, if the doctors  
approve. 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing that hasn't changed is Williams' sense of humor.  
</P>
<P>
	While saying he was happy the Nets finally gave Don Casey the  
full-time job as head coach, Williams kidded about Casey's 
contract. It will pay the 62-year-old about $1 million annually, 
one of the lowest salaries for an NBA coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Case (was) complaining to me about getting a couple-of-year  
deal,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saying: `Case, you're 84, you have half a liver, you're  
not on the back nine, you're turning the clubhouse. You're on the 
20th hole, so just take what you can get one year. We hope you can 
live that long.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing teammate Scott Burrell arrive a little late for the  
opening ceremony that featured Gov. Christie Whitman, Williams 
said: 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming from Michael Jordan's event, of course he went to  
his event first,'' Williams said. ``That's why I'm going to trade 
his behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the laughs though, there is concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I can walk I know I will be able to play,''  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching Williams walk, it's hard to think that way.

<HEADLINE> Rail Slay Suspect Recalled as Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RODEO, Mexico (AP) -- The FBI describes him as a drug-using  
killer riding the rails to find his victims. In his little 
hometown, residents remember the man they know as ``Angel'' as 
hardworking and calm. 
</P>
<P>
	He turns up time to time in this town of about 5,000 people to  
visit his wife and infant daughter, residents say -- the last time 
anyone saw him was two weeks ago, getting some exercise by riding 
his bike calmly past a police station. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems like good people, but who knows what he has in his  
heart,'' said 60-year-old Eduardo Buceaga Perez, a bricklayer 
building a house on a lot owned by the suspect in this farming town 
about 275 miles southwest of the Big Bend area on the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's 10 Most Wanted List says Rafael Resendez-Ramirez is  
suspected of a string of slayings in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky. 
He has had several scrapes with the law in the United States, which 
he has repeated entered illegally since at least 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and residents in this Durango state town say the photo of  
the suspect distributed by the FBI is without a doubt the man they 
know as Angel. Relatives say the suspect's real name is Angel 
Leoncio Reyes Resendiz, and the name put out by the FBI is an 
alias. 
</P>
<P>
	A transit policeman said he remembered giving Angel a parking  
ticket on Sunday, June 13 -- the last time he was seen spending a 
couple of days in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says that two days later, on June 15, the railroad  
killer struck again in Gorham, Ill., shooting an 80-year-old man, 
George Morber, and beating to death his 52-year-old daughter, 
Carolyn Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
	Angel's wife, Julieta Dominguez Reyes, a lab worker in the town  
health center, described him as a ``model'' husband who never gave 
signs of being violent, the Houston Chronicle reported. A year ago, 
she and Angel bought a modest house in Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsfolk said the couple largely keep to themselves. ``He  
doesn't have any friends,'' said the transit policeman. ``He never 
talks with anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. officials say the suspect is a user of drugs and  
alcohol, and is believed to be armed, no one here recalls seeing 
Angel in any cantina. He has no police record and has never been 
seen with any weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Angel taught English in a private school next  
to the police station. Last year he attended adult education 
classes and passed his exam for elementary- and middle-school 
degrees in the same day, said a neighbor, Joel Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrasts make it hard for many to believe he could be  
killing people in the United States. The photos, especially those 
showing the suspect with a mustache, match Angel. But they wonder: 
is it possible for a serial killer to come home and live such a 
low-key life? 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Moreno, the manager a small Rodeo cafe, would be surprised  
if it's true: 
</P>
<P>
	``From the behavior that he has when he's here ... I don't think  
so.''

<HEADLINE> Nomo Regaining Form in Milwaukee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- For the first time in years, Hideo Nomo looks  
like he's having fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it's still hard to tell. Ask him a long question, and  
you're likely to get a one-word answer, even if you speak Japanese. 
He's all business on and off the field, which is only natural when 
an entire country is watching your every move. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former NL Rookie of the Year whose game nearly collapsed  
in 1998 is on a roll for the Brewers, a team that needs his steady 
presence on the mound as much as Nomo needed Milwaukee's low-key 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the Pirates 7-4 on Saturday night, Nomo improved  
to 6-1 on the season with a 3.72 ERA. More importantly, Nomo, who 
hasn't lost since May 16, won his fourth consecutive start and 
fifth straight decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our guy now. There's a good feeling out there when he's  
getting ready to take the ball,'' Milwaukee manager Phil Garner 
said. ``The other guys are starting to feed off him. When he 
pitches, they feel they can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has become the ace on a team that fell into last place  
largely because a lack of quality starting pitching. He's still 
fitting into the Brewers' clubhouse, but Nomo already is a favorite 
among his teammates on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he gives the team an overall lift,'' first baseman  
Mark Loretta said. ``We know we're going to be in the game, and 
he's going to give us a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some thought Nomo had forever lost the form that made him one of  
the game's top starters in 1995 and 1996. He won just six games for 
the Dodgers and Mets last year, and the Cubs released him after a 
three-game minor league tryout this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	After he threw for several teams, the Brewers took a flyer on  
Nomo. He beat San Francisco in his first start on May 9, and hasn't 
slowed down since. 
</P>
<P>
	His unorthodox delivery still confuses hitters -- ``There's no  
good way'' to pick up his pitches, Pittsburgh's Kevin Young said -- 
but his days as a fireballer appear to be over. Instead, Nomo has 
developed a wider repertoire of off-speed stuff, and the results so 
far have been positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's nothing like he was before (he left) L.A., but he's  
learned how to adapt,'' Pirates manager Gene Lamont said. ``That 
real good split-finger helps him set up his other pitches. He mixes 
things up better than he did before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has 61 strikeouts in 10 starts with the Brewers, and he has  
thrown into the seventh inning of seven of his last eight starts. 
All are contributions Milwaukee hadn't received from its starters 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Brewers have intimated Nomo is pitching well again because  
little is expected of both him and Milwaukee this season. Garner 
doesn't buy it; in fact, he thinks Nomo should be considered as the 
Brewers' representative at next month's All-Star game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to see him make it, and I wouldn't be opposed to  
suggesting it,'' Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers still hold exclusive news conferences for Nomo after  
his starts, but they're far from the media circus that followed him 
through Los Angeles and New York. His translator in Milwaukee is 
Utsoka Tani, a genial, smiling elderly Japanese woman. 
</P>
<P>
	When he first arrived in Milwaukee, Nomo was guarded about his  
future with the Brewers, and it was thought he would move as soon 
as possible. But as his performance and his confidence have 
improved, he has begun to entertain the idea of a longer stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I can contribute, I would like to stay here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was asked if he should be considered for the All-Star team.  
His one-word answer -- ``No.'' -- was typical.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Blood Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts about blood donation:  
</P>
<P>
	--About 40,000 units of blood are used each day in the United  
States. One unit is about equal to a pint. Need varies: It can take 
just six units of blood to survive heart surgery, while a car crash 
victim may need 50. 
</P>
<P>
	--There are four main blood types: A, B, AB and O. Blood centers  
often run short of types O and B blood, but shortages of all types 
commonly occur during holidays and the summer because regular 
donors take vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Donated blood can be separated into such components as red  
blood cells, platelets or plasma, which are transfused according to 
specific medical need. 
</P>
<P>
	--People can give whole blood every eight weeks, plasma every  
four weeks and platelets 24 times a year. The minimum requirements 
are that donors be age 17 or older and weigh at least 110 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	--To donate, call an area blood bank or join a blood drive. At  
the time of their appointment, donors must complete a confidential 
medical screening form that asks questions about health and 
lifestyle to assess risk for certain infections. For example, 
recent travelers to malaria-endemic countries or people who just 
received a tattoo may have to wait a year before donating. Blood 
accepted for donation also is strictly for tested for certain 
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Spill Reported in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FERNDALE, Wash. (AP) -- An oil tanker spilled about 1,050 gallons  
of crude oil into north Puget Sound waters Sunday, the Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arco Texas was unloading oil at the Tosco refinery when the  
ship's stern came unmoored at about 1:55 p.m., said Coast Guard Lt. 
j.g. Paul Lattanzi. As the ship drifted away from the dock, the 
metal arm that carries oil from the tanker to the refinery was bent 
and broken, he said, and oil spilled into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unexpected motion of the ship twisted and broke the  
discharge arm,'' Lattanzi said. He said the flow of oil was stopped 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how the stern of the ship became unmoored from  
the dock. The Coast Guard was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	A light sheen of oil could be seen in the water from the dock at  
Neptune Beach for approximately seven miles, Lattanzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Booms were put in place to contain the oil, Lattanzi said, and  
two skimming vessels were aiding the cleanup. Absorbent mops were 
also being used to soak up the oil within the containment booms. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill was 95 miles north of Seattle.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, North Korea 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Starters, subs, what's the difference? Not  
much on the U.S. soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	Backups Shannon MacMillan and Tisha Venturini did the scoring,  
while regulars Julie Foudy and Tiffeny Milbrett provided the spark 
coming off the bench Sunday as the United States beat North Korea 
3-0 to advance to the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to get ready and take whatever time I get,''  
MacMillan said after scoring once and setting up two goals by 
Venturini in the second half. ``Some of us have to step up when we 
rest some players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I sealed my statement that I will give my heart and  
soul to this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. coach Tony DiCicco had the luxury of resting some stars and  
he used it wisely. MacMillan and Venturini, former starters, played 
the whole game. Foudy and Milbrett came on for the second half with 
the match scoreless, and ignited the Americans to their third 
straight win and first place in Group A. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have a strong group who have not been starting,''  
DiCicco said after the win set up a second-round elimination game 
with Germany. ``This was a chance for them to help us out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon played a Shannon MacMillan type of game today. A goal  
like Shannon's will make any coach look like he said the right 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco's decision to rest starters Michelle Akers, Kate  
Sobrero, Foudy and Milbrett showed in the scoreless first half. 
Although the Americans dominated the ball and had many scoring 
chances, their attack wasn't crisp, particularly in midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	But that changed drastically in the second half in 89-degree  
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett entered at halftime for Mia Hamm and Foudy came on for  
Cindy Parlow. Those moves paid off with three goals in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Millie creates things. Whatever game she plays  
in, it's a spark,'' Foudy said. ``We started to go at the defense 
and then they collapsed and we could go wider on them. We weren't 
doing that in the first half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan's shot from 20 yards, off Foudy's feed, skipped off  
the grass and past goalkeeper Kye Yong Sun on the short side in the 
56th minute. The crowd of 50,584 at Foxboro Stadium, somewhat 
subdued until then, erupted in cheers as MacMillan slid face-first 
along the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball just moves around when she shoots,'' U.S. goalie  
Briana Scurry said of MacMillan's darts, which often fool Scurry in 
practice. ``That ball totally dipped before it got to the keeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, with the Americans finally loosened up, Kristine  
Lilly hit the goal post with a left-footed volley. The Koreans 
quickly moved upfield and Jin Pyol Hui hit the crossbar from 15 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly barely missed again seven minutes later on another sharp  
feed from Foudy. But when Milbrett made a long run and passed to 
MacMillan deep in the Korean area, there would be no U.S. mistake. 
MacMillan's soft pass was headed in by Venturini in the 68th. 
</P>
<P>
	Venturini, who like MacMillan started for the gold medal team at  
the 1996 Olympics, connected again eight minutes later with a 
header off MacMillan's free kick. She celebrated with a cartwheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we showed tonight the kind of depth we have,''  
Venturini said, ``and there are still players on the bench who have 
not had the opportunity to demonstrate all their skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry made a handful of outstanding saves as the Koreans  
finally ventured upfield after falling behind. She preserved the 
team's second shutout of the opening round. The Americans beat 
Denmark 3-0 and Nigeria, which also advanced to the quarterfinals, 
7-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's like a rock of granite for us,'' DiCicco said of Scurry,  
who made five saves. 
</P>
<P>
	On Fair Play Day, the Americans posed arm in arm with the  
Koreans (1-2) for a pre-game photo, then watched their opponent 
fall back into a defensive shell. Early on, those tactics seemed to 
frustrate the Americans. But the work of the halftime replacements, 
plus Venturini and MacMillan, carried the Americans into the next 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first non-sellout for a U.S. game in the tournament,  
but the crowd still was impressive. The Women's World Cup has sold 
more than 560,000 tickets, well beyond projections, and with the 
hosts still in it, a sellout in Landover, Md., on Thursday is 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The other quarterfinal on Thursday will have Brazil against  
Nigeria in what could be a high-scoring affair. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, China plays Russia and Norway takes on Sweden in  
San Jose, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Hearings on Implants Settlement Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The final legal step in a settlement between the  
Dow Corning Co. and thousands of women with silicone breast 
implants begins Monday with a judge opening weeks of hearings on 
whether to approve a $4.5 billion bankruptcy plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the company and lawyers for the women say the $3.2 billion  
settlement included within the bankruptcy plan is the best 
compromise that could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	But they face objections from the federal government, lending  
institutions and some women, all of whom claim the settlement plan 
leaves too little for their claims and gives too much protection to 
the company and its corporate parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector is being  
held in a high school auditorium in Essexville, 100 miles northwest 
of Detroit, because it is the largest space near the bankruptcy 
court in Bay City that can handle the expected throng of lawyers 
and plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a group of us that's tried to make every single  
hearing in Michigan,'' said Peggy Pardo, a breast implant claimant 
who is driving seven hours to the hearing from Chicago. ``It took 
us a long, long time to get to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning was sued by some 170,000 women. Their proposed  
settlement is the cornerstone of the company's $4.5 billion 
bankruptcy reorganization plan, which plots how Dow Corning will 
pay off about 570,000 creditors -- including the women, banks that 
hold Dow Corning's debt, insurance companies, doctors and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midland-based company filed for bankruptcy in 1995 after  
thousands of women started suing, claiming breast implants of Dow 
Corning silicone caused a variety of diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, women who blame illnesses on Dow  
Corning silicone implants could get $12,000 to $300,000 each. Women 
could also receive up to $25,000 for ruptured or leaking implants, 
and up to $5,000 for implant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Women outside the United States would be paid 40 percent to 65  
percent less for their claims, depending on where they live. Dow 
Corning said that was due to lower medical costs and different 
economic conditions in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would set aside up to $400 million to cover any  
costs of defending lawsuits by women who reject the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 113,000 women voted on the settlement terms earlier this  
year, and 94 percent approved. One of them was Pardo, who had 
implants made with Dow Corning silicone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say the settlement is perfect by a long shot,  
but I know there are many women desperately in need of help and 
they can't wait anymore,'' said Pardo, a support group leader for 
people with implant-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those objecting to the settlement are 49 women in Nevada  
and the estate of another. Their lawyers contend a clause shielding 
parent company Dow Chemical from further lawsuits is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major objection comes from women in the countries where  
payments are reduced 65 percent. Lawyers representing them say the 
payments should be larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders that hold $1.3 billion in Dow Corning debt voted against  
their part of the bankruptcy plan even though it pays them in full, 
saying the interest rate set by the company was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	And the U.S. Department of Justice has objected, saying the plan  
doesn't provide enough to pay for health care the government has 
provided to people with silicone implants. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dow Corning lawyer, Barbara Houser, says no objection raised  
so far should prevent the judge from approving the settlement with 
the women. 
</P>
<P>
	And a lawyer for the committee representing breast implant  
claims said the plan was as good as it could be. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the reason we agreed to it. It wasn't because we liked  
it,'' said lawyer Ralph Knowles.

<HEADLINE> Americans Accepting Male Au Pairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Johan Hjertquist is an au pair, but it might  
be more appropriate to call him a big brother for hire. 
</P>
<P>
	When 9-year-old Drew gets home from school, Hjertquist takes him  
out to play soccer or to swim at the local pool. Sometimes, 
Hjertquist even gives Drew advice on girls. 
</P>
<P>
	As Americans become more comfortable with male child care  
providers, an increasing number of parents are hiring male rather 
than female au pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely growing,'' said Kathy McLernon, who oversees  
au pairs in northern Virginia for EF Au Pair in Cambridge, Mass., 
the company that made headlines when its English au pair Louise 
Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of an 
infant boy. 
</P>
<P>
	McLernon, who checks in on Hjertquist and three other male au  
pairs, said young men comprise about 5 percent of EF's au pairs in 
the United States, but that percentage is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these families have school-aged boys who don't need  
someone to do the lovable, snuggly, pumpkinish stuff,'' Ms. 
McLernon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew's parents, who did not want their son's last name used,  
have used male au pairs since 1994, making them trailblazers in the 
region, Ms. McLernon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drew didn't need mothering,'' said Drew's father. ``He wants a  
soccer player, a golfer, someone who will wrestle in the basement 
with him,'' Drew's mother chipped in. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's more than fun and games. Hjertquist occasionally must  
give a stern lecture if Drew falls behind in his chores. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes to eat popcorn on the couch, and sometimes he makes a  
mess,'' said Hjertquist, a blond, blue-eyed Swedish youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Au pairs differ from nannies in that they live in the home. They  
also usually are foreign students or young adults seeking to live 
in the United States for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Au pairs are generally paid $139 per week by the hosting family,  
which also pay up to $500 for an accredited college course of the 
au pair's choosing. Au pairs work no more than 45 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual cost to a host family is about $13,000, once room and  
board and other costs are added, according to the United States 
Information Agency, which oversees au pair programs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent, sweltering June afternoon, Hjertquist and Drew  
teased one another as they played an auto racing video game in the 
family room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drew can be very annoying sometimes,'' said Hjertquist,  
glancing over at Drew for a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right,'' Drew said, adding, ``You Swedes are weird.''  
</P>
<P>
	The area's other male au pairs said they also love their jobs,  
which they said are easier than their female counterparts' 
assignments. Families with toddlers -- which means dirty diapers -- 
seem to want female au pairs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomasz Zukowski, 22, of Poland, cares for two boys, ages 7 and  
9, for a single father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of this as work,'' said Zukowski. ``For me, it's  
more of an adventure.''

<HEADLINE> Dam Makes Power Old-Fashioned Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSHFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- It was a technological marvel in the  
Roaring '20s. 
</P>
<P>
	A 5-foot-wide wooden pipe flowing out of the newly constructed  
Marshfield reservoir meandered a mile through the woods, dropping 
350 feet before the water it carried was forced into a turbine that 
cranked out 5 megawatts of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1920s electrical power was pretty much confined to  
Vermont's villages and cities. The homes which had power used it 
for little more than a light in each room and the occasional radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in those days it must have been tremendous. I can see all  
the old-timers saying, `We'll never need another one,''' said Henry 
Parker, Green Mountain Power's maintenance supervisor for the 
utility's power plants. He's worked for GMP for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the Vermont Yankee of its day,'' he said, referring to  
Vermont's sole existing nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 years after the plant, now known as Marshfield 6,  
went on line, it is producing electricity the same way it did when 
Calvin Coolidge was president, and drinking beer was against the 
law. Over the decades the increasing demand for power has 
marginalized Marshfield 6 as its 5 megawatts came to provide a 
smaller and smaller piece of Vermont's electric supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But, like a farmer's workhorse that can be relied on to do the  
job when the tractor breaks down, Marshfield 6 continues to be a 
clean, reliable, low-cost source of power. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant has been updated enough so it can be controlled from  
GMP's central command center in Colchester, but the original gauges 
still measure output. An operator's manual for the General Electric 
turbine, published in 1927, is available for quick reference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got high-tech and low-tech. This is no-tech,'' said  
Swede Dibbell, a 30-year GMP employee who has maintained Marshfield 
6 for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	GMP officials are quick to emphasize that old hydro projects are  
immune to many of the quirks of modern technology. If, in the worst 
case Y2K scenario, Vermont is plunged into darkness when computers 
reset at the turn of the millennium, Dibbell or Parker can throw a 
relay and turn the lights on for 2,000 homes in the Marshfield 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it isn't large, Marshfield 6 isn't unique. There are a  
number of small, low-tech hydro projects scattered across the 
country, said Michael Murphy, president of the Washington-based 
National Hydropower Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``As old as it is, the technology is such that what was built 70  
years ago still works,'' said Murphy, who used to work for GMP. 
``You need to take care of it. For the most part it's not the kind 
of technology that dies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People like Dibbell and Parker are the ones who dedicate their  
working lives to keeping Marshfield 6 running. The skills needed to 
keep the plant making power aren't something electrical engineers 
learn in graduate school. Dibbell learned on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the virtually maintenance-free fiberglass or concrete  
pipes that feed hydroelectric plants today, the wooden pipe, known 
as penstock, needs constant low-tech attention. The penstock is 
drained every few years for maintenance and the boards replaced as 
they wear out. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are skills in themselves. Drain the penstock too fast and  
the vacuum created by the flowing water will collapse it. Open wide 
the gates at both ends of the penstock, and the 411-acre Marshfield 
reservoir would empty into the Winooski River and be dry in hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the penstock lets go, Marshfield is going to be in  
Waterbury,'' Dibbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	About once a month, more in the winter, he walks the length of  
the penstock, looking for leaks or rotting boards. He always finds 
something. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't any such thing as a wooden penstock that doesn't  
leak,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dibbell knows how to replace the 22-foot-long, 4-inch-wide  
notched western pine boards when they wear out. (He doesn't get new 
boards. He still has a supply left over from when the pipe was 
rebuilt in the late 1950s.) 
</P>
<P>
	Every few years the boards are coated with an ecologically  
friendly, tar-like substance. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipe itself is held together with about 11,000 iron hoops  
spaced every six inches along its length. 
</P>
<P>
	The maintenance has paid off. The penstock has been a fixture on  
U.S. Route 2 between Marshfield and Danville for decades and it 
should be there for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, Swede, there are as few leaks in the penstock as  
I've ever seen,'' Parker said to Dibbell one day recently as they 
examined the penstock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The penstock is pretty sound. I'd say we are looking at  
another 20 years,'' Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	After that?  
</P>
<P>
	GMP officials don't have any idea how much it would cost to  
replace the penstock with a more modern pipe. It's unclear whether 
the relatively small amount of power Marshfield 6 produces would 
make it economically feasible to invest in a significant amount of 
new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murphy said hydropower is inexpensive enough and reliable  
enough so it would be worth it to repair projects like Marshfield 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	The question mark remains how small hydro projects will fare as  
the electric industry continues its trend toward deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the really nice things about hydro power in a  
deregulated market is it isn't subject'' to wide swings in the cost 
of fuel, said Murphy. ``We know the water price doesn't go up.''

<HEADLINE> Sea Life Said Threatened by Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The deep is far from silent these days. And  
in some undersea places, its too downright noisy, an environmental 
group warns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Natural Resources Defense Council says underwater noise from  
supertankers and military sonar can scramble signals that sea 
creatures use to communicate, affecting migration routes and 
breeding patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing Russian roulette with our oceans,'' said Joel  
Reynolds, senior attorney with the council. ``We can't afford to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduled to be released today, the study calls for a harder  
look at how man-made noise affects sea creatures. It also urges 
stiffer regulations to protect aquatic life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a serious problem. The problem is, we don't know how  
serious it is,'' said Roger Gentry, acoustics team coordinator for 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees most marine 
life in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was ``a pretty fair summary'' of the issues that  
acoustics experts in government, the military, academia and the 
environmental movement struggle with, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean noise is similar to the visual affect that strip malls and  
utility lines have on dry land, according to Cornell University 
bioacoustics expert Christopher W. Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just went out and listened in the Channel Islands,  
you'd be appalled,'' Clark said. ``Those places off San Francisco, 
off Los Angeles -- you're just in the middle of an acoustics traffic 
jam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study says those three sites, as well as Monterey and San  
Diego bays, have abundant sea life -- and high levels of underwater 
noise. Environmentalists want special efforts to turn down the 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	In dark sea waters, mammals such as whales and dolphins appear  
to use their hearing -- much as humans use sight -- to seek food, 
find mates, guard their young and avoid predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Man-made noise may harm those animals because sound travels  
faster through water than air. Whales sometimes abandon traditional 
breeding grounds and change direction during migration to avoid 
noise, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is too new to say definitively whether these behavioral  
changes do long-term damage to mammal populations, Clark and Gentry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	International shipping generates the most noise pollution, but  
faces few noise regulations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies should have the authority to regulate the acoustic  
output of ships and other sources of noise, the NRDC says. Laws 
should take a cue from the Clean Air Act, setting targets of 
practicable emissions and holding polluters to them, the report 
recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	It also calls for setting aside marine reserves to protect  
animals from noise, additional research and international 
standards.

<HEADLINE> Stowe Impressed With Travolta </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As a teen-ager, Madeleine Stowe was so enamored  
with John Travolta, her co-star in ``The General's Daughter,'' that 
she faked being a reporter in order to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually pretended to be a journalist,'' Stowe said in an  
interview in this week's People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's publicist was very nice, but he did say 'John is too  
busy and, by the way, what publication are you from, miss? I've 
never told John any of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, Stowe, 40, is even more impressed with Travolta  
after filming ``The General's Daughter,'' in which the pair 
investigates the death of the title character. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so nice that one day I was talking to him, and I was like  
'Why don't you knock it off? No one is that nice.' But he is. He

<HEADLINE> Nigeria 2, Denmark 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Nigeria became the first African team to  
ever advance to the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup with a 
2-0 victory over Denmark on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercy Akide scored in the 25th minute and Nkiru Okosieme in the  
81st as the Super Falcons finished Group A with a 2-1 record. 
Nigeria will play Brazil in the next round on Thursday at Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Akide, taking a lead pass from Patience Avre, put the ball  
between the legs of goalkeeper Dorthe Larsen to give Nigeria the 
first-half lead. Okosieme sealed the victory with a 17-yard blast 
after defender Jeanne Axelsen mishandled the ball at the edge of 
the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, Denmark had a goal disallowed and missed two late  
chances on a humid day before a crowd of 22,109 at Cooke Stadium. 
The Danes, missing injured players Marlene Kristensen and Karina 
Christensen, needed to win to keep their quarterfinal hopes alive, 
and they moved most of their players forward in the second half in 
a failed bid to come from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In first-half injury time, Janni Johansen's goal was disallowed  
when Gitte Krogh was whistled for pushing goalkeeper Ann Chiejine. 
Referee Maria Edilene Siqueira of Brazil ruled that Krogh caused 
Chiejine to drop the ball, allowing Johansen to put the shot home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 77th minute, Chiejine pushed Axelsen's shot over the net,  
and Merete Pedersen's header glanced off the crossbar one minute 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark went 0-3 in the tournament, scoring just one goal.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Spill Reported in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FERNDALE, Wash. (AP) -- An oil tanker spilled about 1,050 gallons  
of crude oil into north Puget Sound waters Sunday, the Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arco Texas was unloading oil at the Tosco refinery when the  
ship's stern came unmoored at about 1:55 p.m., said Coast Guard Lt. 
j.g. Paul Lattanzi. As the ship drifted away from the dock, the 
metal arm that carries oil from the tanker to the refinery was bent 
and broken, he said, and oil spilled into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unexpected motion of the ship twisted and broke the  
discharge arm,'' Lattanzi said. He said the flow of oil was stopped 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how the stern of the ship became unmoored from  
the dock. The Coast Guard and the company were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Tosco Ferndale Refinery spokeswoman Wendy Eickmeyer estimated  
the spill at 20 barrels of crude oil, about 840 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	A light sheen of oil could be seen in the water from the dock at  
Neptune Beach for approximately seven miles, Lattanzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Booms were put in place to contain the oil, Lattanzi said, and  
two skimming vessels were aiding the cleanup. Absorbent mops were 
also being used to soak up the oil within the containment booms. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill was 95 miles north of Seattle.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Sunday the main reason  
he is passing up this summer's Republican straw polls in Iowa is 
simple: money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have enough trouble asking people to vote for me without  
asking them to pay 25 bucks,'' McCain, R-Ariz., said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand now that there's going to be 1,000 Washington  
lobbyists out therein Iowa in their bib overalls over their $1,000 
suits to support Governor Bush. So I think I'm staying out of 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memo leaked last week said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP  
front-runner, is trying to line up 50 prominent interest groups to 
turn out representatives to the August polls. The polls earn large 
amounts of money for the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes are nonbinding. But many consider the polls a bellwether  
of February's important party caucuses, the nation's first 
indicator of individual candidate strengths.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is being unfairly

	Lieberman, D-Conn., who shocked the Senate during last year's  
protracted turmoil by condemning Clinton from the floor, also 
revealed Sunday he has endorsed Gore's candidacy for the 2000 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on ``Fox News Sunday'' if he believes the scandal has hurt  
Gore, Lieberman said: ``I do. I do. And I believe and certainly 
hope it's temporary. But there's a strange and very unfair 
phenomenon occurring out there now,'' Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore ``is somehow suffering because there are a certain number  
of people -- now that the president has not been put out of office -- 
who feel the liberty to be upset about what the president did. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't want him thrown out of office, but they don't want  
us to misunderstand that they were profoundly disappointed, some 
disgusted, some angry, about what the president did. And in some 
sense they're taking it out, for now, on the vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Gore's behavior, Lieberman said, ``I've never heard any  
doubts, and I certainly don't have them.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The country's most famous mailman is signing  
on with Sen. Orrin Hatch's longshot presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, R-Utah, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that Karl Malone,  
``The Mailman'' forward of the NBA Utah Jazz, called to offer his 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had Karl Malone ... call and say `I'm with you.' And I hope  
Karl will be,'' Hatch said. ``He's a great guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Hatch said he has not heard from  
Muhammad Ali, the three-time heavyweight boxing champion, about the 
possibility of campaigning. Ali suffers from Parkinson's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't chatted with my friend Ali, but he always said he  
would,'' Hatch said. ``I'm going to chat with him and see.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan  
thinks his party is uniting behind George W. Bush out of 
desperation. The race, however, is far from over, Buchanan said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Buchanan said the Texas  
governor is popular for two reasons: ``He bears a great name, 
George Bush. Secondly, the Republican establishment has moved 
behind him because it is desperate for victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, Buchanan said, ``They're putting all their eggs  
in one basket. I got a hunch (that) somewhere along the way, in the 
fall or the winter, the basket is going to be dropped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has not told the party faithful his policies, Buchanan  
said. ``We've got to find out where he stands,'' Buchanan said, but 
available evidence points to a long line of issues on which ``he 
stands very close to Clinton and Gore and very far away from Pat 
Buchanan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jesse Ventura, Minnesota's Reform Party  
governor, said he did not think Pat Buchanan could run for 
president on a Reform ticket if he should quit the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan suggested Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' he might  
bolt the GOP if it failed to nominate strong anti-abortion 
candidates at its Philadelphia convention next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I highly doubt that we would nominate someone who's not a  
member,'' Ventura said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Buchanan would have to join the Reform party, and I don't  
think it quite fits Pat Buchanan,'' Ventura said. ``He has social 
issues that he puts very strongly on the front burner.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Picks Need Time To Develop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Scott Kelman was excited when he was taken by the  
Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the NHL entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he grew up in Winnipeg, where the Coyotes played  
before moving south. And he had his heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched Keith Tkachuk his whole career. I was at his first  
game,'' said Kelman, the 15th choice in Saturday's draft. ``He and 
(Jeremy) Roenick are amazing and I look forward to playing with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the other first-rounders chosen, he'll probably  
have to wait a year or more. Only two of them -- No. 1 pick Patrik 
Stefan by Atlanta and No. 4 choice Pavel Brendl by the New York 
Rangers, both from the Czech Republic -- are expected to step right 
into the NHL next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to have patience,'' Thrashers general  
manager Don Waddell said. ``We're not worried about Patrik Stefan 
this year or next year. We're worried about Patrik Stefan five 
years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's the draftee considered most prepared for the rigors of  
the NHL. Stefan had 11 goals in 33 games for Long Beach of the 
International Hockey League last season but missed much of it with 
two concussions that concerned some teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell wasn't scared off.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's risk in any player you take,'' he said. ``This player  
has an opportunity to be an elite player for a long time in the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Brendl, who had 73 goals and 61 assists last season for  
Calgary of the Western Hockey League. But how much of an impact can 
he have in his first season? 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows? That's entirely up to him,'' Rangers coach John  
Muckler said. ``I hear a lot of people compare him to somebody 
else, who I won't mention because I don't want to put that tag on 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel and Henrik Sedin, the Swedish twins taken by Vancouver  
with the second and third picks, may not be in the NHL next year 
either. Daniel said they need to gain strength and could spend 
another season in Sweden where they have a year of high school 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can play this fall'' in the NHL, Vancouver general  
manager Brian Burke said. ``But signing them and convincing them 
that they should play right now might be a more difficult pair of 
hurdles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in the draft's history, the first four  
players chosen were Europeans. And the teams they ended up with 
were the result of a flurry of trades focused on Burke's desire to 
get the twins, who said they wanted to play together. 
</P>
<P>
	Once three pre-draft trades were done -- all involving Vancouver  
-- the order of the first four picks had changed from Tampa Bay, 
Atlanta, Vancouver, Chicago to Atlanta, Vancouver, Vancouver, New 
York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody got what they wanted in the whole thing,'' Waddell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He got Stefan, who eventually is expected to provide the offense  
Atlanta lacked after taking 26 players in Friday's expansion draft. 
None of them had more than nine goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the first 11 picks, seven were made by teams that traded for  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing when you do a big draft day deal is having  
the stomach to do it,'' said Burke, who had leverage with the No. 2 
pick to make sure no other team ended up with both Sedins. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefan, though, is a big power forward and the prize of the  
draft crop. He's also the first European taken No. 1 since Tampa 
Bay chose Roman Hamrlik, also of the Czech Republic, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a coincidence'' that Europeans were taken with the  
first four choices, Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden 
said. ``They're developing players faster than we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 28 players chosen in the first round, 15 were from  
Europe, although some played junior hockey in Canada or the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with the fifth pick, the New York Islanders made center  
Tim Connolly of Baldwinsville, N.Y., the first American drafted. He 
had 34 goals for Erie of the Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor being the highest U.S. player drafted,''  
Connolly said. ``I don't feel pressure. Pressure is when you don't 
have a job and have six kids to feed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first goalie taken was Brian Finley, who played with Barrie  
in the OHL, with the sixth pick to Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams picking in the top 10 were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Washington, taking center Kris Beech of Calgary of the WHL;  
</P>
<P>
	--the New York Islanders, grabbing left wing Taylor Pyatt of  
Sudbury of the OHL; 
</P>
<P>
	--the Rangers, choosing center Jamie Lundmark of Moose Jaw of the  
OHL, 
</P>
<P>
	--and the Islanders, picking defenseman Branislav Mezei of  
Belleville of the OHL.

<HEADLINE> Judicial Nominee Votes Looming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a months-long stalemate, the Senate  
Judiciary Committee is beginning to move on President Clinton's 
judicial nominees. Among the beneficiaries is a longtime friend of 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-controlled committee sent five appointments to the full  
Senate last week and planned to meet Monday to vote on three more. 
One of the five was W. Allen Pepper Jr. of Mississippi, who a 
spokesman for Lott, R-Miss., said roomed with Lott at the 
University of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reflection of Senate politics, the Senate's top Democrat,  
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, had a favored nominee in the first 
batch to move through committee: Karen E. Schreier of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear when the full Senate will vote on the  
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has been  
holding up Clinton's appointments in an attempt to win a nomination 
for Ted Stewart, an aide to Utah's governor. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democratic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said the White House recently decided to ``send Stewart's name out 
to be vetted'' for a possible appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two judges have been confirmed by the GOP-controlled Senate  
this year. Both were left over from last year's nominations and had 
been pending for more than 200 days by the time they were approved. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Democrats, 40 nominations are pending in committee.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Whip David Bonior sits atop the list of  
Republican targets in next year's elections, followed by freshman 
Rep. Rush Holt in New Jersey, according to the head of the GOP 
campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., said Republicans ``don't underestimate''  
Bonior. But he said the veteran Michigan Democrat ``starts out 
behind'' in his race for re-election and cited a GOP poll 
commissioned in April to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonior was first elected in 1976. Republicans routinely place  
him on their list of targets, so far without success. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic spokesman Erik Smith predicted that 2000 would be no  
different. ``Michigan is littered with people who underestimated 
David Bonior,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats said Republicans have yet to publicly release  
the poll they tout showing Bonior's vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, who defeated Rep. Mike Pappas in 1998, is in a district  
that is difficult for a Democrat. Clinton carried it in 1996, but 
with less than 50 percent of the vote. He won only 40 percent there 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Holt, Steve Maviglio, said, ``It's wishful  
thinking on their part to think this is a Republican seat. 
Representative Holt has had a mainstream record, he's been actively 
working throughout the district, and we expect (that) no matter 
which of the Republican opponents emerges from their bruising 
primary that it will be a competitive race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas is seeking to retrieve his seat, but he is in a  
Republican primary fight with another former occupant of the seat, 
Dick Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the GOP target list are seats held by Reps. Debbi  
Stabenow of Michigan, Ron Klink of Pennsylvania and Bob Wise of 
West Virginia. Davis also mentioned Reps. James Maloney of 
Connecticut, Dennis Moore of Kansas, Loretta Sanchez of California, 
Adam Smith of Washington, Joseph Hoeffel of Pennsylvania and 
Shelley Berkley of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have 223 seats in the 435-member House, with 211  
Democrats and an independent who usually votes with the Democrats. 
Democrats looking to win six more seats in 2000 and take control of 
the House have targets of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Smith cited Rep. James Rogan, a Californian who gained  
national prominence as a House manager for Clinton's impeachment 
trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Democrats are aiming for GOP Reps. Ernie Fletcher  
in Kentucky, Richard Baker in Louisiana, Rick Hill in Montana, Don 
Sherwood of Pennsylvania, Robin Hayes in North Carolina and Merrill 
Cook in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Smith said Democrats have their eyes on seats being  
vacated by Republicans Bill McCollum of Florida, Jack Metcalf of 
Washington, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Rick Lazio of New York.

<HEADLINE> Driver Shortage Hits Truck Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An industry-wide shortage of truck drivers has  
prompted one St. Louis-based company to search for workers in the 
Caribbean island nation of Barbados. Hogan Transports Inc. is 
hiring 75 to 100 Barbadians from the former British colony to drive 
its big rigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously were looking to our back yard and still are, but  
look at the unemployment numbers,'' Hogan said, referring to 
Missouri's low jobless rate, which, at about 3 percent, is below 
the nation's 29-year-low of 4.2 percent. ``We look at this as an 
opportunity for us to get drivers and a chance for these 
Barbadians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan's recruits will work on temporary visas that can be  
renewed annually at the discretion of the U.S. Department of Labor. 
Their starting salaries will be about $30,000 a year, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry forecasters predict 32,000 new truckers need to hit the  
road in the United States each year through 2005 to keep up with 
growth. Competing fiercely for drivers, trucking companies are 
offering higher pay packages, health insurance, 401(k) retirement 
savings and motel lodging for overnight trips. 
</P>
<P>
	But life on the road can be unappealing. Trucking companies say  
fewer people want to take on the heavy work and long stretches away 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan Transports had to prove to the Labor Department that the  
company could not fill the jobs with local workers before getting 
the go-ahead to bring in truck drivers from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barbadian drivers are scheduled to begin 94 hours of  
hands-on training in the next couple of months at a trucking 
school. But they first have to complete 174 hours of independent 
training. They will be responsible for the cost of the training.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Boss, Colombia Rebel Boss Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- It was an unusual pitch by the chairman  
of the New York Stock Exchange, delivered in Colombia's steamy 
southern savannah to a senior commander of the hemisphere's oldest 
and largest leftist insurgency: 
</P>
<P>
	Make peace and expect great economic benefits from global  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very aggressive in trying to pursue international  
markets and opportunities,'' NYSE chairman Richard Grasso explained 
in an interview Saturday night at his Bogota hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggressive enough to fly deep into guerrilla-held territory in  
southern Colombia earlier Saturday and discuss the promise of 
capitalism for 90 minutes with Raul Reyes, head of the 
international commission of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was arranged by the government of Colombian President  
Andres Pastrana, who has been vigorously seeking international 
support for a peace initiative with rebels that has yet to show 
significant progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said he stressed the support of the world financial  
community for the peace process and tried to make Reyes appreciate 
``the opportunities capital markets will present to Colombia when a 
peace is achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also invited Reyes to visit Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``I extended to the comandante the opportunity to walk the floor  
of the exchange with me -- and he seemed reasonably intrigued,'' 
Grasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting FARC leaders to Wall Street could be difficult, though.  
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old guerrilla group is on the U.S. State  
Department's list of international terrorist groups; its chief 
revenue sources are ransom kidnappings and the ``taxing'' of 
illegal cocaine and heroin production. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Clinton administration broke off all contacts with  
the FARC after one of its factions killed three Americans who were 
in Colombia helping out an indigenous group. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso stressed that his visit was ``in the spirit of a private  
sector exchange'' but told reporters he nevertheless hoped it would 
``mark the beginning of a new relationship between the FARC and the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the FARC's peasant-based leadership say it is out of  
touch and needs to better grasp the international economy as it 
prepares for formal peace talks that are to begin July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC was formed 35 years ago by Communist guerrillas and  
controls some 40 percent of the Colombian countryside. Although 
ostensibly Marxist, its ideologists say they don't oppose foreign 
investment or free-market mechanisms as long as social justice is 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said he found Reyes ``knowledgeable of the process of  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE chairman was accompanied to Saturday's unusual meeting  
by Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo and government peace 
commissioner Victor G. Ricardo. 
</P>
<P>
	It is true that only two Colombian companies -- Banco Ganadero  
and Bancolombia -- trade on the NYSE, Grasso said when asked how the 
country had attracted the personal attention of the exchange's 
chief. President Pastrana was the key to the visit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm impressed with his vision. He is a merchant of change. He  
is really going to be a catalyst for a peaceful Colombia being a 
very important part of the economic bloc of the Americas and we 
want to be a partner with him,'' Grasso said.

<HEADLINE> Obscure Candidates Seek Alaska Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary  
Bauer stood in a room full of Alaska preachers last week. He was 
looking for deliverance from obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
	While better known candidates courted votes in traditional  
battlegrounds such as Iowa, the conservative activist and former 
Reagan aide took a four-day swing through one of America's 
political backwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bauer and other longshot candidates for the nomination,  
Alaska's Republican straw poll, set for Jan. 24, offers a chance 
for a symbolic early victory leading to a burst -- or at least a 
boomlet -- of national exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast northern wilderness also is showing potential as a  
testing ground for social conservative themes more commonly 
associated with the heartland or the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alaska provides an opportunity for retail politicking,'' Bauer  
said. ``You can talk one on one with people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The value of a straw poll victory lies almost entirely in the  
momentum and publicity it could generate, because Alaska 
Republicans do not choose their small number of delegates to the 
Republican national convention until party meetings in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of tailor-made for longshot candidates,'' Merle  
Black, a political science professor at Emory University in 
Atlanta, said of the straw poll. ``It would not make sense for 
George (W.) Bush to spend four days in Alaska.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Bob Dole passed up campaigning here before the straw  
poll and finished a weak third behind conservative commentator Pat 
Buchanan and Steve Forbes, the magazine mogul and flat-tax 
advocate. Buchanan got a boost and went on to win the New Hampshire 
primary, but Dole wound up with Alaska's delegates and the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 10,000 people are expected to venture into the frigid  
darkness of an Alaska winter for the straw poll, so the early part 
of the campaign focuses on recruiting local activists who can bring 
out voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a state where you have to get there early because your  
pool of activists is pretty small,'' said Tom McKay, chairman of 
the Republican Party of Alaska. ``Once you carve that up there's 
not much left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKay sees only four players in Alaska so far -- Bush, Forbes,  
Buchanan and Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got three camps: Christian conservatives, establishment  
Republicans, and the Forbes flat-tax bunch,'' McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush expects to win the establishment, McKay said. He already  
has endorsements from Sen. Frank Murkowski and Rep. Don Young and 
will likely attract support from the state's powerful oil industry. 
But his campaign does not plan a major push for the straw poll and 
has not scheduled a visit to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encourage our local supporters to participate in these  
straw polls as they have time,'' said Bush spokesman Dave Beckwith. 
``We're saving our money for when it counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes travels to Alaska frequently and has a loyal core of  
supporters. He plans three or four visit before the straw poll, 
said Portia Parker, director of his state campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer hopes to win over Christian conservatives, although  
Buchanan has already been to Alaska once this year to shore up his 
support in that wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's campaign sounded unconcerned about Bauer's northern  
foray. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bauer's up there and we want to let him have his day,''  
said Buchanan spokesman Bob Adams. ``We don't want to go trampling 
on him up there. Alaska's very important to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over catfish and fried chicken Friday, Bauer appealed to the  
ministers of Anchorage's black churches, traditionally a Democratic 
stronghold, to join him on a platform built on prayer in schools 
and opposition to abortion and gay marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm deeply offended to see the gay rights movement trying to  
hijack the civil rights movement,'' Bauer said, drawing fervent 
amens. ``The road to Selma was not supposed to be the road to 
Sodom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's socially conservative political action committee helped  
bankroll a campaign last year that effectively banned gay marriage 
in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	From the preachers he asked not for endorsements, but prayers,  
which they gave freely. ``Let this candidate put a move on 
America!'' one pastor said in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to support somebody simply out of history,''  
the Rev. Robert Peoples said. ``We're going to support somebody 
because they bear our witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To appeal to other factions of Alaska's GOP, Bauer proposes  
loosened federal restrictions on development of oil, timber and 
other natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alaska is a state, but it's being treated as a colony,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bauer has attracted prominent Christian conservatives  
to his camp, only about 50 people showed for a rally on Friday, 
proving that politics is among the many indoor activities that fall 
by the wayside on the long sunny evenings of Alaska's brief summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're all in line for a cabinet post,'' Bauer joked to the  
gathering.

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO hoped Sunday that the arrival  
of new Russian peacekeepers would make Serbs feel safer in Kosovo, 
but reports of more revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians did little 
to boost their confidence. NATO said at least three civilians were 
killed yesterday, including a Serbian woman whose mother said she 
was raped and killed by ethnic Albanian rebels as their village was 
being looted and burned. In Pristina, the provincial capital, two 
Russian and two NATO planes landed with equipment and technicians 
to help get Slatina Airport up and running. The airport resumed 
operation Saturday for the first time since the peacekeeping 
mission began two weeks ago.

	Officials Warn of Blood Shortage  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans take for granted they'll get a blood  
transfusion whenever they need one, but soon that may not be the 
case: Blood donations are dropping so low that serious, nationwide 
shortages could hit as early as next year. The government is so 
concerned that Surgeon General David Satcher has a committee 
hunting ways to get more people to donate blood more often, 
studying such incentives as giving donors time away from work or 
small rewards like T-shirts.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Jurors in the first smokers' class-action lawsuit  
to go to trial are expected to begin deliberations tomorrow, 
following eight months of testimony in the $200 billion lawsuit 
filed on behalf of up to 500,000 sick Florida smokers. The 
six-member jury will be asked to decide whether the nation's five 
biggest cigarette makers and two industry groups are responsible 
for injuries smokers claim they suffered because they couldn't quit 
smoking.

	Snipers Set Up Before 1968 Massacre  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The papers of a former defense secretary  
confirm what government critics have argued for decades: 
pre-positioned soldiers fired on a huge 1968 demonstration, 
according to book excerpts published today. Mexico has refused to 
release most documents on the Tlatelolco massacre, when some 300 
people were shot to death during an anti-government demonstration 
in Mexico City 10 days before the opening of the 1968 Olympics. The 
shootings, which capped three months of student demonstrations, so 
traumatized the country that people still refer to those who came 
of age at the time as ``The Generation of 1968.''

when patrons of a gay bar in Greenwich Village fought back against 
a police raid, members of the gay community turned out today to 
celebrate their pride with parades in Manhattan, San Francisco, and 
elsewhere. In New York, some parade-goers complained of 
heavy-handed treatment by police officers who ejected a group with 
a slogan criticizing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and forced another set 
to cut short a moment of silence.

	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- With hopes growing for renewed  
negotiations, Syria insisted today it could not make peace with 
Israel without the return of the entire Golan Heights. The election 
in May of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister has raised 
expectations that long stalled negotiations between Syria and 
Israel could resume. Syria long has demanded a complete Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel occupied in the 
1967 Middle East war and later annexed.

Juan Gonzalez of a three-run shot with a spectacular, 
over-the-fence catch as the Seattle Mariners closed out the 
Kingdome with a 5-2 victory over Texas today. The Mariners played 
the 1,755th and final game at the Kingdome before moving into their 
new home, the $517 million Safeco Field, on July 15. The Kingdome's 
first sellout crowd of the season watched the Mariners beat the AL 
West-leading Rangers for the second straight day after losing 14-4 
to Texas on Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Ankle Keeps McGwire Out of Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A sprained left ankle kept Mark McGwire out of  
the starting lineup Sunday night when the St. Louis Cardinals 
wrapped up their four-game series with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today he's a little bit better. I could pinch-hit him. We're  
hoping that with the off-day on Monday, he will be ready on 
Tuesday,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa did use McGwire as a pinch hitter, and McGwire was  
intentionally walked in the ninth inning of the Cardinals' 3-2, 
10-inning loss. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire left Saturday night's game in the top of the third  
inning. He said later that he isn't sure when he hurt his ankle, 
but it was sometime Friday night during Jose Jimenez's no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has played in all but three of the Cardinals' 75 games.

<HEADLINE> Ark. State Police Ticket Paula Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones was ticketed early Sunday  
morning for having a suspended driver license after she was pulled 
over for a burned out tail light, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones was on Interstate 30, about 25 miles southwest of  
Little Rock, when she was stopped by state police at about 1:15 
a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the side of the highway, the trooper ran Mrs. Jones'  
California license and learned it was suspended, state police 
spokesman Bill Sadler said. The National Crime Information Computer 
check said the suspension was for failure to appear on a 
misdemeanor charge out of Long Beach, Calif. Sadler did not know 
what the Long Beach charge was. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones was ticketed and is to appear in a Saline County  
court sometime this week. A passenger with a valid driver license 
was allowed drive the 1993 Mercedes Benz, Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones used to live in Long Beach. She and her husband,  
Stephen, are going through a divorce and she has been living in 
Cabot since the couple separated in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones accused President Clinton of making a sexual advance  
to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 while he was governor. 
She later sued him for sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Mrs. Jones agreed to an $850,000 out-of-court  
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Salmonella Found in Orange Juice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Scientists found salmonella in unopened  
containers of a widely distributed, unpasteurized orange juice from 
Arizona, putting them one step from definitively identifying the 
juice as the source of an illness that has sickened at least 14 
people, a health official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the smoking gun,'' said Dr. John Kobayashi, a state  
epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	He expected to have DNA test results Monday afternoon to compare  
with the DNA pattern of the 14 Seattle-area cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials also were investigating four new cases of  
salmonella in King County to see whether they were of the same 
strain and could be linked to the juice from Sun Orchard Co. of 
Tempe, Ariz., said Mark Alstead, a spokesman for Public 
Health-Seattle and King County. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under review were at least four cases in Oregon and one  
involving a New York man who got sick after drinking orange juice 
at a hotel in San Francisco. None involved long-term illnesses or 
required hospitalization, Kobayashi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella is a bacteria that causes infection of the  
intestines, typically resulting in diarrhea, cramps, headache, 
fever, vomiting and dehydration. Treatment consists of rest and 
drinking plenty of fluids, and infections rarely are 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun voluntarily recalled its non-pasteurized orange juice Friday  
and has halted further distribution of the product.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Wins British GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GATESHEAD, England (AP) -- Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie wasn't  
thrilled with his performance. Yet he won easily at the British 
Grand Prix on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing in wet conditions, the 26-year-old Olympic 10,000 meters  
champion sprinted the first lap in 54 seconds to grab a lead and 
then burst home to win the Emsley Carr Mile in 3 minutes, 52.39 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected more than this ... but I could not run faster,''  
Gebreselassie said. ``The first lap was okay, the second and third 
were a little bit slow. I'll try to run faster in Oslo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's John Maycock was second in 3:55.70, and Russia's  
Andrey Zadorozhnyi finished third in 3:56.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebreselassie, who set world records in both the 5,000 and  
10,000 meters in June last year, said he was using his first 
appearance at Gateshead as a warm-up for another assault on the 
5,000 meters record. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of distance running, with 15 current or previous world  
records, will try for another record in Oslo on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	British hurdler Colin Jackson, who recorded the world's fastest  
time in the 110 meters hurdles this year on Saturday, completed a 
double by winning the sprint hurdles on Sunday in 13.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 meters, world champion Cathy Freeman returned  
from an injury layoff to run a season-best 50.66 and edge Nigerian 
Falilat Ogunkoya, ranked world No. 1 in 1998, who ran 50.73. 
</P>
<P>
	After trailing early, Freeman came back and held off Ogunkoya  
over the final 30 meters. Jamaican Tracy Barnes finished third in 
51.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said the race was difficult but essential for her  
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard run for me. I was really nervous because I  
haven't run a lot, but I won ... I'm really relieved,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke's Approval in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke's nomination as U.S.  
ambassador to the United Nations has hit a snag, blocked by a 
senator upset over the punishment of a bureaucrat who accused the 
State Department of waste and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke appeared headed for approval until the case of Linda  
Shenwick drew Sen. Charles Grassley's attention. Shenwick worked as 
a budget specialist at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in 
New York until her recent transfer to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, R-Iowa, said he will not allow a vote on the Holbrooke  
nomination until the State Department agrees to rescind the 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is not a member of the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee. But by Senate tradition, any senator can ``hold'' a 
presidential nomination until grievance with the executive branch 
is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate must approve judges, ambassadors and other high  
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department refused comment Saturday on the Holbrooke  
case. But department spokesman was quoted in Saturday's Washington 
Post as saying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``treats all 
her employees fairly and according to the rules and has no personal 
vendettas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state who negotiated  
the 1995 peace agreement that ended protracted ethnic fighting in 
Bosnia, ended three days of testimony Thursday before the Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., predicted on the Senate  
floor the nomination could be confirmed by early this week, and in 
the hearing room Helms called Holbrooke ``Mr. Ambassador.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearings, Holbrooke promised to work toward U.N.  
reforms sought by Helms and other congressional conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours after Thursday's final hearing, Grassley announced  
his hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people in the State Department, apparently all the way to  
the top, don't much care for Ms. Shenwick's candor with Congress,'' 
Grassley said in a statement. ``And so they painted a big ol' 
target on Ms. Shenwick and have come after her relentlessly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in Iowa, Grassley described the 44-year-old senior  
civil servant as a ``patriotic public servant trying to do the 
right thing'' who must be protected by federal whistle-blower laws. 
</P>
<P>
	She worked for Albright during President Clinton's first term,  
when Albright held the job for which Holbrooke is nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shenwick's lawyer, Victoria Toensing, said Ms. Shenwick was  
being sent to a ``made-up job'' in suburban Washington, directing 
acquisitions management for the State Department. Toensing said it 
was ``a personal vendetta'' by Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shenwick is well known to a number of conservative members  
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said in a news release last year she  
``serves as a conduit of information'' for him and many others. He 
said then he had proof the State Department was trying to remove 
her from the U.N. job ``because she is truthful to Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Warn of Blood Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans take for granted they'll get a blood  
transfusion whenever they need one, but soon that may not be the 
case: Blood donations are dropping so low that serious, nationwide 
shortages could hit as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is so concerned that Surgeon General David  
Satcher has a committee hunting ways to get more people to donate 
blood more often, studying such incentives as giving donors time 
away from work or small rewards like T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	And some blood banks have started creative programs to lure  
donors -- one in Iowa even gives puppet shows and science 
demonstrations to school students, grooming them to donate as soon 
as they turn 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``We operate on a very thin margin of safety for the blood  
supply, and if that trend continues it would put us in a year-round 
shortage in a few years,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan of the University 
of Pennsylvania, who heads a federal committee on blood issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Blood Data Resource Center is more pessimistic: Its  
studies predict that next year, Americans will donate just under 
11.7 million units of blood -- but that hospitals will need 11.9 
million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood donations are decreasing about 1 percent a year. Demand  
for blood is increasing by 1 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, some cities routinely experience temporary blood  
shortages during holidays like the Fourth of July weekend and the 
summer, when regular blood donors go on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure, the government soon will ban Americans  
from giving blood if they've traveled extensively in Great Britain 
-- trips that added together total six months since Britain's mad 
cow disease epidemic began in 1980. Mad cow disease has been linked 
to a human brain destroyer, so experts want the precaution of a 
donor ban even though there's no proof any mad cow-type illness 
could spread through human blood. But a ban would cut the blood 
supply another 2.2 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you need surgery, when you need cancer treatment, when a  
woman gives birth -- we all assume the blood will be there,'' Caplan 
said. ``You can't make that assumption anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His committee just recommended one change that could provide up  
to 300,000 more pints a year: Use blood from people with a genetic 
disease called hemochromatosis that causes them to build up too 
much iron. Giving blood regularly alleviates iron buildup. That 
blood is healthy, but today it's thrown away because it's a medical 
treatment that patients pay for -- donations must be altruistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Why are donations dropping? Nobody really knows, although blood  
banks say younger generations have never shown the enthusiasm of 
post-World War II donors. About 60 percent of Americans are 
estimated to be eligible donors, but only 5 percent donate. 
</P>
<P>
	It's partly convenience and being reminded that blood is needed,  
said Satcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Even ``when I give blood, it's in the context of the Red Cross  
coming around to where you work,'' he said. ``There are people who 
would donate at least twice as much if they knew they were 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Florida Blood Bank proved that Satcher's right: It  
created an automated program that leaves messages -- recorded by an 
Orlando TV personality -- on previous donors' answering machines 
saying, ``Please donate blood this week.'' Last Memorial Day, a 
typical shortage period, the RealCall program prompted a 16 percent 
donation response. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center in Davenport, Iowa,  
gives puppet shows in hopes of grooming schoolchildren to become 
donors later in life -- and hook their parents, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joey scraped his knee so I raced right over,'' says Paula  
Platelet in a skit explaining how platelets help clot blood. Other 
skits feature Whitey White Cell and Penelope Plasma. 
</P>
<P>
	When kids get older, blood bank workers visit science classes  
yearly to explain donations and transfusions, and test students' 
blood type. 
</P>
<P>
	They can't yet measure the puppets' effects. But the first  
students to get yearly science-class visits turned 17 last year, 
and the annual high school blood drive showed a 23 percent increase 
in first-time donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood banks hope Satcher's advisers will consider such programs  
in looking for ways to replace the donors who will be lost under 
the pending British travel ban. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., just asked the General  
Accounting Office to study how serious the shortage is, questioning 
the impact of that ban and of hemochromatosis donations.

<HEADLINE> Computers Used To Make Science Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Imagine a diagram in a high-school  
biology book suddenly coming to life, spinning off the page as a 
detailed three-dimensional image. 
</P>
<P>
	Or a written explanation of how blood is sampled and tested,  
translated into a video clip that actually shows how it's done. 
</P>
<P>
	If this sounds a bit more titillating than the average high  
school lab class, then J. Paul Robinson and his crew of scientists 
at Purdue University are on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
	The BioScope Initiative is a project Robinson started last year  
that uses Purdue's laboratory facilities to produce high-quality 
images and videos to accompany subjects commonly taught in high 
school biology classes. These images are being incorporated into a 
CD-ROM that works in conjunction with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is an interactive program that will give students  
anywhere in the world multimedia access to science, allowing them 
to dig as deep into the subject matter as they wish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of stuff that you can't teach kids because you  
don't have the time in school,'' said Robinson, a Purdue professor 
and director of the initiative. ``But the kids, if they're excited 
and interested about it, will go off and learn about it 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the BioScope software -- which is still being  
developed -- can display the structure of a plant cell in which each 
distinct part of the cell acts as a link. By clicking on one of the 
links, the student is shown a rotating three-dimensional view of 
that specific cell part and given a brief explanation of what it 
does. 
</P>
<P>
	If the student wants additional information, he or she can  
proceed to a more detailed section. 
</P>
<P>
	The students can also view images of different cells through an  
interactive microscope. This part of the program provides 
everything from pictures taken on relatively low-powered 
microscopes to ones from high-powered electron microscopes, images 
that previously would only be available at a research university. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to expose the student to science and scientific  
images,'' said Kelly Carles-Kinch, the project's manager. ``Expose 
the student to things they normally wouldn't have access to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the BioScope Initiative came early in 1997.  
Robinson's son, Tim, had done a lab experiment at school one day. 
It was a common high school procedure where students scrape cells 
from inside their mouths then examine the cells under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson asked his 15-year-old what the cells were and what they  
looked like. Tim didn't remember; moreover, he didn't seem too 
excited about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, father and son marched into Robinson's lab at  
Purdue and did the same experiment, this time using a $350,000 
high-powered microscope. The resulting color printouts showed 
detailed images of human cells, highlighted by fluorescent dyes to 
illustrate different parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty excited,'' Robinson said of his son. ``He was  
able to take to school these pictures that were so much better than 
the ones in textbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the light bulb clicked on. Why not use computer  
technology to give kids an exciting way to experience science? Why 
should they have fuzzy, flat textbook pictures when kids anywhere 
can see dramatic three-dimensional images on CD-ROM? 
</P>
<P>
	A couple years and a $2 million grant later, Robinson and his  
team are nearing completion of their first BioScope CD-ROM, which 
they hope to make available in the fall. A consortium of educators 
from across the country acts as an advisory board, and the software 
is being tested by several teachers in Indiana and other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Anderson, a biology teacher at West Lafayette High School,  
worked with a preliminary version of the software and was 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids liked it a lot,'' she said. ``They like computers and  
they like technology, so it was really good for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the average low-power high school microscope can  
frustrate students because it's sometimes hard for them to see what 
they're supposed to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same images on the computer are much clearer and  
sharper,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the scientists, programmers and graphic artists  
working on the BioScope project hope to provide an affordable means 
of bringing interesting, high-quality scientific information into 
any school that has Internet access and a CD-ROM drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to give them the excitement of science,'' Robinson  
said. ``One really questions today whether kids get that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Science is important, and we want kids to see that science is  
not just an exciting hobby, it's an exciting profession.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Pride Celebrated With Parades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some marched in evening gowns, some in leather  
thongs, some danced to disco music and some had political messages. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 30th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, when patrons of  
a gay bar in Greenwich Village fought back against a police raid, 
members of the gay community turned out Sunday to celebrate their 
pride with parades in Manhattan, San Francisco, and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Floats rolling down Fifth Avenue carried gay gospel singers,  
AIDS activists, and a disc jockey named Billy deMace who told 
spectators: ``We're going to play a song in memory of our friends 
who died of AIDS and hate crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' began to play, a drag  
queen dressed in a black evening gown lip-synched the words. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those watching was a group called Parents and Friends of  
Lesbians and Gays. ``To have my mom out here is a joy,'' said Frank 
Jump, 40, with his arm around his mother. ``I came out to her at a 
young age, and we've been coming to the parade together for 20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1969 Stonewall Riots are commemorated around the world as a  
watershed for gay rights, and the bar, the Stonewall Inn, is being 
added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Gay 
Pride Parade began in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berlin this weekend, rainbow flags flew, marchers threw  
feathers to the crowd and half-naked men wearing bird costumes 
danced in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, Phillipines, marchers carried placards reading:  
``Same sex, same love.'' One Filipino gay man, Edgar Mendoza, told 
reporters: ``We are doing this event because we are proud of what 
we are, we are proud of how God made us to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, leather clothes, feather boas, and platform  
shoes mixed with shorts and T-shirts. A half-million spectators 
stood five-deep along the parade route, and marchers ranged from 
members of a gay veterans' group to a contingent from an antique 
auto club for gays. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade was interrupted early by an unscheduled contingent  
from Act Up! The activists carried signs including ``Sex Doesn't 
Kill'' and ``Open the Baths,'' referring to the city's recently 
revitalized controversy over public bathhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani marched, as he always  
does, with Log Cabin, a gay Republican group. The group's 
legislative director, Robert Hasek, heralded New York City's 
domestic partnership policy, which provides health insurance and 
other benefits for same-sex partners of city employees, as ``the 
best of any in the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor waved and smiled as he walked the route, saying:  
``It's a wonderful celebration. I'm here every year.'' Some in the 
crowd applauded, but others booed. Gay activist Bill Dobbs 
complained that City Hall has spent too much time shutting down 
porn shops and too little time fighting AIDS. He handed out cards 
reading: ``Stop Giuliani's Sex Police!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across from St. Patrick's Cathedral, a dozen members of Dignity  
-- a group for gays who are Roman Catholic -- prayed for acceptance 
by their church. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every other parade, the cardinal is on the steps greeting  
people,'' said Brendan Fay. ``It's always sad for me to see the 
doors shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A block away, Randall Terry, leader of the anti-abortion group  
Operation Rescue, protested. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you repent, God will forgive you!'' he shouted. Drag queens  
blew him kisses in response. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of gay firefighters called Fireflag marched for the  
first time as a fraternal organization officially recognized by the 
city. A half-dozen male ballet dancers leapt their way down Fifth 
Avenue, while square dancers swung their partners. The Brazilian 
Rainbow Group featured towering Carmen Miranda-style headdresses 
made from fruit and flowers, and men in colorful saris walked with 
the South Asian Lesbian and Gay Group. Salim Patel, costumed as Ra 
the Sun God, was covered head to toe in gold body paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freedom to be different,'' said Grand Marshal Joan Nestle,  
``is a freedom for all of us.''

<HEADLINE> New Laws Cover Hula Dance to Chili </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You can hula till you drop in Hawaii, but you'll need mom and  
dad's permission to have your navel pierced in Tennessee. And don't 
talk back to your teachers in Louisiana or you may be breaking the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	New laws passed in states around the country -- many of which  
take effect with the new fiscal year July 1 -- regulate everything 
from chili sauce to rubber duck races. A spate of new ordinances 
focuses on reining in teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens caught smoking in South Dakota starting Thursday can be  
fined once for every cigarette they light up, as can the merchant 
who sold them the pack. Louisiana passed a law that makes students 
in kindergarten through fifth grade address teachers with a 
courtesy title such as ``sir'' or ``ma'am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, the marriage age was raised to 16 from 14, and in  
Florida, a new law calls for teen-age girls to wait up to 48 hours 
for an abortion to allow doctors time to notify their parents. 
Indiana and Tennessee enacted legislation that requires parental 
consent for body piercing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at it on a broader scale, I think there is an issue of  
protecting kids from themselves and keeping parents in control,'' 
said Stephanie Wilson, who monitors state laws at the National 
Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that in the wake of the recent shootings at Columbine  
High School and other schools, a nationwide trend toward closer 
monitoring of teens will likely continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Columbine was a huge shock to everyone,'' she said. ``I think  
parents really do feel a loss of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many states have also taken steps to try to protect children in  
school. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, teachers with unsupervised access to students must  
now be fingerprinted and undergo background checks. A new law 
allows school districts in Nevada to hire a chief of school police. 
In Maryland, students who plant bombs or make bomb threats can lose 
their drivers licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, not all the new laws involve children. Many states  
raised penalties for violent crimes and for driving under the 
influence, and some raised so-called ``sin taxes'' on cigarettes 
and alcohol. Several passed legislation capping the awards handed 
out in civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire passed a law allowing homosexuals to adopt  
children, and also became the last state in the country to honor 
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. with a permanent 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina passed legislation officially legalizing  
interracial marriage. A state ban had not been enforced for 
decades. The state took a dim view of the sale of urine, however, 
outlawing the practice in part to stop a local entrepreneur from 
selling it to people required to submit samples. 
</P>
<P>
	In Idaho, meanwhile, lawmakers rescinded a $1,000 limit on prize  
money that can be awarded in charity rubber duck races. For those 
who are interested, the races involve dumping hundreds of rubber 
ducks in a stream and seeing which one reaches the finish line 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Hula, once banned by missionaries as a ``heathen practice,'' was  
declared the official state dance of Hawaii. South Carolina's new 
official state amphibian is the spotted salamander. Legislators in 
New Mexico passed a law declaring the state ``The Land of 
Enchantment,'' and even came up with an official state question: 
``Red or green?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question refers to what type of chili sauce diners want to  
put on their southwestern cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Kansas laws that take effect Thursday will lift a ban on the  
sale of fireworks from Dec. 28, 1999, to Jan. 1, 2000, and allow 
the consumption of alcohol in the Capitol building on New Year's 
Eve to help ring in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills squeaked through the Legislature in Kansas, which  
enforced prohibition until 1948 and still heavily regulates 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final analysis, I think legislators decided alcohol and  
fireworks were OK,'' said state Rep. Susan Wagle. ``They figured it 
was a good way to let people kick up their heels.''

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Win 200 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Maurice Greene showed why he's the world  
fastest human, winning even with a poor start. Marion Jones showed 
that even a knee injury can't slow her. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and Jones capped the USA Outdoor Track and Field  
Championships by winning the men's and women's 200-meter dashes 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, capitalizing on the absence of injured world  
record-holder Michael Johnson, sped to victory in a wind-aided 
19.93 seconds, beating national indoor champion Rohsaan Griffin by 
.05 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't an ordinary Greene race. He stumbled out of the blocks  
and had to put his left hand on the track to maintain his balance. 
He finally took the lead with 80 meters remaining and cruised to 
the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greene didn't come close to Johnson's world record of  
19.32 or his personal best of 19.86, even with an aiding wind of 
2.3 meters per second, he showed he was the best on this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Greene set the world record for 100 meters  
of 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	``The start of my race was shaky, but I recovered well and ran  
the best race I could today. It was a stumble out of the blocks. I 
didn't get enough block clearance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the 1998 track athlete of the year, led all the way in  
winning in 22.10. Like Greene, it was not close to her best of 
21.62 and far off the world record of 21.34, but Jones was superior 
to the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	She led coming off the curve and was not seriously challenged.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Jones sprained her right knee while long-jumping,  
and has been nursing the injury since, though she did not use that 
as an excuse Friday night when she was upset in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best it's felt,'' Jones said of her knee. There were  
several other outstanding performances on the final program of the 
four-day championships that was the qualifying meet for the World 
Championships at Seville, Spain, in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Hartwig broke his American record in the pole vault,  
soaring 19 feet, 9 inches; John Godina uncorked the best shot put 
in the world in two years, 72-3, smashing the 15-year-old Hayward 
Field record; Tisha Waller shattered meet and field records in 
winning the women's high jump at 6-6 1-4; Gail Devers won the 
women's 100 hurdles in a wind-aided 12.54; Mark Crear took the 
men's 110 hurdles in a wind-aided 13.09; and Regina Jacobs, winnner 
of the women's 1,500 Saturday, completed an unprecedented distance 
double by winning the 5,000 in 15:24.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig slithered over the bar at 19-9 on his first attempt,  
surpassing the mark of 19-8 1-2 he set last year. Hartwig then 
tried to become the first American to clear 20 feet, but missed 
three times, not coming close on any try. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he broke the meet record of 19-7 set by Scott Huffman in  
1994 and the Hayward Field record of 19-6 1-4 established in 1994 
by Ukraine's Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder at 20-1 3-4. 
Hartwig's effort also matched the best performance ever in the 
United States, by Bubka, shortly before the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always looking for the American record, every time I  
jump,'' Hartwig said. ``I had a big adrenaline rush after 19-9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godina, the runner-up in the discus Saturday, put on a  
tremendous show in the shot put, with his first three throws 
exceeding 70 feet. On his longest throw, the usually conservative 
Godina danced happily along the fringes of the shot put area. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning toss broke the Hayward Field record of 71-11 by John  
Brenner in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina didn't even have to compete in the shot put Sunday, since  
he had a bye into the World Championships as the two-time defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good for the rest of the season,'' Godina said, after  
his longest throw in three years. ``It's where I wanted to start 
throwing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In winning her third outdoor title in four years and completing  
a sweep of the indoor and outdoor championships this year, Waller 
erased the meet and field record of 6-5 1-2, by Jan Wohlschlag in 
1988 and Tanya Hughes in 1992, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	After clinching the victory, Waller missed three times at an  
American record 6-8 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers, competing in her first competitive hurdles race in three  
years, ran the fastest race in the world this year under any 
conditions. Plagued by injuries since 1996, Devers still is 
hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled my hamstring in three places,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Morrison, the fastest American this year under legal  
conditions, hit the fourth hurdle and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Crear's time in the men's hurdles also was the fastest in the  
world this year under any conditions. He surged over the final 
hurdle to beat two-time world champion and 1996 Olympic gold 
medalist Allen Johnson, second at 13.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade, the American leader this year, was slow from the  
start, bothered by muscle cramps in both legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs became the meet's only double winner and the first ever  
to sweep the 1,500 and 5,000. She stayed close to the leaders, 
before charging to the front with less than 500 meters remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's other winners were Khadevis Robinson in the men's 800  
in 1:45.92; Pascal Dobert in the men's 3,000 steeplechase in 
8:21.48; Jearl Miles-Clark in the women's 800 in 1:59.47; Lynda 
Blutreich in the women's javelin at 182-2; and Curt Clausen in the 
men's 20-kilometer walk in 1:23:34.

<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Jeff Hartwig smashed his American record in  
the pole vault, soaring 19 feet, 9 inches, at the USA Outdoor Track 
and Field Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In clearing on his first attempt, Hartwig surpassed the mark of  
19-8 1-2 he set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The record made Hartwig the third all-time outdoor performer,  
behind only Sergei Bubka of Ukraine and Okkert Brits of South

Russia did it indoors.

<HEADLINE> Four Found Dead in Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Four people, including a police officer,  
were found dead Sunday, and a neighbor was charged in the slayings, 
Kentucky State Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Todd Wedding, 27, was charged with four counts of murder,  
said Bryan Pitney, a spokesman for the state police. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedding lived next door to two of the victims, Joey T. Vincent  
and his wife, Amy, Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities responded Sunday morning to a report of gunshots at  
the Vincents' home and found Vincent, 29, and Mrs. Vincent, 22, 
dead in the driveway, Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon further investigation, authorities found the bodies of a  
man and a woman in a field three miles from the Vincents' home, 
Pitney said. Their identities were not released pending 
notification of relatives, but they were neighbors of the Vincents, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we have a good solid motive ... but right now  
I can't discuss what that motive may be,'' Pitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death for the four victims was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Wedding was being held in the Daviess County Jail, and bond had  
not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey Vincent was an eight-year veteran of the Greenville Police  
Department and also was a minister at New Cypress Cyprus Baptist 
Church.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump by a Half-Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices were up about a  
half-cent in the past two weeks, buoyed by more expensive crude oil 
and gas additives, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes,  
was $1.1960 Friday, up 0.58 cent per gallon from the previous 
survey June 13, Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey 
of 10,000 gas stations nationwide, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase comes after prices dropped by 5 cents between early  
May and early June. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the hikes occurred in the Midwest, while pump prices in  
the rest of the country showed little change, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crude oil prices have been firmer because of OPEC production  
cuts, but the U.S. overall has no shortage of oil or gasoline,'' 
Ms. Lundberg said. ``Right now it certainly seems summer driving -- 
for work or play -- could be smooth with no price shocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded was  
$1.1379, mid-grade was $1.2394 and $1.3244 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, regular was $1.5173, mid-grade averaged  
$1.6051 and premium $1.6789.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Plan 'Too Ambitious' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At ``very little'' cost to taxpayers, all 39  
million Americans covered by Medicare could get prescription drug 
benefits without bankrupting the program, administration officials 
said Sunday in previewing President Clinton's reform package. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before he announces details Tuesday, lawmakers from  
both parties said the plan was too ambitious and they urged 
limiting the new drug coverage to the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The elderly and disabled in the Medicare program who want the  
prescription coverage will have to pay for it, said Donna Shalala, 
secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The poor 
would get help buying medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about just adding some new, lush benefit,'' Shalala  
said on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' noting that half the people in 
rural areas do not have drug coverage. ``This is critical to health 
care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, chairman of the National Economic Council, said  
in CNN's ``Late Edition'' that the expanded prescription coverage 
would ``cost very little'' because of proposed savings through 
streamlining and strengthened competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Sperling said, ``is going to show a bit of  
political guts in coming forward with such a detailed plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Capitol Hill, there was skepticism Clinton could save  
Medicare from bankruptcy and introduce a significant new benefit 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said  
two-thirds of Medicare recipients already have prescription 
coverage, either through the Medicaid program for the poor or 
through private Medigap policies. That leaves about 15 million 
beneficiaries with no coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why we would want to drive those private  
programs out and substitute a government program for it,'' Gramm, 
R-Texas, said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``the working poor, the poorest of the poor not on  
Medicaid, who don't have it and we ought to work that out some 
way,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders generally have supported the idea of  
providing government-subsidized drug benefits only for those near 
the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues many Medigap policies are a major  
financial burden for the elderly, averaging about $90 a month and 
including a $250 deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would require smaller premiums and might pay  
about half the cost of prescriptions, up to perhaps $3,000 to 
$5,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., whose state's senior population  
strongly supports cheaper drug prices, said on CBS that this could 
be accomplished by making Medicare more efficient and by cutting 
fraud and waste, which he said still accounts for about 10 percent 
of Medicare spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats were less optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the way to save Medicare  
from insolvency in the next decade ``is not to load it up with 
another big costly benefit that nobody pays for even though 
everybody wants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do it step by step,'' he said on ``Fox News  
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said expanding drug benefits is  
a candidate for that ``one last national achievement'' Clinton 
wants before leaving office. But the plan for universal coverage 
``suffers an extensive reach,'' the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli predicted prescription drug benefits will grow to  
only those 15 million not now covered and that Medicare reform will 
be linked to the Republican's top priority, a package of tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Former NHL Player Gets Drug Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANTFORD, Ontario (AP) -- Former NHL defenseman Bryan Fogarty  
was arrested Saturday and charged with drug possession after a 
break-in at a local school, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogarty, who battled alcohol dependence when he played in the  
NHL from 1989-1995, signed with the Chicago Blackhawks in September 
as a free agent, but spent the season in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogarty, 30, was charged with breaking and entering and  
possession of a controlled substance after someone forced open the 
kitchen doors at the Tollgate Technological Skills Centre early 
Saturday morning. He was found standing naked in the kitchen with 
cooking oil spilled on the floor around him. He was in possession 
of a controlled substance, possibly cocaine, according to Brantford 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Brantford, Fogarty has spoken publicly about his  
problems with alcohol dependence and has spent time in a 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogarty showed great promise as a junior player, setting a  
Canadian major junior record for points by a defenseman, with 155 
in 66 games in 1988-89 when he played for the Niagara Falls Thunder 
of the Ontario Hockey League. That was the same season he was named 
Canadian major junior defenseman of the year and player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogarty was drafted ninth overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the  
1987 NHL entry draft, but never lived up to his potential. He 
debuted with the Nordiques in 1989-90 but played in only 110 NHL 
games over the next three seasons, also spending time in the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogarty also played with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Montreal  
Canadiens. He last played in the NHL in 1994-95 with the Canadiens, 
and since then has played in the International Hockey League and in 
Europe.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Women's Team May Rest Starters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- The U.S. soccer team is comfortably at  
the doorstep of the Women's World Cup quarterfinals. So 
comfortable, in fact, that several starters almost certainly won't 
play Sunday against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a spirited practice at Babson College on Saturday that  
attracted about 300 fans, the Americans made it clear they are 
taking the Koreans seriously in their round-robin finale. After 
all, a spot in the next round isn't quite secured, although it 
would take something very weird to keep the hosts out of the final 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll play to win,'' said defender Lorrie Fair, a likely  
starter in place of Kate Sobrero, who has a tender ankle. ``But I 
think Tony will give the starters some rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony DiCicco said his plans heading into the match at  
Foxboro Stadium, where more than 48,000 tickets have been sold, 
were to have Sobrero and star midfielder Michelle Akers on the 
bench at the outset. That most likely would mean moving defender 
Brandi Chastain into Akers' spot and having youngsters Fair and 
Sara Whalen on the back line with veterans Carla Overbeck and Joy 
Fawcett. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a good chance DiCicco will find a way to give some time  
off to forwards Mia Hamm and Tiffeny Milbrett. Hamm sat out most of 
the second half of a 7-1 rout of Nigeria, a rough game in which she 
and Milbrett took a physical beating. If the Americans can build a 
lead on the surprising Koreans, who are 1-1 after a 3-0 pasting of 
Denmark, look for Danielle Fotopoulos and Shannon MacMillan to get 
a lot of time up front. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't do anything that jeopardizes our winning the game and  
our group,'' DiCicco said. ``But it would be nice to get them in 
and get some rest for the players who've played three games in 
eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we need any of them on the field, they will be on the  
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States to fall out of the tournament, it would  
have to lose by at least five goals and Nigeria would have to beat 
Denmark by 10. An observer at practice noted that the U.S. men 
might be capable of such a collapse, but not this group. 
</P>
<P>
	She's right. So pencil in the Americans for the quarterfinals in  
Landover, Md., on Thursday against either Brazil, Germany or Italy. 
And expect them to be relatively well-rested for that game. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Koreans, DiCicco and his staff admit they don't know  
a whole lot. They do know Korea likely will advance to the quarters 
with a victory, and could do so with a tie if the Danes beat 
Nigeria and don't make up a six-goal differential. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have so much to gain,'' Akers said.  
</P>
<P>
	Akers has much to gain by resting. She suffers from chronic  
fatigue syndrome, so her practice work and game time is closely 
monitored. She sat out the second half against Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go into a game and you spend the half a tank you have  
in the first half, if you stay on you dig a deeper hole in the 
reserve,'' she said. ``Anytime you can save some reserve, it's a 
bonus. It's been a big deal in the preparation for tomorrow and 
will be for the quarterfinals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans complained about the scheduling that saw them play  
two games on the West Coast before heading east. They probably 
won't be complaining if they get into the second round in their 
first World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Oswald Files May Have Nothing New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The U.S. government has known since the 1960s  
nearly everything the KGB knew about Lee Harvey Oswald's time in 
the Soviet Union, and Soviet files recently turned over to the 
United States are unlikely to contain any surprises, according to a 
former KGB colonel. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Feklisov was a KGB representative in Washington when  
President Kennedy was shot in 1963. In an interview broadcast on 
Russia's NTV television Sunday, Feklisov said he collected KGB 
documents on Oswald immediately after he was linked to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We photographed the documents, there were no Xerox machines  
back then, and gave the (photos) to the State Department,'' 
Feklisov said. ``As far as I know, the State Department never 
reacted to our correspondence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald, the man the Warren Commission identified as the gunman  
who killed Kennedy, lived in the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave President Clinton a  
surprise gift at a summit earlier this month: some 85 declassified 
papers containing information gathered by Soviet intelligence 
agencies about Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
	NTV showed three of the documents Sunday: a handwritten letter  
Oswald sent to Soviet authorities seeking asylum in 1959, a 
discussion of the Soviet reaction to the assassination, and an 
announcement about which Soviet leaders would attend the Kennedy 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Some assassination researchers have said the files could provide  
a monumental breakthrough, though their full contents haven't been 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
	But Feklisov said the files were unlikely to show anything  
crucial that he didn't mention in his initial report to the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised that the Americans asked for more documents,''  
he told NTV. To find the culprit for the ``crime of the century,'' 
he said, Americans would be better off looking ``inside 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the KGB declassified the Oswald files after the 1991  
Soviet collapse, Russian officials have said the documents shed no 
new light on the assassination. They insist the Soviets had little 
interest in Oswald; the KGB deemed him mentally unstable and 
refused his asylum request. 
</P>
<P>
	Former KGB general Oleg Nechiporenko told NTV that the Soviets  
didn't want to grant him asylum, so they let him into the country 
on a temporary basis. But instead of allowing him in Moscow, they 
sent him to Minsk, Belarus, Nechiporenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The KGB amassed a six-volume file on Oswald's activities in  
Minsk. It was sent to Moscow after the assassination but returned 
to Minsk after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian media has painted Yeltsin's handover of the  
documents as little more than a symbolic friendship gesture after 
weeks of hostility over NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is setting up an interagency review to handle  
the files.

<HEADLINE> Freak Accident Kills 5-Year-Old Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Grieving neighbors left balloons and flowers  
around a baseball diamond where a 5-year-old boy died after being 
hit in the chest by a ball, and stunned families gathered Sunday at 
a local school to discuss the tragedy with social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of counselors was dispatched to Morton Elementary School  
in Millard, where Andrew Cook would have been a kindergartner this 
fall, and memorials were left at Anderson Field, where the accident 
happened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was standing next to an adult pitcher, and asked an  
adult catcher to throw him the ball. But he glanced away as the 
soft-cored T-ball was thrown and it struck him in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andrew attempted to catch it and the ball hit him on the chest  
and he went into cardiac arrest,'' said Suzanne Hinman, principal 
of the elementary school. ``We're all in shock. This is just such a 
freak accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the boy staggered and fell, took a few breaths and  
then stopped breathing. Hinman said Andrew did not have a known 
history of illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Don Savage said a doctor came out of the stands to join  
others who unsuccessfully tried to revive the child. Paramedics 
took the boy to St. Joseph Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
An autopsy was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts have calculated that about one in 200,000  
school-age athletes dies annually from accidents on the playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say seemingly innocent blows to the chest can cause  
cardiac arrest if they happen at precisely the right moment in the 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinman said the youth league was run by the Millard Athletic  
Association. She declined to release any information about the 
adult who threw the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all thinking of the Cook family,'' Hinman said. ``This  
is definitely a community, and this is a tragedy for the community, 
too.''

<HEADLINE>  Stewart To Start Alongside Gordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie Tony Stewart tested at Sears Point  
in anticipation of his first road course race. It was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will start alongside polesitter Jeff Gordon on Sunday in  
the Save Mart/Kragen 350. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's team made a trip to the winding Northern California  
track in late April, just before the California 500 in Fontana. 
Earlier in the month, he took a one-day Russell Racing School 
course at Sears Point in an open-wheel car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The little tidbits I learned here and there really helped a  
lot,'' he said. ``Anytime you can get on a race track in any type 
of car and learn the sweet spots, that's a plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won the pole Friday with a speed of 98.519 mph. Stewart  
went 98.277. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, the rookie sensation currently sixth in the Winston Cup  
standings, has not competed on a road course since he raced 
go-karts as a kid -- hardly a hint of what it will be like Sunday in 
his Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely think Sunday is going to be one of the biggest  
challenges of the year for sure,'' he said. ``It's just 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also was second to Gordon in the starting lineup for the  
Daytona 500 earlier this year. Gordon won the race. Stewart, the 
1997 Indy Racing League champion, finished 28th. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, winner of five poles this season, has won the last three  
Winston Cup road-course races, starting at Watkins Glen, N.Y., in 
1997. In 10 races at Sears point, three have been won by 
polesitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the advantages, Gordon remains wary of the competition,  
including Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to look at road courses where we could catch up on some  
guys,'' he said. ``But now these guys have closed up on us a 
bunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top five for the race Sunday were Jerry Nadeau,  
Rusty Wallace and Jimmy Spencer. Dale Jarrett, the Winston Cup 
points leader, failed to qualify in the top 25 on Friday after 
running off the course. On Saturday, he lapped at 97.063 for the 
29th starting position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stayed on the track today, but it still wasn't what we  
needed,'' Jarrett said. ``We had a pretty good lap, but got wide a 
little in turn 11, and it probably cost us a couple of tenths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it was Wallace who failed to make the field in  
first-round qualifying at Sears Point. He went on to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Stewart, Wallace also tested earlier this year at Sears  
Point after the track was once again reconfigured. The so-called 
``Chute,'' an 890-foot high-speed bypass between the track's No. 4 
and No. 7 turns, was modified with a hard-breaking exit turn. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, during testing, Wallace and Wally Dallenbach helped  
tweak the track, readjusting the tire barriers to make the turn 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, considered a road course ace, said the changes weren't  
as dramatic as the year before, when the bypass reconfiguration 
shortened the course from 2.52 miles to 1.949 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal at Sears Point last year was so untypical of our road  
course performances,'' he said. ``I'll guarantee you that it'll 
never happen again.''

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, Dozens Hurt in 2 Bus Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A tour bus carrying about 30 people on  
their way to Tijuana, Mexico, smashed into a car that veered into 
its path Sunday, killing the car's driver, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tour bus crash more than an hour later near the Mojave  
Desert town of Baker left a dozen people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before 9 a.m., a Chevy Malibu traveling southbound on  
Interstate 5 veered into the path of the bus headed for Mexico, 
said Officer Gary Montanez, a CHP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus smashed into the Chevy, leaving the unidentified driver  
with fatal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus' passengers later boarded a new replacement and resumed  
their trip. 
</P>

	Meanwhile, about 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles near the  
town of Baker, a tour bus carrying 37 passengers overturned on 
Interstate 15. Twelve people were taken to hospitals, including two 
with moderate injuries, CHP Officer Willie Hailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10:20 a.m., driver Louis Auther Jackson, 59, of Lynwood  
lost control of his bus, which crashed into the center divider and 
flipped over, Hailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was returning to Los Angeles from Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> 7 Dead in Racing Accident in Latvia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Two race cars drove off a track at a road  
rally Sunday and plowed into a crowd of spectators, killing seven 
and injuring 14, Madona County police told the Baltic News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars apparently brushed against each other and lost control  
at the start of the cross-country race just outside the capital, 
Riga. 
</P>
<P>
	Imants Pullstens, a cameraman for regional Latgale Broadcasting  
Co., said the accident happened quickly. A race car skidded off the 
track, started spinning in the air and fell into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I turned my head, everybody was already ... down,'' he  
told BNS. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead and injured were taken to nearby hospitals, including  
Madona County Hospital. Others were flown to Riga by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred during the Madona Trophy race, which also  
was a round of Latvian Cross-country Motor Racing Championship.

<HEADLINE> Woodcarver Wins muddy Queen's Plate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Woodcarver had a great start from the No. 1 post  
and pulled away from the field midway down the backstretch to win 
the 140th running of the $500,000 Queen's Plate at a muddy Woodbine 
race track Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodcarver, the 7-2 second choice, won the 1 1/4-mile race by five  
lengths in 2:03. It was the first time the Queen's Plate was run in 
muddy conditions since Steady Growth's victory in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Mickey Walls, Woodcarver paid $9.30, $6.40 and $4.50  
and won $300,000 in besting the field of 17, the race's largest 
since 18 ran in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Gandria, a 65-1 long shot, was second and paid $44.60  
and $17.20. Euchre, part of the 2-1 favorite three-horse entry with 
Touching and Roaring Twenties, was third and paid $2.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodcarver will go for the second jewel in Canada's Triple  
Crown, the $175,000 Prince of Wales Stakes at Fort Erie, Ontario, 
on July 25. If Woodcarver can win that race, and the $325,000 
Breeders' Stakes on Aug. 15 at Woodbine, he will earn owner Gus 
Schickedanz the newly inaugurated $500,000 bonus. He would also 
become the first Triple Crown winner since Peteski in 1993, which 
was the last year the Bank of Montreal offered a $1 million bonus 
for winning the Triple Crown.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil 3, Germany 3, Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Germany gave up a goal on the last play of  
the game Sunday. As penance, it now has to play the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth minute of second-half injury time, Maicon drove  
home a 12-footer after a twice-headed free kick to lift Brazil into 
a 3-3 tie with Germany and first place in Group B in the Women's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The result means Brazil will play Nigeria, the second-place team  
from Group A, in the quarterfinals. Group B runner-up Germany will 
face the tournament favorite U.S. team, with both games Thursday at 
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always seem to have something like this happen to us,''  
Germany goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg said. ``We are no more afraid 
of the Americans than they are of us. We don't want to hide from 
the Americans, we just didn't want to have to book any early flight 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil now avoids the United States until the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	``Inevitably we have to play the U.S,'' Brazil coach Wilson De  
Oliveira Rica said. ``But down the road is much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result also eliminated Italy from contention for a  
quarterfinal berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans, though exhausted in the heat and humidity, had  
limited Brazil to one shot on goal in the second half until the 
final push in injury time when Tina Wunderlich fouled Maicon to the 
right of the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi, who earlier scored her tournament-high sixth goal, took  
the kick and chipped the ball into the box. It was headed once by a 
teammate and once by Germany defender Sandra Minnert and fell to 
the left foot of second-half substitute Maicon, who drove the shot 
past Rottenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was stupid to make a foul,'' Germany defender Steffi Jones  
said. ``We were not clever enough to take the 3-2 home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a match that pitted Brazilian flair vs. German precision,  
Germany scored first when Maren Meinert made a nice 40-yard run 
down the middle of the field and passed left in the penalty box to 
Birgit Prinz, who netted in the eighth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil tied the game in the 15th on Katia da Silva's 17-yard  
strike into the upper left-hand corner of the net, then took the 
lead on Sissi's 28-yard free kick around the left side of the wall 
in the 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 2-1 at halftime, Germany regained the lead early in the  
second half on goals from Bettina Wiegmann and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiegmann celebrated her 100th international appearance with a  
penalty shot to the left of goalkeeper Maravilha in the 47th 
minute. The penalty was awarded when Prinz was yanked down by the 
left arm by defender Suzana. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones then drilled an 18-yard shot off the foot of defender  
Elane in the 58th minute to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of regulation, Brazil made only one serious threat  
to tie the game. Sissi's 15-yard shot in the 78th minute was saved 
by Rottenberg and cleared out of the box by the German defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Maicon's very late goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were patient enough and lucky enough to keep our heads  
together and get a score at the end,'' De Oliveira Rica said. ``In 
Brazil, there's a saying that God is Brazilian. This proves it once 
more.''

<HEADLINE> Bantamweights a Big Hit in Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- This was just a show to a lot of people until a  
fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 6,000 at Mandalay Bay cheered and laughed as  
Mia St. John, who has been photographed in Playboy, won a decision 
and 311-pound Butterbean pummeled Peter McNeeley, who on a previous 
visit to Las Vegas was pummeled by Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Then anyone in the crowd who was not a fight fan had to become  
one as bantamweights Paulie Ayala and John Tapia put on a 
demonstration of skill and courage over 12 frantic rounds Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala handed Tapia his first defeat in 49 fights and won the WBA  
118-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
	``To beat a champion you really have to beat him,'' said the  
32-year-old Tapia (46-1-1, 25 knockouts) of Albuquerque, N.M. He 
did not agree with the decision but acknowledged, ``Paulie is a 
great champion, a great fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges all scored the fight for the 29-year-old Ayala  
-- one by one point and the other two each by three points. The 
Associated Press favored Ayala 115-113. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great champion like Johnny, you've got to take him on every  
round,'' said Ayala (28-1, 12 knockouts) of Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Every round was close. Every round was exciting, marked by sharp  
combinations to the head, savage blows to the body and several 
collisions of heads as both fighters refused to give an inch. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old McNeeley has fought back from drug and alcohol  
abuse. He had hoped to gain some recognition and better fights and 
atone in some way for his ridiculed loss to Tyson in 1995 in which 
manager Vinny Vecchione jumped into the ring and stopped the bout 
after 89 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterbean, billed as King of the Four-Rounders, stopped  
McNeeley, 212, at 2:59 of the first round. He battered him with 
head shots but failed to knock him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to run me out of town when he was getting pounded  
by Mike Tyson,'' Vecchione said. ``They complained like hell before 
for what I did. There were no knockdowns, no cuts (Saturday night). 
I think he should have been given more of an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNeeley had become emotional at a news conference Wednesday and  
referee Jay Nady had been instructed to watch him closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought being a little emotional at a press conference  
would affect a fight being stopped three nights later,'' McNeeley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeeley wants a rematch but that's unlikely. The 32-year-old  
Butterbean, whose name is Eric Esch, wants something even more 
unlikely . 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Mike Tyson at four rounds,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	St. John's win over Mary Ann Haik on the pay-per-view show was  
sandwiched between a 10-round decision victory by Yory Boy Campos 
of Mexico over Ron Weaver and a decision by champion Stevie 
Johnston over Aldo Rios of Argentina in a dull WBC lightweight 
match.

<HEADLINE> Pulsipher To Rejoin Brewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Pitcher Bill Pulsipher, on the disabled list  
since April 18 with a strained lower back, will travel with the 
Milwaukee Brewers during their upcoming 12-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulsipher made his final rehabilitation start with Triple-A  
Louisville on Sunday and will join the team for Tuesday's game at 
Chicago, the first in the Brewers' season-longest road trip leading 
up to the All-Star break. Pulsipher hasn't been activated, but 
likely will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He could pitch as soon as the Brewers' three-game series against  
the Cubs, manager Phil Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take a look at him and see how he's doing,''  
Garner said. ``We could use him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of Hideo Nomo's emergence as the staff ace, Garner has  
received little consistency from his starters. It's hoped Pulsipher 
will be able to replace Jim Abbott (1-7) or Rafael Roque (1-5) in 
the rotation, after former No. 1 starter Cal Eldred (1-5) was 
banished to the bullpen earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulsipher had back surgery during the offseason and reaggravated  
the injury during a start April 16 against the Cubs, and he hasn't 
pitched for the Brewers since. He was 3-4 for Milwaukee last season 
with a 4.66 earned-run average.

<HEADLINE> Educational Value of Kid's TV Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The television industry is providing more  
shows for young people, but the educational value of some of the 
programs are questionable, a research group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of  
Pennsylvania said the number of shows available for children rose 
12 percent in the 1998-99 season, but it deemed 21.1 percent of the 
total programming ``minimally educational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still substantial confusion about what constitutes  
educational programming,'' said Annenberg research fellow Kelly L. 
Schmitt. ``Shows such as `Duck Tales' and `Hercules' were offered 
by stations to satisfy the educational needs of children, even 
though syndicators and networks claimed they were not designed for 
that purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The studies evaluated the quality and quantity of children's  
television in 1998, as well as parents' and children's opinions and 
behavior. Similar reports have been issued since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the increase in the number of children's  
programs is due mostly to a Federal Communication Commission rule 
that helps broadcasters speed their license renewal by airing a 
minimum of three hours a week of educational and informational 
television for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows such as ``NBA Inside Stuff'' and ``Peer Pressure''  
continue to receive the educational and informational label even 
though they contain minimal educational content, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was some improvement: Researchers judged 26 percent of  
the 1998 shows to be ``low quality,'' down from 36 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of the shows classified educational under FCC  
guidelines were ``highly educational,'' 45.5 percent were judged 
``moderately educational,'' and 21.2 percent were ``minimally 
educational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--28 percent of children's shows contained four or more acts of  
violence, and 75 percent of these high-violence programs did not 
carry the FV, or fantasy violence, content rating for children's 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--45 percent of children's programs contained one or more  
instances of problematic language and 12 percent of programs had 
one or more instances of sexual innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	--27 percent of local educational productions reported to the FCC  
in 1997 and 1998 no longer are on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	--84.1 percent of parents ``strongly'' or ``somewhat'' favor the  
V-chip technology, which allows them to block certain shows from TV 
sets. Also, 51.4 percent of parents say they would use the V-chip 
``often'' if they had one. 
</P>
<P>
	--Parents report their children spend, on average, 3.25 hours per  
day watching television or videos and 48.2 percent of the children 
have television sets in their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The national survey covered 1,269 parents of 2- to 17-year-olds  
and 303 of their children, ages 10 to 17. The margin of error was 
plus or minus 2.9 percent for the parent's survey and 5.7 percent 
for the children's survey.

<HEADLINE>  NYSE Boss, Colombia Rebel Boss Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- It was an unusual pitch by the chairman  
of the New York Stock Exchange, delivered in Colombia's steamy 
southern savannah to a senior commander of the hemisphere's oldest 
and largest leftist insurgency: 
</P>
<P>
	Make peace and expect great economic benefits from global  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very aggressive in trying to pursue international  
markets and opportunities,'' NYSE chairman Richard Grasso explained 
in an interview Saturday night at his Bogota hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggressive enough to fly deep into guerrilla-held territory in  
southern Colombia earlier Saturday and discuss the promise of 
capitalism for 90 minutes with Raul Reyes, head of the 
international commission of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was arranged by the government of Colombian President  
Andres Pastrana, who has been vigorously seeking international 
support for a peace initiative with rebels that has yet to show 
significant progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said he stressed the support of the world financial  
community for the peace process and tried to make Reyes appreciate 
``the opportunities capital markets will present to Colombia when a 
peace is achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also invited Reyes to visit Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``I extended to the comandante the opportunity to walk the floor  
of the exchange with me -- and he seemed reasonably intrigued,'' 
Grasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting FARC leaders to Wall Street could be difficult, though.  
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old guerrilla group is on the U.S. State  
Department's list of international terrorist groups; its chief 
revenue sources are ransom kidnappings and the ``taxing'' of 
illegal cocaine and heroin production. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Clinton administration broke off all contacts with  
the FARC after one of its factions killed three Americans who were 
in Colombia helping out an indigenous group. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso stressed that his visit was ``in the spirit of a private  
sector exchange'' but told reporters he nevertheless hoped it would 
``mark the beginning of a new relationship between the FARC and the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the FARC's peasant-based leadership say it is out of  
touch and needs to better grasp the international economy as it 
prepares for formal peace talks that are to begin July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC was formed 35 years ago by Communist guerrillas and  
controls some 40 percent of the Colombian countryside. Although 
ostensibly Marxist, its ideologists say they don't oppose foreign 
investment or free-market mechanisms as long as social justice is 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said he found Reyes ``knowledgeable of the process of  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE chairman was accompanied to Saturday's unusual meeting  
by Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo and government peace 
commissioner Victor G. Ricardo. 
</P>
<P>
	It is true that only two Colombian companies -- Banco Ganadero  
and Bancolombia -- trade on the NYSE, Grasso said when asked how the 
country had attracted the personal attention of the exchange's 
chief. President Pastrana was the key to the visit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm impressed with his vision. He is a merchant of change. He  
is really going to be a catalyst for a peaceful Colombia being a 
very important part of the economic bloc of the Americas and we 
want to be a partner with him,'' Grasso said.

	He said he also invited Reyes to visit Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``I extended to the comandante the opportunity to walk the floor  
of the exchange with me -- and he seemed reasonably intrigued,'' 
Grasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting FARC leaders to Wall Street could be difficult, though.  
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old guerrilla group is on the U.S. State  
Department's list of international terrorist groups; its chief 
revenue sources are ransom kidnappings and the ``taxing'' of 
illegal cocaine and heroin production. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the Clinton administration broke off all contacts with  
the FARC after one of its factions killed three Americans who were 
in Colombia helping out an indigenous group. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso stressed that his visit was ``in the spirit of a private  
sector exchange'' but told reporters he nevertheless hoped it would 
``mark the beginning of a new relationship between the FARC and the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the FARC's peasant-based leadership say it is out of  
touch and needs to better grasp the international economy as it 
prepares for formal peace talks that are to begin July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC was formed 35 years ago by Communist guerrillas and  
controls some 40 percent of the Colombian countryside. Although 
ostensibly Marxist, its ideologists say they don't oppose foreign 
investment or free-market mechanisms as long as social justice is 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said he found Reyes ``knowledgeable of the process of  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE chairman was accompanied to Saturday's unusual meeting  
by Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo and government peace 
commissioner Victor G. Ricardo. 
</P>
<P>
	It is true that only two Colombian companies -- Banco Ganadero  
and Bancolombia -- trade on the NYSE, Grasso said when asked how the 
country had attracted the personal attention of the exchange's 
chief. President Pastrana was the key to the visit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm impressed with his vision. He is a merchant of change. He  
is really going to be a catalyst for a peaceful Colombia being a 
very important part of the economic bloc of the Americas and we 
want to be a partner with him,'' Grasso said.

<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- It was an unusual pitch by the chairman  
of the New York Stock Exchange, delivered in Colombia's steamy 
southern savannah to a senior commander of the hemisphere's oldest 
and largest leftist insurgency: 
</P>
<P>
	Make peace and expect great economic benefits from global  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very aggressive in trying to pursue international  
markets and opportunities,'' NYSE chairman Richard Grasso explained 
in an interview Saturday night at his Bogota hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggressive enough to fly deep into guerrilla-held territory in  
southern Colombia earlier Saturday and discuss the promise of 
capitalism for 90 minutes with Raul Reyes, head of the 
international commission of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was arranged by the government of Colombian President  
Andres Pastrana, who has been vigorously seeking international 
support for a peace initiative with rebels that has yet to show 
significant progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso said he stressed the support of the world financial  
community for the peace process and tried to make Reyes appreciate 
``the opportunities capital markets will present to Colombia when a 
peace is achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also invited Reyes to visit Wall Street.
