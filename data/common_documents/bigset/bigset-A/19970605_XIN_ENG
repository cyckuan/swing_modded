CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Swimmer Scott Miller, Olympic
silver medalist, was kicked out of the Australian Institute of
Sports (AIS) for his failure to meet the training commitment, AIS
director said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
John Boultbee said he had informed Miller of the decision after
consultation with head coach Don Talbot and ordered Miller to pack
up his belongs because "this isn't the place for you."
</P>
<P>
Miller who won the 100-meter butterfly silver medal in Atlanta,
had missed many of the sessions at the team camp in Canberra last
week.
</P>
<P>
Miller explained that he had informed the AIS that his
sponsorship commitments would take up some of his time and he
would not participate in a full training program because of an
injury to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian swimming officials said Miller was still in
the Australian team for the Pan Pacific championships in Fukuoka,
Japan, from August 12-15.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Military Intervention in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the United
Nations Kofi Annan said in London today that he hoped the current
crisis in Sierra Leone could be resolved by negotiations, but he
refused to rule out a military intervention in the
conflict-stricken western African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after talks with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, Annan said that he preferred a peaceful
solution to the stand-off between Sierra Leone armed forces and
Nigerian troops trying to restore the ousted Sierra Leone
president.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, I would prefer negotiations. It must be clear to the
coup leaders that they don't have the support of the people, they
don't have the support of their neighbors, they don't have the
support of the region and they don't have the support of the
international community," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"How they expect to survive I do not know. I wish they would be
sensible and cut their losses and walk away," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a multinational armed force could be sent to
Sierra Leone, the U.N. chief said, "If use of force becomes a last
resort and is inevitable, it may have to come to that."
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting between Annan and Cook, they also
exchanged views on the reforms of the United Nations and other
international issues.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up 1.2 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
increased by 1.2 percent in April, the third rise in four months,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the factory orders increase to a
seasonally adjusted 323.9 billion dollars in the month. The gain
followed a 1.3 percent drop in March and increases of 0.4 percent
in February and 2.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last three or
more years -- were up by 1.3 percent. There was a 1 percent rise
in non-durable goods, the first increase in three months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of manufactured goods, a measure of current
production, also increased by 1.2 percent in April, the largest in
a year. It resulted in a 0.3 percent decline in the backlog of
unfilled orders, the second consecutive drop and same as in March.
</P>
<P>
The report said that new orders for volatile transportation
equipment rose by 3.4 percent, the first increase since January.
Orders for industrial machinery rose 2.7 percent, the fifth
consecutive increase.
</P>
<P>
However, a slump in communications equipment and electronic
components pulled orders for electronic and electrical equipment
5.7 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
The greatest strength in non-durable goods was registered by
chemicals, apparel and paper products
</P>
<P>
Factory orders in the U.S. are closely followed by economists
as a barometer of future production. If production fails to keep
up with the pace of new orders, it's a sign that inflationary
bottlenecks could be developing in the production pipeline.

DAMASCUS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran blanked Kirghizstan 7-0 in
its second game in Group two of the Asian World Cup qualifying
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bagheri Karim scored the opener in the 36th minute to help Iran

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Survives No Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
survived an opposition-proposed no confidence vote in parliament
today, with a deal with the country's central bank Bundesbank on
gold and US dollar reserves revaluation still pending.
</P>
<P>
Waigel received 328 votes in favor of his remaining in office,
compared to 311 against.
</P>
<P>
The vote came after Chancellor Helmut Kohl made a long
statement defending him, who last month proposed a bill to raise
the book value of the Bundesbank's 95 million fine ounces of gold
to 60 percent of the current market price from the 25 percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
Waigel's plan has pulled the government and the Bundesbank in a
bitter standoff. The German finance minister has been battling to
fill a budget gap of up to 29 billion marks (16.82 billion US
dollars) this year and at least 15 billion marks (8.7 billion
dollars) in 1998 to qualify Germany for the European single
currency, the euro, which was planned to be launched from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kohl in the statement today warned that the delay of the euro
would lead to Deutschmark appreciation, thus hindering economic
growth and aggravating the country's record unemployment. He vowed
to do everything to meet the strict budget deficit and debt limits
needed to make Germany one of the first euro member countries in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany has failed to meet the criteria in recent years and
most analysts believe it will fail again this year. The main
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) called for delaying euro
introduction. Opinion polls showed two-thirds of German people
were against giving up mark for euro.
</P>
<P>
Waigel's gold revaluation plan could yield a 20 billion mark
(11.6 billion dollar) windfall for the government. However, the
Bundesbank intended to begin paying extra gold revenue to Bonn
from 1999, instead of 1997 as initially demanded by Bonn, nor 1998
as Waigel said he now wanted.
</P>
<P>
Would gold proceeds transfer to Bonn not start from 1997, the
gold revaluation plan would do little help to Bonn in its battle
for joining the euro in 1999.
</P>
<P>
While admitting an accord with the Bundesbank was still
pending, Waigel said earlier today that he would raise new revenue
by speeding up share sales of the state-owned Telecom company and
impose a spending freeze in a bid to ease the budget pressure this
year.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Britain Unlikely to Join EMU in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said today that Britain would probably not be among the first wave
of countries joining European Monetary Union (EMU), which is
scheduled for 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We must keep our options open," he told the Commons. It would
be better for EMU not to go ahead at all than for it to start with
"fudged" convergence criteria, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is highly unlikely that Britain would want to join the
first wave of monetary union," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Chancellor Gordon Brown said the government's
position on a single European currency was unchanged. It would
maintain its "wait-and-see" stance while acknowledging there were
big obstacles to joining in the first round, he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Brown unveiled a new employment plan for Europe,
promising to make it a central theme of London's presidency of the
European Union next year.
</P>
<P>
His three-point plan aims to cut unemployment and increase
employment opportunities and labor market flexibility across
Europe.

<HEADLINE> OAU Reiterates Support for Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd summit of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) ended here today after adopting a
declaration calling for a peaceful solution to the dispute
between Libya and the west.
</P>
<P>
Libya and the United States, Britain and France should "settle
their differences by peaceful means, through dialogue,
negotiation and legal procedures", said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It warned against any threats to the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and the security of any U.N. member states during the
course of seeking solutions to disputes.
</P>
<P>
Libya and the three western powers have been locked in a
dispute over the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The
western countries accused Libya of being behind the bombing and
demanded the handover of two suspected Libyan nationals, a
request rejected by Libya.
</P>
<P>
"Libya had found it impossible to extradite its two nationals
allegedly implicated in the bombing," the declaration said.
"Libya had fully met the requirements demanded by the un security
council as contained in resolution 731."
</P>
<P>
The declaration noted that the OAU is willing to "cooperate
fully" with Libya in any regional or international effort aimed
at resolving the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We, regretting the continued sanctions imposed on the
country, expressed our deep concern over the human and material
deprivations to which the Libyan people have been subjected," the
African leaders said.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under air sanctions imposed by the U.N.to force
the north African country to surrender.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to emphasize that these obnoxious sanctions affect
not only the Libyan people, but also the neighboring countries as
well as African workers from other countries of the continent,"
the declaration said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu presented today his plan on the Israeli-Palestinian
final settlement, which was immediately rejected by the Palestinian
side.
</P>
<P>
The plan, in which Netanyahu envisions retaining strategic
borders, settlements, water resources and key roads, was presented
to the inner cabinet in its second meeting in the past days to
discuss arrangements for the final-status talks with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet, which includes Foreign Minister David Levy
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, discussed the issue for
the first time last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu's plan, Israel will keep most of the
Jewish settlements scattered in the Palestinian territories of
West Bank and Gaza Strip. It will also retain control over
the Jordan River, strategic borders in the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
Israel will build a Greater Jerusalem whose boundaries are
to be extended in all directions: to Maaleh Adumim settlement
in the east and to Gush Etzion settlement in the south.
The Jerusalem Corridor under Israeli control will link Greater
Jerusalem westward to the coastal plain in the west.
</P>
<P>
In general, Israel intends to create security belts in
areas along the Green Line, or the border until the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
But the Prime Minister's Office said Israel was not
committed to any map on the final arrangements, and the plan
presented by Netanyahu was neither an opening nor a closing
position in future final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The plan is almost identical to the detailed map published
by Hebrew dailies last Thursday, which marked the borders,
roads and settlements that will be under Israeli control in
the final settlement. The map showed that the PNA will get
about 40 percent of the territories, much less than the 90
percent it has required.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu apparently formulated the plan after taking into
consideration of the security map presented to the first inner
cabinet meeting by the security establishment, which recommended
retaining control over all the strategic areas in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to coalition lawmakers Tuesday in the Knesset
(Parliament), Netanyahu said he believed that his government
would reach a final settlement with the PNA. He added such
agreement would be a package deal which the public would be
able to unite behind.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current difficulties in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, Netanyahu said the final-status talks could be
resumed in the near future. The peace talks have been
deadlocked since Israel began building the controversial Har
Homa settlement in East Jerusalem late March.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Israel would not allow the redivision of
Jerusalem, not return to the 1967 borders and not agree to
the influx of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Following the inner cabinet discussion, Netanyahu said he
would bring his plan for the final settlement to the full
cabinet and the Knesset for debate and approval.
</P>
<P>
As before, the Palestinian side swiftly rejected the
Netanyahu plan on the final settlement. Ahmed Tibi, adviser to
PNA President Yasser Arafat, said the plan was a non-starter,
because it did not represent peace but confrontation. He said
Israel would never succeed in imposing conditions on the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is hoping to establish an independent Palestinian
state on the most of West Bank and Gaza Strip with East
Jerusalem as its capital in the final settlement.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Lead Fight Against Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- British Environment Minister Michael
Meacher said today his government will take a tough position and
lead the fight against global warming.
</P>
<P>
"We will take the hard decisions necessary to put the UK truly
at the forefront in tackling climate change. This government will
take the lead in the fight against global warming," Meacher said
at a conference on the climate crisis organized by the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
A world summit on environment and global warming will be held
in the Japanese city of Kyoto in December to agree on targets for
cutting emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide which
warm the atmosphere and are widely blamed for changing the
climate.
</P>
<P>
The WWF says climate change is a greatest threat to species and
habitats worldwide and is urging governments to reduce emissions
of greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has agreed in principle to a cut of 15
percent by 2010 but has so far enacted measures that would only
bring about a 10 percent cut.
</P>
<P>
Meacher pledged his government was pushing for a 20 percent
reduction by 2010 but would not blaze a trail if others refused to
follow.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the business of picking up the tab for everyone
else and we are not offering more for others to do less," Meacher
said.

<HEADLINE> VAT Compliance Increased in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
lUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has
recorded an increase in Vvalue Added Tax (VAT) compliance following the
introduction of a 0.5 percent penalty for delayed payments.
</P>
<P>
ZRA Public Relations ,Manager Michael Mwape, who confirmed the
increase in compliance for April, said it is not easy to give the
specific number of companies that have been penalized because ZRA is
still monitoring the new penalty, according to the Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The penalty introduced on April 1 this year is charged on those
companies that make their VAT return submissions on time but without
making the payment.
</P>
<P>
Mwape said that to encourage compliance, the penalty is charged
everday that payment is overdue.
</P>
<P>
With this new penalty, there have been a significant reduction in
unaccompanied submissions, said Mwape.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Protests Israel over Civilian Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon lodged today a complaint to
an international panel monitoring cease-fire in south Lebanon over
civilian casualties in mine blasts in the Western Beqaa, Beirut
Foreign Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Lebanon accused the Israeli occupation
forces of targeting civilians, thus violating a cease-fire
understanding the two sides reached in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanese security sources reported that four mines,
planted by the Israelis on the main road between the towns of
Zilaya and Qalya near the edge of the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone", exploded as a civilian pickup was passing by.
</P>
<P>
The blasts, which took place at 9:30 a.m. (0630 GMT), led to
the killing of the driver and the injury of two passengers.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected that the mines were detonated by remote
control, according to the anonymous security sources.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee, set up following a 17-day Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon in April 1996 and on the basis of the
cease-fire understanding to comprise representatives from France,
Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States, was to look into
complaints over cease-fire violations.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the U.S. and France, the cease-fire understanding
bars the fighting sides from targeting civilians or launching
operations from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces fired heavy artilleries sporadically
at no-man's areas opposite the buffer zone over the night
and during the daytime without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese resistance guerrillas fired back with mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
The two sides' trading fire constitutes a daily scene in
south Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Samba, Regional Director for Africa of the World

He said, "Unfortunately, in Africa, cigarettes are sold
without restrictions or mandatory warning on the attendant health
hazards. No mention is made of the different ingredients and

cigarettes."

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Gives Up 55-Cent Sandwiches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The McDonald's Corporation
announced late Tuesday that it was canceling all lunch and dinner
promotions built around discounting sandwiches to 55 cents under
the pressure from among its franchisees.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the announcement
signaled unusual disarray in the marketing plans of McDonald's,
the world's leader in fast food. Just last week, the company
confirmed that it would not begin a program to offer free food to
diners who had not been served within 55 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The promotion made its debut with Big Mac hamburgers being sold
for 55 cents along with any order of fries and a drink. In late
May, the quarter-pound cheeseburger replaced the Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
But many consumers found it difficult to get the 55-cent
hamburger and were disappointed that the savings were often minor
compared with other value packages on the menu of McDonald's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many franchisees said the promotion was not
generating enough new business to cover the costs. The package was
a money-loser for them.
</P>
<P>
Still the new announcement surprised some franchisees who had
been among the company's harshest critics in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's reported recently that sales at restaurants opened
at least a year rose in the first quarter of this year. It said
that today's cancellation was "a midcourse correction" in Campaign
55, which would continue in the form of breakfast My Size meals,
which offer various combinations of food built around the 55-cent
theme.

HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd summit of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) today issued a declaration, stressing the
urgency for industrialization on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said African leaders decided to "redouble
efforts to promote sustainable industrial developments to overcome
major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in
the global market place".
</P>
<P>
"Without sustainable industrial development, African economies
will be condemned to persistent economic crisis, dependence on
humanitarian relief and deepening poverty, despair and political
unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability," said
the declaration, issued at the end of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on OAU member states and the regional
economic communities with the full involvement of the African
private sector and with the technical support of international
organizations, to elaborate national and regional plans of action
for industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The summit approved the creation of a Patron Group of Africa's
industrialization, consisting of five heads of state and government.

<HEADLINE> Africa Gears up for Fight Against Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today reaffirmed
their "unflagging resolve" to prevent the outbreak of malaria which
claims 4,200 lives every day on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, ending their 33rd summit here, issued a declaration
which considers malaria control in Africa as one of the continent's
priority programs.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said African countries "support fully the
implementation of the Global and Regional Strategy and approaches
recommended by the World Health Organization."
</P>
<P>
African countries, the declaration said, will implement well
planned and coordinated malaria control programs involving
individuals, families, communities, institutions, relevant
government ministries, and other public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on African countries to allocate
sufficient human, financial and material resources, and mobilize
other local resources including resources from non-governmental and
private and civil sectors, for the sustained prevention and control
of malaria in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to mobilize additional external
resources from international agencies, governmental and
non-governmental agencies, foundations and industrial and commercial
enterprises to support national and commercial action to control
malaria and surveillance to prevent epidemics and sustain the
progress already made, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It suggested the following actions:
</P>
<P>
-- Give full political support to actions directed towards
sustainable malaria preventioan and control as an urgent priority;
</P>
<P>
-- Further develop and implement plans for malaria prevention
and control, including incorporation into development projects based
on environmental and health impact assessments;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop strong community based programs to mobilize active
community participation for malaria prevention and control;
</P>
<P>
-- Promote and support micro-financing schemes, especially for
women, to initiate income generating projects aimed at basic
environmental and household improvements;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop mechanisms that will facilitate and ensure well
coordinated multisectoral action to reduce substantially the burden
of malaria and promote inter-country collaboration and coordination
of efforts; and
</P>
<P>
-- Promote basic and operational research to ensure that new
tools, including vaccines, are made available without delay and
existing ones are used in the most cost-effective and sustainable
manner.

<HEADLINE> Advisors Criticize Bonn's Gold Revaluation, Telekom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Council of Economic Experts
has criticized government plans to revaluate Bundesbank gold
reserves and to speed up sale of the state-owned Telecom company
in efforts to qualify for the single European currency euro.
</P>
<P>
The council, which advises the German government, said in the
letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl dated May 23 and published today
that it "regards this action as inappropriate for remedying the
undesirable developments in public finances."
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel wanted to raise the book
value of Bundesbank's 95 million fine ounces of gold to 60 percent
of the current market price from the 25 percent at present,
expecting to yield a 20 billion mark (11.6 billion US dollar)
windfall for the government.
</P>
<P>
Waigel has been battling to fill a budget gap of up to 29
billion marks (16.82 billion dollars) this year and at least 15
billion marks (8.7 billion dollars) in 1998 so that Germany can
meet the strict budget deficit and debt limits required for euro
membership and can join euro in the year of 1999 when the single
currency is due to be launched.
</P>
<P>
Admitting an accord with the Bundesbank was still pending,
Waigel also said earlier today that he would raise new revenue by
speeding up the sale of shares of the state-owned Telecom in a bid
to ease the budget pressure this year.
</P>
<P>
Germany has failed to meet the criteria for euro membership
over recent years and most analysts believe it will fail again in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Experts said in its letter that the
gold revaluation plan gave the impression that Bonn was using
"creative accounting" to qualify for joining euro.
</P>
<P>
This also "casts a shadow over the independence and credibility
of the Bundesbank," said the letter, warning that it would be
difficult for the future European central bank to reject political
influence over monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The experts also feared that the move would encourage
scepticism over euro. Opinion polls show about two-thirds of
German people are against giving up mark for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to the letter, Waigel defended his plan, noting
that Germany was facing "extraordinary overall economic factors"
including sharply declined tax revenues. He also stressed that the
extra gold proceeds would be used to reduce the state's 833
billion mark (483.14 billion dollar) overall debt burden.

<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
arrived back in Beijing today after an official goodwill visit to
the three South Pacific countries of Australia, Western Samoa and
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The visit shows that China enjoys good relations with the three
countries and that there is a solid foundation and bright
prospects of further developing mutually beneficial cooperation in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
Sino-Australian and Sino-New Zealand diplomatic relations. It also
marks the 22nd anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Chinese government delegation was warmly
welcomed by the governments and peoples of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu held talks and reached wide-ranging understanding with
leaders of the three nations on bilateral relations, especially on
trade and economic cooperation and international issues of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three countries said they wanted to make joint
efforts with China to promote mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During their visits, the delegation also met local government
leaders, businessmen and representatives of overseas Chinese and
Chinese nationals studying or working in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
They visited factories, farms and scientific research
institutions and saw the economic achievements made by the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
The importance the three governments attaches to the
development of their relations with China and the deep affection
the peoples of the three countries hold for Chinese people made a
deep impression on the delegates.
</P>
<P>
It is safe to say that the visit has helped enhance high-level
contacts, strengthen mutual understanding, promote mutually
beneficial cooperation and the overall development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region maintains a good momentum for political
stability and economic vitality. China and the three countries,
all Asian-Pacific countries, have wide-ranging common interests
and share the same or similar views on many important world issues.
</P>
<P>
Australia, New Zealand and Western Samoa have actively
participated and promoted cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region
and have been playing important roles in world and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of mutual respect and equality, China and the
three countries have held friendly consultations and dialogues on
bilateral relations and regional and world issues, and have
enjoyed friendly cooperation within global and regional
organizations, including the United Nations and the Asian and
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
The three countries all support China in its bid to join the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Zhu and the leaders of the three countries
said that to further strengthen friendly and mutually beneficial
cooperation between their countries is not only in the fundamental
interests of their peoples, but also of great importance to
safeguarding peace and stability and promoting economic prosperity
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three countries said that they believe the
vigorous economic development of China will not pose any threat to
any country and a strong and prosperous China will make a greater
contribution to peace and development in the Asian Pacific region
and the world at large.

Leaders of the three countries also appreciated the
implementation of the policies of "one country, two systems,"
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong with a high degree of
autonomy" and "maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability" after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese said that they believe economic and trade
cooperation between Hong Kong and the three countries will have a
much greater development in the future.
</P>
<P>
One the question of Taiwan, leaders of the three nations
reaffirmed their adherence to the one-China policy and their
commitment not to establish official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side appreciated the stand the three countries have
taken on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of the visit was on promoting bilateral economic
and trade. The Chinese side is happy to see that China has become
Australia's fifth largest and New Zealand's seventh largest
trading partner, as well as the biggest purchaser of wool from the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand have become China's two largest
investment destinations. Channar Iron Ore of Australia and a tree
farm in New Zealand, both joint ventures run with China, have made
good profits.
</P>
<P>
Economic and technological cooperation between China and
Western Samoa have also generated clear social benefits.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Chinese delegation held broad exchanges
of view with the leaders of the three countries on expanding
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.

China, Australia and New Zealand unanimously agreed to
strengthen the Sino-Australian and Sino-New Zealand joint
committee on trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side reached consensus with the governments of
Australia and New Zealand on enhancing cooperation in mining, iron
and steel, energy, finance, insurance, agriculture, animal
husbandry, forestry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
China and West Samoa agreed to expand economic and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises from China and Australia signed two documents to
jointly develop reduced iron.
</P>
<P>
All of this will undoubtedly help relations between China and
the three countries maintain long-term, stable and sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
China's economy complements those of Australia and New Zealand
and there is great potential for cooperation between China and the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand are two developed countries with rich
natural resources and strengths in certain economic fields.
</P>
<P>
China has a long-term need for many of their products, such as
iron ore, timber and wool. Meanwhile, mechanical, electronic and
textile products from China, known for their low price and good
quality, are well-regarded by the peoples of Australia, New
Zealand and Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest developing country in the world. Its
economic development is characterized by high growth and low
inflation and an increasing openness to the outside world. These
are favorable conditions for deepening and expanding economic and
trade cooperation with the three nations.
</P>
<P>
The great potential for bilateral cooperation will be tapped
more speedily and comprehensively as long as we grasp
opportunities and try to find new areas and ways of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government delegation extends heartfelt gratitude
to the governments and peoples of the three countries for their
careful arrangements and efforts in making the visit a success.
</P>
<P>
We believe that through common effort, the friendly, mutually
beneficial cooperative relationship between China and Australia,
New Zealand and Western Samoa will move up to a new and higher
level in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Tuesday
announced the extension of its limited sanctions imposed on Nigeria
for another six months, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by EU foreign ministers at a meeting in
Brussel, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Though it confirmed "certain positive signs from the government",
the meeting decided that the human rights situation in Nigeria has not
improved much to warrant a rescission of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed sanctions on Nigeria in the wake of the hanging of
author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists by the Nigerian
government for murdur in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include a ban on the issuance of visas to the
Nigerian military leaders and their families, an arms embargo as
well as a freeze on sports links with any EU members.

LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Immigration Service said
today it has repatriated 23 Asian and European prostitutes found here
to their own countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Assistant Comptroller-General of Immigration Alhaji
Husain Mahuta, the women were arrested in various night clubs in Lagos
where "they pretended to be working as performing artistes.
</P>
<P>
"Those repatriated are single ladies who came to Nigeria under the
pretence that they are performing artistes being invited by club
owners and hotellers," he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Nigeria Immigration Service has warned night
club owners and hotellers of the consequences of allowing their
property to be used by foreign prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
"This type of attitude will no longer be allowed. It is not good
for the country's image," Mahatu said, adding that anyone caught would
be punished according to the law.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Parliament Urges Cut of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The foreign affairs committee of
Lebanon's parliament called today on all Arab countries to sever
their economic ties with Turkey because of the current Turkish
incursion in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member committee also denounced what it called a
Turkish-Israeli coalition sponsored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that the committee held a meeting in
presence of Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz to discuss the
latest developments in the Middle East "in light of the
Turkish-Israeli coalition" sponsored by the U.S. and its dangerous
reaction.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the coalition was aimed at what it
called getting water and territory and imposing blockade upon
Iraq, Syria and Lebanon as well as other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The document, issued at the end of the meeting, noted that the
Turkish-Israeli coalition wants to achieve these goals "by the
Turkish incursion into northern Iraq and by the Israeli military
escalation in south Lebanon and an attempt to impose a solution
of surrender" upon the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The committee also denounces the Turkish incursion into
northern Iraq because it threatens the Arab national security
and because the means which Turkey is using has gone beyond the
limit of solving the Kurdish problem to the extent of inflaming
a powder barrel in the region," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops have intruded northern Iraq
since mid-May at the pretext of eliminating members of the
separatist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
On the question of convening a regional economic conference,
which is due in Doha, Qatar, in November, the committee called
for an Arab economic conference "in order to foil the plot of
establishing a Middle East market" with an Israeli domination in
it.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar GDP Increases by 6.3 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 6.3 percent last year, as against 3.7 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in the town of Zanzibar today by Minister
of State in the President's Office Ali Juma Shamhuna at the
1997/98 development plan budget session of the House of
Representatives of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Shamhuna told the house that the growth in economy last year
was achieved despite the existence of many problems including the
long dry spell and "silent sanctions", probably referring to the
suspension of aid by a number of donor countries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the GDP growth to the increase in
clove production as well as the contribution from other economic
sectors which led to the increase in local resources.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar last year recorded good clove yield ever in the past
few years, in which 10,105 tons were harvested.
</P>
<P>
The minister also outlined measures to boost the economy of
Zanzibar which include the setting up of a conducive environment
for investors, the improvement of telecommunications,
communications network and consolidation of the tourism sector.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Australia Firms Sign Offset Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and an Australian
company signed a memorandum of understanding today within the
framework of a Kuwaiti Offset Program under which the company is
obligated to invest 4.5 million U.S. dollars in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Aerospace-Australia Company signed the agreement with the
Kuwaiti Finance Ministry after winning a contract to sell armored
vehicles Shorland S600 worth 15 million dollars to Kuwait, the
official Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait started implementing the Offset Program in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The program stipulates that foreign companies which win
contract worth more than 1 million Kuwaiti dinars (3.3
million U.S. dollars) have to invest a sum of money equaling 30
percent of the contract value in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Offset Program mainly applies to defense contracts, and
foreign defense contractors are able to set up joint ventures
with Kuwaiti nationals in third countries.
</P>
<P>
Mazen Madoh, director of Offset Department in Kuwaiti Finance
Ministry said that up to now 18 companies from the United States,
Britain, France, Japan, Russia, Norway and Australia have been
already committed to the Offset Program with 1.5-billion-dollar
investment obligations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Offset Program consists of four stages, with the
signing of a contract as the first, concluding a memorandum as
the second, the approval of the idea of the project presented by
foreign companies as the third and approval of the final work
plan as the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The contract with Aerospace-Australia is on the second phase.
</P>
<P>
So far eight projects have been finally approved and carried
out in Kuwait under the program. The projects include an
aluminium factory, an academic and vocational education school,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Sound Record Underpins Credit Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Credit Rating Agency
(IBCA) today assigned a long-term foreign currency rating of BBB-
(BBB minus) to all senior, unsecured debt issues of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
This investment grade rating applies to over 50 billion US
dollars of public and publicly guaranteed foreign currency debt
and will set a ceiling for IBCA rated banks and corporation in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IBCA also issued a long-term local currency rating of A in
recognition of Indonesia's strong fiscal position and low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The agency said, "Indonesia has an outstanding record of
economic development: real GDP growth has averaged 7 percent annum
over the last 25 years, putting it among the High Performing Asian
Economies."
</P>
<P>
"Per capita GDP has risen over ten-fold from less than 100 US
dollars in 1970 to 1,132 US dollars in 1996, elevating the country
to lower middle income status," it added.
</P>
<P>
Steadfast adherence to sound macro-economic policy management,
complemented by structural adjustment, has been the key to
Indonesia's success, according to the IBCA.
</P>
<P>
However, the IBCA said that the country's external debts act as
major constraint on the rating.
</P>
<P>
Although the continuity of economic policy in Indonesia does
not appear to be under threat, the lack of transparency is a
growing source of uncertainty, it added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Peace Activists Hold Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian peace
activists held a joint peace march this afternoon toward the
site of the Har Homa Jewish settlement to mark the 30th
anniversary of the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem since
1967.
</P>
<P>
At the initiative of the Israeli Peace Bloc, Gush Shalom,
Israeli peace activists set out from inside the Jewish state and
march to the site while Palestinians proceeded simultaneously
from the Palestinian protest tent camp south of the site. The two
processions met at the site to symbolically show their
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Gush Shalom said, in a statement distributed to the press here,
that the timing of the march was chosen both because of its
proximity to the 30th anniversary of East Jerusalem's occupation
by the Israeli army, and the official Israeli "Jerusalem Day," in
which religious nationalists habitually hold provocative rallies
in East Jerusalem to mark the so-called "unification" of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"It is the opinion of Gush Shalom, as of other Israeli peace
movements, that this 'unification' is nothing but a wafer-thin
myth, an euphemism for an oppressive military occupation rule
over the 180,000 Palestinian inhabitants," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Israeli occupation rule is
manifested in many forms.
</P>
<P>
Israel has confiscated Palestinian lands widely and
constructed on the soil neighborhoods for the Jews only.
</P>
<P>
The prohibition on Arab construction in East Jerusalem still
takes effect despite numerous statements on the issue published
by the Netanyahu government in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Arab houses are often demolished by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
Extreme-right settlers penetrate into Arab neighborhoods,
using various legal tricks and government-financed "sales," and
have led to what the statement called the creation of armed
settler enclaves.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Interior Ministry have expelled outright thousands
of Palestinian Jerusalemites, whose right of residence is denied
by the ministry on various pretexts.
</P>
<P>
"All of these measures, taken together, amount to nothing
less than a policy of ethnic cleansing, which can only lead to a
total confrontation between the two peoples, in Jerusalem and
elsewhere," declared Gush Shalom in the statement.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma today stressed that all development activities to
be undertaken should consider environment conservation.
</P>
<P>
In his message to mark the World Environment Day today, Juma
said history shows that development activities which were carried
out without considering their impacts to the environment are
endangering the lives of living things including the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will take all possible measures to
avert environmental problems to be caused by the social and
economic development undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the steps to be taken includes the
strengthening of the Environmental Impact Assessment Unit which
is under his office as well as investing more on environmental
conservation initiatives.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said people's participation in protecting the
environment is very essential in making the government efforts a
success.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask every individual
to participate fully in environmental issues. Let us plant trees.
Let us not pollute water sources. Let us stop invading government
conservation areas, illegal fishing and any other activities that
endanger our environment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the World Environment Day this year is
being marked under the theme "for life for earth", with an aim to
remind the people on the importance of conserving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
He said environmental degradation is a result of improper land
use, the use of chemicals, illegal fishing, deforestation and
many other environmental unfriendly activities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Ask FEC to Ban "Soft Money" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The White House confirmed U.S.
President Bill Clinton plans to appeal directly to the Federal
Election Commission to outlaw the limitless contributions to
political parties known as "soft money."
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton decided
to pursue action through the FEC after deciding there is now
virtually no chance Congress will meet the challenge in his State
of the Union speech for enacting campaign finance reform
legislation on its own before July 4.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton "would love for it to (meet the July 4
deadline), but as a practical matter that won't happen."
</P>
<P>
Federal law limits political contributions by groups and
individuals to candidates, but donors found a major loophole known
as "soft money" by making their contributions through their
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "soft money" given to parties is limited to
"party-building" purposes, but Democrats and Republicans have
stretched the limits of that definition to include virtually a
full array of activities benefiting individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton would base his FEC appeal on the grounds
that FEC definitions following the 1974 campaign finance reforms
"opened the loophole for soft money that then expanded
significantly throughout the '70s and '80s, and so it's within the
power of the commission to close the loophole."

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, London Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets showed
gains today, but London slipped into the minus column as Wall
Street made a weak start.
</P>
<P>
British shares ended a choppy session mixed amid continued
uncertainty about possible interest rate hikes. Fears that rates
could be tightened by both the U.S. and British central banks in
the near term kept many participants out of the market. The
FTSE-100 index closed 0.7 of a point lower to 4,557.1.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended low-volume bourse trade 1
percent higher. The market lacked impetus to forge more
significant gains and continued to track late gains in electronic
trade from Tuesday. The DAX index closed at 3,661.84, up 36.10
points.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse finished in positive ground for the third
straight session this week since the Socialists came to power. The
market was enjoying a honeymoon period with the left and bargain
hunting helped support prices. The CAC-40 index closed up 10.88
points to 2,635.37.

<HEADLINE> European Hotel Industry Shake-Up Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The European hotel industry will be
shaken up by mergers and joint ventures in the next few years as
large international hotel chains vie to increase their presence,
said a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy levels at European hotels rose by 2 percent last year
to 72.2 percent, according to the Hotel Industry Benchmark Survey
1997.
</P>
<P>
London enjoyed the highest average occupancy levels of 84.3
percent. Hotels in Rome, with marginally lower occupancy rates,
were the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
Average revenue per room in Rome rose by 22 percent to 185.13
Deutsche marks (some 107 US dollars), due to a rise in tourism, a
lack of new hotels and a strengthening of the lira against the
mark.
</P>
<P>
Large international hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton
Hotel Corporation and Inter-Continental, will target regional and
large national players while continuing to acquire small European
groups.
</P>
<P>
Consolidation is also likely in the mid-market sector as
smaller groups merge or collaborate in join ventures, in order to
expand nationally and reduce overheads, said Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm, which surveyed 1,000 hotels of three-star
standard and above.
</P>
<P>
Europe received half the world's international tourism
expenditure last year but the health of its hotel industry varied
widely between countries.
</P>
<P>
Difficult economic conditions continued to affect hotels in
France and Germany. Occupancy levels in Paris were static while
those in Berlin and Frankfurt fell back last year compared to
1995, the report said.

ANKARA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Four workers today were killed and
another injured in a powerful explosion in a tanker in Istanbul,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the blast, which occurred at 14:55
local time (11:55 GMT), caused fire in an empty 75,366-tonne

the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The injured worker was sent to a nearby hospital for
treatment, said the agency.

It added that other workers in the tanker had been transferred
to the place of security in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not report the reason why the blast
occurred in the tanker.
</P>
<P>
On February 13, at least 20 fire fighters got injured when
extinguishing a fire caused by the explosion in an empty
307-meter-long petrol tanker in the same area of Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Saudi Arabia to Continue Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 4 (Xinhua) - Jordan and Saudi Arabia expressed here
today their willingness to ensure the continuity of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This came after Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud met with
King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali during his two-day visit which ended today.
</P>
<P>
The visit was against the backdrop that the U.S. and Egypt
failed to reactivate the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister voiced appreciation over the "advanced
level" of cooperative relations between Amman and Riyadh and
expressed gratitude for Saudi support to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides shared identical views that peace is an
international strategy and that it was Israel that hindered the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed means to promote bilateral ties,
and regional and international issues of mutual concern,
particularly inter-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia suffered setbacks
during the Gulf Crisis as Jordan sided with Iraq. About 3 million
Jordanians working in Saudi Arabia were then driven out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
After the crisis, Jordan distanced itself from Iraq in order to
end international isolation. Its ties with Saudi Arabia also began
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
Now Saudi Arabia is the kingdom's second largest Arab trade
partner after Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported some 184 million
U.S. dollars worth of goods to Saudi Arabia, up from about 99
million in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Legislators to Push Stronger TV Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Commerce
Committee chairman, John McCain, intends to move ahead with a new
bill that would force stronger TV program ratings.
</P>
<P>
The bill by Senator Dan Coats would forbid the Federal
Communications Commission to renew TV stations' licenses unless
they provide detailed information about a program's sexual and
violent content. The bill does not recommend a particular ratings
system.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 19-1 to send to
the Senate a bill that would either require stronger ratings or
ban violent shows when children are likely to be watching.
</P>
<P>
Now McCain is planning for the committee to vote on Coats' bill
June 18 -- two days before the FCC holds its first hearing on the
effectiveness of the TV industry's rating system, which took
effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
McCain was meeting with network and cable representatives
Wednesday to underscore his seriousness about industry action.
</P>
<P>
Critics, including lawmakers, child-advocacy groups, the
National Parent Teacher Association and the medical community, say
the existing six-tier, age-based ratings system doesn't provide
parents with enough information to protect their children from
excessive violence, sex and language.
</P>
<P>
They want more-detailed ratings that would give specific
information about the amount and intensity of such content in each
program.
</P>
<P>
The FCC is reviewing the ratings system. If the FCC finds the
system is unsuitable, it can appoint an independent advisory board
to create a new system. But the government cannot require its use.

on the economy in the medium- to long-term time-frame, a

</P>
<P>
Benjamin Mweene, Secretary to the Treasury in the Ministry of

He said that although the structural adjustment program has

<P>
The computable model will also be used to follow the evolution
of the economy in response to policy changes and thus lead to an
improvement in the country's economic management process, said
Mweene.
</P>
<P>
Mweene noted that the model will enrich policy debate and
contribute to a much wider search for options in the

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Botswana will present a new
plan to a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
meeting in Zimbabwe next week, a top Botswanan official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal is for limited and controlled trade in
stockpiled ivory with one buyer, Botswana's Commerce and Industry
Minister George Kgoroba told a press conference in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
"Funds from the trade will be used to establish wildlife
management programs that will eventually include culling,"
Kgoroba said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana reportedly wants to sell 25 tons of stockpiled ivory.
It says that a Japanese buyer has been identified and has agreed
not to re-export the ivory or products made from it.
</P>
<P>
According to Botswana wildlife officials, the country's
elephant population totaled 79,000 in 1995, with an annual
growth of five percent.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's Deputy Director of Wildlife Joseph Matlhare said
that his country wants only to reduce its stockpile of ivory.
"There will be no killing to build up the stockpile," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
For now, in addition to Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia also
seek a partial lifting of the 1989 ban on ivory trade.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Balking Supply for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official here today
accused the United States of blocking the supplies needed for the
country's education.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Education Abdul Jabbar Toufiq told reporters
that up till now, Iraq has not received anything that is needed
for education in accordance with the "oil-for-food" deal signed
by Iraq and the United Nations last year.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Sanctions Committee has not approved any contracts
relating to the educational sector," although five months have
passed since such contracts in this regard were handed over to
the committee, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. representative on the committee of
opposing the ratification of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq will "continue the education process even if
(Iraqi) students have to sit on the ground and use the feather
to write on date-palm leaves," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "oil-for-food" deal allowed Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to pay for food,
medicine and other basic commodities badly needed in the country
to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqis following the seven-year
U.N. sanctions since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
About 12 million dollars from the oil revenues was earmarked
for Iraq's educational sector. The education minister said, "This
is a very small amount" compared with 1.6 billion dollars before
the sanctions started.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the official Iraqi news agency quoted an
unnamed spokesman of the Ministry of Information and Culture as
saying that the U.S. has so far suspended 200 contracts to
supply Iraq with humanitarian commodities.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved on the same day the
extension of the "oil-for-food' deal, which will expire on June
7, for another six months.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Some Hong Kong young people will
present a Bronze vessel to the motherland on June 21, to greet the
return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is modeled after "Simuwu", an ancient square cooking
vessel with two loop handles and four legs made during the Shang
Dynasty (1600 -- 1100 B.C.) for sacrificial offerings.
</P>
<P>
The 1,997-kg vessel is 2.22 meters high, 2 meters long, and 1.5
meters wide, and has a dragon and phoenix pattern and the emblem
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on its sides.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League,
the All-China Youth Federation, and other units will organize a
celebration for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on June
21 at Yuanming Yuan Park in north suburban Beijing, where
representatives of Hong Kong's young people will present the
vessel. The "Shenghe Baoding" (prosperous, harmonious, precious
vessel) is intended to wish eternal prosperity and harmony to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The event will make the park a place of patriotic lessons for
China's young people, said Liu Peng, chairman of the All-China
Youth Federation, at a news briefing in Beijing today. He said
that young people should be taught that "A poor and weak nation is
the target of invasion" and China can achieve its reunification
and make social progress only by "becoming prosperous and strong."

three-time champion Monica Seles from one set down.
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Swiss kept her unbeaten slate clean of the year
by downing Seles 6-7 (2-7), 7-5 and 6-4 to secure her outing to
the finals at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
Hingis was sure on course for her second straight Grand Slam
title after her victory at the Australian Open at the start of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will vie for the title against either Iva Majoli of
Croatia or Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, both Hingis and Seles had two breaks apiece
before being deadlocked 4-4 and Seles rushed to a 6-1 lead in the
tiebreaker which she eventually won as Hingis committed five
unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the second, Seles double-faulted at break
point, levelled after the fourth game, but dropped her serve again
in the very next.
</P>
<P>
Down 5-3, Seles survived two set points and broke anew at 5-5,
but made errors in a hurry to surrender her 11th game before
Hingis serveing out the set at love.
</P>
<P>
The key point in the third set came in the third game. After
Seles saved two break points, Hingis hit an angled forehand winner
for another break point before Seles dropped her serve by hitting
long.

<HEADLINE> Further Development of Sino-Italian Ties Stressed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that the further development of Sino-Italian relations is
helpful for the establishment of a world pattern featuring
multi-polarization and a just and rational new international order
for politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the remark during his talks here today
with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China considers the
growth of relations between China and Italy as an important part
of the overall progress of Sino-European ties, and to reinforce
bilateral ties conforms to the interests of the two countries and
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two prime ministers exchanged views on
bilateral relations and issues of common concern with consensus
reached on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled his two visits to Italy as prime minister and his
friendly talks with Prodi last year when he attended the World
Food Summit held in Rome, saying that the talks had deepened
mutual understanding and enhanced friendship.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that since Prodi is accompanied by many
Italian enterpreneurs this time, his visit will be of great
significance to the further advancement of bilateral economic and
trade ties as well as co-operation in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy, both with ancient civilization,
have a long history of friendly contacts, the Chinese premier
said, noting bilateral relations have grown rapidly and achieved
many positive results since the establishment of diplomatic ties
in 1970 and especially over the recent years.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the development of a
long-term and stable friendship and relations of co-operation with
Italy, and is willing to expand co-operation in politics, economy,
trade, culture, technology and other fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's present visit demonstrated the Italian government's
willingness to actively promote bilateral ties, Li noted,
expressing the belief that through concerted efforts of both
sides, Sino-Italian friendship and co-operation will be expanded
on the basis of mutual respect, seeking common ground while
reserving differences, and equality and mutual benefit.

<P>
Li pointed out that in recent years, bilateral economic and
trade relations have been reinforced, contacts between the
business circles of the two countries increased, and Italian
investment in China kept rising. Italy has joined
the 100-seat aircraft production program of China, Li noted,
describing this as a "new content" in bilateral co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that in recent years, Italy and China have
expand their co-operation in various spheres, and bilateral ties
have kept growing. He said that later this year, Italy will
organize a large-scale fair in China.
</P>
<P>
Italy, as China's second largest trade partner in Europe, will
try to keep this position while seeking new co-operation ways in
a bid to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth development of such
relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Italy and China hold the same or similar
views on many international issues and China is playing an
important role in world affairs. He expressed the hope Italy and
China will have a better co-operation in the United Nation and
other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Italy supports China to join the World Trade Organization,
Prodi reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's return to China is worth celebrating,
and the policy of "one country, two systems" is a creation full of
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Hong Kong's return is in sight, and China is
confident about the development prospect after its return,
stressing the legitimate rights and interests of Italian business
people or people of other circles in Hong Kong will be protected.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two prime ministers also attended a
signing ceremony of four documents including an exchange of notes
on the maintenance of Italian consulate general in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Li presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Prodi.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Sign More Deals With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi delegate to the Arab League
Nabil Negm said here today that Baghdad will sign new accords with
Egyptian government and firms after the renewal of oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Negm said that Iraq and Egypt have taken long strides in recent
months towards promoting bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meetings have been held between Iraqi and Egyptian trade
ministers and among officials of their chambers of commerce and
industries to achieve the purpose, added the delegate.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council decided Wednesday to
extend, for another six months, the agreement with Iraq, which
allows the embargo-stricken country to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Another batch of Egyptian pharmaceuticals worth 1.53 million
dollars will be shipped to Iraq in a few days under the new
contracts approved this month by the Sanction Committee under the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official accused the United States and Britain of
interfering in the implementation of the deal which is designed to
ease the sufferings of the Iraqi people under seven years of
international embargo.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the fact that his country has signed over
700 agreements on importing food and medicines since the deal came
into effect, less than 37 percent of them have been approved and
implemented mainly because of the U.S. stance.
</P>
<P>
"They are still working to impede giving green light to
implement accords concluded by Iraq with several countries in
accordance with the deal," said the Iraqi delegate to the Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
"The American attitude was the main reason behind the delay in
distributing food quotas on the Iraqi people and it has thwarted
the objectives of the memo of understanding concluded between Iraq
and the UN," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has previously complained that very little medicine, and
only 700,000 tons of the 2.4 million tons of food expected as a
result of the deal, have arrived since oil began to flow in
December.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has signed several agreements on exporting medicines to
Iraq but apparently failed to reach the targeted 100 million
dollars of exports in the first six months since the deal took
effect.
</P>
<P>
The deal is an exemption from the U.N. sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. U.N. diplomats have said they will
not consider lifting the sanctions until they are satisfied that
Iraq has fully cooperated with U.N. arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Urges Party to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called on the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) and government members to steadfastly fight
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is now abroad on a two-month long vacation, made
the call during a 15-minute video tele-conferencing connecting
him in London with Acting prime minister Anwar Ibrahim at the UMNO
headquarters here, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is UMNO president, said fighting graft required
determined efforts to prevent erosion of UMNO and the government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
"Graft is unhealthy for the party and the government," he said,
adding "Our friends may be involved. But if we don't take action
they may think we'll defend whatever they do since we (the
government) have the powers."
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama, also present at the UMNO headquarters
were party secretary-general Sabbaruddin Chik, vice-presidents
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Najib Tun Razak, UMNO Youth Chief Ahmad
Zahid Hamidi, UMNO Women Wing leader Zaharah Sulaiman and party
information chief Yusof Nor.
</P>
<P>
The video tele-conferencing with Mahathir took place after
Anwar chaired a three-hour-long UMNO Supreme Council meeting at
the party headquarters, which had strongly resolved to deal with
corruption, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the fight against graft, which got full backing
from the Cabinet, should also get solid support from all UMNO
members.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was informed by Anwar that the Supreme Council wholly
supported measures to maintain a clean image of the party and the
government and deal with corruption.
</P>
<P>
The council also discussed declaration of assets and incomes by
government officers, elected representatives, executive
councilors, chief ministers, deputy ministers and cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the council was also unanimous in relaying
a clear message to the party and government machineries on
anti-corruption measures.

<HEADLINE> Developed Nations Rebuked for Linking Trade to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries like Indonesia
should be wary of developed countries which try to pressure them
by linking trade to environmental issues, a business official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Developed nations often press developing countries to conserve
the environment while they leave their own environment in a state
of neglect," said Dewi Motik Pramono, chairperson for
environmental affairs of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a panel discussion on Indonesia's Agenda 21, she
said care should be taken to assess the pressure given by
developed countries to prevent them from making developing
countries merely their suppliers (of energy and natural sources).
</P>
<P>
"We are not against developed nations because they are our
business partners, but we should be rational in doing business.
(We should not) pursue profit at the expense of our interests,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koesnadi Hardjasoemantri, former rector of the
Yogyakarta-based Gajah Mada University, said the application of
Agenda 21, adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June
1992, has divided the world into two camps -- developed countries
and developing ones -- which have become suspicious of each other.
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, developed nations are often accused of
excessively exploiting the natural resources of developing
countries while on the other hand, developing countries are very
dependent on the technology of developed countries. This is one of
the factors that impede the global application of Agenda 21," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Agenda 21 is a follow-up to the global Agenda 21
adopted at the Earth Summit.

MOGADISHU, June 5 (xinhua)--At least eight people were killed
and nine others wounded yesterday when Somali militiamen at the
airport and others who were sent to fetch the newly printed money
fought over who would escort the money on its way to capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A package of newly printed Somali Shillings consignment worth
of US $ 750,000 is just an introductory part of nearly US $12
million which has allegedly been printed in malaysia. The arrival
of this money which has been brought by a plane led to the armed
confrontation at the airport within the supporters of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
According to Aidid's security officials today, security of the
airport has been restored back to normal. Commander of the
airport, Mukhtar Sayid Ahmed told joumalists that the differences
have now been settleed and the airport is officially open for
both the local and international flights.
</P>
<P>
There's no word yet from the government of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid over yesterday's incident nor the arrival of the money.
However, the one thousand Somali Shilling notes of the newly
arrived money have been seen in the main business center of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Other two Somalia's main factions have condemned the arrival
of the newly printed money. The factions led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed
and Osman Hassan Ali Atto today issued a joint communique,
condemning the country that printed the new consignment of money.
</P>
<P>
The two factions called on the United Nations, the
Organization of African Unity, the European Union and the Arab
League to take the necessary measures against the newly printed
money which they characterized as " fake".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks on US-German Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said that
Germany and the United States should not let their differences over
policies toward countries like Iran overshadow their cooperative
relationship, a German newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Germany is an essential partner for the United States in
tackling the most important regional and global issues, Clinton
said in an exclusive interview with the German mass circulation
tabloid Bild.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Germany's role in securing peace and prosperity
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S.'s role in Europe, the president said, "the
Unites States has been a European power since the 1940s and will
remain such a power."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also dismissed reports that U.S.-German ties have
cooled recently.
</P>
<P>
"We have been hearing these rumors for 20 years or more. They
were unfounded then as they are now."
</P>
<P>
Germany had irked Washington by calling for a dialogue with
Iran, but relations between Bonn and Tehran took a downturn in
April after a German court ruled that Iran was behind the
assassination of Iranian Kurds in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the interview coincided with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's stay in Washington, where Clinton is to
host celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
Marshall Plan on Thursday. The plan helped the reconstruction of
post-war Europe.

<P>
A number of cooperative agreements were signed today, he said,

in major projects.
</P>
<P>
Italy's light industry, textile, and leather technology lead
the world, and China is rich in raw materials and has a huge
market, Li said, noting that cooperation should not be limited to
trade. China and Italy should set up more joint ventures to
cooperate more extensively in leather-tanning and silk printing
and dyeing, he said.

<P>
Prodi said that he has held constructive and fruitful talks
with Li, and the two sides signed a number of important
cooperative agreements.

He said that Italy has always attached great importance to its
relations with China, he said, and the two countries' economies
complement each other, so the two sides can enhance economic
cooperation in various forms.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Italy and China will continue to
enhance their relations in all areas including politics, the
economy, and culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto here
today called on all industries to minimize their wastes while the
country endeavors to produce environment-friendly products which
will improve the competitive edge of its goods on the global
market.
</P>
<P>
After presenting environmental awards to a number of
individuals and regional administrations, the president said that
production of environment-friendly products must be part of the
industries' foundation, policy and strategy which in turn develop
the quality of Indonesian products.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the increasing number of people involved in
conserving the environment, saying that their efforts have helped
the government a lot in addressing the increasingly formidable and
complicated environmental and development issues.
</P>
<P>
However, Soeharto said that in spite of the efforts, the global
environment is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"This is happening because of limited funds despite rapid
progress in science and technology,' he added.
</P>
<P>
"A developing country faces environmental problems due to its
backwardness, unawareness and inability, while a developed country
faces the same problems because of their extravagant use of
natural resources,' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said there are 1.7 billion people, mainly in the
developing countries, who do not enjoy clean water because of lack
of funds.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Give Preferential Treatment to Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors are to be given
preferential treatment by the Romanian government following an
emergency decree issued today amending its Foreign Capital Act.
</P>
<P>
The series of measures designed to make Romania an attractive
place for foreign investment include exemptions from income tax
and import tariffs for businesses investing more than 300,000
U.S. dollars and the ability to remit foreign currency earnings
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The preferential treatment will be based on the volume of
investment, re-investment of a venture's annual profit, use of
Romania's natural resources, infrastructure construction and new
jobs created.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors who export more than half of their production
and invest in infrastructure, tourism, environmental protection
or underdeveloped areas will also get preferential treatment, the
decree said.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to jump start the country's stock market,
foreigners buying stocks and shares will also be given
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Romanian parliament renewed the Foreign
Capital Act which was passed in 1991, permitting foreign
businessmen to buy land to be used in infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Romania has seen an sharp increase in
foreign investment since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investment in Romania reached 2.486 billion
dollars by the end of May. Holland is the biggest investor, with
264 million dollars, South Korea the second with 235 million
dollars and Germany the third with 224 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> OIC Plans to Review Manila-MNLF Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) has proposed to review the implementation of a
landmark peace agreement signed last September between Manila and
a former major Muslim rebel group in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed today
that the OIC had extended its invitation to the Philippine
government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) for a
meeting in Libya soon.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the OIC, the MNLF and the Philippine
forged the Mindanao Peace Accord last September, ending 27-year
armed conflicts between the MNLF rebels and the government forces
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was conveyed through the OIC Committee of Six,
chaired by Indonesia, which supervised the Manila-MNLF peace talks
and served as observers during its protracted negotiations,
sources at the department said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative to review the Mindanao Peace Accord stems from
the reported defection of many MNLF fighters to another rebel
group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the southern
Philippines, since the signing of the agreement, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said the OIC wants to review the agreement to help ensure
peace in Mindanao by making sure all the provisions provided in
the agreement are substantially complied with.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A five-year European program to
tackle rare diseases and support victims has been launched by the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The program has three main focus areas, including the provision
of better information about rare diseases, the setting up and
fostering of voluntary organizations to support people affected by
rare diseases.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said today rare diseases are
life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases which are of
such low prevalence -- five or less per 10,000 in the population
-- that special efforts are needed if they are to be tackled
effectively.
</P>
<P>
It says that action at European level is of particular value
because the low incidence in every EU member state can be
aggregated to form a much larger group sharing the same
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This will provide the opportunity to undertake a wider range of
intervention and to initiate co-ordinated action with patients who
might otherwise be isolated.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia have agreed to all the three proposals made by General
Abdul Malik aimed at resolving the on-going crisis gripping the
war-ravaged Afghanistan, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban Shoora in Kandahar and their leader Mulla Muhammad
Omar have okayed these proposals," Pakistani Additional Secretary
for Afghanistan Iftikhar Murshid told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
According to Murshid, Malik had assured the Taliban of his
cooperation in establishing an Islamic state and proposed to allow
the northern parties to exclusively control northern Afghanistan
and not to disarm these groups.
</P>
<P>
Murshid said the proposals were jotted down on May 19, some
eight days before clashes erupted between Malik's forces and
Taliban fighters in Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban leadership expressed their willingness to
accept the proposals on May 31 and "the response from General
Malik is expected anytime."
</P>
<P>
Murshid quoted Malik as telling Pakistan's Consel General Ayaz
Wazir in Mazar-e-Sharif that "he is willing to extend all-out
cooperation to the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
Malik, whose defection on May 19 triggered the downfall of
northern warlord Rashid Dostum, turned his back on the Taliban
only four days after his forces and the Taliban fighters took
control of Dostum's stronghold Mazar-e-Sharif on May 24.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Environmental Report For 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, Jane 5 (Xinhua) -- Tibet had no acid rain or any
pollution accidents in 1996, according to a report on
environmental conditions for 1996 released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional
government, showed that water quality in the main rivers of the
region is good, and in line with state environmental quality
standards.
</P>
<P>
Underground water quality was also generally good, the report
said, and most of the more than 1,500 lakes with a total water
surface of 24,000 sq km maintain their primary conditions and good
water quality.
</P>
<P>
Air quality in 1996 was the same as the previous year, and
accords with state standard for grade-II air quality.
</P>
<P>
However, it reported, noise pollution in Lhasa, the region's
capital, got worse in 1996 because of the increasing number of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The rural environment in Tibet was good on the whole, and the
region was free from pesticide pollution. In order to keep the
"roof of the world" clean, the report said, a great deal of effort
is needed to prevent pollution and improve the ecology. This
includes afforestation and the increased use of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the environmental protection achievements
in Tibet mostly to the environment-related legal work and
increasing environmental protection awareness.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Tell the World the Truth About HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Everyday Kevin Sinclair spends
long hours working at his computer, and every week he gets his
articles printed in local English newspapers and overseas
publications.
</P>
<P>
"What I've been doing is to try to tell the world the truth
about Hong Kong," said Sinclair in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua in his home office in the Hong Kong Polytechnic Staff
Quarters in Fo Tan.
</P>
<P>
The strongly-built Sinclair is an Occidental who has lived in
Hong Kong for over 30 years and has always considered himself
part of Hong Kong despite the difference of his hair and eye
colors from local Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair has difficulty in talking due to a throat operation
many years ago, but that does not hinder him from opening a column
in South China Morning Post which he called "conversations".
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's difficult to tell the truth," he said. "Because
many people overseas are so ignorant. They think that Hong Kong is
going to die in July -- which is rubbish. We're going to get
better, with a better life for everyone."
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said he likes talking and is good at it although he
has to exert himself, often with gestures, to make himself clear.
</P>
<P>
Having witnessed the exciting changes of Hong Kong in the past
few decades, Sinclair believes he is qualified to tell the story
of Hong Kong, not some foreign reporters who come here "with
stupid ideas to write stupid things".
</P>
<P>
"Reporters should just report what they see and what is
happening here, instead of choosing the bad or the good," he said.
"Whenever Chinese officials come to Hong Kong, it's always the
same 20 people demonstrating, and some reporters only concentrate
on the handful of demonstrators while ignoring the six million who
are working. This is unfair for Hong Kong people." His cheeks
turned red as he became excited.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair cherishes profound feelings for Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland. He knows well the history and culture of China,
which are reflected in his social, political and food columns and
other works. And all these originated from a book he read when he
was Young.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair was born on a farm in New Zealand in 1942. At 14, he
read "Red Star Over China" written by Edgar Snow, which aroused
his interest in China.
</P>
<P>
He left school at the age of 16 and worked for different
newspapers from messenger boy to reporter, and finally came to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I came by ship, because my parents were very poor and couldn't
afford to buy a plane ticket," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said at that time Hong Kong was as poor as he was. The hills
were covered in squatter huts, people had nothing but pride and
hope. Nevertheless, he loved this piece of land the moment he
stepped on it.
</P>
<P>
"Look at Hong Kong today. It is fantastic what has been
achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now Hong Kong people are generally rich and confident, and they
play a big role in international financial and business councils.
And this will surely continue considering their marvelous
resilience to adapt to different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair has a hobby of long-distance cycling, usually three
times a week. And he likes to stop in villages to talk to the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Many of my best friends are Hakka farmers," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes to Get 5 Billion U.S. Dollars From CGI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia hopes that the
Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI), which convenes in the
middle of this month in Tokyo, Japan, would provide 5 billion U.S.
dollars in loans for it, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita told reporters after meeting with President Soeharto
that Indonesia must be prepared for a possible decline in CGI aid.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia secured 5.26 billion U.S. dollars in loans from the
CGI, which is composed of 18 countries and 11 international
agencies, at the conclusion of its meeting in Paris on June 19-20
last year.
</P>
<P>
The loans consisted of 2.563 billion U.S. dollars from the 18
CGI countries and 2.696 billion U.S. dollars from the
international agencies.
</P>
<P>
If Indonesia expects a 5 billion U.S. dollars loan, it must
heed the ceiling on loans each CGI country and international body
will give to Indonesia, said Ginandjar, who will leave for Japan
on June 8 to hold preparatory talks with Japanese officials.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility the CGI will cut its assistance, the
minister said a reduction in CGI loans is possible as Indonesia
has been categorized as a middle-income country.

<P>
Sinclair is also proud of his own achievements in Hong Kong: "I
have got one wife, two children and written 13 books."
</P>
<P>
He showed some of his works to the reporter, most of which are
about Hong Kong and China, covering such areas as the environment,
Hong Kong police, Chinese cooking, the Yellow River and Chinese
national minorities.
</P>
<P>
His columns and books have made him a name both in Hong Kong
and the mainland, and he attributed that to hardworking.
</P>
<P>
"Having cancer and not being able to talk properly were a great
advantage. That made me tougher. It made me harder," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is my home. I have lived here more than half my
life. I met my wife here, we had our two children here and we own
our home here -- we are Hong Kongers."
</P>
<P>
Sinclair's wife, Kit Allred, teaches medicine and helps
handicapped people at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She
also has courses in universities in Hebei, Anhui and Guangdong
provinces on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said his wife is just like him -- she is also
committed to China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
His 21-year-old son, David, is studying in California, while
his 19-year-old daughter Kiri is studying in Brisbane. "She hopes
to go to Beijing University next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
While dwelling on Hong Kong's changes for the better, Sinclair
is also worried about some changes which he believes are very bad,
especially the deterioration of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about Hong Kong is pollution. Sometimes the
air is so dirty that I'm scared to go for a bike ride," he said.
"I'm very glad that Tung Chee Hwa is concerned about the
environment."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the handover at midnight on June 30, he said there
is nothing to be worried about. On the handover day he will stay
at home, working as usual.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair has been visiting mainland provinces quite regularly
and has an intimate knowledge of China.
</P>
<P>
"I've interviewed many Chinese leaders, and I think the Chinese
government will do anything to make Hong Kong successful," he
said, showing this reporter around his roomy house to see pictures
taken with his Chinese friends, Chinese paintings and collections.
</P>
<P>
He said that in China's history never have so many Chinese been
so wealthy, so healthy, so well-educated and had such a measure of
real freedom since Deng Xiaoping's policies threw open the doors
of China to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"I believe sincerely that the government, bureaucracy, party
and army are united in promoting Hong Kong's welfare -- not out of
any altruistic reasons but because a prosperous and safe Hong Kong
means a richer and more powerful China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admits that with the handover to China, there will be some
changes, people will lose some of the advantages of the western
way of life. "But we have to be realists. We are going to be part
of China and if we want to remain in Hong Kong, we had better be
prepared to play by Chinese rules. If you don't like it, go. I
will stay."
</P>
<P>
He said many of his western friends in Hong Kong hold similar
views. They will stay in Hong Kong as long as they are happy with
their jobs, he said.

JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the South
African people supported the participation of the national armed
forces in peacekeeping operations, according to a survey released
here today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of (62 percent) of respondents expressed
that they were in favour of South African troops being sent
outsdie the country for peacekeeping operations, the survey by
the Human Sciences Research Council and the Institute for Securty
Studies (ISS) said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted among 4,400 respondents in urban and
rural areas throughout South Africa, might reflect the view that
the security of South Africa could not be pursued in isolation
from that of its neighbors, ISS Executive Director Jaki Cilliers
said.
</P>
<P>
It indicated South Africans support the concept of common, or
collaborative security in the Southern African region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the cost and pitfalls of the regional peacekeeping,
there is immense pressure on South Africa to become a major
contributor to the evolution of sub-regional capacity for peace
operations, Cilliers said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President-Elect Favors Easing Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami said here today that Iran favors easing tension in
relations with other countries and has always strived for
honorable peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of thousands of people who had gathered
at the Mausoleum of the late spiritual leader Khomeini, in
southern Tehran, the 54-year-old president-elect called for a
united front to ward off these threats, saying that all forces
from every wing and faction should work in unity to repel these
threats.
</P>
<P>
"We have always been for an honorable peace coupled with
dignity and independence of the country and to this end the
Islamic Iran has followed and will always pursue a policy of
easing tension in its relations with other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Iranian nation in the past has incurred
damage and losses from terrorism and thus will strive for a
lasting peace in the world which guarantees the independence and
rights of all nations.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who won the presidency by securing 69 percent of a
total of 29.07 million votes cast on May 23, called on all
revolutionary forces and those sympathetic with the Islamic
revolution to cooperate with government officials for the success
of the next administration which is due to take over in August.
</P>
<P>
He said that the continuation of the reconstruction programs,
promotion of social justice and safeguarding the dignity of Iran
will be top on the agenda of his government.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that he will carry out his platform to further
enhance the prestige of the country with full commitment to
Islam, the supreme leader and the nation under the guidance of
the leader of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
"Success in this task is not possible without an overall
partnership of the people and precise supervision of Parliament
and public institutions as well as the press over the
performance of the government and its officials," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Healthy and constructive criticism of government's
performance by the press will enable the administration to
strengthen its strong points and drop the weak points," Khatami
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"What is of utmost importance is respect for the rule of law
and the rights stipulated in the constitution of the Islamic
Republic of Iran," Khatami was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the society needs a strong government whose strength
is derived from adherence to law.
</P>
<P>
He said that going ahead with reconstruction efforts,
promoting the dignity and independence of the country demand
national determination which will come by respecting the
law.

CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Profit-takers knocked shares down
across the board on the Australian share market today, with the
soft base metal and gold prices counteracting modest gains in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index slipped 11.7 points to close at
2604.2.
</P>
<P>
"The market just seems to be idling ahead of the long weekend
and with new jobs data out in the U.S. tomorrow night," a
Sydney-based trader said.
"There was a fair bit of profit-taking which didn't help
momentum."
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market hovered for much of the day before a
late burst of selling towards the close, with many investors
likely to be away tomorrow for an extended Queen's Birthday long
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Many were also positioning ahead of the release of U.S. May
jobs data tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 10.9 points to 1480.3 while the
all industrials index lost 13.6 points to 4067.2.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was also down, losing 16.6 points to 1549.4 in
the wake of Wednesday's 2.10 U.S. dollar fall in the gold price.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion closed in Sydney at 341.35 U.S. dollars an ounce
from 343.70 U.S. dollars last.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 359.08 million shares worth 853.56
million Australian dollars (648.70 million U.S. dollars), with

</P>
<P>
Westpac Banking Corp. was one of the heaviest traded stocks
amid rumors that its 1.4 billion Australian dollar (1.06 billion
U.S. dollar) bid for Bank of Melbourne Ltd. was unlikely to be
approved by the ACCC.
</P>
<P>
Westpac was also the center of takeover speculation, with
suggestions that a major offshore institution has approached the
Foreign Investment Review Board with regard to a takeover.
</P>
<P>
More than 7.49 million Westpac shares were traded worth 53.19
million Australian dollars (40.42 million U.S. dollars). Westpac

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets US Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China and the United States share the responsibility of
working hard to bring a healthy and stable Sino-US relationship
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark here this afternoon with Zbigniew
Brzezinski, former special assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs of the US.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Brzezinski took part in the work for the
establishment of Sino-US diplomatic ties during his term of
office and made
contributions to the normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
After that, he still worked extensively to promote the
development of bilateral relations, Jiang said, adding he
appreciated Brzezinski's efforts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the world is moving towards multi-polarization,
which plays an important role in promoting world peace, stability
and development. Meanwhile, he said, the international community
still faces many unstable elements and numerous challenges.
</P>
<P>
Under such a global situation, China and the US, as two big
countries in the world and two permanent members of the Security
Council of the United Nations, share more comprehensive common
interests and more responsibilities, compared with a dozen years
ago when the two sides forged diplomatic ties, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that at the dawn of a new century, the nature
of the Sino-US relationship that continues into the next century
is a great historical mission for the leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We share the responsibility of working hard to bring a
healthy and stable Sino-US relationship into the 21st century,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-US relations have shown a trend toward improvement since
the latter half of last year, Jiang noted, adding that whether the
opportunity can be seized to promote a healthy and steady
development of bilateral relations requires not only the concerted
efforts from the two governments but also the active efforts from
people of insight of various circles of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that Brzezinski may continue to play a
active role in promoting the further improvement and development
of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski said that three years have passed since his last
visit to China, and China's great changes have proved it is a
country of vitality, which has made a deep impression on him.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his feeling that in the years to come, China will
continue to concentrate on developing the economy and improving
Chinese people's life.
</P>
<P>
He said the notion spreading throughout the world that China
will adopt an overbearing position in international affairs is
groundless and does not accord with the reality.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the US-China relationship is one of the most
important bilateral relationships in the current world, Brzezinski
said that a full range of common interests exist between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders of the two countries should increase their
dialogue on issues of strategic importance, and work hard so that
the two peoples can understand and support these common interests,
and the bilateral relations may be built on a more solid and
comprehensive base.
</P>
<P>
Among those present on the occasion were Liu Huaqiu, director
of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council, Mei Zhaorong,
president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs,
and James Ralph Sasser, US ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski is here as the guest of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs.

Cathay announced today that 10 of its fleet of 11 A330s were

24. All are currently being fitted with the modified gearboxes and
will each be ferried back to Hong Kong to operate their first
commercial flights from the airline's home base.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President's Son Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecutors today
indicted Kim Hyun-chul, the second son of President Kim Young-sam,
on bribery and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The junior Kim's close aide Kim Ki-sup, former deputy director
of the National Security Planning, was also indicted on graft
charges.
</P>
<P>
The trial for the president's son and his five aides is
expected to open early next month, according to court officials.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old junior Kim was arrested on May 17 on charges of
taking 3.6 million U.S. dollars in return for favors from two
business firms.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded a supplementary probe into the junior Kim's
influence-peddling and scale, sources and expenditures of his
slush fund," said the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The probe concluded that the president's son is suspected of
having received a total of 7.4 million U.S. dollars from six
businessmen, 3.6 million dollars in return for favors and 3.8
million under the name of "operational funds."
</P>
<P>
For the "operation fund", if not bribe, Kim will have to pay
1.46 million U.S. dollars in penalties on tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also revealed that Kim had managed a slush
fund worth more than 16.9 million dollars, some of which were from
the businessmen.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutors refused to disclose the details of the
sources, management and the expenditure of the slush fund, in a
bid to avoid what they called "possible negative political impact."
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties and the public charged that the prosecutors
failed to find out the truth on Kim's alleged connection with the
collapsed Hanbo Group, his meddling in state affairs such as
personnel appointment and other profitable affairs.

<HEADLINE> IMF's Lending Arm to Fund Kenya's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the International Monetary Fund's lending arm
to the private sector, is to fund Kenya's micro-enterprise bank
with one million U.S. Dollars of equity investment.
</P>
<P>
A just-signed financing agreement will facilitate the
transforming of Kenya Rural Enterprise Program (K-Rep) into a
commercial, micro-enterprise bank to be known as K-Rep Bank, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is IFC's first direct investment in a
micro-enterprise financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The new bank will continue to provide lending and savings
services to Kenyan micro-entrepreneurs who do not have access to
formal financial institutions due to lack of collateral and high
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
It will lend to either individual clients or groups, whereby
credit is extended to members of a group who are jointly held
accountable for repayment.
</P>
<P>
The K-Rep was initially established to provide training,
technical assistance and financial credit to micro-entrepreneurs.
Now it has the largest micro-enterprise finance operation in
Africa with a client base of over 15,000.
</P>
<P>
Its average loan size is about 300 Dollars and has achieved an
average repayment rate of about 95 percent over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
"We expect K-Rep Bank to help extend IFC's reach to the many
micro and small-scale businesses throughout Kenya," said Tei
Mante, an IFC director.
</P>
<P>
The other major shareholders of K-Rep Bank will be South Shore
Bank of Chicago, the African Development Bank, Triodios (a Dutch
non-governmental group) and the Netherlands Development
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The IFC has also signed an agreement with Kenya's Credit
Finance Corporation Limited bank (CFC) for a loan option facility
of 10 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The hedge facility, a new product introduced by IFC, will
allow CFC Bank the right but not the obligation, to draw down
short and medium-term loans from IFC.
</P>
<P>
The CFC was set up in 1955 as the first independent
asset-based financing company in the eastern African country and
converted into a commercial bank in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today
slipped against the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and the
Deutsche mark as the market awaited vital job data to be released
in the United States on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The market, also still cautious about the prospects of another
easing in the domestic official interest rates, was met with
silence from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this morning, for
the second day since its monthly board meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that another cut is imminent remains and the market
will be listening for news resulting from RBA Governor Ian
Macfarlane's speech overnight at Westpac's economic conference in
London.
</P>
<P>
On May 23, the RBA took the financial market by surprise by
announcing that the official overnight borrowing rate would be cut
to 5.5 percent from 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the day's trading here at 75.81
U.S. cents, down from yesterday's close of 75.89 after trading in
a range of 75.65 to 75.88 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. job data proves to be stronger than expected, it
would boost expectations of an increase in interest rates in the
United States, resulting in a fall in the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 87.86 yen, down from 88.39, and
at 1.3099 marks, down from 1.3158.

<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to recruit about
170,000 overseas experts and send around 90,000 people to attend
overseas training programs in the coming two years, according to
China's State Bureau of Foreign Experts (SBFE).
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, some 160,000 cultural, technical and
managerial experts have worked in China. Among them about 120,000

told a national talent introduction conference, which ended here
today.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, State Councillor Li Guixian urged
departments concerned to bring the talent search to a higher level
so as to better serve the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that China's move to recruit overseas talent in the
next two years will focus on serving agriculture and the reform
of the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Overseas talent will also be brought to the country to serve
China's science and education drive and accelerate the training of
highly-qualified professionals, Wan said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Encourages Investment in Road Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has decided
to give 100 percent income tax exemption for the first five years
and 30 percent for 20 years to attract private sector
participation in the road building sector.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Surface Transport T.G. Venkatraman, who announced
this decision here today, said that the Cabinet Committee on
Infrastructure also decided to allow the National Highway
Authority of India (NHAI) to provide capital grants up to 40
percent for build, operate and transfer (BOT) projects for
national highways to enable leveraging of private investment in
this sector.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided to exempt from customs duty special heavy
machinery required for speeding up highway construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, of the 2.03 million kilometers road
length in the country, only half is surfaced and most of the
unsurfaced roads are non-motorable. The national highway network
of about 34,000 kilometers has only 358 km four-lane roads while
6,674 km are of single intermediate lanes.
</P>
<P>
Road quality standards too have not kept pace with changes in
vehicle and freight technologies as they are designed only for
single axle vehicles with axle load up to 8.20 tons. Poor quality
of roads and heavy congestion result in longer turnaround of
vehicles and lead to higher transportation costs.

<HEADLINE> Coli 0-157 Bacteria Resistant to Drugs Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The 0-157 strain of E. Coli bacteria
has been found to be resistant to the Japanese Health Ministry's
prescribed antibiotic fosfomycin last July at the start of a food
poisoning outbreak, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Pharmacology Department at the Yamaguchi
University Faculty of Medicine confirmed the drug-resistant
properties of the bacillus, which are thought to develop inside
the colon, in experiments conducted in open air.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will announce the results of their study at a
Japan Society of Chemotherapy meeting, which will open in Tokyo on
June 12.
</P>
<P>
The antibiotic fosfomycin was prescribed for use by the
ministry to treat those infected in last summer's mass poisoning
in Sakai, Osaka prefecture, and was considered to have been highly
effective.
</P>
<P>
The Yamaguchi research team cultivated E. Coli bacteria from
six people infected last July and compared the effectivity of
seven kinds of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
By mixing nutrient fluids and replicating inside the test tube
conditions similar to those found in the human body,
pharmacologists discovered that fosfomycin lost its germicidal
effect in all six patients and failed to inhibit replication of
the bacteria in one of the six patients.
</P>
<P>
An E. coli 0-157 poisoning epidemic claimed 12 lives and made
more than 10,000 people ill in Japan last July.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Young Musicians To Play At Historic Moment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOMG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The summer of 1997 means
something special for 21-year-old Joseph Kam Ho Pang, a musical
student who has played violin and viola for more than one decade.
</P>
<P>
Joseph is happy to be chosen for the third time as a violinist
of the Asian Youth Orchestra (AYO) -- a summer-camp program which
selects 102 outstanding young musicians each year from 11 Asia
countries and regions for six-week rehearsal and performance tour.
</P>
<P>
What makes him happier is that he, together with other members
of the AYO, will perform on two occasions marking the return of
Hong Kong to its motherland on July 1, 1997. They will perform the
premiere of a new composition titled Symphony 1997, written
specially for the historic handover by Chinese composer Tan Dun.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy that I can perform on such a special occasion. I
can witness the history. I feel I'm part of the history," said the
young man.
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese, I'm proud to see that China can take back Hong
Kong and the colonial rule will come to an end," he added.
</P>
<P>
Joseph is not alone in having a sense of pride. As a matter of
fact, 11 Hong Kong students have been selected to the AYO this
summer and will give the special performance at the historic
moment. They all come from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing
Arts.
</P>
<P>
Apart from those Chinese students from Hong Kong, the AYO has
chosen 22 students from well-known conservatories across China,
and 11 students from Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"We're all proud of playing 'Symphony 1997' on the significant
occasion," said AYO's Executive Director Richard Pontzious, who is
 now busy arranging the rehearsal to start on June 9 in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The students will take part in a three-week rehearsal camp in
Malaysia before they come to Hong Kong on the eve of the
handover. On July 1, they will cooperate with the world-famous
cello soloist Yo-Yo Ma to play part of "Symphony 1997" first at
the founding ceremony of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), and then on the bank of the Victoria Harbor to
accompany the spectacular fireworks show in the evening. Composer
Tan Dun will conduct the two performances.
</P>
<P>
Symphony 1997, divided into three movements -- Heaven, Earth
and Mankind, is a large scale choral and orchestral work, which
combines the voice of a 200-children choir, the sound of a set of
2,500-year-old Chinese chime called Bianzhong and the melody of
cello by YO-Yo Ma. It took Chinese composer Tan Dun almost one
year to complete the work.
</P>
<P>
The 55-minute work will be staged on July 4 at the Hong Kong
Cultural Center, said the executive director. On the following
day, the AYO will perform Symphony 1997 at the Great Hall of the
People in Beijing, raising the curtain of a ten-day tour in six
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Joseph has never been to Beijing, and now he expects to
perform in the capital of China.

GENEVA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Evgeny
Primakov said here today that the document signed last month in
Paris between Russia and NATO will contribute to "real
international stabilization."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going Conference on Disarmament, Primakov
said that the substance of the Founding Act "reflected the
political will of leaders of the largest nations in Europe and
America to take into account security and cooperation interests of
each other for the sake of stability in the world."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Russia is still opposed to NATO's
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The NATO enlargement "can bring about new dividing lines in
Europe which we started to intensively eliminate in the post Cold
War era", he said.
</P>
<P>
The reason why Russia decided to sign the Founding Act with
NATO "is precisely to minimize the negative effects of such an
enlargement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he hoped that the practical implementation of the
principles and the "code of conduct" laid down in the Act will
help to enhance security in Europe.
</P>

Primakov is in Geneva for a one-day official visit to the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim
Khaddam and Lebanese leaders today exchanged views on the
establishment of an Arab economic bloc and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam, accompanied by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa,
held a meeting in the Beirut Presidential Palace with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Lebanese leaders the outcomes of his recent
tour of Arab capitals in the Gulf and north Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the Syrian vice president announced
that his talks with the Lebanese leaders dealt with a Middle East
economic conference, which is due to be held in Doha, Qatar, next
November, and a Turkish-Israeli coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said that they discussed ways "to establish an Arab
economic bloc which will bring the inter-Arab relations into a
new phase and put the cooperations between the Arab states on the
correct path."
</P>
<P>
Khaddam stressed that the responses to Syrian proposals, which
he received during the recent tour of Arab countries, were "very
good," but he did not specify what the proposals he has been
marketing to the Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
On the current Turkish incursion into Iraq in pursuit of
Kurdish separatists, the Syrian leader noted that what is
happening in northern Iraq "not only concerns Iraq, but concerns
all the Arab states as a whole."

"The Turkish-Israeli partnership is a security, political and
economic partnership which is aimed at controlling the region,
aimed at Arab territories and aimed at Arab resources," the
Syrian leader claimed.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Establish Information Network Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A joint information network center
will be established in Macao before the end of this year to
facilitate the exchange of information between China's interior
areas and Macao, and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed here Wednesday by three parties
involved -- the Macao Foundation, China's State Science and
Technology Commission (SSTC) and the Macao-based International
Institute of Software Technology of the United Nations University.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the SSTC will provide computers,
the UN institute will supply technical services, and the Macao
Foundation will be in charge of management of the Macao
Information-Net Center.
</P>
<P>
Wu Guoxiang, an expert who signed the agreement on behalf of
the SSTC, said that the center will enable users of the Internet
to have a quicker access to information on China's interior
areas and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It is now difficult to get access to information about China
via the Internet in China because communications facilities are
not so good," Wu told Xinhua. "Macao's communications facilities,
 however, are much better."
</P>
<P>
World Internet users can, via the center, get a quicker contact
with relevant departments in China's interior areas while the
latter can spread information on science and technology, economic
affairs and business information via the center, he said.
</P>
<P>
The center will also benefit Macao, he added. It will help
spread information about Macao, expand its information service so
that Macao will gradually become a hub of international business
service.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the center is set to start operation before
1998 as further negotiations are still under way.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Stage Portuguese-Style Bullfighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to stage another round of
Portuguese-style bullfighting in September and October this year
following a similar act in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen bullfighters, including one woman, 24 bulls and three
horses will arrive from Portugal for the event, which will cost 5
million patacas (about 632,900 U.S. dollars), the newspaper Macao
Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese matadors will fight the bulls on September 27 and 28
and October 1, 4, and 5 as a way to attract more tourists to the
territory, coinciding with an international fireworks display to
be held at the time.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the special suits for matadors and fighting
tools will be on show in the territory to let viewers learn more
about the Portuguese tradition.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the main difference between Portuguese-style
fighting and Spanish-style fighting is that the bulls in
Portuguese fighting are not killed on the spot, but butchered
later.
</P>
<P>
Last year's bullfighting attracted thousands of viewers, mostly
from Hong Kong. Organizers of this year's event believe the
upcoming bullfighting will also be a success.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Expand Internal Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government will
during 1997/98 fiscal year put more thrust on increasing revenue
from internal sources to reduce dependence on external donors.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1997/98 government budget proposal to the House
of Representatives in the town of Zanzibar on Wednesday, Minister
of Finance Amina Ali said increased inland revenue would cover
budget deficit and finance recurrent and development votes.
</P>
<P>
She said the government will continue to implement policies
aimed at strengthening the economy, building internal foundation
for self-management without dependence on external revenue.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the house that over-dependence on external
financial sources was improper and likely to risk sacrificing the
nation's integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
She said projections for development programs were not
realized because several donors suspended aid to the Isles.
</P>
<P>
The Donors accuse Zanzibar of a "poor human rights record", a
claim mounted shortly after the 1995 general elections in which
the ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) presidential candidate,
Salmin Amour, defeated Seif Shariff Hamad of the opposition Civic
United Front (CUF).
</P>
<P>
"Government individuals, private enterprises and individuals
must work tirelessly to achieve this objective - and today, not
tomorrow," Ali stressed.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the government was reviewing all sources
possibility of increasing them, adding that the government will
continue with efforts to collect revenue through the Zanzibar
Revenue Board.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government will put a stop to all tax
exemptions which are unjustified by investment law and customs
regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, during the 1997/98 fiscal year, the
government is expected to collect 40.5 billion Tanzanian
Shillings (about 67.5 million U.S. Dollars) from various taxes
including those from the tourism and petroleum sectors.
</P>
<P>
She said in the new financial year, all other rates of
existing taxes will not be reviewed upwards due to poor income
and low standard of living of the islanders.
</P>
<P>
The minister also told the house that in the new fiscal year,
the government expenditure will be 55.4 billion Tanzanian
Shillings (about 32.3 million U.S. Dollars), out of which 42.2
billion Tanzanian Shillings (about 70.3 million U.S. Dollars)
will be for recurrent expenditure and 12.8 billion Tanzanian
Shillings (about 21.3 million U.S. Dollars) will be for
development budget.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government on
Wednesday raised the minimum wage pushing it to 20,000 Tanzania
Shillings (about 33.3 US Dollars) from present 15,000 T.Shs.
(about 25 US Dollars) per month, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Finance, Amina Salum Ali announced the new
wage structure in the House of Representatives when presenting
1997/98 government budget proposals in the town of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
She said procedures to adjust the salaries in the civil
service would be made public after consultation with accounting
officers and governemtn institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the case of private sector, Ali said the government has
enacted a law on the minimum wage for employees in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced the establishment of Social
Security Fund (SSF) to offer economic and social protection to
employees upon retirement.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has
provided about 8.6 million U.S. Dollars to Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda for the biological control of the water hyacinth in Lake
Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total sum, Kenya will receive 2.4 million Dollars
and the rest will be shared between the other two eastern African
countries, Jim Lindsay, the Australian deputy High Commissioner,
was quoted by today's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Biological means of controlling the water weed still remain
some of the most effective and cheapest, he said Wednesday at a
seminar on training facilitators in beetle-rearing in Kisumu,
Kenya's northern city bordering the lake.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) Deputy Director
A.M. Mailu said at the seminar that the KARI has released 10,000
beetles into Lake Victoria beaches as part of the process of
eradicating the water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The hyacinth now covers an area of more than 70,000 hectares
of the Kenyan part of the lake.
</P>
<P>
About 60 million neochetina beetles, an acclaimed natural
enemy of the hyacinth, would be released in at least 150 stations
on the Kenyan side this year, making Kenya the first in the east
African region to advocate the use of beetles.
</P>
<P>
The water hyacinth weed, one of the fastest-spreading plants
in the earth, was first noticed in Lake Victoria in 1980s, but
did not pose a significant problem until 1990s.

<HEADLINE> German GDP Up 0.5 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic product was
up 0.5 percent in the first three months this year over the last
quarter of 1996, and 1.4 percent higher than that in the same
period last year, the Federal Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Working days totaled less than in the first quarter of 1996
due to the earlier coming of Easter holidays, otherwise the
annualized growth rate may have been even higher, the office said.
</P>
<P>
"This working days factor could have accounted for more than
one percentage point of economic growth," it said.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent quarter-to-quarter growth indicated an economic
upturn after zero growth at the end of 1996. This also disproves
recent stagnation projection by the German Economic Research
Institute in Berlin that zero growth or even a negative 0.25
percent would be seen in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Imports grew by 3.9 percent. Exports registered a real 6.8
percent increase compared with a year earlier, remaining the only
factor that boosts economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, real job
creation can only be expected after the pickup of investments and
domestic demand in the country, which has suffered record
unemployment this year.
</P>
<P>
The data published today by the office showed that compared
with the first quarter of 1996, domestic demand grew only by 0.6
percent, while capital equipment investments by just 2.2 percent
and construction investments by 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Employment went 528,000 lower than in the first quarter of last
year, while a 2.9 percent increase was registered in labor
productivity, according to the statistics office.
</P>
<P>
Western Germany's annual GDP growth was just 1.2 percent in the
first quarter, compared with the 1.8 percent growth rate in the
last quarter of 1996. In the eastern area, the annualized growth
rate was 2.8 percent, the same as the last quarter of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Overseas Investments Help Beijing's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Since China first opened its doors
to the outside world 19 years ago, overseas funds have played an
annually increasing role in Beijing's economic development.
</P>
<P>
To a significant degree, foreign funding is responsible for
invigorating Beijing, a local source said, adding that from 1979
to 1996, a total of 10.2 billion US dollars had been actually
used, accounting for 29.96 percent of the entire fixed assets'
investment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Yi Xiqun, director of the municipal economy and
foreign trade commission, there were 12,845 overseas-funded
enterprises in the capital as of this April.
</P>
<P>
He said that the combined contractual overseas investment had
reached more than 20 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As many as 279 multinational companies have put their money
into 366 projects in Beijing, with the direct investment totaling
2.9 billion US dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Yi, 132 of the 500 largest multinational companies
in the world have entered the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city's total gross domestic product
(GDP) for 1996 was 97.2 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) more
than in 1991, 36 percent of which came from overseas-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of GDP from overseas-funded enterprises in the
city's total GDP increased from 12.9 percent in 1991 to 27.3
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these investments have aided Beijing's tertiary sector.
</P>
<P>
"They have contributed a great deal to the internationalization
of Beijing and helped to establish a modern, open and prosperous
image for the ancient city," a local source commented.
</P>
<P>
Also, the overseas funds are believed to have improved the
city's industrial structure, promoted the development of Beijing's
now-booming hi-tech sector, and introduced advanced technology and
management experience to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Among all the overseas-funded enterprises currently in Beijing,
81 percent have introduced "advanced technology and management
experience" into their operations.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of overseas-funded enterprises has largely
filled the gap between Chinese enterprises and their overseas
counterparts in terms of technology and management," a local
economic observer said.
</P>
<P>
The overseas funds in Beijing have hastened the development of
the city's real estate sector and the infrastructure construction
as well.
</P>
<P>
At present, 458 real estate development projects have been
approved to receive a total of 5.03 billion US dollars in overseas
funding. The construction areas will total an estimated 27 million
sq m.

Along the well-known commercial street of Wangfujing, and the
"financial street" in the Xicheng District, as much as 30 to 35
percent of the total overseas investment was channeled into real
estate development.
</P>
<P>
On Beijing's Chongwaidajie, one of the capital's main streets,
the entire 516 million yuan (64 million US dollars) in
infrastructure renovation costs were provided by the New World
group company from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's foreign trade has also been expanded and optimized
partly due to the introduction and use of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, overseas-funded enterprises in Beijing exported 810
million US dollars-worth of goods, making up 34.46 of the
capital's total export volume. And 82 percent of the hi-tech
products export volume came from overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
There are now 4,586 overseas-funded enterprises in Beijing,
with 362,800 employees.
</P>
<P>
Last year these businesses paid 3.5 billion yuan (400 million
US dollars) in taxes, accounting for 19.7 percent of the total
industrial and commercial tax income in Beijing.

On the "one country, two systems" policy, Prachuab said that
the policy initiated by the late Deng Xiaoping is the right

The policy will help China uphold national unity and
territorial integrity while maintaining the prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong, he said.

Speaking of the future Thai-Hong Kong relations, Prachuab said
that Thailand and Hong Kong have enjoyed close ties in trade,

"The return of Hong Kong to China will increase the economic
potential of our relations further by providing additional options
in our economic interaction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After the handover, Thailand will continue to cooperate
closely with 'Hong Kong, China' in various international
organizations and trade agreements because it is our mutual
benefit to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab also expressed confidence in the HK SAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa's ability to handle the region's affairs.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi Urges to further Use Deng's Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping has left abundant and
valuable ideological wealth to the Chinese people and his theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics should continue
to be practiced, a senior Chinese leader urged recently.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remarks during an inspection tour in Shanxi Province in
the north.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the senior CPC leader, who is also chairman of
the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), visited a number of major projects and heard reports by
senior provincial officials on the local development.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with local officials, Qiao praised both cadres and
the masses of people in the province for the spirit of forging
ahead as well as for their hard and strenuous efforts in their
economic development, saying that the provincial leadership has
worked out its development strategy in line with the specific
local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Still greater changes are due to take place in Shanxi, if the
local people carry out Deng's theory and the Party's basic line,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of studying Deng Xiaoping's theory, he said, is to
apply it into the social practice of hundreds of millions of the
Chinese people, so as to effectively advance China's socialist
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
While affirming Shanxi's active exploration of the reform in
the state-owned enterprises, Qiao called for pushing forward the
state-owned enterprise reform by making effective efforts and
adopting practical measures and resolving problems thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the pace for legislation should be accelerated in
Shanxi, supervisory work be effectively strengthened, and some
good experience created, summed up and further improved, Qiao Shi
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has warned that India's
deployment of medium-range ballistic missiles near the Pakistani
border has created "a dangerous security environment."
</P>
<P>
"The Indian action bears the potential of unleashing a
ballistic missile race in South Asia," a Foreign Office spokesman
today quoted Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan as saying in a
letter to U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The threat posed by this escalatory action would leave us no
choice but to take appropriate countermeasures," the minister said
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a weekly news briefing here that the foreign
minister has also pointed out that "India appears to have been
encouraged by the discriminatory American legislation against
Pakistan that has resulted in a serious military imbalance in the
region."
</P>
<P>
As regards the reported cooperation among Thailand, Bangladesh,
India and Sri Lanka, the spokesman said, "It is the sovereign
right of every state to enter into such cooperation with other
countries if they deem it necessary for the economic well-being of
their peoples."
</P>
<P>
"We do not think it will in any way affect the cooperation
among the SAARC countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Diplomacy Active in S. Leone Amid Peacekeeping Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chang Yong)
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- While west Africa's peacekeeping
existence is being reinforced in coup-torn Sierra Leone, a
diplomatic drive has been launched by Nigeria to prevent external
assistance for coupists and rebels in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports in Lagos said Nigeria on Tuesday sent from
its military base in Liberia at least four helicopters packed
with heavily armed soldiers to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a four-man Nigerian military team arrived in
Freetown Wednesday night to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
They are reported to join senior ECOMOG commanders for talks
with the coup leaders of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has also sent his deputy
foreign minister and chief of defense staff to Freetown for peace
talks with Sierra Leone's coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
In an address in Accra, capital of Ghana, to mark the 18th
anniversary of the 1979 coup that first brought him to power,
President Rawlings said: "The reasons for the coup in Sierra
Leone are unjustified and we all back the action of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to examine all avenues to settling the
crisis, with emphasis on a negotiated settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Rawlings had commented publicly on the
May 25 coup that toppled Sierra Leone's elected government led by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
This coincided with earlier reports that the military junta
led by Major Jonny Koromah in Sierra Leone had announced the
release of all 300 Nigerian soldiers allegedly held as hostages
to discourage the military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a state radio broadcast in Freetown on
Wednesday as saying: "Their release is a gesture of goodwill as
the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (the junta's ruling organ)
is exploring all avenues to bring the situation to a peaceful
end."
</P>
<P>
It said that food and other logistics were provided for the
Nigerian soldiers, including 13 military officers, as they were
escorted back to their base.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military denied the men's capture.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the coup, the ECOMOG force led by Nigeria
launched an attack on the coupists with an aim to restore the
legitimate civilian government of the country.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention has won wide support from the
international community, including the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, a former British colony racked by civil war
since 1991, has suffered three coups in five years. It is one of
the world's poorest countries despite a wealth of quality
diamonds and other mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders have accused President Kabbah of failing to
consolidate a peace accord signed last November with Foday
Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, and of
failing to pacify ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, reportedly in detention in Nigeria, has been appointed
by Major Koromah as his vice-chairman and is said to call on his
men to support the coup.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to go
lower on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials fell another 4.18 points to close at 2043.71 today.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume was thin at 125.23 million units, worth
397.74 million Singapore dollars (about 278.14 million U.S.
dollars). Declines led advances by a narrow margin of 154 to 153,
while 315 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Local fruit and food trading firm FHTK was the most actively
traded stock as it registered a turnover of 8.91 million units. It

cents to finish at 11.1 Singapore dollars. JMH 400, the United
Overseas Bank (UOB) F A and UOB Foreign gained 30 cents each to

<HEADLINE> Social Security System Perfected In Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north China
has made headway in the reform of its social security system,
forming a management network for the job, Deputy Provincial
Governor Ye Liansong said recently.
</P>
<P>
The system now covers not only pension and unemployment
insurance, but also that for on-the-job injuries, medicare, and
birth. Insurance expenses are borne jointly by the country,
enterprises, and individuals, instead of by state and enterprises
as before.
</P>
<P>
A provincial social security committee and a supervisory
committee on a social security insurance fund were established in
1996 to further improve the system.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 90 percent of the province's
workers had taken part in the social mutual assistance fund, and
approximately 30,000 enterprises had purchased unemployment
insurance.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 counties and cities across the province have set
up self-management organizations for retired employees.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Greater Efforts for Treasury Bond Issue  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shang attributed the slowdown in bond sales to a capital
diversion to a surging stock market since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
A huge capital inflow into the stock market is a major factor
affecting the smooth floatation of treasury bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stock indices had soared more than 45 percent each at
China's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen before the
release of a government regulation banning state enterprises and
listed companies from speculating in stocks on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Shang added that another important reason for the slowdown in
bonds sales is an expanded planned issue of corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
China has officially set this year's quota of corporate bonds
at 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An widely overlapping availability period of corporate bonds
and treasury bonds in the first half of this year combined with a
higher interest rate for the corporate bonds have made treasury
bonds less attractive to investors, Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Both officials said that more should be done to complete the
floatation of treasury bonds already announced, as another 60
billion yuan in government bonds will have to be issued in the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The issuing speed must be accelerated in order to sell out all
bonds when the year ends, they urged.
</P>
<P>
"The floatation of treasury bonds is a important issue that has
a bearing on the overall situation of the economic work," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shang said that the successful completion of the
treasury bond issues will be in the interest of meeting the
objectives of the financial and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
It also will help reduce investment risks, the deputy central
bank governor noted.

<HEADLINE> West Africa May Adopt Common Currency by Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Yongkang)
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The 16 Member countries of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) may adopt a
common currency by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Punch reported today that the issue will
be discussed by ECOWAS heads of states at a summit scheduled to
be held in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, next month.
</P>
<P>
David Asante, head of Monetary Cooperation and Payment
Relations at the ECOWAS Secretariat, confirmed that the year 2000
will be the time for adoption of the common currency.
</P>
<P>
The idea emerged from a meeting of the central banks of ECOWAS
countries in Nouakchott, Mauritania, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The year 1992 was earlier set for the goal but it was not
achieved because of the unpreparedness of member countries.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the goal of a single currency, the Council of
ECOWAS Ministers of Finance has come out with "indicators of
convergence" to be observed by members.
</P>
<P>
The council demands that member countries keep a single-digit
inflation rate and a government deficit not more than three
percent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Member countries have also let their exchange rate be
determined by the market and subject to year-to-year variations
not more than five percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 member states, only Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea Bissau
are yet to achieve the acceptable level of inflation, while
Guinea Bissau, Togo and Sierra Leone are yet to meet the
three-percent GDP deficit index.
</P>
<P>
Eight ECOWAS members countries in the French-speaking
countries are already using a single currency, the CFA Franc
which is tied to the French Franc.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is using the U.S. Dollar, while other member countries
have their own currencies, the exchange rates of which are mostly
under full official control instead of being subjected to the
market.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A two-week long Photo
Exhibition -- "Hong Kong: Its History and Today" opened here today
in connection with the resumption of exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Minister of Culture, Arts and Tourism Sabbaruddin
Chik and Chinese ambassador to Malaysia Qian Jinchang jointly
officiated the exhibition organized by the Chinese Embassy in
Malaysia with the assistance of the National Museum of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one hundred photos are put on display, introducing Hong
Kong's history, present situation and the process of Hong Kong's
return to China and revealing an even more beautiful tomorrow for
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Sabbaruddin said on the occasion that "the efforts put in
organizing such an exhibition show the seriousness of the Chinese
people in strengthening the heart to heart relationship with the
Malaysian people."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and China have enjoyed friendly relationship since
long time ago, he said, adding the ties between the two countries
have become closer and closer in economic, political, cultural and
educational fields.
</P>
<P>
He sincerely hoped that this exhibition will further enhance
future cultural exchanges between Malaysia and China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador expressed the hope that the exhibition
will help friends in Malaysia better understand Hong Kong and the
great significance of implementing the principle of "one country,
two systems" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the exhibition itself presents one aspect of the
Chinese nation's sufferings during the past more than 150 years
after the signing of the Treaty of Nanking which ceded Hong Kong
to Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said the resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong by the People's Republic of China will wipe out the
humiliation that the Chinese nation suffered over the past 100
years and more.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that "after Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, with the principle of 'one country, two systems' and
the legal guarantee of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, Hong Kong will definitely have a more
beautiful, more prosperous and brighter future."

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Ends Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Mideast envoy
Miguel Moratinos left here this morning, wrapping up his short
visit to Egypt that is aimed to infuse vigor to the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay here, Moratinos held separate talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on the latest developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meetings, Moratinos said that "there is some
breakthrough, but there is still much work to be done."
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said the EU supports the current Egyptian peace moves
and agrees with Egyptian officials that Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has "a desire for riding out the current peace
plight."
</P>
<P>
But Moratinos stressed that without the Americans it is
impossible to weather out the ongoing peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will head for Washington to meet with
U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross to exchange views on
overcoming the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after meeting the EU emissary on Wednesday
night, Moussa did not say whether Moratinos forwarded to the
Egyptian leader any European initiative reportedly to be unveiled
in the upcoming EU summit in Amsterdam, Holland.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos has been shuttling in the region as part of the
European endeavors to revive the deadlocked peace march and
restart the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Burn Textbooks Filled With Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Education, Culture and Sports said here today that it would burn
all textbooks filled with errors in Cebu, the second biggest city
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Education Undersecretary Antonio Nachura said that all
error-filled textbooks found in Cebu would be withdrawn and burnt
next week.
</P>
<P>
As a symbolic gesture of the drive against the use of these
books, the education department will send Undersecretary Erlinda
Pefianco to oversee the burning, Nachura added.
</P>
<P>
The assurance came in the light of a report by Representative
Raul del Mar of the proliferation of such books in Cebu.
</P>
<P>
Del Mar said in a statement that in Cebu, all of the 36 books
used in private and public schools, except those used in Grades 5
and 6, "contain material errors in facts, grammar and concepts."
</P>
<P>
Some of the more glaring examples of errors were the reference
of national hero Apolinario Mabini as a "she", utilization of some
words which are non-existent in the dictionary and the employment
of torture on grasshoppers and ducks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nachura said he is waiting for a policy statement from
Education Secretary Ricardo Gloria on whether legal action will be
taken against those found responsible for the error-filled
textbooks.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. and Israeli
military officials are holding their biannual strategic talks in
Netanya, north of Tel Aviv, against the background of stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks, which started Wednesday, focuses on the
needs of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for "qualitative edge"
in the future, local English daily The Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
David Ivry, special adviser to Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, is representing Israel and the U.S. is being
represented by Assistant Secretary of State Ted MacNamara,
accompanied by officials from the State Department and
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has long committed itself to maintaining Israel's
strategic edge over the Arabs. Israel has used the commitment in
its requests for advanced military technology and its opposition
to sales by the U.S. of advanced weapons and satellite
photographs to Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also sought U.S. help in preventing what it
believed rival states, Iran in particular, in the Middle East
from obtaining non-conventional weapons and nuclear knowhow.
</P>
<P>
The change of Iran's leadership is also a major topic in the
discussions. Senior Israeli sources are very pleased over the
fact that last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton publicly defined
clear conditions for improving relations with Iran, according to
a report of Hebrew newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made it clear that the U.S. will judge Iran according
to the degree of change in its actions on three international
fronts: weapons proliferation, terror and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
At the first press conference after his election, Iranian
president-elected Mohammad Khatami said that Iran will not
intervene in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Feature: An Untiring Psychologist in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- At the age of 70, Prof. Chen
Zhongshun still works 16-hours a day.
</P>
<P>
The first person in China to set up a telephone hotline for
psychological counseling, Chen's daily workload consists of dozens
of phone calls and correspondence with those seeking his
specialized help.
</P>
<P>
He regularly holds consultations at hospitals and contributes
articles to 12 magazines across the country. But to the
hard-working professor, the hotline, which is affiliated with
China's Association for Suicide Prevention, is his pride and joy.
</P>
<P>
"I would give up anything but the hotline -- it is the main
communication channel between me and society," he says.
</P>
<P>
Chen, formerly a professor with Tianjin Medical College, has a
degree in psychology with an emphasis in mental health. Upon
retirement 10 years ago, he publicized his home phone number,
offering it as a means of assistance in a society that until only
recently regarded frank talk about mental illness as taboo.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Chen's hotline help has saved the lives
of 180 persons, mended 125 troubled families, and successfully
handled 1,200 cases involving people with serious mental
problems. Over 100,000 persons from all around China, including
some in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have sought the professor's
professional advice.
</P>
<P>
Chen has over the years developed numerous forms of counseling,
including group therapy, to tackle the problems of his patients in
the shortest time possible, which usually varies from three days
to two weeks. And his hotline has expanded to three telephones
lines, staffed by 12 volunteers.

"People had no idea what `psychological counseling' was ten
years ago." he recalled. "The hotline was greeted with rumors
rather than understanding at first."
</P>
<P>
"Counseling then was confined to marital and sexual problems,
which in the traditional Chinese way of thinking was nearly taboo
even for discussion between close friends, let alone something to
talk about with a stranger on the phone," Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
"But China has been undergoing unprecedented changes," said the
professor.
</P>
<P>
To his gratification, his pioneering work has initiated a boom
in counseling services in China, with hotlines and organizations
providing consultations mushrooming throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that psychological counseling has wide room
for development in China, as people of all age groups are becoming
more and more burdened by increasing job and family pressures.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, 12 to 15 out of every 1,000 people in
China suffer from some form of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that China still is short of professionals in the
field of psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
"There are some who are taking the job who actually know little
about it," he pointed out. "We have a long way to go before
psychological counseling becomes a well-developed social sector in
China."

<HEADLINE> Israel Wins Deal to Upgrade Helicopters for Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli arms consortium has
won a 600-million-U.S. dollar deal to upgrade about 100
helicopters for Poland, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, which comprises of Elbit Ltd., El-Op
Industries and the Armament Development Authority, gained the
deal in fierce competition with a group led by the U.S. Boeing
company and several European sub-contractors.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, the U.S.-led group applied heavy
pressure on Warsaw that appeared to link the deal to acceptance
of Poland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
But Polish Defense Ministry informed the Israeli consortium
recently that it had won the competition, the report quoted El-Op
President Jacob Toren as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the decision to be realized. The
announcement has been delayed," Toren said, adding that the delay
 might stem from Warsaw's fear about Washington's strong reaction
 to the choice. Others expected the announcement to be made in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an agreement, although no contract has yet
been signed. The signing, however, could take place very soon,"
an Elbit source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But an Elbit spokeswoman said she could neither confirm nor
deny the Polish decision.
</P>
<P>
Israel entered the competition for the upgrade of the
Polish-designed Huzar helicopters in 1994. The upgrade will
involve avionics, missiles and fire-control systems.

an application by the General Electric Finance Corp. of the United
States to set up a finance company in Shanghai, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new company, known as GE Finance and
Accounting (China) Co. Ltd, raised to 48 the number of operational
overseas financial institutions in Shanghai, China's leading
economic and financial center.
</P>
<P>
The business scope of the GE company, to be located in the
city's Pudong New Area, includes accepting deposits and extending
loans in foreign exchange, discounting bills in foreign exchange,
providing foreign exchange-based guarantees, making investments,
offering trust, trading in foreign exchange, raising and leasing
funds in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Official records show that the 48 overseas financial
institutions are from 15 countries and regions; more than 20 are
banks ranking among the world's biggest 50 in terms of assets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of representative offices set up in
Shanghai by overseas financial institutions has reached more than
160.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that the Shanghai-based operational
overseas banks and financial companies had a total of 13.5 billion
US dollars in assets by the end of last year, up 49 percent over a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Loans in foreign exchange extended by the overseas financial
institutions soared 50 percent on a yearly basis to nine billion
US dollars in 1996. Their deposits and profits grew six and 41
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that overseas insurance companies in
Shanghai reported more than 500 million yuan in premium income in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that as China's opening-up in the financial
sector deepens, Shanghai is drawing greater attention worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is currently the only Chinese city where some overseas
banks are allowed to deal in business in the Chinese currency.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Wildlife College to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will officially
launch a wildlife college in September this year for training
conservation managers, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The college, the first of its kind in the southern African
region, will be situated in the Timbavati area on the boundary of
the Kruger National Park, a well-known natural wild animal
protection area in northeast South Africa bordering Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"Our fundamental strategy is to create a generation of black
conservation managers," said C. E. Ian Macdonald, an official of
the South African branch of the World-Wide Fund for Nature.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most damaging legacies of apartheid has been the
perception of conservation as a white preserve -- and to change
this we must have black leadership," Macdonald said.
</P>
<P>
On curriculum arrangement, Macdonald said the core program
offered by the college is a two-year modular course, which
consists of road construction and maintenance, rest camp
management, fence line maintenance and constructive interaction
with neighboring communities.
</P>
<P>
It also includes basic business skills, he added.
</P>
<P>
The college will begin operations with a series of short
courses running from July to December. This is a
capacity-building initiative, designed in line with its goal to
upgrade the level of skills in conservation bodies.
</P>
<P>
Each module, normally lasting from five to 20 days, will be
directed at people against a wide range of backgrounds from
senior park scientists to junior rangers, but will focus mainly
on people from previously disadvantaged groups, said the
official.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Orders Security Mobilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has
ordered the mobilization of security forces to suppress
"lawlessness" reminiscent of the civil war years, the Daily Star
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The order came following a call for civil disobedience made by
a Lebanese Shiite extremist and threats against U.S. targets made
from Beirut by a Kurdish leader whose separatist fellows are
currently fighting tens of thousands Turkish troops in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Opening a weekly cabinet session in the Beirut Presidential
Place Wednesday night, Hrawi disclosed that security agents had
detected a flow of weapons "to known forces in the Beqaa" in the
Shiite Muslim-populated eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president demanded a crackdown by "the
ministries concerned, the security departments and the judiciary,"
said the only English-language daily published in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not name the recipients of the weapons,
the president was clearly alluding to Sheikh Sobhi Toufeili, a
breakaway Hezbollah leader who is initiating a "hunger
revolution" in the form of civil disobedience for July 4.
</P>
<P>
Nor did Hrawi specify where the arms had come from.
</P>
<P>
The president's rare remarks, described by a government source
as the harshest since the end of the civil war seven years ago,
came after Western diplomats had privately complained about the
threats made from Beirut earlier this week by a commander of the
Kurdish Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
Commander Hilal Atac held a news conference in Beirut's
southern suburb on Monday in which he threatened to attack
American interests among others in retaliation for Ankara's
campaign against the Kurdish separatists seeking autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Atac spoke of "operations agaisnt Israeli targets in Istanbul
and elsewhere in Turkey and against U.S. enemy's interests."
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said he wanted to uphold public freedoms and
democracy, in which the country takes pride. But, he added,
"trespassing the boundaries of freedom leads to chaos and
ultimately to dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
"In recent days, we've heard and read of a Toufeili here
or a Toufeili there making clear threats to the security of
the state and the safety of its citizens and threatening the
interests of Lebanon and its relations with a friendly
country," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
"The media has reported a news conference in south Beirut
during which a Kurdish activist poured threats in all
directions. This does not serve the interests of the state
but is an attempt to inflict harm on the state and
security in the region," he added
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that the government had made its
position on regional developments clear, denouncing the
Israeli-Turkish military alliance and Ankara's incursion into
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"But this was not a carte blanche for individuals or a
parties to act as they please on Lebanese soil," the
president underlined.
</P>
<P>
"This requires immediate action by the security and judicial
departments in the country in pursuit of anyone posing a threat to
national interests, Lebanon's (foreign) relations and its internal
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country's biggest woe was Israel's occupation
of the south, he said: "This, however, does not mean that
resistance against the government or threats to return to the
lawlessness we experienced years back will be tolerated."

<HEADLINE> EA Airlines Need Common Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania have been urged to finalise arrangements to
adopt an East African (EA) Common Civil Aviation Policy.
</P>
<P>
The chief executives of the national carriers of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania made this urgement at the end of their three-day
meeting in Arusha, northern Tanzania, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Arusha-based permanent tripartite
commission for East African Co-operation (EAC) said that adoption
of such a policy would help ease travel between Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania "and push further the regional co-operation".
</P>
<P>
He noted that streamlining civil aviation rules and adopting
common regulations would help strengthen EA airlines and make
their operations much easier and competitive against outsiders.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also said Kenya Airways has no immediate plans to
participate in the ownership and activities of Ajas. "Alliance
Air is out of context in as far as the East African National
Airlines Co-operation is concerned", said the official.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting it was resolved that the issue of Alliance
Air should be addressed separately among Ajas share holders.
</P>
<P>
On privatisation, the meeting recommended that Kenya Airways'
mode of privatisation, where possible, be used as a guide for the
privatisation of Uganda Airlines and Air Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On joint use of facilities, the chief executives recommended
that the East African Civil Aviation Academy, Soroti of Uganda
and the East African school of aviation, Nairobi of Kenya be
taken up by member states as regional projects for which donor
assistance could be effective sources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had also agreed on enhanced efforts towards tariff
harmonisation and schedule co-ordination.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by the Managing Director of the Kenya
Airways, Mr. Brain Davies, Acting General Manager of the Uganda
Airlines, Mr. Dunstan Turinawe and the Acting Managing Director
of the Air Tanzania, Mr. Dominic Rwehunbiza.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand to Cooperate in Stemming Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand today pledged to
continue to cooperate with Malaysia to stem the influx of illegal
immigrants along their common border.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is here to
attend the 39th Malaysia-Thailand General Border Committee (GBC)
meeting, said today "we are trying our best because we understand
how the problem could burden Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, who is also defense minister, said Thailand is also
facing an illegal immigrant problem, with an estimated 500,000
illegal immigrants in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities have tightened checks and issued less than
3,000 transit visas so far this year to foreigners from countries
which required the document to enter Malaysia, Chavalit told a
joint news conference with Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid
Albar who led the Malaysian delegation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said Bangladeshi and Myanma nationals were among the
biggest groups of foreigners traveling by land through Thailand to
enter Malaysia in search of work.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Malaysia was satisfied with the efforts taken
by Thailand to control the illegal immigrant problem.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian immigration authorities launched a massive
legalization exercise for illegal foreign workers last year but
there are still estimated one million illegal foreign workers in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Malaysia and Thailand had agreed to continue
socio-economic activities and social programs along their 647 km
long common border to ensure mutual security, stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the meeting that the next GBC meeting shall
be held in Thailand next year.

<HEADLINE> Lin Zexu Foundation to Carry on Combat against Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Xu Jimei, vice-president of the Lin
Zexu Foundation, said that the group will carry forward the battle
against drugs in the name of its founder, who ordered the burning
of some 1,190 tons of opium in Humen in south China's Guangdong
Province in 1840.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zexu was an imperial envoy of the Qing Dynasty government
(1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The foundation was formally founded on November 6, 1995 in
memory of the man who pioneered the fight against the infiltration
of opium from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the foundation has received donations worth more
than ten million yuan (1.2 million US dollars), financing some TV
series, publications and various activities in honor of Lin Zexu.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the foundation will continue to fund
activities of significance in the fight against drugs, conduct
investigations on the use of drugs among young people, set aside
money to award institutions and individuals who excel in their
work to combat drugs, and promote the research on medicine used in
the rehabilitation of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are now as many as one million drug
addicts. Almost 80 percent of them are young people, the figures
show.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine, heroin and the drug "ice" have been discovered in
China, which have the same addictive qualities as opium.
</P>
<P>
The central government has been emphasizing the importance of
the problem. The National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, passed laws in December, 1990, to aid in the
crackdown upon drugs.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Greater Efforts for Treasury Bond Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Two senior financial and banking
officials said here today that greater marketing efforts are
needed to ensure that all of this year's treasury bonds are sold
out in time.
</P>
<P>
"China's treasury bond issue has gone smoothly in the first
half of this year, but to fulfill this year's quota we must work
still harder," Vice-Minister of Finance Liu Jibin said at a
televised meeting today on the floatation of government bonds.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that a total of more than
85.7 billion yuan in certificate bonds had been sold nationwide by
June 3, about 69.68 percent of the announced amount.
</P>
<P>
The sales of other varieties of treasury bonds have basically
been normal, Liu added.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the practice of issuing treasury bonds in
1981. Its annual issue has been growing rapidly in recent years,
from 19 billion yuan in 1991 to more than 196 billion yuan last
year. This year's government bond issue has been budgeted at more
than 248.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, China has offered three batches of treasury
bonds, totaling 60 billion yuan in unregistered bonds and 123
billion yuan in certificate bonds.
</P>
<P>
Shang Fulin, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, said today that the certificate bonds are likely to
be sold out before the issue closes on October 20, as there are
still more than four months to go.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that sales of the certificate bonds, in
either two, three or five years, have slowed since March, the
first month when they were available.
</P>
<P>
The sales of treasury bonds of different terms are also
unbalanced, he noted, adding that the two-year bonds have turned
out to be the most welcomed while the five-year bonds are the
least favored.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 86 percent of the 25 billion yuan in
two-year bonds has been snapped up, compared with only 53 percent
for the five-year bonds, which are also valued at 25 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
Shang attributed the slowdown in bond sales to a capital
diversion to a surging stock market since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
A huge capital inflow into the stock market is a major factor
affecting the smooth floatation of treasury bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stock indices had soared more than 45 percent each at
China's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen before the
publication of a government regulation banning state enterprises
and listed companies from speculating in stocks on May 12.
</P>
<P>
Shang added that another important reason for the slowdown in
bonds sales is an expanded planned issue of corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
China has officially set this year's quota of corporate bonds
at 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An widely overlapping availability period of corporate bonds
and treasury bonds in the first half of this year combined with a
higher interest rate for the corporate bonds have made treasury
bonds less attractive to investors, Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Both officials said that more should be done to complete the
floatation of treasury bonds already announced, as another 60
billion yuan in government bonds will have to be issued in the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The issuing speed must be accelerated in order to sell out all
bonds when the year ends, they urged.
</P>
<P>
"The floatation of treasury bonds is a important issue that has
a bearing on the overall situation of the economic work," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shang said that the successful completion of the
treasury bond issues will be in the interest of meeting the
objectives of the financial and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
It also will help reduce investment risks, the deputy central
bank governor noted.

ZHENGZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minorities in central
China's Henan province have made big contributions to local
economic development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Kiwi Preserving Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A new technique that can preserve
kiwi for over six months has been developed by Chinese scientists
in Henan province, with aids from United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Using a low-pressure ethylene air conditioning process, the
preserving period for kiwi has been extended from three months to
more than six.
</P>
<P>
Kiwi, the so-called "king of fruits," sells well in domestic
and overseas markets. China has an annual kiwi output of 50
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
However, preservation of the fruit has created a headache for
many kiwi growers, particularly those in east China's Henan
province, who annually lose 30 million yuan (some 3.7 million US
dollars) as a result of problems in the preservation process.
</P>
<P>
The international cooperative project, one of the state's key
scientific research plans listed by the State Science and
Technology Commission, was launched by the Henan provincial
government and the biology institute attached to the Henan Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The new technique was developed after a 12-year effort.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have so far successfully applied their new
technique to preserve 200,000 kilograms kiwi for six months, a
pilot experiment that could be adopted in preserving large amounts
of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
Henan also built China's first kiwi low-pressure ethylene air
conditioning storehouse in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Comparing with the traditional cold storage or low oxygen
preserving methods, the new technique achieves better result,
is cost-effective, and has a longer preserving period.

<HEADLINE> Building A Forest Park Instead Of Luxury Villas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A forest park in Shaxian County in
Fujian Province, east China, is expected to open this month, now
that the county government vetoed any building of luxury villas on
that spot.
</P>
<P>
The 40-ha Shayang Forest Park has plenty of trees and flowers
and more than 20 scenic spots added, including an outdoor swimming
pool, a children's garden, and a forest dining hall.
</P>
<P>
Local people are eagerly awaiting the opening, but there would
have been no opening at all if county officials had agreed and let
developers have their way in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The widening of national Highway 205 left nearly six ha of open
ground on Fenghuang Mountain, which is near the county seat, so
some departments decided to build luxury villas there. The county
authorities had other ideas however, saying that they would rather
have a place of leisure for ordinary people than a lot more money.
</P>
<P>
So, some experts were invited to do the planning and design a
forest park. Work began on it in 1995.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Make Aid Accessible to African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Economics Association of Zambia
(EAZ) has urged the European union (EU) to channel its aid
through local commercial banks for easy access by peasants of
recipient African countries.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted EAZ national coordinator Amos
Nakalonga as saying that the EU is currently channeling its aid
through its institutions like the European Investment Bank and
the European Development Fund which make money exclusively
available to commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Since the EU grants and loans are made through these
institutions and aimed at alleviating poverty in the developing
world, it is imperative that funds be channeled through
commercial banks which are easily accessible to all citizens,"
said Nakalonga.
</P>
<P>
"This can be better than the specialized cartels which create
closed clubs, making money exclusively available to commercial
farmers without any trickle to the peasants and deserving
non-government organizations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU could consider propping up national chambers of
commerce and other organized groups who will be, as a united
regional body, ready to spearhead negotiations, Nakalonga said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Urged to Cooperate in Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Acting Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today called upon the ASEAN countries to
migrate in stages from technology recipients to technology
providers in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
There should be more active collaboration among leaders of
industry, academicians and experts from the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries to provide policy guidelines
and blueprint for the sector, he said while opening the first
ASEAN Energy Forum here today.
</P>
<P>
He said a steady economic growth has continued to fuel
impressive energy demand in the ASEAN region, which currently
stands at 140 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) and is
expected to increase to 460 MTOE in the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Anwar urged the ASEAN countries to position themselves
strategically to tap new areas of growth in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
He said "as a long term project, we also should endeavor to
make the region the regional energy center of excellence with a
fully developed energy sector including all upstream and
downstream activities."
</P>
<P>
To make it a reality, he said, serious attention should be
given towards the development of international connectivity among
the ASEAN countries in terms of the ASEAN grid and for an
integrated ASEAN gas pipeline network.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said one of the key aspects that would
contribute towards the goal and in the process enhance the
region's competitiveness is the development of a modern, secure
and reliable energy system.
</P>
<P>
The future of the energy sector in the ASEAN region would
depend on how the vast opportunities for the local, regional and
global fronts are being capitalized on, he said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day forum, organized by the Association of Independent
Power Producers of Malaysia, was attended by more than 200 experts
and leaders of industry in the energy sector from the ASEAN region
which covers Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam as well as Myanmar, Cambodia and
Laos which are set to Join ASEAN in this July.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Netanyahu's Plan on Final Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has rejected the plan on the final
Israeli-Palestinian settlement put forward by Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza upon returning from an African
tour late Wednesday, PNA President Yasser Arafat denounced the
Netanyahu's plan for violating the Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreements. He added this was another blow to the deadlocked
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu presented the plan to the inner cabinet for
discussion Wednesday, in which he envisioned retaining control
over the strategic borders, Greater Jerusalem, settlements, water
resources and key roads in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu dubbed his proposal as the "Allon-Plus plan" -- an
enlarged version of the original formula proposed by late Israeli
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon after the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qurie, speaker of the Palestinian Council, also rejected
the plan. "This is not a basis for negotiations on a final
agreement," said Qurie, who played a major role in the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
"The three prerequisites for peace were solution of the Arab
refugee problem, termination of the Israeli occupation that began
in 1967, and definition of the nature of the relations between
Israelis and Palestinians, in particular, with the Arabs, in
general," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu's plan was
based on what he thought to be "a broad consensus that exists
within the Israeli public" and was aimed at gaining popular
support in the nation.
</P>
<P>
But PNA Cabinet Secretary-General Ahmed Abdel Rahman said
Netanyahu's plan was meant to suppress and terrorize the
Palestinian people in Jerusalem. PNA Finance Minister Mohammed
Nashashibi said the "Allon-plus plan" smacks of Nazi ideology and
reflects Hitler's belief on national security.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu plan was similar to the detailed map on final
settlement disclosed by the Hebrew press last Thursday, in which
Israel will retain over 60 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
This is much less than the 90 percent required by the PNA,
which hopes to establish an independent state with East
Jerusalem as capital in the final arrangements. Israel's current
hardline government has ruled out the redivision of Jerusalem
and establishment of a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Carrying Out Re-employment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More laid-off workers are getting
new jobs in Beijing with help from the re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of four programs: job introduction,
professional skill training, social insurance and labor service
companies.
</P>
<P>
The project was carried out last year, with more than 20,000
laid-off workers finding new jobs through 239 job introduction
agencies and more than 200 job introduction fairs.
</P>
<P>
Professional skill training played an important part in helping
people find jobs. A labour force of more than 80,000 people
received training last year, and 80 percent of them found
employment.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of labor-service enterprises has provided
more employment opportunities, helping 20,100 people find jobs
last year, and this year the industry is expected to provide more
than 50,000 job positions.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment insurance system provides basic guarantees for
laid offs' lives. An unemployment relief fund of 11.43 million
yuan (about 1.1 million US dollars) was offered to 11,150 laid-off
workers last year.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government's goal is to help more than 60 percent
laid-off workers get reemployed this year, and keep the registered
unemployment rate below two percent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Troupe to Stage Women War Victims in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Bunkaza Troupe will stage
a three-act drama based on "Sandakan Brothel No. 8" in the Beijing
Theatre on June 21 and 22, to mark the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
"Sandakan Brothel No.8 -- An Introduction to the History of
Women at the Lowest Level of Japanese Society" was a report
written by Japanese writer Tomoko Yamazaki in 1972. It described
miserable life of under-age women who were sold abroad to be
prostitutes by Japanese militarists who tried to allocate money
for war at the beginning of this century.
</P>
<P>
"Sandakan Brothel No.8" unveiled crimes Japanese militarists
committed toward the world people including Japanese during the
war. It was adapted into both a movie and a drama in
mid-1970s. The movie was introduced to China in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Sandakan Brothel No.8" attracted attention again recently when
the issue of "comfort women" has been made public.

<HEADLINE> New Delhi Tops in Air Pollution: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- With emission of nearly 1,400
tons of pollution everyday, New Delhi, capital of India, is the
most air polluted city in the country, said a latest study by
Indian industry and business circles.
</P>
<P>
The study is prepared for a conference entitled "cleaner air",
which is being held here today to mark the world environment day.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total pollution load in the capital, as much as
1,050 tons is caused by 2.8 million vehicles. The industrial
pollution emitted from three thermal power plants, a large number
of brick kilns and other industrial units amounts to roughly one
third of the total air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Bombay, with 650 tons of vehicle pollution load everyday, ranks
second to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The main pollutants emitted from automobiles are particulate
matter, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The study recommended a number of measures to combat air
pollution caused by vehicles such as enforcement of stricter
vehicular emission norms and use of cleaner fuels.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Wins Second Match in NBA Final Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls took a 2-0 lead
in the NBA final series with a 97-85 victory over Utah Jazz here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan, the last-second hero of game one on Sunday,
finished just one assist shy of his first finals triple double
with 38 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
The victory means that the Bulls, seeking their fifth title in
seven years, go to Salt Lake City for the next three games in the
seven-game series with their home court advantage intact.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Jazz, whose formidable home record in the regular
season included a victory over Chicago, win all three games, they
would have to come back to Chicago and win at least once to close
out the series.
</P>
<P>
Only twice in NBA history has a team lost the first two games
of the finals and rallied to win the title. It was most recently
done by Portland in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Utah's NBA Most Valuable Player Karl Malone suffered a dreadful
night shooting, hitting only 6-of-20 field goal attempts. He
finished with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek added 19 for the Jazz before he fouled out with
just over a minute left in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> ROUND-UP: United Africa to Develop Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Unite to meet challenges and
develop economy. This is the common stand reached by leaders of
African countries at the just concluded 33rd summit conference of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
During the OAU summit from June 2 to 4, the African Economic
Community (AEC) was officially inaugurated by leaders of African
countries to promote the process of economic integration on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the economies of African countries have
developed in an encouraging way with the improvement of political
environment on the continent, though there are still conflicts,
strifes and violences in some parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic organizations, such as the East African
Cooperation, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have taken
measures to promote regional cooperation and economic integration
to jointly develop their economies.
</P>
<P>
In such an encouraging circumstance comes the establishment of
the African Economic Community that is geared to become a force
in ridding the continent of poverty and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
This move vindicates the belief of successive generations of
African leaders that Africa could never be independent unless it
took responsibility for its economic and political destiny.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who is also the new OAU
executive chairman, said at the first AEC summit that the
establishment of the highest organ of the AEC constituted a
standard by which Africa's future economic policies would be
judged by Africans and outsiders.
</P>
<P>
The AEC takes regional integration bodies as its pillars. In this
way, African countries are joining together to respond to the fierce
challenges in the world economic arena.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the AEC shows the will of unity of African
countries in developing their economies, which will surely push
forward the economic progress in the continent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province, one of North
China's major grain producers, expects an imminent bumper wheat
harvest after expanding its wheat growing area to its largest
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Li Lianxi, a provincial agricultural official, said that
Hebei's wheat growing area was increased by nearly 100,000 ha to
2.687 million ha, and that farmers chose to grow more wheat this
year because last year's severe flood had created good moist
condition in the soil.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, which usually suffers droughts every year, is enjoying
abundant rainfall this spring, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributes strengthened combat against
insects and wheat disease to a certain bumper harvest. He added
that farmers will soon start cutting in the wheat.

NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,600 million rupees
(194.12 million U.S dollars) were swindled off by 28 nationalized
banks during the period between March 1993 and March 1996,
according to a recent internal report of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office is reported to have asked all the
investigating agencies to look into the various scams and submit a
status report at the earliest. These developments followed the CRB
Group scam in which several hundred crores of public money were
swindled.
</P>
<P>
The country's Punjab National Bank (PNB) tops the list of banks
involved in scams. As many as 269 cases were registered against
the bank which has swindled more than 560 million rupees (16.47
million dollars). The second on the list is the State Bank of
India (SBI) against which as many as 1,868 cases were filed and
the amount of money involved is more than 490 million rupees
(14.41 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report also states that 77 cases were registered against
Indian nationalized banks in foreign countries and the money
swindled was about 600 million rupees (17.65 million dollars). The

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Concerned Over Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) khaleda Zia has expressed concern over some reported
activities by some Indians inside Bangladeshi territory, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting news reports on landing of an Indian helicopter at a
village in Habiganj, the former prime minister claimed all its
passengers were military personnel, but the government is yet to
give any explanation or formally protest it.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unholy and dangerous exercise that a foreign fighter
could safely intrude into our airspace, safely landed, stayed and
took off without obstruction," the opposition leader told a
function marking the 12th anniversary of the daily Inqilab, an
influential newspaper, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zia also suspected that an agreement giving a corridor to India
might have been signed.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned a recent meeting of some Indian officials with
the divisional commissioner of northern Mymensingh, noting that
the officials came by road through the Haluaghat border and
returned by the same way.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, it raises the question whether the agreement to
give a corridor to India has already been signed," the BNP
chairperson said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader has been accusing the government of
selling out state sovereignty to India.
</P>
<P>
Zia expressed her deep concern at those news reports and over
the silence of the government. "The government has neither given
any explanation nor protested the news items regarding the
security-related matters," she added.

Entrepreneurs who invest over 350,000 U.S. dollars or whose
products are mostly sold abroad will be exempted from income tax
and import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The decree also allows foreign investors to send their foreign
currency incomes abroad and bans nationalization and requisition

Overseas buyers of Romanian company stocks will pay a lower
profit tax of one percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gov't Agencies Urged to Buy Local Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's national car "Timor"
has been official sedan for government officials and state
company executives since April, a cabinet minister said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said here last night that "for this year, the
budgetary directives include a ruling that if government offices
need passenger cars for official use, they must buy national cars,
which is the Timor sedan," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo
said government offices and state-owned firms would soon be
required to buy Timor sedans to prop up the national car's
slumping sales.
</P>
<P>
But Ginandjar said that the ruling had already taken effect
with the beginning of this 1997/98 fiscal year from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the ruling was based on the understanding that
the government -- which included state firms owned by provincial
and regional administrations -- should naturally support a
national program it had designed.
</P>
<P>
The national car program, launched in February 1996, grants
tariff and luxury sales tax exemptions to national cars on
condition that their local content rises to 60 percent in three
years.
</P>
<P>
However, only a joint venture between Pt. Timor Putra Nasional
and South Korean Kia Motors is qualified to produce national cars
until 1999.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the European Union have taken Indonesia's national
car policy to the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement
body.

<HEADLINE> Pollution in Nepali Capital Hazardous to Health: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Air and noise pollution in some
areas of this capital city of Nepal is significantly high with
possible health risks to local residents, a Nepali institute said
today.
</P>
<P>
A recent study in Kathmandu found that the level of dust
concentration in the air is 1,053 micro-grams per cubic meter,
over four times the acceptable level set by the World Health
Organization (WHO), according to the Nepal Environment and
Scientific Services (NESS).
</P>
<P>
Under the WHO air quality guidelines, the acceptable level is
230 micro-grams per cubic meter for suspended particles, the NESS
said in its study report made public here today.
</P>
<P>
The risky level of dust in the air may cause some health
hazards like common cold, cough, asthma. Sore throats and
bronchitis, it said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the noise levels at some places in the Kathmandu
Valley range from 63 to 76 decibel, the NESS study said, adding
that 60 decibel of noise could be harmful for health.
</P>
<P>
The study cited the increasing number of vehicles, unnecessary
honking of vehicles, poor road condition and lack of noise control
regulations as main causes of the high noise pollution level in
the city.
</P>
<P>
It also found that the Bagmati, a major river runs through
Kathmandu, has become a "sewage" as some 95 percent of its flow
comes from the toilets of local houses.
</P>
<P>
NESS researchers in their report suggested that the government
should take effective policy and regulatory measures to control
the worsening pollution situation in the capital.

BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of high-end
textile and garment products jumped 22.8 percent to 307 million US
dollars) in the first quarter this year when compared with the

<P>
Narongchai was quoted today by local press as saying that the
high-end textile were exported under quota agreements with Canada,
the European union, Norway and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said the better export performance were mainly due to
economic upturns in the importing countries. It was also due to
the fact that exporters had successfully upgraded their products
from low-end to high-end status.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's exports of low-end goods slowed 20
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Narongchai said his ministry was promoting those products in
neighboring Indochina to try to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the major markets for Thailand's low-end garments
were Eastern Europe and the Middle East but these regions have
increasingly been buying cheaper goods from China, Indonesia and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not Fully Ready for Finance Liberalization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has not been ready for
full liberalization of its financial sector, as the country
currently sees some competitive disadvantages in the sector, Thai
Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made this remark here on Tuesday in response to
pressure from the US government which is pushing Thailand to open
its financial sector to foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Narongchai said that Thailand would cooperate with all
members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to work out steps
for future liberalization of the finance sector.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a timetable for that, which will be followed
strictly, he was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the US government reportedly sent a letter to Thai
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan, calling
for Thailand to allow foreign financial institutions to freely
engage in various financial businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the Thai government to guarantee the security of
foreign investment in the sector, or at least to grant privileges
under the most-favored-nation framework for business expansion in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
However, Amnuay replied that no developing country could accede
to such requests due to the big competitiveness gap with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The WTO reportedly will be receiving the financial
liberalization commitments and timetables from all of its members
by December this year.

Britain were caught on the counter-attack as Katrine Powell

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, Jane 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Hi-Tech Park in south
China's Guangdong province is becoming one of the key zones for
overseas funds in the area.
</P>
<P>
The place now has more than 200 hi-tech enterprises, most of
which are involved in communications, computers, medicines, and
new materials.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, of 34.76 billion yuan (4.3 billion US dollars) in
total output in Shenzhen's hi-tech sector, nearly 20 percent came
from the park.
</P>
<P>
Li Zibin, the city's mayor, recently told a press conference
that Shenzhen will develop its hi-tech sector even more, and that,
"the development of the hi-tech sector should be viewed as a new
economic growth mechanism for Shenzhen's overall economy."
</P>
<P>
The park is located in the west of the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone and has a number of research institutes, including
Shenzhen University, the Shenzhen-Qinghua Institute, and the
national electrical engineering center.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, electronic information,
bio-engineering, new materials, and optically-controlled machine
tools are the park's four major industries, and that electronics
has a certain advantage there.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this year the proportion the hi-tech sector holds
in Shenzhen's total industrial output is expected to be 32
percent, up 3.3 percentage points from last year.

<HEADLINE> United Opposition Taking Shape in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A united opposition party is taking
shape in the Philippines as four opposition parties have finally
agreed to merge and field a common candidate for the 1998
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The four parties, after negotiations, agreed Wednesday to
formally launch the United Opposition on June 11, on the eve of
the country's commemoration of Independence Day, the Manila Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United Opposition will include the Partido ng Masang
Pilipino party (PMP), Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (Laban), the
People's Reform Party (PRP) and the Nationalist People's
Coalition, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The four parties also decided to select a common candidate
against the formidable ruling Lakas-NUCD party in the 1998 polls.
They gave up the traditional convention-type selection, and
instead adopted a new method under which all presidential hopefuls
will have an equal and fair chance to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada of the PMP, Senator Edgardo
Angara of Laban and Miriam Defensor-Santiago of PRP are the main
aspirants for the Presidency in the opposition bloc.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough of unifying the four parties came at the heel
of Estrada's resignation Wednesday as the chairman of the
Presidential Anti-Crime Commission. By taking the move, Estrada
severed all ties with the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lakas-NUCD party immediately scoffed at the future
of the proposed United Opposition, calling it a "transient and a
fleeting arrangement".

<HEADLINE> OAS Backs Argentina's Peaceful Solution to Malvinas Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 27th General Assembly of the
Organization of American States (OAS) has expressed its support
for Argentina's way to seek a peaceful solution to the dispute
over the Malvina (Falkland) Islands dispute.
</P>
<P>
The assembly being held in Lima approved a statement on the
question of the Malvina Islands whose sovereignty remains a source
of controversy between Argentina and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in 1988 the OAS asked the governments
of Argentina and Britain to resume negotiations and come up with a
peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The OAS assembly expressed satisfaction with the reaffirmation
of Argentina's willingness to continue exploring all possible ways
to a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the OAS has decided to continue
examining the question until a definitive solution is reached.
</P>
<P>
Before the statement was approved, Martinez Rios, the
representative for Argentina, said that the recovery of the
Malvina Islands is of great significance for the people and
government of his country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain has not responded in a positive way to
Argentina's willingness to resume dialogue on the Malvinas issue.
</P>
<P>
He declared that Argentina remains convinced that only
negotiations can lead to a resolution of this matter.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's position is backed by several OAS member countries,
including Paraguay, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Venezuela and Brazil,
whose representatives agreed on the need for Argentina and Britain
to resume talks to solve the controversy over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain began to fight in April 1982 for the
sovereignty of the islands, which located to the east of the
strait of Magellan in South America and 550 kilometers off the
east coast of Argentina. In June, Britain regained control over
the islands. Since then the United Nations General Assembly has
asked the two countries to negotiate on the dispute. But they have
failed to reach any agreement on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Control Efforts Paid-off along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China's eight years of soil
erosion control efforts along the upper branch of the Yangtze
River have reaped some positive results, with marked improvement
in the regional ecological environment and the local residents'
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently-closed working meeting on soil erosion
control, a total of 630 million yuan (nearly 80 million US
dollars) has been spent on the work over the past eight years,
putting 45,800 sq km of eroded land under control.
</P>
<P>
In addition to an ecological forest, nearly 460,000 ha of fruit
trees and other trees grown for special economic purposes have
been planted along the upper branch of Yangtze River, which
includes seven provinces and Chongqing municipality, according to
a source from the conference.
</P>
<P>
In Xihe County of northwest China's Gansu province, the soil
erosion control effort has helped to increase the per capita grain
output by 22 percent and helped 150,000 people shed poverty.
</P>
<P>
The projects centering on the upper branch of the Yangtze began
in 1988, when experts estimated that 35 percent of the total land
area in the region suffered from soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The program also plays a key role in checking sand silting in
the Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> Operation Under Way To Clean Up Pearl River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Pearl River, south China's main
water system and supplier of 80 percent of Hong Kong's drinking
and industrial water, is expected to have the quality of its water
further improved to meet higher standards.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry has vowed to consolidate the
ecological environment in the area by speeding up construction of
the Pearl River Shelter Forestry Project in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong provincial government also plans to renovate
polluting industries along the river and other waters, calling it
a "clean-water plan", today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
With efforts made in the last two years, half the Pearl River
water is now drinkable and usable, compared with a rate of some 30
percent in 1995, according to a new national environment
communique.
</P>
<P>
But with forestry coverage decreasing along the Pearl River,
water and soil erosion is serious, and water is deteriorating,
said Li Shidong, an official with the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry vowed annual increases in its investment in the
Pearl River Shelter Forestry Project as Hong Kong returns to its
motherland, aiming to improve the fragile ecological environment
of the area.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated last year, the project is one of the ministry's 10
big ecological projects.
</P>
<P>
It involves 177 cities and counties in Guangdong, Yunnan and
Guizhou provinces, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. When the
first phase is completed in 2010, 1.2 million hectares of forests
will be added to the region, bringing the forestry coverage rate
from 35 percent to almost 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
"South China and especially Hong Kong will greatly benefit from
the ecological improvement," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Budgeted at 480 million yuan (57.8 million US dollars), the
project is on a trial basis in 13 counties with a two million yuan
(240,000 dollars) central government investment last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry plans to put five million yuan
(602,000 dollars) into the project this year. Provincial and local
governments will contribute an equal amount of money.

<HEADLINE> Old Chinese Revolutionary Area Becomes Grain Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The once harsh and adverse conditions
of the Loess Plateau of northwest China's Shaanxi province have
been conquered at a number of successful grain production bases.
</P>
<P>
The three prefectures and cities of Yulin, Yan'an, and
Tongchuan -- all former Chinese revolutionary bases in northern
Shaanxi -- produced 2.5 billion kg of grain last year, with the
average per-ha of maize output reaching 6,090 kg, 1,890 kg more
than the provincial average.
</P>
<P>
The area is rich in land resources, accounting for 56 percent of
the province's total farmland. But random reclamation worsened the
eco-system, and as a result local people lived a meager life for
many years.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, Yan'an began to develop ecological
agriculture by reclaiming forest areas from farmland and growing
high-profit forests instead to improve the environment and promote
diversified management.
</P>
<P>
The city has built about 86,000 ha of high-quality apple yards,
and its forest coverage rate has risen to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sandy Yulin Prefecture has basically fixed its 570,000 ha
of quicksand area, and cultivated nearly 100,000 ha of high-yield
farmland out of it, with 12,000 kg of per-ha grain output.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an and Yulin alone are expected to produce three billion kg
of grain by the end of the century.

</P>
<P>
The study reviewed the records of more than 75,000 newborns
from 1991 through 1993, finding that the number of birth defects
among war veterans' children was virtually the same as the risk
among civilians.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study, conducted by the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research, were published in today's issue of the New
England of Journal.
</P>
<P>
Many Gulf War veterans have complained of a variety of
unexplained symptoms, including fatigue, diarrhea, memory problems
and trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
Some also worry that their war exposure harmed their
reproductive health, making them more likely to have babies with
serious birth defects.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 1.9 percent of Gulf War veterans' babies
had severe birth defects, identical to the number among veterans
who did not serve in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Big US Auto Makers to Build Ethanol-Burning Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ford Motor Company, the No. 2
American auto maker, announced Tuesday that it would begin
building 250,000 cars, mini-vans and pickup trucks annually that
can burn ethanol or gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The decision was described by the New York Times in a report
today as "the largest alternative fuel program in the United
States since the oil crises of the 1970's produced alarm about
American reliance on imported oil."
</P>
<P>
Ford officials characterized their announcement as part of a
corporate commitment to clean air. The company hoped that the
sharp increase in the availability of ethanol-burning vehicles
would prompt more service stations to sell the fuel. Ford last
year produced just 5,000 such vehicles. Only 40 stations across
the country currently sell ethanol, which is grain-based alcohol
mixed with a little gasoline.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chrysler, th No. 3 auto maker in this
country, is expected to announce a similar program next week, and
General Motors, the No. one auto maker, is considering whether to
follow Ford and Chrysler's examples.

<HEADLINE> Ruehe Expects Bonn to Decide on Eurofighter in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
said today that he expected the Bonn government to decide on the
purchase of Eurofighter 2000 before Summer recess in July.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after meeting with his British counterpart
George Robertson at the exclusive military zone of Cologne/Bonn
airport that the cabinet might make the decision at a budget
meeting on July 11.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Robertson, Ruehe also voiced optimism
over a government decision in favor of buying the controversial
warplane while admitting that the financial difficulties facing
Bonn has made the deal more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is battling to meet the strict budget deficit and debt
limits required for joining the single European currency, the
euro, which is due to be launched from 1999. There remain doubts
over how to pay for the much-delayed Eurofighter.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, taking office in May after the Labour Party won the
British elections, stressed in the talks the continued interest of
the London government in the Eurofighter, saying London expected
serial production of the aircraft could start as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Italy and Spain have already approved the Eurofighter.
London plans to buy 232 Eurofighters, Rome 121 and Madrid 87. The
German armed forces intends to buy 180. The total price for the
four-nation project is estimated at over 65 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Germany's aerospace industry today urged a quick
government decision on the issue. Hans Eberhard Burke, head of
Germany's aerospace lobby (BDLI), said in Bonn that if the
government again delayed its decision on the Eurofighter in July,
German firms involved in the project would cease financing
preparatory work for production.
</P>
<P>
The main German firm involved is Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA).

<HEADLINE> Greece: Climate of Trust Necessary for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece today stressed the need of
cultivating "a climate of calm and trust" before the start of
direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities,
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
The direct talks between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will be held in New York
within the framework of efforts by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to seek a solution to Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said he hoped that the forthcoming direct talks would be
"fruitful."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Nicosia was contacting international
organizations charging that certain powers were trying to
undermine efforts for a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
"invaded" and occupied the northern third of the island in
response to a coup in Cyprus engineered by the junta then ruling
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The international communities have tried over the past 20 years
to find ways of resolving the Cyprus problem, but no progress have
been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Holbrooke New Cyprus Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday appointed high-profile diplomat Richard Holbrooke as
ambassador to Cyprus, signaling his administration's intention to
mediate for the settlement of an intractable dispute on the island
state.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns when he told reporters: "President Clinton has
named Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as the new U.S. special
presidential emissary on Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"This appointment of one of our most capable negotiators
demonstrates our commitment to help promote a final political
settlement on Cyprus," Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will replace Richard Beattie, named by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright last month as her adviser on
incorporating three foreign affairs agencies into the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkish troops
invaded the island in 1974 in response to a pro-Greek coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Turkish Cypriots, who account for about a quarter of
the island's 750,000 people, declared a breakaway state in the
north under the protection of 30,000 Turkish troops. The
international community except for Turkey does not recognize the
breakaway state.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the appointment of Holbrooke represented a "rebirth
and a renewal" of the U.S. mediation effort between the Greek and
Turkish communities on the island, but he expected no "imminent
breakthrough" in the settlement of disputes, which has put Greece
and Turkey, the two NATO members close to war.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that President Glafkos Clerides of Cyprus and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktashwere due to meet in July in
New York and he said Washington strongly urged all parties to work
for a comprehensive, permanent settlement on the island.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, 55, is well-known for his role in negotiating the
Dayton peace accords that ended a three-year civil war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Approves Renewal of Iraqi Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 4 (xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today approved the renewal of Iraqi "oil-for-food deal"
for another period of 180 days beginning on June 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the Security Council said
the renewal of the "oil-for-food deal" was aimed to alleviate the
humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated the commitment of all member countries
to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Chinese Acting Permanent Representative to
UN Wang Xuexian pointed out that the final goal of the current
action was to lift all the sanctions against Iraq, which was the
only way to solve the humanitarian crisis facing the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under UN sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in
August 1990, which have resulted in severe shortage of food,
medicine and other civilian needs. The UN Security Council
adopted Resolution 986 in April 1995, allowing Iraq to export 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over 180 days to purchase the
urgently needed civilian goods.
