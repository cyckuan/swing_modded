LAKERS STILL IN SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers are seven weeks into Project Triangle,
but if the results on the floor still look a little less than
geometrical, there's good reason for it. Masked behind a surprising
8-4 record is a team still learning on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we're at the fetus stage,'' guard Derek Fisher
said after practice Tuesday at the Forum. ``We've been going over
some things today, and even some of the things we've gone over a
number of times, we're still having a hard time being able to do in
a game-type setting, where it's intense and it's fierce, being able
to recall all these things mentally. That's why I would still say
we're in the very early stages of trying to get this thing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has given the Lakers the basic form of the
triangle offense to run, but there are dozens and dozens of
variations he has yet to introduce. Fisher said the Lakers already
have all they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a plethora of things I know their champing at the
bit to throw in there, but they're scared it will blow us up
mentally,'' Fisher said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the basics, the Lakers too often are thinking through
the offense, rather than simply reacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's quite a bit of thinking going on,'' Fisher
said. ``Our coaches are doing the best job they can do of letting
us know to go out there and just play basketball, and this offense
is only a format to play within. . . . It's on us as players to
just continue to learn. And until you get down what you need to get
down, you can't start to become creative with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means the new offense often looks like the old one _ come
up the floor, throw the ball in to Shaquille O'Neal in the low
post, then cut and move and wait for O'Neal to pass or shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows some of our limitations mentally that we aren't ready
to go out there and play the game in a creative type of way,''
Fisher said. ``And it also kind of shows how far we have to go. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it will be the latter part of the season, where we
aren't even thinking about what's going on out there. That's when
the offense is most effective, when you just run down the court and
flow. It's almost like you don't even recognize that there's a
triangle being set up. Right now we run down and everybody's like,
`OK, I have to get over here and then this guy's got to get there
and now we're OK.' We're looking to see if a triangle is formed. We
have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the winning percentage looks comfortable, Fisher
insisted: ``There's really no level of comfort. We haven't played
well. We've won games, but that's because we have Shaquille O'Neal
and we have Glen Rice, we have Rick (Fox). We've got guys that can
play games. We've been lucky for the most part. . . . We want to be
the best, and right now we aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding pattern: Jackson has hinted at changes to the starting
lineup but said he's unlikely to make any change for tonight's game
against the Utah Jazz. &QL;

GUN ATTACK AT SCHOOL IS THWARTED  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - In a case eerily reminiscent of the Columbine High
School massacre in Colorado, Phoenix police have thwarted what they
say was a plot by Moon Valley High School students to kill their
enemies during lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   An early-morning tip to police on Oct. 12 led to the arrests of
Christopher Michael Ciulla, and Matthew David Russ, both 16, on
charges of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, said Sgt. Jeff
Halstead, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When police confronted the teenagers on a northwest Phoenix
street, they found a backpack that contained a weapon, along with a
detailed map of a nearby house the students planned to burglarize
to obtain guns, Halstead said. The attack at the school was planned
for later that day during the first lunch period, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had missed them, they would have got the guns and been
on their way to school'' to carry out the shootings, Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla was spending the night at Russ' home when the tip came
in, Halstead said, and the suspects were arrested later that
morning a few blocks from Russ' home by officers who had them under
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kaiser, an attorney for Russ, said that his client did
not realize he was carrying a .22-caliber handgun in his backpack
and that Ciulla had access to the backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our opinion that he (Russ) prevented this tragedy from
happening,'' Kaiser said. ``He prevented Chris from moving forward
with these alleged crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ does not have a criminal record, Kaiser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind our son 100 percent,'' said James Russ, Matthew's
father. ``We believe him. He's always told me the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   James Russ said Ciulla was a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been sleeping at various houses,'' the father said.
``The first time I saw Chris was that morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gun, James Russ said, police found a mask and
a set of gloves in Matthew's backpack. If both teenagers were going
to carry out the killings, he said, then why weren't there two
masks and two sets of gloves?
</P>
<P>
   Matthew ``had no notion that these items were in there,'' his
father said.
</P>
<P>
   Halstead said detectives do not know how many fellow students
were targeted, and they have no clear motive.
</P>
<P>
   Police only know that Ciulla and Russ were part of a clique that
had a conflict with another clique at the high school, but the
run-in was never reported to authorities, Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy demonstrates a dangerous lack of communication
between students and their parents, Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other kids knew about this plan and never called police.
That's what they said at Columbine,'' he said. ``The kids knew
about it, and they were going to hang around and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The April massacre at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., left
15 people dead and nearly a dozen injured. The gunmen were members
of a clique known as the Trenchcoat Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla and Russ were suspended for two years from the Glendale
Union High School District and will never be allowed to attend Moon
Valley High again, said Carole Sabo, a district spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Columbine, we've been pretty hyper across the
country,'' said Richard Stapley, a school board member who declined
to discuss the case in detail. ``We're trying to keep an eye on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several parents watching a soccer game at the school Tuesday
night, Nov. 23, were upset when they heard about the plot. They
also were concerned that the district didn't inform them. Late
Tuesday, Sabo said a letter will be sent home to parents notifying
them of the incident. Kevin Jones, 16, a junior at Moon Valley, was
told about the plot by a teacher during class shortly after it
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was crazy. I thought it was like Columbine. You
could just be sitting in class, and someone could just come in and
start shooting,'' he said. ``It's nuts. You don't know who can have
a gun anymore. Anyone can have a gun now.''
</P>
<P>
   The students who didn't report the plot probably thought that
the suspects were blowing hot air, Stapley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was just like Columbine, that they didn't think
anything was going to happen,'' Stapley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Hugh, another school board member, praised the tipster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever picked up that phone and made that call apparently
saved someone's life,'' Hugh said. ``I hope that sets a good
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Halstead declined to identify the tipster who called police at 4
a.m. that morning, but Kaiser said it was a fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   Ciulla and Russ were indicted Nov. 12 on the conspiracy charges.
Ciulla, who has a record, was charged with illegally possessing a
gun. The teens were arraigned Monday, Nov. 22, on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   They are being held in lieu of $200,000 bail and face a Jan. 14
hearing before Judge Stephen Gerst of Maricopa County Superior
Court. &QL;

2 WHITE TEENS CHARGED WITH MURDERING BLACK YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELKHART, Ind. _ Two white teen-agers were charged with murder on
Tuesday in what prosecutors say was the racially motivated random
shooting of a black teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   A local newspaper reported that one of the whites told friends
that he hoped the killing would win a membership for him in the
Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist prison gang, and the right
to wear its spider-web tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors brought the murder charges in Elkhart County Circuit
Court against Alex Witmer, 18, and his friend Jason Powell, 19, in
the killing of Sasezley Richardson, 19. Richardson was shot in the
head on Nov. 17 as he walked in a suburban residential area of this
blue-collar factory city in northern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he was returning on foot from a mall, where he
had bought diapers for his girlfriend's baby. He died on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a particularly heinous crime,'' said Mike Christofeno,
the chief deputy prosecutor in Elkhart County. ``This victim was
entirely random. It could have been any black person or any
minority person.''
</P>
<P>
   Christofeno read in court on Tuesday a police affidavit
reporting that Witmer and Powell had confessed to the crime. He
said the killing was racially motivated, but would not comment on
any possible connection with white supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was found bleeding on the side of the road by a
passer-by who has not been identified by the police. Witmer and
Powell were arrested on Saturday morning after a tip.
</P>
<P>
   The Elkhart County Branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People praised prosecutors on Tuesday for
identifying the killing as a ``true hate crime'' and called for
calm. They will sponsor a Thanksgiving Day prayer vigil at the site
of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was on foot because he had lost his driver's license
because of traffic fines, a friend, Tony Lewis, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Richardson had been working in a fast-food restaurant
to earn money to pay his fines and hoped to have his license
reinstated by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis bumped into Richardson a week ago, he said, and found his
friend happy and excited because he was turning his life around.
Richardson, who had dropped out of school, had been scheduled to
receive his high school equivalency certificate the day after he
was shot, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Richardson was generous and quiet, Lewis said: ``If he had
it, you had it. If you needed it, you got it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his friend ``didn't bother anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis continued, ``He was the quiet type. He wouldn't say too
much. For someone just to shoot him out of nowhere _ that is just
wrong. In fact, he'd turn and walk the other way if someone tried
to pick a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials said that Witmer had served time at
Plainfield Juvenile Correctional Facility for a handgun offense and
had been released in June.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has no criminal record. A neighborhood friend, Caleb
Johnson, said that Powell ``liked everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter what people were like,'' Johnson continued.
``He just liked people for who they were. I didn't think he'd get
involved in something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elkhart County police estimate that there are just under 100
members of the Aryan Brotherhood in the area. The local newspaper,
The Elkhart Truth, reported that Powell hoped to win a spider-web
tattoo that symbolizes that a member has killed a person of a
minority race. The paper reported that Witmer had told officers at
the county jail that he was a member of the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Aryan Brotherhood, which began in the California prison
system in 1967, is ``the biggest and hardest-edged prison gang,''
said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its members are in state prisons, Potok said.  &QL;

<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ Thousands of jubilant Muslims chanted prayers
to Allah, threw fists into the air and set off firecrackers Tuesday
as they defiantly laid the marble cornerstone of a mosque in the
shadow of the Basilica of the Annunciation.
</P>
<P>
   A nun in white, a monk in brown and a priest in black watched
the celebration glumly from the crenelated roof of the church,
which, like all the major churches in the Holy Land, had been
shuttered for two days in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of the Muslim majority here to build a mosque
adjacent to a central Christian pilgrimage site has not only
divided the once harmonious Israeli Arab town but strained Israel's
relations with the Vatican as the millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican on Tuesday issued a sharply worded criticism of the
Israeli government's decision to authorize the mosque in the
boyhood town of Jesus. But it did not mention any change in the
plans for Pope John Paul's visit to the Holy Land in March, a trip
that local Christian leaders here had said would be jeopardized if
the cornerstone were unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision of the Israeli government seems to lay the
groundwork for future contrasts and tensions between the two
religious communities, Christian and Islamic,'' said Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, the chief spokesman for the Vatican. ``I believe
that political authorities in this case have a great
responsibility, because instead of favoring unity, they created the
foundation to foment division.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's foreign ministry responded angrily later in the day,
saying, ``It's their unfortunate but time-honored habit of pointing
the finger of blame in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   At the eleventh hour before Tuesday's festivities, Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, worked unsuccessfully to dissuade
Muslim leaders from moving ahead with the project. It put him in an
unusual role, mediating not only between his fellow Muslims and the
Christian world, but between Israeli Arabs and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat fears that the troubles in Nazareth could harm his
plans to attract thousands of pilgrims to Palestinian-governed
Bethlehem and could sow religious discord among Palestinians.
Muslim leaders in Jerusalem also called on their counterparts in
Nazareth to cancel their plans, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The usually sleepy center of this northern Israeli town was
strung with balloons as a few thousand Muslim men filled the square
to pray and to bask in their accomplishment. With several of them
deliberately facing the church, they waved the green flags of the
Islamic Movement and released canisters of green smoke as speaker
after speaker heralded the day as a critical first step in
reclaiming Islamic land throughout Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's liberate al Aksa next,'' said Ahmed Abu Nawaf, who runs
the Islamic religious trust in Nazareth. He was referring to the
Jerusalem mosque that is one of Islam's holiest, and he held his
fingers aloft in a V.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of the unveiling, hundreds elbowed close to the
marble slab. When its textile cover, embroidered with verses from
the Koran, was lifted, the crowd went wild. They shouted ``Praise
to God,'' as the fireworks exploded so loudly that the nun on the
church roof covered her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should anyone be upset with us?'' asked Salman Abu Ahmad,
a local councilman who rode on the shoulders of his supporters.
``We are not building a dance hall or a casino. We are building a
house of prayer next to another house of prayer. May our city be
filled with blessing upon blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   A man wearing a T-shirt that said ``Islam is the solution''
smiled broadly in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israeli riot police officers, armed with truncheons,
tear-gas launchers and automatic rifles, were positioned around the
old city, but the celebration did not get out of hand. In fact,
many of the Christian-owned stores were shut and the Christians
stayed away from the old town center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle, because we are not Muslims and we are
not Christians,'' said an Israeli officer who would not give his
name. ``The Muslims are a lot stronger than the Christians, a lot
more deadly. Without the protection of the Jews, I don't think
there would be any Christians left here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious statement, given that Christian leaders accuse
the Israelis of disregarding Christians' interests because their
population is small. The leaders say that Israel gave in to the
demands of a small group of militant Muslims who were seen to
represent a large population of Israeli Arab voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of man does not depend on numbers,'' said
Archbishop Michel Sabbah, the Latin patriarch, who is the
highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric in Israel and the Palestinian
territories and who is from Nazareth. ``Because of neglect, we were
forgotten and put aside.''

KINGS SHOW NET LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With Stephane Fiset already sidelined more than two
weeks with an injured right hand, the groin injury suffered by
goalie Jamie Storr in the first period Tuesday has left the Kings
terribly thin at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Neill, a backup goalie for the Kings' minor-league
affiliate in Long Beach until Marcel Cousineau was called up to
replace Fiset, flew this morning to Dallas, where the Kings face
the Stars tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau and O'Neill each had 21 games of NHL experience
entering Tuesday's game. O'Neill was scheduled to fly to Utah today
where the Ice Dogs are playing in Salt Lake. If Storr is out but
not put on injured reserve, the Kings will have to make a roster
move to remain at 23 players.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jaroslav Modry would have to clear waivers to be sent
back to the minors. Center Jason Blake, right wing Brad Chartrand
and new defenseman Jere Karalahti would not have to clear waivers.
Tuesday night, Blake scored his first goal of the season on an
assist by Chartrand.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille improves: Luc Robitaille, expected to miss at least
the rest of the month with a fractured left foot, skated for the
second consecutive day and reported no discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille was sluggish on the ice Monday when he tested the
foot for the first time on the ice. He originally suffered the
injury Oct. 28 against Pittsburgh but played the next three games
until an MRI located the fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille was cleared to resume skating Monday morning at the
Kings' Iceoplex training facility after an MRI showed the break had
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille has maintained a rigorous conditioning program during
his time on injured reserve but probably will require a week to
regain his timing.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic back: Colorado center Joe Sakic, sidelined since Nov. 5
with torn cartilage in his rib cage, returned Tuesday against the
Kings with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Needing just two points to reach 1,000 for his career, Sakic had
the game's first goal, when he poked the puck past Storr with 12:08
gone in the opening period. It was his sixth of the season and
381st of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first five minutes, it was clear Sakic, who missed
six games including the Nov. 11 game at the Staples Center, was
back. Just 1:49 into the game, Sakic had an excellent scoring
chance in front after taking a pass from Milan Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes later, Sakic was alone in front of Storr
but was pulled down by defenseman Garry Galley. Despite the
power-play opportunity, the Avs did not score. The next time they
had the man advantage, with Steve McKenna off for interference,
Sakic scored.

 NAZARETH, Israel: put aside.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basilica is a modern building atop the ruins of a
12th-century Crusader Church, which sits on the site where
tradition says the angel Gabriel told Mary she was pregnant with
the child of God. On Tuesday its gates were locked, with a notice
posted explaining the conflict to ``all ambassadors, local
Christians, Christian pilgrims and travel agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church's locked gate, a local Christian man said he
feared that things would never again be the same in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind closed doors, everyone can express their feelings, but
not out here,'' he said, giving only his first name, Khameis.
``It's sad, though, shameful. We have the same language, the same
culture, the same foods. We grew up together, neighbors. That's
what hurts me, that these people I went to school with turned out
to be fundamentalists. What if we tried to put a church in Mecca,
their holy place?''
</P>
<P>
   A priest called the man away from the gates and cautioned him
not to talk. Any frank conversation was seen as inflaming tensions
in a city determined to proclaim to the world that nothing was
really wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Returning, the man called out to a friend passing by. ``See, he
is Muslim, he is my friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the nearby marketplace, Hamed Bana, who owns a shoe
stall, pointed to Rima Bana, who runs the neighboring clothing
store and who shares his last name but is not related. ``I'm a
Muslim and she's a Christian and she's like my daughter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Zoubi, another shopkeeper, said: ``It's important for the
leaders to start calming people down. What is done is done. Now we
will have a mosque and church side by side, just like in Jerusalem.
Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict here began as a very parochial issue at a very
scruffy site in the center of the largest Arab town in Israel,
where Muslims outnumber Christians about 42,000 to 18,000. Almost
two years ago, local leaders set out to build a millennial plaza in
the half-acre lot adjoining the basilica.
</P>
<P>
   They tore down a school, and then began to fight with local
Muslims over a tiny mosque that is believed to contain the holy
tomb of Shehab el-Din, who is venerated by association: His uncle
was Saladin, the Muslim hero who ousted the crusaders in the 12th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims erected a protest tent on the site, promised to
build a huge mosque, and a tug-of-war between religious and
political forces in the town ensued. It came to a boil last Easter
when an outburst of violence brought the friction between Muslims
and Christians to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government proposed _ and imposed _ a compromise to
build a small mosque, leaving some land for the intended plaza. The
compromise was initiated by the right-wing Likud government of
Benjamin Netanyahu and completed by the new centrist government of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But the compromise was not fully
accepted and led to the church protest. ``Each government erred out
of narrow party political interests,'' Ehud Olmert, the Likud mayor
of Jerusalem, said Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In protest, churches were closed for the second day Tuesday.
Tuesday morning, at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem,
an elderly woman, dressed entirely in black, crossed herself,
kneeled and kissed the sun-drenched wooden door several times. A
group of Polish pilgrims prayed silently outside the locked
entrance. A Belgian, Daniel Verschoore, said, winking, ``Maybe I'll
become a Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, Santos Nery, a visitor from Guatemala, stood on the
outskirts of the Muslim gathering studying the event. He had
intended to visit the basilica Tuesday, but shrugged off the
disappointment. ``I'll come back in the morning,'' he said, adding
that he would not begin to pass judgment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are different cultures, with different perspectives.
This country has its own way of doing things.''

FORMER PAROLE COMMISSIONER IS SENTENCED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former state parole commissioner was sentenced to
two years in prison Tuesday for lying to a federal grand jury
investigating allegations that New York Gov. George Pataki's
campaign aides promised early paroles in exchange for
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Sean McSherry, a former Bronx prosecutor,
violated a sacred public trust when he lied to a grand jury, and
his crime was more serious because he did so as a law enforcement
official, said Judge Nina Gershon of U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to the heart of the administration of justice,'' she
said before pronouncing sentence. ``The public is entitled to
confidence that when a parole commissioner testifies, he will do so
truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   McSherry, 47, was convicted of perjury and obstruction of
justice in August. Prosecutors said he had lied to investigators
and then to a grand jury about a 1996 parole hearing at which a man
convicted of armed robbery was given early parole.
</P>
<P>
   The robber, John Kim, is the son of the Rev. Nam Soo Kim, who
made sizable donations to the 1994 Pataki campaign. A special
assistant to the state Parole Board, Ronald Hotaling, pleaded
guilty in August to lying to federal authorities who were
considering Kim's release.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Tuesday that their investigation was
continuing. No one in the Pataki administration has been charged in
connection with the investigation of accusations of influence
peddling, and Pataki has said no one received favors from the board
in exchange for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in 1997 after the parents of a man
convicted with Kim said that a Pataki campaign aide and a
Korean-American businessman had guaranteed that their son would
gain an early parole if they contributed to Pataki's 1994 campaign.
Investigators later found letters and memos from the governor's
office to the parole board concerning Kim and two other
Korean-American inmates whose families contributed to the Pataki
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other two inmates were not granted early paroles. The
three-member parole board, headed by McSherry, ordered Kim
released; he had served four years of a 4-to-12-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators questioned McSherry last summer about the
hearing, he told them he could not remember anything about it. When
he was called before a federal grand jury, though, McSherry stated
that he recalled a verbal dispute with a parole officer, one who
prosecutors later proved had been on vacation at the time of the
hearing. He also said he could not recall whether he had known the
governor's office had a special interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing McSherry, Judge Gershon said that he had lied to
investigators and ``volunteered an elaborate and false story''
during his two appearances before the grand jury. Noting that
McSherry said during his trial that he believed the events occurred
as he had testified and that he had not deliberately lied to
anyone, the judge added that ``the jury verdict clearly reflects
their disbelief of this assertion.'' McSherry's lawyer, Diarmuid
White, said he had filed an appeal in the case.
</P>
<P>
   His client is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on Jan. 3
in a minimum-security federal prison.

IN AMERICA, EVERY DAY SHOULD BE A DAY TO GIVE THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This one's for those for whom thanks is an alien concept, those
never able or willing to look or walk on life's brighter side.
</P>
<P>
   They live on the dark side, where no blessing is worth
acknowledgment. For them, no incidence of good fortune is ever as
good as they think it should be.
</P>
<P>
   It's the malcontents who are most in my thoughts at this time of
year. They strive so mightily to avoid introspective reveries about
what they might be grateful for during this time of Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a recent preoccupation. It first began to enter my
consciousness back at Thanksgiving time in 1970 after returning
from a 14-year stay in the Far East, first as a soldier and later
as a newspaper journalist. The return to America and the challenge
of restarting a life and career had been difficult, but the first
Thanksgiving back was a special time because the new adventure was
beginning to show promise.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half a lifetime away from my native land, the
culture shock was a jarring experience. America not only was like a
foreign country compared with the one remembered, but it also was a
much better place. Prosperity was so widespread as to be
unremarkable, and most Americans took it for granted. Compared with
the mid-1950s America of West Virginia last known to me, America
seemed like the promised land when it came to material things.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, compared with many places of my acquaintance in Asia,
America was a paradise. What was shocking, however, was that so few
Americans seemed to appreciate how much better off they were than
whoever was in second place. Conversations with new colleagues and
friends were more likely to be dominated by complaints about how
lousy things were than how wonderful their life actually was
compared with anyone else's on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever this was pointed out, though, the reaction was
defensive. Well, yeah, the argument went, maybe so, but we're not
living in another country. We're living in America, and things
could be so much better than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Here it is 29 years later, and life is even better than it was
back then. The year 1970, as it turned out, ushered in a rough
decade no matter what economic role you happened to being playing
at any given time. Workers, investors and consumers all got
bulldozed by the triple whammy of bad economic times, bear markets
and hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   As usually happens in America, though, things got better. Lots
better. Since the early '80s no society in the history of human
existence has had a longer run of prosperity, by every measure of
such things.
</P>
<P>
   It was during those early months of rediscovering my homeland
that my Thanksgiving epiphany occurred. My personal pledge was that
no matter how tough things got, never to forget how the other half
lives based on remembered observations and experiences of those
years abroad.
</P>
<P>
   From these memories would come constant reminders of the
difference between bad and really bad. After you've seen really
bad, whatever economic misfortune America has to offer always seems
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving may be our national day of expressing gratitude for
life's blessings, but if you're lucky enough to live in America,
every day should be a day of thanksgiving.

H&AMP;R BLOCK REPORTS HIGHER SECOND-QUARTER LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Tuesday that its second-quarter loss widened
43 percent to $44.7 million, or 46 cents a share, because of
changed expense patterns in its tax operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City company also reported a 145 percent increase in
revenue to $209.9 million during the three months that ended Oct.
31. That was largely because of its acquisition in August of much
of the business and accounting services of McGladrey &AMP; Pullen LLC,
which made Block the nation's sixth-largest accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Block reported a loss of $31.2 million, or 31 cents a share, on
$85.6 million in revenue for last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Block often reports losses or small profits during its first
three quarters because those are slack times in the tax filing
season. The company is aggressively expanding beyond tax
preparation to even out that seasonal pattern, which affected the
results reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased expenses from U.S. tax operations and a decrease in
investment income were the two primary reasons for a higher net
loss this quarter,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni, Block's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Tax service expenses rose because Block has begun paying its
field managers higher salaries instead of big season-end bonuses.
The company also has made other changes that spread many previous
fourth-quarter-only costs through the rest of the year.

CENEX MEMBERS TURN DOWN PROPOSED MERGER WITH FARMLAND INDUSTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City-based Farmland Industries Inc. was left standing at
the merger altar Tuesday when the nation's second-largest farm
cooperative narrowly rejected a proposed union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprising setback, Farmland's top officer vowed to
continue the courtship of Minnesota-based Cenex Harvest States
Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too many economic benefits and market impact on our
owners to just give up at this point,'' said Harry Cleberg,
Farmland's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   With about 2,000 area employees, Farmland is the nation's
largest farmer-owned cooperative and one of the few Fortune 500
companies based in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The merger defeat comes as federal regulators are considering
whether to approve a $129 billion merger between Westwood-based
Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. Unlike the proposed Sprint
merger, under which the combined company would be based in Clinton,
Miss., the co-ops had planned to put their merged headquarters in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed by the vote,'' said Bob Marcusse,
president of the Kansas City Area Development Council. ``We hope
that whatever issues stood in the way are resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Each co-op needed support from two-thirds of its members to
merge. Although 89 percent of Farmland's members approved, only 64
percent of Cenex members voted to merge.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents cited concerns about Farmland's financial
condition and large merger-related payments to both co-op's
managers.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would have combined the co-ops into United Country
Brands as of March 1. Management on each side had said the merger
would help them compete better against even larger corporate
agricultural giants.
</P>
<P>
   Both co-ops will hold their annual meetings early next month.
Their continuing pursuit of a merger may depend on what happens at
those separate events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we don't have an answer to what happens next,'' said
Lani Jordan, director of corporate communications at Cenex Harvest
States.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said Cenex President Noel Estenson was not available for
comment Tuesday afternoon. He was rewriting his speech for the
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the Cenex vote made it clear that Cenex leaders
need to learn more about members' concerns before considering
future talks with Farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a slightly different message from our members. We need
to talk to them,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said 92 percent of Cenex's members cast votes. Only 70
percent had voted when the co-op was formed last year in a merger
between Cenex Inc. and Harvest States Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the supporting vote from Farmland's members
validated management's pursuit of the merger. It also encouraged
him to seek whatever economic ties the two large co-ops can
accomplish even if a merger doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the merger plan included agreements to combine
parts of their operations as joint ventures. Cleberg said that
those deals will have to be re-evaluated but that he wants to
pursue them as well as a merger.
</P>
<P>
   His first objective, he said, is to ``bring these companies
closer together even if it is not through a full and complete
consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the merger focused largely on Farmland's
above-average use of debt financing, a large potential tax
liability at Farmland and multimillion-dollar merger-related
payments to the top executives of both co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any of those factors might be altered to rekindle
interest in the merger, Cleberg said, ``Those are all
possibilities, and certainly everything will be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the merger was intended to help the farmer-owned co-ops
compete globally, Cleberg said the defeat won't compromise either
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither organization is backed to the wall right now,'' he
said. ``We're not in a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said they were as surprised as they were pleased by
the merger's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm happy. I thought it would pass,'' said Steve
Carney, a Montana farmer and Cenex director who worked against the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Carney had sent a letter, without Cenex approval or assistance,
to Cenex members challenging and questioning the merger. He said
Tuesday he believed it made a difference in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it ever would,'' Carney said. ``I didn't
think people would read it, but evidently they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney is scheduled to retire from the Cenex board at next
week's annual meeting. The vote, however, has him wondering whether
he should seek re-election through a floor nomination at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to give a guy a lot to think about,'' Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   Carney also said a future merger might work, especially if
Farmland reduces its reliance on debt.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, expressed continuing reasons to avoid a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``By not merging it will preserve some competition'' in local
farm supply markets, said Robert Taylor, an agricultural economist
at Auburn University in Alabama. Taylor studied the merger at the
request of the National Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's report was critical of the merger and especially of
Farmland's financial condition and the merger-related payments to
managers.

STATION CASINO REGAINS MARKET SHARE LEAD IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five weekends in October helped boost Station Casino back into
Kansas City's market share lead, according to the Missouri Gaming
Commission's latest financial report.
</P>
<P>
   Station's second-largest revenue month in history, $14.88
million, topped the $14.08 million raked in by Harrah's North
Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel. That gave Station the market lead for
only the third time in nearly three years _ but the second time in
four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to think there's a trend there,'' said Station's
Midwest president, John V. Finamore, who discounted the effect of
October's extra weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That used to be the case,'' he said. ``Weekends were our big
focus. But there have been other five-weekend months when we
haven't been the market leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekday business is steadily improving, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to think it's the maturity and the natural evolution of
the property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's general manger, Michael St. Pierre, could not be
reached Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for market share between the twin-boat Station and
Harrah's properties could be over next Wednesday if the Gaming
Commission, as expected, approves Station's proposed purchase of
the Flamingo Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   That would give Station three Kansas City boats and almost 58
percent of the market's total gambling capacity _ or places for
players at the games.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrah's appears to get more out of its capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The two Harrah's boats represent 28 percent of market capacity,
but the company's vessels routinely capture around 34 percent of
the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Station, on the other hand, owns almost 44 percent of the
market's slot machines, table games and other wagering devices.
Despite that edge, Station also captures around 34 percent of the
monthly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   With the Flamingo's 13.9 percent of capacity, Station would own
57.8 percent of the market's games, but last month, for instance,
would have taken in only 48.2 percent of the market's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Argosy Riverside Casino, with 14.1 percent of capacity, has
been gradually increasing its share of market revenue, to a record
18.35 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
   The single-boat Argosy posted a $7.7 million month, its best
showing since Station Casino _ the market's newest _ opened in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy's success rests in part on heavy marketing of its
``loosest slots'' title. The phrase is industry jargon for the
highest percentage of jackpot payouts to customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gaming Commission financial records and six-month
average payouts calculated by The Kansas City Star, the Argosy has
held the coveted title for the most popular 25-cent games for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy also operates the loosest 5-cent and $1 games.
</P>
<P>
   But October's numbers suggest that Illinois-based Argosy may be
losing its grip on the quarter-slots title.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time this year the Flamingo posted the highest
25-cent monthly paybacks to players and now trails Argosy in The
Star's six-month average calculation by just .01 of a percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy General Manager Larry Kinser is watching the Flamingo's
sale to Station with interest. ``I don't know what's going to
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Station's 25-cent slots typically are the market's tightest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, payouts at Kansas City's casinos are only
fractions apart and, according to Strictly Slots magazine, are
among the loosest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue of the publication for casino players showed
that Missouri's best quarter-slot payback for July, 94.3 percent at
the Argosy, was the highest among all U.S. riverboats. It was more
than a full percentage point better than payouts on the Las Vegas
Strip and trailed only four of eight other regions in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also reported that the North Las Vegas region,
which includes Station's Texas Station Casino, is home to the
nation's loosest slots, with paybacks of 97.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tightest quarter slots this summer were at tribal casinos in
Connecticut; several boardwalk casinos in Atlantic City, N.J.; and
the Aztar Casino in Caruthersville, Mo., where paybacks averaged
less than 91 percent, the magazine said.

   LOS ANGELES -- This morning is truly the calm before the storm
at the Winnetka 21 in the suburban San Fernando Valley section of
Los Angeles. Or more appropriately, the eye within the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, employees at one of the nation's largest
and busiest movie houses have been scurrying around like ants in
the moments before it rains. The five-day storm begins this
afternoon, when customers start showing up to eat tons of popcorn,
candy and hot dogs until the final curtain drops Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like the L.A. rush hour,'' said manager John King
Jr. ``If you don't plan it out, you'll wind up stuck in the
Sepulveda Pass. The sheer numbers of people are astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   King and the other managers at the Winnetka 21 have been working
overtime for the last month preparing for this long holiday
weekend, shipping in and stacking hundreds of pounds of extra candy
and popcorn, hiring and training extra staff and plotting which
screens will show which movies at what time to maximize ticket
sales and minimize customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Although theaters across the country all had similar preholiday
strategies, few movie houses are as large or well-attended as the
Winnetka 21. Its more than 100 separate showtimes every day are
spread over 120,000 square feet supporting 5,900 seats. Its three
snack bars include a main one nearly 100 feet long. The main hall
runs the length of two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   Co-manager Gary Frost predicts the theater will sell three times
as much snack food as usual this week. The key numbers: thousands
of pounds of popcorn, weighing 1.5 tons before popping, to be
washed down by 1,500 gallons of soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started ordering extra heavy 2{ weeks ago so I wouldn't kill
my stock people in the last few days,'' Frost said. Both storerooms
_ the larger of which is as big as a theater auditorium _ are
nearly full.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had enough to take us through Thanksgiving weekend, but we
got in another shipment Monday to restock,'' Frost said. ``You
can't afford to run out of anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach of Thanksgiving requires double-checking all
equipment and making certain that staff members _ up to 170 people
from 120 in the early fall _ know how to deal with holiday hordes.
</P>
<P>
   King and Frost say crowd control is the most crucial part of
keeping customers happy. With ``Toy Story 2,'' ``The World Is Not
Enough,'' ``Sleepy Hollow'' and ``End of Days'' all playing, there
will be lines to buy tickets and then lines for specific films once
customers have bought their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth the extra effort to make sure there are lots of
people out there to answer questions and prevent people from
waiting an hour for the wrong movie,'' King said. ``Otherwise you
have chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at the Winnetka 21 receive a week of training before
being assigned to specific areas of the theater, and each new one
initially is paired with a more experienced employee. But at crunch
time, everyone is expected to do whatever's needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the employees are trained to handle any job, so we can
assign people to wherever the greatest need is at that moment,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   The managers also place a premium on staffing the
guest-relations desk with employees who can quickly defuse
agitation. Those slots go to experienced workers with the knack for
dealing effectively with customers who wound up in the wrong
auditorium, were disappointed by the movie or had some other
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest complaint by far is that they didn't get a good
seat,'' King said. ``They either came late or took a long time at
the snack bar. No one likes to sit in the front rows except for
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``bad seat'' complaint can be resolved several ways. An
usher can be assigned to try to find a seat the customer likes
better, or the customer may be offered the choice of a different
movie or a later screening, a ``sorry'' pass for re-admission later
or a cash refund.
</P>
<P>
   King and Frost admit that the most difficult part of their job
recently has been maintaining staffing levels for mostly
minimum-wage jobs requiring work on weekends and holidays. In a
tight job market, finding qualified employees has become
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a lot harder to get workers, particularly since a
lot of new stores opened at Northridge Fashion Center,'' King said.
``That really hurt us. A lot of people will show up for the
interview with torn clothes and green hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Job perks include free popcorn on the job and a once-a-week
family pass to the theater. Over the past week, eight new employees
have been hired, far short of the goal of 20 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of new hires was not what we wanted, but every
single one of them helps,'' Frost said. ``The job requirements are
pretty basic. You have to act like you want to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers insist that dealing with behavior problems at the
Winnetka 21 has not been a major burden for the staff. ``We really
do have a very good clientele here,'' King said. ``They tend to be
very well-behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures will intensify this afternoon as customers
begin to celebrate what to most of them is a four-day weekend.
Forget that the calendar says it's Wednesday. Tonight will resemble
a busy Friday night for theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving Day starts really busy and then slows down a bit
in the middle of the afternoon,'' King said. ``Then it really picks
up in late afternoon once people have gotten tired of seeing their
relatives. And on the day after, it's crazy from opening to
closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has unholstered four major guns for this prime-time
period: ``The World Is Not Enough,'' which opened last weekend with
$35.5 million; ``Sleepy Hollow,'' which followed with $30 million;
Walt Disney Co.'s ``Toy Story 2'' and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``End
of Days.'' Each has a shot at matching the $45.7 million
Thanksgiving record set by ``A Bug's Life'' last year. Exhibitor
Relations Co. has predicted the five-day total could top $200
million, far above last year's record of $182.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Winnetka will allocate nine screens collectively to
``World,'' ``Sleepy'' and ``End of Days.'' In one of the
auditoriums assigned to each title, customers will see the film on
a 70-feet-wide screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big screens have really become our signature,'' King said.
``We get people coming all the way from Palmdale and Lancaster to
see them. This is really the crown jewel of the Pacific chain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winnetka's 10-screen sister complex at the remade Northridge
Fashion Center will probably attract the region's
kiddie-and-parents crowd with ``Toy Story 2'' and ``Pokemon: The
First Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Both complexes are owned by the Los Angeles-based Pacific chain.
On the day after Thanksgiving last year, when the Northridge
complex was still under construction, the Winnetka 21 set its
all-time attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 17,404 admissions,'' Frost recalled. ``There are a
lot of towns that aren't that big. We had `A Bug's Life,' `Enemy of
the State' and `Rugrats,' and it was extremely busy, with lots of
sell-outs. We probably won't ever match that again because back
then we got all the major movies, and now we split them with
Northridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pacific's headquarters staff deals with studios in
booking the films a week at a time, managers like King and Frost
are point men in executing strategy. For example, if a film in a
big auditorium isn't drawing customers, it may be shifted into a
smaller space at midday.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the right movie in the right auditorium is a
still-developing art since megaplexes _ theaters with 16 or more
screens _ have been on the scene only a few years. At the Winnetka,
there are 2,000 seats collectively in the three theaters with
70-feet-wide screens, while the small halls only have about 200
seats, so managers need to guess just how much demand there will be
for each film and allocate space accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Timing poses another tricky calculation. Even though the most
popular starting time is between 7 and 7:45 p.m., operators have
found it makes more sense to stagger the showings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're showing the Bond movie in three auditoriums starting
at 7, 7:15 and 7:30, then you could have close to 2,000 people at
once and that's a lot of traffic,'' King said. ``The idea is that
you spread them out and open one big auditorium on one side at the
same time that you open a small one on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their preparations, King and Frost face the prospect of
18-hour workdays back to back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like Thanksgiving and the day after,'' King
said. ``Gary and I will arrive at 9 a.m., take separate breaks for
dinner and go home at 3 in the morning. This will be my 23rd year
of working on Thanksgiving, so I can't believe I'm smiling as I'm
telling you this.''

HEAVY TRAFFIC EXPECTED OVER THANKSGIVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A record 4.1 million Californians are expected to
take planes, trains and automobiles this Thanksgiving, travel
industry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong economy with low unemployment and when people
have extra money, they often spend it on travel,'' said Paul
Moreno, spokesman for the American Automobile Association of
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles International Airport, at least 171,083
passengers are expected Nov. 19-28, the peak Thanksgiving travel
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting this to be a record Thanksgiving,'' LAX
spokeswoman Angela M. Franklin said. ``Each year, we continue to
break the previous year's record.''
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the holiday crush, extra traffic officers will be
deployed and police on bicycles will patrol LAX parking lots and
structures.
</P>
<P>
   If you drive to the airport, expect to park in lots B and C on
the perimeter of the airport and take shuttles to terminals.
Parking inside the airport is growing tight.
</P>
<P>
   Parking structure 5, which serves SwissAir, Aeromexico, United,
Skywest, Lufthansa, Continental and Delta, already is filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't plan on parking inside the airport,'' LAX
spokeswoman Diana Sanchez said. ``We're recommending that people
take alternative forms of transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Van Nuys, the long-term parking lot for the FlyAway Bus at
Saticoy Street and Woodley Avenue also is filled, but 30-minute
free spaces are available for picking and dropping off passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers heading to LAX are urged to arrive two hours before
domestic flights and three hours before international flights.
Burbank Airport expects to have an additional 3,000 to 4,000
passengers a day from today to Sunday. Add to that the friends and
family who drop off and pick up loved ones, and the usually quiet
Burbank airport may seem a bit more like LAX.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to Burbank Airport for its convenience. Usually
they can run in a few minutes before the flight. That may not be
the case this weekend,'' said Victor J. Gill, director of public
affairs and communications for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Airport Authority has reduced the daily rate for valet
parking through Sunday from $18 a day to $12 to help redirect some
of the traffic flow away from the parking structure. Economy lots
north and east of the airport are even cheaper at $8 per day, with
free shuttles to the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 19.8 million passengers will take to the air _ 10
percent more than the 18 million who flew during the Thanksgiving
holiday last year, said David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, which represents major air carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to be busy,'' Fuscus said. ``The airlines gear
up for it. People need to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 2million Southern Californians are expected to hit the
highway this holiday season, according to the Automobile Club of
Southern California. The most popular destinations are Las Vegas,
San Francisco, San Diego, Palm Springs and Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice is to get on the road as early as you can,''
said Carol Thorp, spokeswoman of the Automobile Club.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't leave early, be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let your temper flare,'' Thorp said. ``Realize that
everybody is in the same boat as you are. Getty angry gets you
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 34million Americans will travel at least 100
miles or more, with 27.8million expected to drive to their
destinations, Thorp said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 33.6million Americans took trips by car, plane,
train, bus and boat.
</P>
<P>
   For the California Highway Patrol, the Thanksgiving holiday
means all available officers will be out on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving holiday reporting period starts at 6 p.m. today
and ends at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our officers will be especially watching for aggressive
drivers,'' CHP Commissioner Dwight Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A driver who speeds, tailgates, or cuts in and out of traffic
should expect to spend a little of his or her holiday with a CHP
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 25 fatal crashes occurred statewide during the
Thanksgiving maximum enforcement period, the CHP said. In Los
Angeles, one fatal crash occurred during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak projects a 28percent nationwide increase in riders during
the holiday week. Ridership is expected to climb to 525,000
compared to 410,000 travelers during a typical week.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, ridership is expected to increase by
32percent and by 54percent out of downtown Los Angeles' Union
Station from today through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the additional passengers, Amtrak will add 61
trains to the Pacific Northwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. is preparing for a red-hot holiday season,
too. The Dallas-based operation expects more than half a million
passengers during the six-day holiday period.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound, which was recently acquired by Laidlaw Inc., North
America's largest ambulance and passenger bus company, plans to
rent extra buses nationwide and will add 3,197 departures Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of activity,'' said Kristin Parsley, a
spokeswoman for Greyhound. ``It hasn't slowed down for us.''

FORMER PATIENT DONATES $18,000 TO HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jack Wilkinson recalls vividly the needles
that doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital used to drain fluid from
his lungs. That was in 1937. Wilkinson was 4 years old and had
double pneumonia. Survival was far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saved my bacon,'' he said. ``They knew my dad didn't have
any money, so they didn't even send him a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wilkinson, 66, of Springfield, Va., is repaying Children's
Mercy. He retired recently as vice president of the Laborers'
International Union and donated to the hospital the $18,000 he
received in retirement gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go toward a whirlpool for arthritis patients in
physical therapy. On Tuesday, Wilkinson visited Children's Mercy to
see where it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of love for that hospital,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't be here without them.''

NUMBER OF MISSOURI NURSING HOMES CITED FOR INFRACTIONS SKYROCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ The number of Missouri nursing homes cited
for problems that endangered residents more than quadrupled in the
last year, new federal statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The likely reason for the increase, state and federal officials
said Tuesday, was a combination of factors, including more vigorous
enforcement of regulations and the increasing difficulty nursing
homes face in hiring adequate staff.
</P>
<P>
   But inspectors also may be grading nursing homes more harshly
now for violations that were not considered as serious in the past,
a spokesman for the nursing-home industry said.
</P>
<P>
   In their most recent inspections, 26 Missouri nursing homes _
4.6 percent of the state's total _ had violations that placed
residents' health or safety in immediate jeopardy. Missouri has
about 560 nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Just six nursing homes, or 1.1 percent of the total, had such
violations in their previous inspections, conducted annually by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, 1.5 percent of the state's 399 nursing homes had such
serious violations in their most recent inspections, compared with
3 percent in their previous inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were released Tuesday by U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, a
Missouri Republican, following a meeting in Kansas City with
officials from the federal Health Care Financing Administration,
which oversees nursing-home quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a disturbing spike up in the number of deficiencies
found in Missouri nursing homes,'' Bond said. He said he had asked
the federal agency to give him monthly reports on Missouri nursing
homes that had chronic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said his office has been contacted in recent months by
family members of many Missouri nursing-home residents who ``give
us tales of very serious problems...not getting adequate care, not
getting the treatment they think they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems cited in the federal agency's statistics were not
trivial violations but involved such serious issues as inadequately
treated bedsores, medication errors and patients who were able to
wander away from their nursing homes unattended, said Thomas Lenz,
the agency's associate regional administrator.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the increasing numbers of Missouri nursing
homes with violations can be attributed to a single cause, Lenz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to look for the one thing. I don't think
there's one thing. It's a bushel basket of things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1998, the federal agency has been under presidential
orders to step up enforcement of nursing-home regulations, Lenz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have emphasized states must follow our protocols'' for
doing inspections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the increasing number of violations is that
nursing homes are having a hard time maintaining adequate staffing
levels, Lenz said. Nursing-home work is often difficult and poorly
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average pay for a nurse's assistant is what they pay at
Burger King,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri officials acknowledge that nursing homes are having a
hard time attracting workers, said Bryan Forbis, acting deputy
director for institutional services of the Missouri Division of
Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The division is seeking an increase in the budget next year for
Medicaid, the state program that pays for most nursing-home care,
so that nursing homes can better recruit and maintain their work
forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical they have sufficient numbers of adequately
trained staff,'' Forbis said. ``We want there to be a high quality
of care.''
</P>
<P>
   While a budget increase next year will help nursing homes,
higher Medicaid payments are needed right away, said Earl Carlson,
executive director of the Missouri Health Care Association, which
represents the nursing-home industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis in staffing today that needs to be addressed
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of Missouri nursing-home patients are
covered by Medicaid, Carlson said. ``We just can't go out and raise
prices because it's government reimbursement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While inadequate staffing may account for some nursing-home
problems, the increased violations found in the federal agency's
data may be inflated, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing-home inspectors are grading problems more severely than
they used to, and some violations now are being counted twice, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, being found at fault for allowing a nursing-home
resident to wander away will also trigger a citation for inadequate
staffing, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't happen before,'' he said.

JUDGE REJECTS STATE'S BID TO DELAY HALTING OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD
FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ A circuit judge Tuesday rejected the
state's attempt to delay his decision halting state funds for
Planned Parenthood offices in Kansas City and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Cole County Circuit Judge Byron Kinder rejected the state's
request despite predictions that the ruling would force Missouri's
entire family planning program to close for up to one month,
temporarily denying services to 3,000 women and men.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys said they would appeal Kinder's decision to the
Western District Court of Appeals in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The latest order stems from a Kinder ruling last week that
ordered a halt to state family planning money for Planned
Parenthood offices in Kansas City and St. Louis. Kinder said the
groups failed to comply with a new anti-abortion law, and he
ordered them to repay the state $105,750 they had received since
July 1, with interest. The law is designed to make sure that state
tax dollars do not subsidize Planned Parenthood's abortion
services. Kinder said the two Planned Parenthood offices violated
the statute by directly referring patients to abortion providers,
distributing marketing materials about abortion services and in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday attorneys for the state asked Kinder to delay his
ruling while they appealed the decision. They said his order would
damage all 96 hospitals, local health departments and others that
supply state-funded family planning services, not just the two
Planned Parenthood offices.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Dempsey, state health director, told the court in an
affidavit last week that clients would temporarily lose access to
tests or screening for pregnancy, cancer, sexually transmitted
diseases and sexual abuse while contracts were rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Cherrick, a special assistant attorney general who filed
the lawsuit, praised Kinder's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cherrick, who was hired solely to defend two anti-abortion laws,
says there is no reason to interrupt state funds to nearly 100
family planning offices just because tax money was halted for
Planned Parenthood offices in Kansas City and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the court has refused to accept the
director of health's attempt to hold hostage the recipients of
family planning funds not affected by this court order,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said the monthlong shutdown remained possible because
all of the state's family planning agreements were covered by the
same state contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that contract is at issue, then everyone's contract is at
issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said that, if Kinder's ruling was not delayed, health
officials would ``have to issue contract amendments to assure
compliance'' with his order, and that would take up to one month.
</P>
<P>
   Family planning services are still being offered at Planned
Parenthood offices in the Kansas City area, said Peter Brownlie,
president and chief executive officer for Planned Parenthood of
Kansas and Mid-Missouri. Brownlie said his group was seeking
donations of about $300,000 to offset the possible loss of $628,000
in state family planning money.

Clemson assistant coach might visit Texas Tech again 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clemson offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez said yesterday that
he and his wife, Rita, are considering going to Lubbock, Texas,
this weekend as speculation continues to point to him as a top
contender to succeed Spike Dykes as head football coach at Texas
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about doing that just to look around and get the
feel from her perspective,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez interviewed with Tech officials, met chancellor John
T. Montford and toured university facilities Monday. He said the
fact that he made the initial trip indicated his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have gotten on the plane if I wasn't interested,''
Rodriguez said. ``I think the future looks bright there whether I'm
the next coach or not. Spike Dykes laid a great foundation and did
a great job while he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Rodriguez and Oklahoma offensive coordinator Mike
Leach run wide-open offensive attacks make them both attractive
candidates, Tech athletic director Gerald Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are other people that we are interested in talking
to,'' he added. ``We want to talk to some people that we haven't
talked to yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers indicated that the process would intensify next week.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said his first impressions of the situation and the
university were good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed my visit and I think things went really
well,'' he said. ``Everything has been positive. It's my impression
that \RTech\S is committed to doing what is necessary facility-wise
to keeping up. And the Big 12 is one of the top conferences in the
country. Look at the top 10 right now.'' / nn

<P>
   TRADE-MEETING (Washington) _ President Clinton has quietly tried
_ and failed _ to persuade leaders of major countries to attend

break political deadlocks over workers' rights, agricultural
subsidies and America's self-proclaimed authority to block low-cost

<P>
   TEXAS-AFFIRM-EDUC (Austin, Texas) _ Two years into the
startlingly simple program to guarantee the top 10 percent of
graduates from every Texas high school a spot at the public
university of their choice, the racial mix on the University of
Texas campus here has been restored to what it was under
affirmative action, and the University has also been able to
attract students from impoverished rural and inner-city schools
that rarely sent graduates here before. The experiment has already
been copied by California and Florida and is being closely watched
by universities nationwide as they agonize over how to enroll more
black and Hispanic students in the face of mounting challenges to
affirmative action. By Jodi Wilgoren.

   MACYS-BALLOONS (New York) _ Everyone who goes to the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade knows there is a price to be paid for
attending. Getting up at dawn to grab a curb-side spot, getting
squashed by hordes of out-of-towners, getting home too late to put
the turkey in the oven. But all that pales beside the price
companies pay to get their balloons in the parade:
$200,000-$300,000. And they say it is worth every penny. By Leslie

country is about to have another e-Christmas, brick-and-mortar
stores are striking back. Retailers know that they are facing a
pervasive stereotype that real-world holiday shopping is a parking

MAVERICKS CAUGHT SHORT BY ROCKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rudy Tomjanovich, who turns 51 today, might want to
put two extra candles on his birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Tomjanovich's Houston Rockets blow away the
stubborn Mavericks, 119-99, last night. They also said goodbye to
the longest losing streak ever to open a season at the 25-year-old
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated Rockets captured their first home victory of the
season _ in seven tries _ as they zipped by a road-weary and
short-handed Mavericks team that suited up only eight players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them before the game that fatigue might be a factor,
and it was,'' Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``We
were running on empty.''
</P>
<P>
   With Robert Pack, Cedric Ceballos and Gary Trent back in Dallas,
and Steve Nash and Randell Jackson on the bench in street clothes,
the Mavericks' gas tank quickly ran low in the second half. Pack
(hamstring), Trent (hamstring) and Jackson (thigh) will also miss
tonight's game at Orlando, while Ceballos is doubtful with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, meanwhile, will have his sore right ankle examined this
morning to determine if he'll be available to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   After a solid 24 minutes that saw them trailing only 57-54 at
intermission, the Mavericks couldn't keep pace with the quicker and
more athletic Rockets in the second half. With rookie point guard
Steve Francis accounting for 11 of his 17 points and three of his
seven assists, the Rockets outscored the Mavericks, 37-25, in the
third period en route to snapping a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just outmanned,'' said point guard Hubert Davis, who
made his first start of the season and finished with 14 points and
six assists. ``We played real hard, but things didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed tired in the third quarter, and we made some runs.
But it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough, because the Rockets had almost as many players
in double-figure scoring (seven) as the Mavericks had players in
uniform (eight).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough, because future Hall of Fame forward Charles
Barkley played lights-out. Barkley produced a season-high 26 points
and 14 rebounds as the Rockets improved to 3-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very frustrating and disappointing season thus
far,'' Barkley said. ``Tonight was the first night this year that I
played up to my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (4-8) dropped their fourth consecutive game after
starting the season 4-4. Not even a career-high 31 points from Dirk
Nowitzki could save the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a good game offensively, and tonight most of my
shots were going down,'' Nowitzki said. ``I'm always running on the
break, and Charles wasn't picking me up. I just had a good game,
and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley (29 points, eight rebounds, six assists) and Rick
Hughes (11 points) were the only other Mavericks players who
performed admirably. Erick Strickland struggled through a 2-of-12
shooting night, and Shawn Bradley was scoreless in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, because I think we made it tough,'' Finley said.
``I think the first half we put ourselves in a good position to win
the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we came out in the second half, they started the
third quarter real strong and we never recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being short on players, Finley steadfastly refused to
use that as an excuse for losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to strap it up and do it again,'' Finley said,
adding that he hoped some of his teammates were upset about the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to be our attitude to go in there and get a win.
Hopefully this won't happen again.''

KINGS TOP NETS, 105-92 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ There would be no therapeutic victory to restore
the New Jersey Nets to wholeness, no strong, unified performance to
serve as a balm for a team as sore as a fresh wound. The
cross-country plane ride and public airing of their locker-room
grievances did nothing to heal what ails the Nets. They left
Sacramento as they entered it on Tuesday night: wounded, fractured
and with one victory to their name.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, that youthful and exciting team that is all the Nets
were supposed to be, beat their guests soundly, 105-92, before
17,021 delighted fans at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing their record to 8-1, the best start in franchise
history, the Kings proved to be all the Nets (1-10) are not. In
concert like a jazz band, they found teammates with behind-the-back
passes and finished uncanny feeds with alley-oop dunks that left
the Nets staring at the soles of their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets were the Stephon Marbury show, the Kings had a
starting five and bench full of contributors. There was Chris
Webber gripping the rim and posing after dunks, grabbing every
rebound in sight and giving fascinating dishes to teammates in
recording a monstrous triple-double of 26 points, 22 rebounds and
10 assists. It was the ninth triple-double of Webber's career.
</P>
<P>
   There was the dazzling point guard Jason Williams gliding in the
lane for loping finger-roll layups, and the reserve energizer
Lawrence Funderburke providing a tour-de-force performance of 18
points and 9 rebounds off the bench. Ten Kings scored in all,
including four with 13 or more points.
</P>
<P>
   It was too much for Marbury, who played splendidly in recording
31 points and 7 assists on 12-of-27 shooting, to beat by himself.
Sherman Douglas added 13 points, and Keith Van Horn scored 12 and
grabbed 17 rebounds but missed a horrific 16 of 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that Jim McIlvaine was poked in the eye in the second
quarter by his teammate Sherman Douglas and did not return, Kendall
Gill was accidentally hit in the face by Corliss Williamson and
received 4 stitches above his left eye and Douglas tweaked his left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets will hope for a better result Wednesday night in
Oakland, home of the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   After letting the Nets hang for a quarter and a half, the Kings
blew the game open with a slam-dunk competition's worth of jams
late in the second quarter. Webber seemed to score on nothing but
dunks, and Funderburke hung from the rim like a net after vicious
alley oops.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Nets, who led by as many as 8 points in the
first quarter, trailed, 60-50. It only grew worse in the third, as
the Kings came out with a barrage of 3-pointers to bury the Nets'
already fleeting hopes and increase the lead to 18 points midway
through the period.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento wanted to run from the tip-off, and initially the
Nets were game. With Marbury playing shooting guard alongside
Douglas, the Nets were able to keep up with the speed game and take
a 30-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, free to concentrate on scoring, was too much for
Williams. Effective from the perimeter as well as driving to the
basket, he made 5 of 8 shots in scoring 12 first-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   He was so hot that late in the quarter he pulled up from behind
the left hash mark with the shot clock running down and sank a
30-footer.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Marbury-Douglas backcourt seemed to be a
great find, as Marbury, like Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, thrived
without the responsibility of running the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best of both worlds,'' Casey said before the
game. ``Having Sherman handle the ball more takes some of the
burden of setting up things for Stephon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' downfall had nothing to do with their backcourt. Van
Horn, who entered the game shooting 38.4 percent from the floor,
continued to struggle offensively and proved to be a microcosm of
the Nets' entire team in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 6 points on 3-of-8 shooting in the first, Van Horn
missed 7 of 8 shots in the second. The Nets, who shot 48 percent in
the first, fell flat, hitting just 7 of 26 shots for 26.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets stone cold, Sacramento took control midway through
the period and gained the lead for good, 42-41, on a basket by
Predrag Stojakovic. The hoop began a 20-7 run that ended with the
Kings ahead by 60-48 moments before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Injury was added to the embarrassing situation when McIlvaine
was poked in the eye by his teammate Douglas while both were
scrambling for a loose ball with 1 minute 58 seconds remaining in
the half. McIlvaine did not return to compete, and in a way,
neither did the Nets.

KINGS WIN, STORR LOSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Kings were pounding the Colorado Avalanche on
Tuesday night, but things rarely have looked worse.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr was gone after one period with the goaltender's
biggest fear _ a badly strained right groin _ just two weeks after
the Kings lost Stephane Fiset with a deep bone bruise in his right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   And though the team rallied around Storr's replacement Marcel
Cousineau by ending a two-game slide with a 6-2 victory, it was
hard to tell the winners from the losers in front of 18,004 at the
new Pepsi Center that included Kings owner Phillip Anschutz.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into tonight's game against the struggling but still
defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars, the Kings have been
struck with their fourth potentially major injury this month that
began with Luc Robitaille's broken left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the game,'' said captain Rob Blake, who scored
two goals. ``You aren't going to replace the guys we've lost, but
now is the time when you put faith in your system. Last year, we
lost guys and it killed us. But we weren't a playoff team. Now we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Kings looked like they might be able to absorb the
loss of Robitaille and center Jozef Stumpel, who will miss at least
the six weeks due to abdominal surgery. But after an early surge
this season, their power play continues to disintegrate, going 0
for 3 against Colorado and scoreless in the last 24 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss of their second goalie in two weeks truly stings.
Last year, the Kings lost Storr and Fiset seven minutes apart
during the season's fourth game, lost 14 of their next 16 and were
never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team is much better, but Fiset is expected to miss
two more weeks. Cousineau was brought in when Fiset went down Nov.
6 but didn't play until Tuesday. Storr, who has a history of groin
problems, was 4-2-1 in Fiset's absence and was named NHL Player of
the Week in early November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mike O'Neill, Cousineau's backup at minor league Long
Beach, will fly to Dallas today to be the Kings No.2 goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this before,'' said Cousineau, who started
the second period with just 21 games of NHL experience. ``It's
tough to play back-to-back on the road, but with Long Beach I
played three games back-to-back in three different cities.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is certain Brett Hull, the Stars' biggest star, did not
play in any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-6-4 Kings, though, made it look easy for Cousineau. The
beat up Colorado, which was coming off a tough overtime victory on
Monday against Dallas. For the first six minutes of the second
period, the Avs did not get a shot off against Cousineau.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the Kings got goals from Vladimir Tsyplakov and
Blake to make it a 3-1 game. The first shot Cousineau faced was a
goal by Dave Reid, but the Kings wore down the tired Avs and scored
three more times against goalie Marc Denis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were tired, but you have to make sure they play
tired,'' said Blake, who also assisted on Jason Blake's first goal
this season. ``That could be us against Dallas, but I think we'll
have something in reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that Kings coach Andy Murray rested Blake and
Ziggy Palffy for much of the third period in preparation for
tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   But the big ice pack of Storr's right groin in the post-game
locker room was a reminder that the Kings won at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Storr was injured attempting to stop a first-period breakaway by
Avs center Joe Sakic, who was back after missing nearly two weeks
with a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic already had scored a power-play goal. As he came in on the
Kings' net, Sakic had a chance for his 1,000 career point. He
didn't get off the shot, but Storr stuck out his right leg and felt
more than a tweak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have stayed in, but I might have injured it more,''
Storr said. ``We'll have to see tomorrow just how bad it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the strength in Storr's leg was down to 20 percent
between the first and second periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time when we find out about ourselves and our
system,'' Murray said. ``We have confidence in the guy we are
bringing up. We will get through this.''

CLIPPERS DEFEAT KNICKS, 100-95 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New York Knicks hauled their frontline of
spare parts onto the showroom floor of the Staples Center on
Tuesday night and were faced with the forgotten team off the back
lot of Hollywood, the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to give, and it was the Knicks. They were unable
to make up for the absences of the injured Marcus Camby, Larry
Johnson and Patrick Ewing against a lively Clippers team that was
led by the youth of the Queens prodigy Lamar Odom and the savvy of
Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, zipping in and around a variety of Knicks defenders,
scored 24 points in the Clippers' 100-95 victory, a performance
that included a driving layup with 2 minutes 12 seconds left to put
his team up by 7 points. Until then, the Knicks had a chance
despite their lethargic beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Down by as many as 28 points in the second quarter, they blew
four opportunities to tie the game in the fourth quarter and wasted
an energetic effort by Latrell Sprewell, who finished with 32
points. The Knicks missed two 3-pointers that would have tied the
game in the waning seconds; one by Charlie Ward with 16.9 seconds
left and one by Sprewell with 1.4 seconds left. When it was over,
the Knicks' five-game swing out west ended 2-3 and left the team at
6-7.
</P>
<P>
   It was a miserable night for Allan Houston. Often double-teamed
and turnover prone, Houston scored 11 points on a 4-for-11 effort.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Kurt Thomas (18 points) kept hope alive. In the
fourth quarter, the Knicks were down, 85-74, when Sprewell, Andrew
Lang and John Wallace alternated scores to get the team within 2
points with eight minutes left. The Knicks had a chance to tie it
at 87 but a pull-up jumper by Sprewell bounded off the rim before
falling to the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would have another chance to tie with 4:40 left but
Chris Childs missed a short jumper. Each failure opened up a chance
for Tyrone Nesby to hurt the Knicks. After scoring four points in a
row for the Clippers, Nesby launched a 3-pointer over Wallace with
4:11 left to give his team a 94-89 lead. Odom took over from there
on a difficult night to swallow for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day break in the California sun and some time to
relax, the Knicks approached their last night of a five-game road
trip as uninspired as beach bums. After all, these were the
Clippers, not the Warriors. No big deal. After their controversial,
Sprewell-charged romp in Oakland, the Knicks had a laid-back look
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Injury-depleted or not, there was little excuse for a casual
defense that allowed the Clippers amazing opportunities to look
like an elite team. If Anderson was not slipping by Houston or
Sprewell, Odom was twisting past Sprewell, Thomas and Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who were down by as many as 28 points in the first
half, were a stunned group on the sidelines. An exasperated Coach
Jeff Van Gundy tried everything, even playing a four-guard lineup,
and nothing was working until Sprewell opened up as suddenly as a
pop-up book to give the Knicks a chance with a 17-point second
quarter. He was the inspiration behind the Knicks' third-quarter
surge that helped them trim a 16-point halftime deficit to 6 after
a 12-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   But after a couple of botched possessions, the Clippers held a
84-74 lead entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was actually an uneasy lead for the Clippers, who started out
clicking so well against a Knicks team that was oozing apathy.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Anderson had 17 points in the first quarter and
the versatile Odom flashed moves as if he was ruling the
playgrounds of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   And it got a lot worse before Sprewell seemed to get a whiff of
smelling salts when the Knicks bottomed out, down by 60-32 with
four minutes left in the second quarter. As usual, Sprewell didn't
ease into his game, he barged into it aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to the basket and pulling up to hit his jumper, Sprewell
scored 15 of his 21 first-half points during a 17-5 run to get the
Knicks back to respectability at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting just two of his first five shots, Sprewell hit six
in a row in the second quarter to lead the Knicks back into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way Van Gundy wanted to end this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injuries and energy-draining week on the road, he
was looking for a big finishing kick.

PEPPERDINE UPSETS FRESNO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO _ There was no way Tezale Archie was going to pass on an
opportunity to be a hero in his long-awaited homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   So Archie, on a play designed for him, let the shot fly, and
watched as the ball never got close to the rim. And then Archie, a
senior point guard at Pepperdine, celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Fresno State's Melvin Ely was called for
goaltending on Archie's game-winning shot attempt with less than a
second left, and the Waves upset the Bulldogs 70-68 in a men's
basketball game Tuesday night before a sellout crowd of 10,220.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a storybook ending,'' said Archie, who starred at
Fresno's Hoover High in the early '90s and grew up rooting for the
Bulldogs. ``I've been coming here (Selland Arena) since I was a
kid. I couldn't have written it any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Archie, who scored 13 points, doesn't care to think about a
scenario not entailing Ely getting called for goaltending. He drove
the length of the court after Ely's free throw tied the game at 68
with 8.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The shot) looked good to me,'' he said. ``A goaltend is a
goaltend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a gutsy call, but the right one by the officials. The
ball was on a downward trajectory when Ely swatted it against the
backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was up there for a long time,'' said Jan van Breda
Kolff, Pepperdine's first-year head coach who has guided the Waves
to a 2-0 start. ``It was the correct call.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves surprised the favored Bulldogs (1-1), who played
without All-American candidate Courtney Alexander who has a stress
fracture in his foot, with a tenacious pressing and trapping
defense. Pepperdine won despite shooting 36 percent (27-of-75).
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State committed 24 turnovers and blew a 65-60 lead with
3:25 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players believe, if we get down, we can come back because
of the press,'' van Breda Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ely also was at the center of another crucial sequence with
three minutes left that helped the Waves score six points on a
single trip.
</P>
<P>
   After Nick Sheppard made a basket for the Waves, Ely was called
for a technical foul. Archie made both free throws, and with 2:38
left, Brandon Armstrong made a layup to give Pepperdine a 66-65
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves trailed most of the first half, but went on an 11-3
run in the final three minutes to cut the Bulldogs' lead to 40-37
at halftime. Pepperdine shot just 28 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to try and find different ways to win the game,''
van Breda Kolff said. ``You can't always win with your shooting.
You have to make big plays.''

UCLA BEATS FAIRFIELD IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two bad teams played one bad game Tuesday night at
Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfield was worse _ but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA broke open a ragged game in the second half and gave
fourth-year coach Steve Lavin a 76-57 season-opening victory over
the Stags, who had lost their two previous games by a combined 50
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what our strengths and weaknesses are,'' UCLA
guard Earl Watson said. ``We won't know until after the first
couple games.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary reviews are not good.
</P>
<P>
   Except for forward Matt Barnes, who's academically ineligible
for the fall quarter, the Bruins had their full complement of
players. Even guard Ray Young played, although with a taped right
thumb to protect his partially torn ligaments. He was 0 of 5 in the
first half and no better in the second.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Young to play well; he's practiced sparingly for
weeks. But that's not true of veterans Jerome Moiso, Earl Watson,
Billy Knight and Rico Hines. They've been healthy throughout the
preseason and have practiced regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tuesday, they, too, were awful in the first half, when the
Bruins shot 29 percent, had 14 turnovers, missed half their free
throws and shot 14 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, frustrated, told a fourth-row heckler to ``go home''
midway through the half. Clearly not a purist, the man stayed.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw was familiar: Fairfield took a page from Detroit
Mercy's playbook and used a zone defense against the Bruins, who
weren't much better against it than they were eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely not where I'd like to be in terms of
conditioning and timing because we haven't had our full complement
of players,'' Lavin said. ``It's not a mystery. We haven't had the
practice time as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Limited practice time means limited performance _ as the Bruins
proved last week in a sloppy exhibition victory and again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're connected,'' Lavin continued. ``The players that were
injured don't have the conditioning level they need. Because they
aren't in practice, it affects the timing of the offense, and they
don't have a feel for the press or man-to-man defense because they
haven't had the repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that's been breaking down is all from conditioning
and not being together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stags were vulnerable. Their tallest player is 6-7, they
start three freshmen, and they were playing their third road game
in five days. They lost at Kansas by 26 points Friday and at
Nevada-Las Vegas by 24 points Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ideal situation for the Bruins to press fatigued
Fairfield into submission. The Stags chipped in 21 first-half
turnovers, but the Bruins rarely took advantage of the mistakes _
and often followed with mistakes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA found patience and discipline at halftime and looked much
better in the second half. Jason Kapono's driving lay-up gave it a
35-28 lead. A few minutes later, JaRon Rush hit a short bank shot
to push the margin to 43-33.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono answered a brief Fairfield rally with a lay-up and
3-pointer from the left corner, again showing he is UCLA's
steadiest and most-skilled player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes everybody better,'' Watson said. ``He's very smart,
very mature for his age.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of its 17 years, Operation Smile seemed a model
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by a charismatic plastic surgeon and his wife, it
garnered millions in donations and sheaves of plaudits for the
surgeons it sent abroad to fix the cleft palates and lips of
children in poor corners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Donors from Bill Gates to Goldie Hawn pitched in generously, and
the numbers of children granted a pretty smile grew by leaps and
bounds. The founders often appeared on television, and the group
won many awards.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, however, serious allegations of shoddy
medical practices and questions about the charity's direction and
conduct have stirred bitter struggles within the organization, well
outside public view.
</P>
<P>
   The founder dismisses the charges as ``blatantly not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegations focus on the surgeries themselves.
Critics charge that the organization has put volume and publicity
over safety, leading to high numbers of complications, and even
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, four children died during or after the surgery,
adding to at least 12 other patients that the charity acknowledges
losing since it began operations in 1982. Repairing a cleft lip or
palate in the developed world is a rather low-risk proposition, and
in the United States, deaths are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians in China, where Operation Smile has performed many of
its operations, have accused the surgeons of ``assembly line''
medicine. In Bolivia, a pediatric surgeon branded the
organization's practices ``a form of neo-colonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have also charged that Operation Smile exaggerates its
size and impact on the group's tax returns by including the medical
services that its volunteer nurses and doctors donate. And some
question the charity's priorities for choosing to finance projects
like its recent World Journey of Hope, a whirlwind mission around
the globe that cost $8.8 million, $910,000 of which went for
promotion and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive is leaving, many staff members have quit and
seven of its most prominent board members have resigned. Charles B.
Wang, the chief executive of Computer Associates International,
pulled back a $10 million donation, which he has now promised to a
rival charity. Warner-Lambert, a corporate donor that had been
contributing at least $1 million a year to the $40 million that the
charity spends on programs, also retracted its support.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of Operation Smile, Dr. William P. Magee Jr. and
his wife, Kathleen S. Magee, neither of whom have ever taken a
salary from the charity, have dismissed much of the criticism as
the assertions of those who do not understand what they are trying
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is put this behind us and not get
distracted,'' Magee said in an interview last week at the charity's
headquarters in Norfolk, Va., flanked by the many awards he has
won, including this year's Charity Executive of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Magee declared that without an operation to correct a facial
deformity, a child has ``no chance to live a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the charity launched a counteroffensive at a news
conference in Manhattan, where Magee addressed some of the recent
criticism. He dismissed the allegations as ``blatantly not true,''
and said the charity had hired a lawyer, F. Bradford Stillman, to
review its operations and report by January.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile is not without its supporters, including Johnson
&AMP; Johnson. ``I personally, and the organization, believe very
strongly in the fine work that Operation Smile has done,'' said
Robert Darretta, the chief financial officer for Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
who remains a director. Acknowledging the challenges faced by the
charity, Darretta said he and other directors are staying to
``bring about constructive change.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how Operation Smile has pursued its goals
exposes a fundamental problem facing many nonprofit organizations:
When a charity gets into trouble, who ought to slam on the brakes?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike companies that have shareholders who could lobby for
change, nonprofits do not usually have stakeholders who can easily
complain or regulators who have much muscle. Fearful of the time
and negative publicity involved in trying to force change, even big
donors and directors may simply wash their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resigning is the final weapon,'' said F. Warren McFarlan, a
Harvard Business School professor who has studied nonprofit boards.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the surgeons' charity, while apparently concerned
about some of the quality-of-care issues being raised, seem most
deeply divided about the founders' role and the increasing view
among some directors that their own input was being ignored, one
former director said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Operation Smile is vowing to do a thorough
internal investigation of its conduct, according to Magee. He said
the charity has hired a lawyer, F. Bradford Stillman, to review its
operations and report by January, though so far the lawyer has not
been asked to look at the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The Procedures: A Child's Death in China Sets Off an Alarm
</P>
<P>
   As long as Operation Smile remained a modest organization, it
could bask in praise. But as it tried to reach its stated goal of
treating 10,000 children a year, troubling reports began to surface
that the charity was sacrificing safety.
</P>
<P>
   No surgery is without risk; in poor countries, operations are
always more difficult. Sanitation might not be up to par, and
patients may have other complications they do not explain to
doctors for fear of being rejected for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile has had 16 deaths, according to Magee, about one
for every 2,000 cases, which he claims is about average for such
missions. In the last four years, the average has been slightly
better, about one death in every 3,200 cases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But Interplast, a competing charity in Mountain View, Calif.,
that also operates on children abroad, had a mortality rate over
the last four years of about one death for every 10,000 cases,
according to David Dingman, the director of Interplast's medical
program. Its own rates had been no better than Operation Smile's
until it tightened quality controls and took advantage of improved
technology about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The death that has caused the most stir at Operation Smile
occurred recently in China. A medical volunteer who was in Beijing
sent an anonymous E-mail in November to members of the board that
voiced serious criticism about how the death occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the direct result of a poorly run mission with far too
much attention being paid to publicity and not enough to patient
safety and standard monitoring techniques,'' said the volunteer,
who was subsequently identified and interviewed by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also my impression that Operation Smile not only did not
learn from this tragedy in Beijing and make changes to ensure that
it did not happen again, but continues to send missions that
operate in a similar unsafe, reckless and unprofessional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   What most troubled the volunteer was the decision not to use
carbon dioxide monitoring equipment that was readily available, a
decision the charity acknowledges but is at a loss to explain. If
the monitoring equipment had been engaged during the cleft-lip
operation, doctors might have known that the toddler being operated
on was responding badly to anesthesia and about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we not use the same standard of care'' as in the
developed world, the volunteer asked. ``The goal is just volume,''
the volunteer concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Medical professionals at the Beijing hospital where Operation
Smile conducted the mission were also severely critical, voicing
concern over the high number of serious complications, where
children suffered from unusually excessive bleeding or had to have
emergency surgery because their palates had collapsed. The Chinese
described much of the work done by the charity's doctors and by
others who were not qualified or skilled in this surgery as crude.
They concluded that about 29 percent of the 169 children with
complications needed further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chinese medical professionals, who later wrote
a detailed report about the mission outlining some of their major
concerns to help direct future missions, Operation Smile conducted
an ``assembly line,'' where patients were known by their numbers
rather than names and surgeons spent little or no time seeing
patients before operating. ``Even though we only worked together
for a few days, we got the impression that the international team
prioritized numbers treated at the cost of quality and safety,''
said a translated copy of the report, which was obtained by The New
York Times. The charity said it has never seen a copy of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical volunteers echo similar concerns about the
pressure to do as many surgeries as possible. While all charities
want to impress donors with large numbers of operations and find it
heart-wrenching to turn away patients, Operation Smile seems more
concerned than others about the final tally, according to a medical
volunteer who has traveled with them and with other comparable
charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of numbers does not seem to be as significant'' with
the others, according to the volunteer, who recalled having to
persuade a team leader not to do surgery on one mission.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile takes every serious complication
``extraordinarily seriously,'' said Magee, and the charity has made
changes as a result of the incident in Beijing. For instance, team
leaders overseeing anesthesia will be doctors, not nurses, and will
be required to use monitoring equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Magee, who is personally responsible for selecting the
group's surgeons, denied that the volunteer physicians, many of
whom are not from the United States, were not able surgeons. While
the Chinese saw them for only a few days, he had known them for
years, he said. ``I have no doubt about their work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble in Beijing, however, was hardly an isolated example.
In Kenya, a child died last year because the mission ran out of
oxygen during the operation _ a mistake that could be easily
remedied in the United States but is fatal in a country where
additional supplies of oxygen are not necessarily available. A
Vietnamese child also died last year when his asthma went
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been complaints about other missions. In March,
after Operation Smile came to Bolivia, several children needed
extensive follow-up care at San Gabriel Hospital, according to Dr.
Roberto Rosa, a pediatric surgeon there who was sharply critical of
Operation Smile and other charities. In one case, the technique
used by Operation Smile on a little girl was clearly inappropriate,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a form of neo-colonialism,'' argued Rosa, who said his
hospital had performed about 2,000 of these surgeries. While his
hospital would be eager to cooperate with surgeons from the United
States, Operation Smile had committed ``surgical safaris against
our children,'' who are from poor families unlikely to complain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile said it had no knowledge of complaints from
Bolivia and has been invited back to provide more operations.
</P>
<P>
   Also problematic, Magee, whose background as a surgeon is
nothing if not impressive, has been criticized for allowing people
without medical training to have too large a role. One volunteer,
who insisted on remaining anonymous, said that he was once allowed
to assist Magee in surgery _ even to perform minor surgery _
although he had no medical background. ``I shouldn't have even been
there,'' the volunteer said.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said volunteers may have been allowed to cut sutures from
time to time, but he has no memory of this incident and he doubted
it happened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One recurring grievance among volunteers and others associated
with the charity is the lack of independent review when there are
problems. While Interplast has in place a quality assurance
committee, made of medical professionals who had nothing to do with
the care, to investigate unusual outcomes and report to the board,
the Magees rely on councils that only meet once a year and are not
necessarily privy to all incidents. Magee personally chairs the
council for plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerating The Numbers
</P>
<P>
   The quest to dazzle donors and outsiders alike with its good
works seems to have led Operation Smile to exaggerate how many
children it has helped. While the organization has helped literally
tens of thousands of children overseas, its activities at home are
less impressive. The 20,000 to 25,000 children in the United States
that Operation Smile says it has helped in brochures, press
briefings and speeches, represent children cared for by its medical
volunteers with little or no involvement by the charity, according
to an internal memo written by Magee in October.
</P>
<P>
   The charity also appears to have taken steps on its latest tax
return, the only public document by which charities can really be
judged, to make itself look much larger and more efficient,
according to Daniel Borochoff, the president of the American
Institute of Philanthropy, a Bethesda, Md., watchdog group that
grades charities. In completing its 1997 tax return, the latest
available, the charity included the ostensible value of the
services donated by its volunteers _ $30.8 million _ as part of its
$59.7 million in revenues from program services.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service explicitly tells charities not to
include donated services as a part of those revenues, according to
an official from the service. Operation Smile appears to have
filled out the forms correctly in 1996, only to have Borochoff
criticize the charity at the time for not spending more of its
money on its programs. By including donated services, the charity
can make it appear that each dollar goes farther, and Interplast,
its rival, has also improperly included the value of services in
its revenues in its 1997 return but says it is now amending the
document. Operation Smile officials say they too have decided to
amend their return.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning The Charity's Goals
</P>
<P>
   Other events over the last two years have also created serious
criticism of the organization even as it would seem to be enjoying
unprecedented success. In early 1998, with much fanfare, Operation
Smile had announced a new program called the Smile Train, whose aim
was to provide training and equipment to Chinese doctors to allow
local doctors to operate on children. Glowing with a $10-million
pledge from Wang, the largest in the charity's history, as well as
$1 million from Gates and millions of dollars promised by other
donors, the charity said it would begin this work in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the project ended up being sidetracked in favor of another
idea: the World Journey of Hope, a nine-week tour of 18 countries,
from Honduras to Russia to China, to treat 5,300 children.
</P>
<P>
   Within Operation Smile, the World Journey project was met with
heavy criticism from directors, staff and volunteers. A huge
endeavor, involving the leasing of a flying hospital from Pat
Robertson, the $8.8 million price tag seemed, to some, hard to
justify. About $465,000, before expenses, was paid to the charity's
public relations firm, Ruder-Finn, to generate publicity. Another
$446,000 was spent on materials and outreach.
</P>
<P>
   The World Journey certainly proved a photo opportunity in the
various countries it landed, with dignitaries and other politicians
quick to call. But many associated with the charity say that too
many volunteers treated the trip as a personal vacation, and the
opportunity to provide education and equipment was squandered. ``It
was basically a promotion,'' said one disappointed volunteer, on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   With concerns growing about the charity's conduct, several
members of the board and large donors began pulling their support.
By the end of 1998, two directors _ Wang and Brian F. Mullaney, a
New York advertising executive, had resigned. The money Wang
originally pledged for the Smile Train was diverted into a new
charity of the same name. Wang declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said Operation Smile was willing to let go of the Smile
Train project and all the money earmarked for it because the
organization was in danger of becoming too ``China-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   But tension continued to grow between other directors and the
Magees. Operation Smile had experienced huge turnover among its top
staff, and by spring 1999 the founders wanted to oust Operation
Smile's chief executive, Thomas Fox, the former chief executive of
the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, who had been brought in
to try to run the organization more professionally. But
foreshadowing a showdown, the board instead voted to keep Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the first round of scathing anonymous e-mail began
making the rounds to the charity's board and top officers. Later
that month, the Magees abruptly canceled a scheduled board meeting.
A few days later, Fox agreed to leave the charity at the end of the
year. Outraged, board members began to resign: Ann Ziff, a
prominent philanthropist; Robert A. Peterson, the vice president of
development for Thomas Jefferson University; Stephen O'Conner, the
president of New Brunswick Tomorrow, a N.J. civic group. Nancy
Gary, president of Educational Commission for Foreign Medical
Graduates, also resigned, according to Operation Smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to participate in a farce,'' one exiting
director said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate donors were also alarmed. Gregory Johnson, the general
counsel for Warner-Lambert, quit, calling for an independent
investigation into the allegations made in the September anonymous
e-mail. Warner-Lambert has since cut all ties to the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile denied Fox was ever fired but said he will not
be renewing his contract next year. Fox declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that many of those involved in Operation Smile
are genuinely upset when a child dies or is hurt or would contend
that anyone delivering medical care will always have perfect
outcomes. ``Everybody wails,'' said Julia S. Heffernan, director of
international missions for the charity, ``and then we move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is exactly this calculus that troubles many of the
charity's critics. When Magee talked about the devastation he felt
back in 1993 when two children died in China while he personally
oversaw the surgery, he said he was convinced about the need to go
on, given how many more children desperately needed his services.
He never did determine the causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere it lost its innocence,'' said one longtime volunteer
who left Operation Smile and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
Without the Magees, ``there wouldn't be an Operation Smile,'' this
person acknowledged, but the two refuse to hear any criticism about
how the charity is run. ``They wouldn't listen,'' the person said.
``It was their vision.''

BIG WEST OFFICIALS VISIT NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The process for Cal State Northridge to join the
Big West Conference took a big step Tuesday as members of the
conference's expansion committee spent the day touring the campus,
viewing facilities and meeting with top academic and athletic
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Big West commissioner Dennis Farrell said if the conference
decides to expand, Northridge should expect an invitation in the
next two months. He said the next step is for a report of the visit
to be distributed to a counsel of ADs, senior athletic
administrators and faculty representatives, probably in about two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell would not say what he thought of Northridge's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my decision,'' Farrell said. ``The ultimate decision
rests with the (university) presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did note Northridge's advantages, including its physical,
academic and athletic similarities to current members Cal State
Fullerton and Long Beach State. The Big West is also considering UC
Riverside, which the four-person committee visited about two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday it met with CSUN coaches, athletic director Dick Dull
and interim president Louanne Kennedy; talked to financial aid,
student services, academic personnel and boosters.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN assistant events manager Mark Adamiak, who led the campus
tour, said some members were not impressed with the campus
gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had concerns about the size of the Matadome _ the seating
capacity,'' Adamiak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big West will lose four football-playing members _ Boise
State, New Mexico State, Nevada and North Texas _ next year. That
will leave the conference with eight schools, the reason it is
considering expansion.
</P>
<P>
   If Northridge is invited to join the Big West and accepts, it
will have to decide what to do about football. The conference will
drop football after this season and of the eight members who will
remain, only Utah State and Idaho play football. That means
Northridge will have to either join another conference for football
only, play as an independent or drop the sport altogether.

ACTIVISTS, DRUGMAKERS SPLIT OVER AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO AIDS DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  At the Washington, D.C., headquarters of Ralph Nader's Consumer
Project on Technology, Jamie Love is reveling in the global
attention.
<P>
   It was Love's office that first promoted the idea that costly
AIDS drugs could be brought cheaply to poor countries by
sidestepping pharmaceutical industry patents _ an idea that has
recently caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were completely unsuccessful for five years on this
thing,'' he said. ``Now, we're kicking ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Understood by only a handful of advocates a year ago, the topic
will be spotlighted next week at the World Trade Organization's
conference in Seattle _ debated at meetings and championed in
demonstrations on the streets outside.
</P>
<P>
   Allied with AIDS activists and Doctors Without Borders (the
recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize), Love's organization
developed a strategy to invoke little-known WTO rules that permit
poor countries to manufacture drugs ordinarily protected by
patents.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers are alarmed. An internal memo by the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, which was
obtained by The Chronicle, warns that ``the current and foreseeable
environment at the WTO is very dangerous for the R&AMP;D industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's own success in fighting AIDS in Western countries
has highlighted the gap in access to drugs between have- and
have-not nations.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations of newly developed antiviral drugs have helped cut
the U.S. AIDS death rate in half since 1996. But at a cost of more
than $1,000 a month, such therapies are hopelessly out of reach for
Third World countries, where 90 percent of the world's people with
AIDS reside.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the WTO rules, say Love and other activists, are two
tools that could bring low-cost drugs to the poor:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Compulsory licensing,'' which allows a country to force a
drug company to license its patent to a local manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Parallel importing,'' which permits poor countries to shop
the international market for the lowest price drug, instead of
paying the rate charged in their countries by companies that own
the patent.
</P>
<P>
   With this twin combination, hard-hit nations might produce their
own AIDS pills and cut the prices they pay by more than 80 percent,
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   However, drugmakers see these tactics as an assault on
``intellectual property'' protections, without which companies
won't make the megabuck investments in research and development
needed to discover new drugs for AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and
other global killers.
</P>
<P>
   They want tighter limits on the use of compulsory licenses and
are working toward a worldwide ban on parallel imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe parallel importing is proper,'' said Mark
Grayson, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug-industry trade group.
``A lot of parallel imports come from places like India, and half
the time there are no active ingredients. It's killing patients,
causing drug resistance and giving false hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Grayson said the issue is far more complex than simply marking
down the prices drug companies charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of governments making their choices,'' he
said. ``South Africa just spent $3.5 billion on fighter jets from
Europe. Just what are they protecting with those jets if they say
they are going to lose half their country to HIV?''
</P>
<P>
   But a summerlong hounding by AIDS activists of Vice President Al
Gore at campaign appearances already has forced the Clinton
administration to rethink its opposition to efforts by South Africa
to cut the cost of its AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As late as February, a State Department lawyer boasted in a memo
to Congress of ``a full-court press'' to stop South Africa from
adopting compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs. Drugmakers had
sued in South African courts to block a law permitting the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But by September, the drug companies had suspended their lawsuit
and Washington agreed to stop threatening South Africa with trade
sanctions _ acknowledging that the country was on firm ground under
WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Africa has yet to carry out any plan to make
cheaper AIDS drugs, Thailand's Government Pharmaceutical
Organization said on November 12 that it intended to seek a
compulsory license to make the AIDS drug ddI from patent-holder
Bristol-Myers Squibb. The same WTO rules that permit compulsory
licenses also require negotiation of royalties payments to the drug
patent holder. Thailand would have become the first nation to take
that step.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tido von Schoen-Angerer, of Doctors Without Borders in
Bangkok, said the goal was to produce ddI in Thailand for 66 cents
a pill, instead of the $1.23 charged by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Thailand's bid was strengthened, he said, because ddI was
originally developed by U.S. scientists at the National Institutes
of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation here where a drug continues to be priced
unaffordable to Thai people by a company that has not itself
invented the drug. I call this profiteering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But within days of the Bangkok announcement, the effort to gain
a license was suspended. The Thais instead are negotiating with
Bristol-Myers to lower the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe compulsory licensing is the way to go,''
said Bristol-Myers spokeswoman Jane Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Thailand's dealings with the New York drug giant
will be closely watched, for it may set a precedent for how
developing countries can manage the manufacture of their own AIDS
drugs, or determine what discounts drug companies are willing to
give countries that can't afford Western prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the WTO conference in Seattle, the activists will attempt to
build on the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not going to go away,'' said John James, who
publicized Love's campaign in his San Francisco newsletter AIDS
Treatment News. ``Ninety percent of the people in the world needing
HIV medications are not able to afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle, it is unlikely that the rules governing compulsory
licensing and parallel importing will be either strengthened or
weakened. The U.S. position, which drug companies support, is that
the rules governing these issues _ contained in an agreement called
Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) _
should not be reopened for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But some nations still may push for modifications of TRIPS,
which requires WTO members to comply with international patent laws
by January 1. Venezuela, for example, wants the patent compliance
rules suspended for ``essential medicines,'' a list of life-saving
drugs compiled by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry hopes to keep discussion of drug patents off
the WTO agenda, the international drugmakers federation has laid
out its positions should the matter arise. The goals include
measures that would:
</P>
<P>
   -- Make it more difficult for countries to shop for lower-priced
drugs on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make it harder for generic drugmakers to gain regulatory
approval for their products.
</P>
<P>
   -- Extend patent protection for new drugs ``delayed'' by drug
approval processes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prevent countries from blocking patents of plants and
animals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase penalties for counterfeiting of patented drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The group's internal memo also calls for strengthening WTO
agreements ``in order to counter adverse consequences of government
interventions intended to protect public health ... or contain
health care costs.''
</P>
<P>
   PhRMA spokesman Grayson argues that intellectual property
protection can advance public health goals and that pharmaceutical
companies have a long track record of social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent more than any other industry trying to get medical
services to Africa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug manufacturers insist that there are no simple solutions
to the international AIDS crisis. The triple-combination drugs that
are saving lives in the United States and Europe require
sophisticated laboratory tests to monitor the type of drug and
dosage. Most poor countries do not even have the money to buy the
simplest AIDS diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Laing, of the Boston University School of Public
Health, said that bypassing patents won't begin to solve the drug
access problem in the poorest countries. ``The vast majority of
drugs on the World Health Organization essential-drug list are
off-patent. Despite that, access remains poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Laing said that if compulsory licensing is used by developing
countries, it will make more sense to apply it to production of the
most cost-effective drugs _ those that can cure rather than just
control disease. For example, the anti-fungal drug fluconazole can
cure a variety of diseases within a short time frame, whereas AIDS
antiviral drugs work best only in three-drug combinations, have
serious side effects and must be taken over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry experience of tuberculosis control in developing
countries also should give AIDS activists pause, said Laing.
Although common TB strains can be cured by a combination of
antibiotics costing $20 to $30, incomplete therapy can breed
drug-resistant strains that respond only to drugs costing $2,000 to
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AIDS drugs are used badly, resistance will develop and
people will transmit the resistant virus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists, however, plan to keep the issue in the public
eye during the Seattle conference. ``There will be teach-ins,
lobbying and protests,'' said Sydney Levy, campaign director for
the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of lower-cost drugs to developing countries hope to
persuade trade ministers to impanel a WTO working group to look
into access to ``essential medicines,'' perhaps in concert with the
U.N.'s World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activist Eric Sawyer, co-founder of the Health Gap
Coalition and someone whose life has been saved by antiviral drugs,
typifies the passion that is driving American AIDS activists to the
international arena. At AIDS conferences, he has sat side by side
with activists from developing countries who do not have the same
access to antiviral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch them die in front of my eyes. It rips me apart,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a prominent international activist, Sawyer gets e-mails from
colleagues overseas begging for supplies of the triple-combination
drugs. ``I have to say, `I wish I could help you, but I can't.' ''

CUSTER TRAIL LEADS TRAVELERS TO HISTORY, HEIGHTS OF THE
IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My best trip ever?
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. That's a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my travels have been themed. Sports-focused holidays
have revolved around soccer in San Francisco and baseball in St.
Louis; historical jaunts have led to castles in Germany and pueblos
in New Mexico; musically tuned vacations have culminated in
concerts in Orlando, Chicago and New Orleans. On other dedicated
trips, I have hiked in Turkey, roller-skated in Minnesota and skied
in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But the all-time best?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ireland's Donegal had fabulous scenery, terrific soccer and
good beer, but it was so cold that I didn't feel my toes for the
entire two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ I wept for joy the first time I saw Mickey's Magic Kingdom.
Too bad I was 20; it caused quite a scene.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bustling Bangkok with its temples and temptations was
fascinating, but a lost passport sapped the fun of that exotic
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   _ For days I marveled at the palpable power of Washington, D.C.,
but I dreaded the nights at a cheap motel where most guests paid by
the hour and bat-wielding teens tortured rats in the alley.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my most loosely themed trip was my best. My favorite
traveling companion and I spent a week on the trail of George
Armstrong Custer, the controversial yellow-haired general who met
his Waterloo at Little Bighorn.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trip marked not as much by what we saw as by what we
imagined:
</P>
<P>
   _ The sky slicing open and spilling stars onto the forest during
a violent thunderstorm at Custer State Park near Rapid City, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gutzon Borglum's disappointment of not seeing his monumental
salute to democracy, Mount Rushmore, completed before he died. Work
commenced in 1927, and while it took only 6{ years to carve the
four presidents' faces, the plagued project wasn't finished until
1941, eight months after the sculptor's death at age 74.
</P>
<P>
   _ The force of a vision such as sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski's
tribute to American Indians. His Crazy Horse would be 563 feet high
and 641 feet long. Compare that to nearby Mount Rushmore, where
George Washington's face is 60 feet tall. The sculptor began his
project more than 50 years ago, armed with a jackhammer, explosives
and $174. He died in 1982, and Crazy Horse is still a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Along the trail, we rediscovered the power of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Before white settlers came to what is now northeastern Wyoming,
the unique geological formation currently known as Devils Tower was
called Mateo Tepee, or Bear Lodge. The story: Chased by a fierce
bear, seven sisters take refuge in a great tree. The bear's huge
claws scrape the tree as the girls climb higher and higher to
safety. Eventually the sisters are lifted to the sky, where they
become the seven stars of the Big Dipper.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years later, Steven Spielberg told quite a different
story in his film ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' The 1977
hit depicted the formation as a magical welcome mat for visiting
aliens. While Devils Tower became a national monument in 1906, it
is Spielberg's story that lures hundreds of thousands of visitors
to the park each year.
</P>
<P>
   Moving westward through Wyoming, we contemplated the perils of
life on the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of Fort Phil Kearny, we imagined the life of the
soldier sent to battle many foes: isolation, extreme weather,
rattlesnakes and a hostile people with more at stake than a young
infantry soldier. We spent hours walking the site of the
short-lived fort, constructed along the Bozeman Trail in 1866 to
protect westbound travelers from Indian attacks. Thousands of logs
were used to build the fort, which boasted 8-foot walls and
enclosed more than 17 acres. Two years later, it was abandoned by
the Army. Soon after that, Cheyenne Indians burned it.
</P>
<P>
   The fort's most famous soldier is remembered for a gaffe, not
greatness. Capt. William Fetterman disobeyed orders and was led
into a trap near the fort. He and his 81 men were killed. We walked
around the well-marked battleground, dodging rattlesnakes and
imaginary enemies on a lonely, windblown ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The week climaxed at Little Bighorn Battlefield in southeast
Montana. The national monument marks the site where Custer and more
than 200 members of the 7th Cavalry were killed in a battle with
Sioux and Cheyenne forces in 1876. Led by Sitting Bull and Crazy
Horse, the Indians claimed their most dramatic victory in a doomed
quest to preserve their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Like generations of history buffs, we were drawn to the
battlefield by its myths, its mysteries and its momentousness in
American history. While the Indians won the battle, Little Bighorn
lost them the war by bolstering the U.S. government's commitment to
their domination.
</P>
<P>
   My companion was eager to walk the entire battlefield, to decide
for himself where errors were made and comrades were betrayed.
Well-versed in Custer lore, he walked along the ridge, imagining
troop movements and second-guessing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly aware that I should have beefed up on American history
before the trip, I became engrossed in the many ranger talks,
historic films and tours offered at the visitors center. Much of
the information dealt with the archaeological research done at the
battlefield and the site's importance to American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   That evening at dinner, with ``Garryowen'' echoing in our heads,
my companion presented his latest theories, and I shared my
conversations with the park's American Indian rangers.
</P>
<P>
   We agreed it had been the best day ever. &QL;

 DIVISION, DISSENT MAY RULE AT WTO SUMMIT  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed like a great idea when the Clinton administration
volunteered Seattle as the host city for next week's World Trade
Organization summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to demonstrate to the American public the
importance of international commerce than by showcasing the
powerful yet little-known WTO?
</P>
<P>
   The decisions that are made in Seattle _ and the three-year
round of WTO negotiations that is expected to follow _ will
determine nothing less than the rule book for the global economy of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit is threatening to blow up in the administration's
face.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a lightning rod for critics on the left and right,
nationally and internationally, and has caused bitter diplomatic
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The summit has provoked an increasingly loud debate over the
fast-evolving system of free trade, which backers say has brought a
bonanza of business activity to the four corners of the globe but
critics argue has impoverished millions in developing nations and
has eroded democracy.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit will be 5,000 dignitaries from the WTO's 135
member nations, spanning the spectrum from President Clinton to, it
is expected, Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets, meanwhile, will be tens of thousands of
protesters from labor, environmental and other groups who promise
to raise a ruckus in full view of the media. Several thousand will
come from the Bay Area, which has become a hotbed of anti-WTO
activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO has become a target of grievances for everything that
has gone wrong in the world in many decades,'' WTO Director-General
Mike Moore, a former prime minister of New Zealand, acknowledged
recently. ``If we were not a democratic institution, we'd rebrand
ourselves and start again.''
</P>
<P>
   On the agenda in Seattle is a new round of negotiations over
such multibillion-dollar trade topics as biotechnology,
intellectual property rights, agriculture, forestry and the
services sector (which includes banking, insurance,
telecommunications and e-commerce).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proposals are designed to spur greater trade and
flows of investment by reducing tariffs and cutting government
intervention in the WTO's member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the agenda's seemingly bland surface, however, lies a
diplomatic minefield.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter conflicts over issues that get little attention from most
Americans pit the United States against its own allies, rich
nations against poor, and sometimes neighbor against neighbor _ all
in complex, sometimes byzantine ways.
</P>
<P>
   In agriculture, for example, the United States and other major
food-exporting nations are fighting the European Union, Japan and
South Korea over demands that they cut their enormous subsidies to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States and the others prevail, U.S. agribusiness _
including California's _ could see a big increase in sales as the
elimination of subsidies forces foreign farmers to raise their
export prices. But the demands have sparked a raucous protest
movement among European farmers.
</P>
<P>
   A nasty wrangle also is expected over labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration _ under pressure from the AFL-CIO and
congressional Democrats _ is advocating that a study be done on the
impact of trade on workers' rights. The plan is being fought tooth
and nail by diplomats from low-wage Asian and Latin American
nations who worry that it could lead to trade sanctions for rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   When it premiered on New Year's Day 1995 as the beefed-up
successor to the 47-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the WTO was hailed as sort of a combination of United
Nations and World Court for trade _ the arbiter and enforcer of the
hectic, mind-boggling process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike GATT, the WTO can judge trade disputes between nations
and force the losers to change their domestic laws or pay large
tariff increases.
</P>
<P>
   Since the WTO's formation, international trade has grown by 37
percent, to $6.5 trillion last year, and 1.5 million new jobs have
been created worldwide. Last week's landmark agreement between
Washington and Beijing to speed China's entry will add the world's
seventh-largest economy to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   California also has seen rapid growth in trade, with the San
Francisco Bay Area now exporting more than $40 billion annually in
goods, such as electronics and computers, and an unknown amount in
services.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, business interests are lobbying all-out in
Washington, at the WTO's Geneva headquarters and in capital cities
worldwide, in favor of a wide-ranging expansion of the WTO's
powers.
</P>
<P>
   They say that for the world economy to keep booming, tariffs
must be cut further and new rules must be added to help regulate
the fast-changing trade in technological products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area stands to benefit more than any other region in
the country from a successful WTO,'' said Sean Randolph, president
of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a San Francisco-based alliance of
local governments and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unique strength is in knowledge-intensive industries _
information technology, computers, multimedia, telecom, medical
technology, biotech _ which have an enormous and growing demand
internationally. Unless the WTO opens up those markets, makes them
more transparent and accessible, we won't gain the same
advantage,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic benefit to be had, some federal, state and
local legislators worry that the WTO is undermining their lawmaking
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is essential for the Bay Area, so we all encourage it,''
said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``But the WTO's rules don't
reflect the values of this country. It limits countries' rights to
legislate against labor or environmental abuse, so it basically
ratifies the right to use sweatshops, prison labor or child labor,
or kill dolphins or use asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, WTO rulings have forced the United States to weaken
provisions of the Clean Air Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act
and the Endangered Species Act, while South Korea has lowered meat
safety regulations, Australia has loosened up on tests of imported
salmon, and India is lifting its ban on pharmaceutical patents.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' ability to levy anti-dumping tariffs also is
under fire. Last month, the WTO ruled in favor of a European Union
complaint against U.S. anti-dumping sanctions on steel, and South
Korea and Japan have filed similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
   State and local laws also can run afoul of the WTO. In
September, for example, Gov. Gray Davis vetoed the Buy California
Act, a bill giving locally manufactured goods a 5 percent price
preference for state and local government purchases, because he
said it would violate WTO rules against such preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was supported by steel firms and labor unions, which
said it would create thousands of new jobs in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under its current powers, the WTO dramatically constrains the
ability of state and local governments to enact a wide variety of
economic-development and environmental laws,'' said Robert
Stumberg, a law professor at Georgetown University who is an expert
on trade policy. ``The next round (of WTO negotiations) is likely
to further limit those powers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been put on the defensive by the
criticism, which threatens to undercut support among environmental
groups and labor unions for Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the administration has belatedly echoed the
critics' charges that the WTO's extreme internal secrecy must be
ended. Currently, all deliberations and records of trade disputes
are closed to the public, and unlike the U.S. court system,
nonparticipants are barred from filing friend-of-the-court briefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO has been treated for too long like some private
priesthood for experts where we know what's right and we pat you on
the head and tell you to just go right along and play by the rules
that we reach,'' Clinton said last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't work that way anymore. If we want the world
trading system to have legitimacy, we have got to allow every
legitimate group with any kind of beef, whether they're right or
wrong, to have some access to the deliberative process of the
WTO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The talk about greater transparency faded quickly, as other
nations criticized the U.S. proposal as a power play by American
labor unions and protectionist groups. Administration officials
have spent recent weeks busily backpedaling, trying to defuse the
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Further clouding the prospects for success in Seattle, 14 months
of talks in Geneva to prepare a common agenda for the summit
collapsed Tuesday because of bickering over a wide variety of
issues. As a result, diplomats in Seattle will have only four days
to hammer out an agreement for a new round.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprising has been the formation of a firm bloc of
developing nations led by Malaysia, India, Pakistan and Egypt,
which are demanding tariff concessions and development aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous disillusionment, frustration and
bitterness that the material benefits promised to developing
nations at the (WTO's previous) Uruguay Round haven't
materialized,'' said Martin Khor, president of Third World Network,
an influential Malaysian think tank, and an informal adviser to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an increase in exports by rich countries, and
imports into developing nations have grown,'' Khor said. ``The
trade deficit of our countries is now 3 percent of gross national
product, more than a decade ago, and there's a lower growth rate.
As a result, most developing countries don't want a new round.''
</P>
<P>
   Many poorer _ and smaller _ nations also say that they are being
left out of the WTO's secretive negotiating process, in which the
United States and a handful of other, influential nations hammer
out many issues by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders warn that the dangers of a stalemate are large.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration doesn't compromise on the labor
issue and if developing nations don't bend, too, there could be a
deadlock in Seattle,'' said Thomas Niles, president of the U.S.
Council for International Business, the principal American business
lobbying group on trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are too high for both the U.S. and world economies
to let that happen,'' he said.

BIG RED BOAT TEXAS-BOUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven months before its debut, Premier Cruise Lines is making a
significant change in its product targeted for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Good-bye, IslandBreeze. Hello, Big Red Boat III.
</P>
<P>
   Same ship. New name. New concept. Well, actually a familiar
concept in Florida, soon to be expanded all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Facing potentially strong competition at the Port of Houston
from the newer, bigger and already established Norwegian Sea, and
with industry giant Carnival primed to inaugurate sailings from
Galveston next fall, Premier will attempt to carve a niche by
focusing on family cruising during weekly voyages to three ports in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will have their own dining area and dinner hour (5 p.m.),
their own menu, their own activities, even shore excursions geared
to young people,'' Premier president Bruce Nierenberg says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have separate facilities and counselors for kids ages
2-4, 5-8, 9-12 and teens. And because parents will know their kids
are well taken care of, they'll be able to fully enjoy all the
other services we offer. We won't be cutting back, either, on any
of our standard activities and entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT'S NEW? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the question is: What's so radically different
about Premier's approach?
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line, which pioneered weeklong ``Texaribbean''
sailings from the Port of Houston to Mexico and Honduras in May
1997, also offers a variety of kids' programs (and menus) aboard
its Norwegian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, whose Celebration will operate four- and five-day
itineraries from Galveston beginning Oct. 5, sponsors a year-round
supervised Camp Carnival for passengers ages 2-15.
</P>
<P>
   But Nierenberg, previously with NCL and largely responsible for
that line's initial presence here, says Premier has some
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ship coming to Houston has a lot of larger staterooms
equipped to handle third and fourth beds,'' he says. ``We can
easily accommodate 500-600 kids above our normal adult capacity.
The Sea is a great ship, but she's totally different. Most cabins
are small. She's limited in the number of kids she can carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Won't some travelers be put off at the prospect of 500 children
_ plus as many as 1,146 adults _ vying for space on a ship that, at
31,000 tons, is much smaller than the Norwegian Sea or Celebration?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because if you know what you're doing, 500 kids can seem
like less of a distraction than 100 kids on other ships,''
Nierenberg says. ``And we know how to do this right; it's been our
focus for many years. We'll have separate areas of the ship
dedicated to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
APPEALING NOT JUST TO KIDS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Boat family concept goes beyond kids, Nierenberg
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year alone, 93 million adults will take a family trip,''
he says. ``But what constitutes a family? It is parents with kids.
But it's also honeymooners, single parents, extended families,
grandparents and couples without children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dare I say he's covered the waterfront there? Wait: ``We'll have
a lot of family reunions aboard the Big Red Boats, too,''
Nierenberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Premier claims to have pioneered the concept of the family
cruise vacation in 1983. For 10 years it was ``the Official Cruise
Line of Walt Disney World,'' specializing in land-sea packages. One
Big Red Boat remains a fixture at Port Canaveral, Fla., with
packages that include Universal Studios Escape.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Nierenberg, ``Now, we are bringing our Big Red Boat to
where the people live.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be four Big Red Boats in all.
</P>
<P>
   Big Red Boat I will continue to offer three- and four-night
cruises from Port Canaveral, combined with land packages at
Orlando-area resorts (but struggling for market share since the
debut of two newer and larger Disney Cruise Line vessels over the
past two years).
</P>
<P>
   Big Red Boat II, the recently chartered Edinburgh Castle, will
operate New England/Canada itineraries from New York next summer,
then switch to the Caribbean in the fall. Big Red Boat IV, now
known as the Rembrandt, will be based in Los Angeles beginning next
November.
</P>
<P>
   Big Red Boat III will sail from the Port of Houston to Vera
Cruz, Cozumel and Playa del Carmen starting in June.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see this and other recent strategies as Premier
grasping for any edge with an older fleet (including the 1961
vessel bound for Houston) in an increasingly competitive business.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Nierenberg, a co-founder of Premier and a longtime
industry leader, proclaimed the company ``the cruise line of the
individual.'' Then he announced a focus on ``Seven-Star Service'' _
an obvious takeoff on ship ratings by ``Fielding's Worldwide
Cruises,''an annual guide whose highest designation has progressed
from five-star to five-star-plus to six-star in recent editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely still have our Seven-Star Service aboard the
Big Red Boats,'' Nierenberg says. Amenities will range from
complimentary evening shoeshine service to tableside cooking.
``Chocolate-ship cookies'' will be awaiting kids at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Premier has firmed itineraries and is accepting reservations for
its first Houston venture, which will offer departures each
Saturday and feature at least 10 hours in each Mexican port.
</P>
<P>
   Brochure prices are $1,369-$2,269 per person, with third and
fourth guests in a stateroom _ read kids _ paying $569 each (or
$469 for ages 2-9).
</P>
<P>
   Consult a travel agent about significant discounts (but don't
expect bargains quite as extreme as a current $996 family-of-four
rate for land-sea packages on Big Red Boat I in Florida).
</P>
<P>
   Carnival also has announced Galveston-based itineraries through
2001. Brochure rates are $699-$1,229 per person for a four-night
sailing.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can provide brochures and discuss special fares
for these and Norwegian Sea departures.

WHEN YOU GO: LUCERNE AND LONDON

LUCERNE 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carnival: The Lucerne Carnival begins before dawn on the
Thursday before Ash Wednesday. (Ash Wednesday is March 8, 2000.)
Lucerne's 2000 celebration is scheduled March 2-7, with parades
planned March 2, 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Swiss Carnival celebrations take place after Lent
begins, a Protestant reaction to Catholicism. Basel's Carnival, the
nation's biggest with more than 20,000 masked participants, begins
at 4 a.m. March 13 next year and continues through the evening of
March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Italian-speaking communities in southern Switzerland's Ticino
region celebrate Carnival in a different fashion. In a tradition
dating to the 1860s, risotto feasts are the highlight on Shrove
Tuesday (Mardi Gras Day, March 7, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Rail passes: Rail Europe offers a multitude of travel passes
that focus specifically on Switzerland or include other European
countries. A four-day Swiss Pass costs $136 per person in second
class or $208 in first class when two or more people travel
together. Children under 16 travel free with a parent. Swiss Passes
for unlimited travel covering 8, 15 or 21 consecutive days or one
month also are available.

FUN-FILLED WINTER VACATION TO ENGLAND AND SWITZERLAND TOPS LIST OF
FAVORITES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questions in Switzerland:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why did the housekeeper place earplugs, not chocolates, on
the pillows tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Are we allowed to play the harp in our hotel room?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Will you summon our waiter? The tablecloth is on fire!''
</P>
<P>
   Surprises in London:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What do you mean all this formal wear spread over the bed is
for my wedding? I'm already married!''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Can you believe our good fortune in seeing three icons of
the British theater _ Sir John Gielgud, Dame Maggie Smith and Koo
Stark?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Is that tall man bumping us from our flight home Tommy
Tune?''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge today: determining my best travel experience ever.
Not necessarily the most exotic itinerary, the most daring
adventure or the most enriching odyssey. Just one favorite trip _
even a flawed favorite, though fun-filled _ to commemorate the
impending conclusion of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the memory bank of my travels overflows, how is it
that I've come to choose a rather uncomplicated (or so wife and I
envisioned) three-week vacation in Switzerland and England during
the dead of winter almost 12 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   I begin the process of elimination:
</P>
<P>
   There was the spring when, as a sportswriter, I proposed
visiting 26 major-league baseball training camps in 26 days _ and
almost fainted when the boss took me up on the idea. For sheer
endurance, that one ranks high. Alas, the boss also expected 26
stories in 26 days, detracting a wee bit from the enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you imagine I learned my lesson, several years later, after
I had assumed my current position, came a 17-day whirlwind tour of
Wales, Scotland and England that included 15 hotels in 15 cities
and towns.
</P>
<P>
   The pace does occasionally slow. Indeed, I'll always cherish
living like a local for the better part of a month in a Barcelona
apartment during the 1992 Olympics. Lingering over a bottle of fine
wine on the terrace of a 10th-century German castle overlooking the
Rhine River. Leisurely exploring the Natchez Trace, the Oregon
coast, Wisconsin farm lands and so many Texas treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Some snapshots are permanently etched in the mind: singing
around a campfire beneath twinkling stars in Yellowstone National
Park; Mozart chamber music resonating within a fortress overlooking
Salzburg, Austria; parasailing above Acapulco Bay, losing my
glasses and not being able to see how scared I was; and struggling
with chopsticks _ the most effective diet procedure I've undertaken
_ for meal after meal in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the foods of the world: feasting on foie gras in Provence,
kim chi in Seoul, Jagerschnitzel in Vienna and Jack Daniels Pie in
Lynchburg, Tenn. Hey, cut me some slack: I need fuel to fulfill
this task. And I did resist a kangaroo burger in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It's also tempting to revisit the beginning _ the morning my
father and I embarked from our home on the Mississippi Gulf Coast
for my first real trip, to Rocky Mountain National Park in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   I can still see the horror on Daddy's face when I lost my
breakfast peering down as we crossed the old Mississippi River
bridge in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you can handle heights?'' he said. ``Maybe this
trip isn't such a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   I was 9 years old. What if he'd turned the car around? Would I
never have developed an addiction to travel?
</P>
<P>
   Never discovered earplugs on my pillow?
</P>
<P>
   February 1988:
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe this seems a strange time of year to vacation in
Switzerland, considering that the wife and I don't ski. But we are
reasonably polished at apres-skiing. And once I'd witnessed the
grandeur of the snowcapped Rockies, and later the Alps, I was
magnetized.
</P>
<P>
   So I wrote about the Super Bowl from balmy San Diego on a
Sunday, flew home on Monday, packed on Tuesday and headed back to
Houston Intercontinental Airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``London. Flight 4. Canceled.'' We stared at the words on the
monitor. ``No, that was last night's flight; we're just delayed
tonight,'' an attendant reassured us.
</P>
<P>
   This was the old Continental. The bad Continental. Not the
reinvented good Continental of today. But as a frequent flyer in
the era of ``triple-mile promotions,'' I had earned two free
first-class tickets, and we weren't about to let a minor
inconvenience spoil the rare treat of crossing the pond in luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret to announce that it will take several hours to
repair the aircraft,'' the attendant was now saying. ``Please
collect meal vouchers at the gate, and we'll keep you informed of
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a pause. Maybe 10 seconds. ``Wait!'' she shouted, halting
the stampede. ``I've just been told the airplane is fixed. We'll
board momentarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to fret. This was devised as a relaxing trip: a break
between hectic work assignments. We would spend nine nights in
``Zimmer 29,'' a cozy but comfortable and familiar room at the
Wilden Mann Hotel in Lucerne, and nine nights at the London
Marriott. (Yes, I'm cheap; this was a frequent-traveler award,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   The prime objectives:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make Lucerne a base for scampering all about Switzerland,
using Swiss Passes for unlimited travel on trains and buses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Tower of
London _ each fascinates, but we'd seen them several times _ and
instead savor as many musicals and plays (and as much Indian and
Thai cuisine) as possible during our stay in London.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleep until noon if the spirit moved.
</P>
<P>
   Noon, hah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earplugs? We've left them for all our guests tonight
because Carnival starts at 4 a.m.,'' the Wilden Mann receptionist
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. where?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Right outside your window. The Carnival king gets to select
the headquarters. He chose us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was our second surprise in as many days. ``Zimmer 29 is under
repair; we must give you alternative accommodations,'' the manager
had informed at check-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Zimmer 29 is the only reason we're here,'' I pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you accept our penthouse apartment instead for the entire
length of your stay?'' the manager asked.
</P>
<P>
   If you must be awakened at 4 a.m., you may as well rise in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Two features of that vast apartment stand out in my memory: (1)
The beamed ceiling beside my bed was 5 feet, 6 inches above the
floor; I know because I stand 5 feet, 7 inches. (2) There really
was a harp _ an enormous harp _ in the dining room. And, yes, as
one who toys with the piano, I couldn't resist gingerly tickling
the strings.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the harp could be heard above the pulsating sounds of
kettles, drums and trumpets in the streets below. In terms of
revelry, the Lucerne Carnival would do New Orleans and Rio de
Janeiro proud. The Swiss manage to cram two months' worth of
celebration into about 36 hours, with kids and grandparents alike
decked out in blindingly bright colors _ many wearing masks 2-4
feet tall, masks towering toward the sky and all but defying
description other than to say that political correctness is not an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Once celebrants wear out the streets, they parade into
restaurants and taverns, instruments in hand, serenading each table
of diners. Then they move on to Basel or another town and begin the
fun anew.
</P>
<P>
   Partied out, we took a different path, or paths: a marathon rail
odyssey in the Swiss Alps on a gloriously snowy, sunny day,
changing trains at Zug, Goschenen, Andermatt, Disentis,
Reichenau-Tamins, Filisur, Davos Platz, Landquart and _ how did
this one get in here? _ Zurich during one 14-hour period. We even
arranged time for walking tours during stopovers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, as we followed the route of the Glacier Express,
the blizzard was so intense that we were in white-out conditions;
at other points we donned sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any shock that the Dole wine tasted better with every leg?
</P>
<P>
   Next day, we rode six trains to and from Zermatt, my favorite
village in the whole world _ a town where cars are banned and
visitors are greeted at the station by horse-drawn sleighs, a
winter wonderland in the shadow of the spectacular Matterhorn.
</P>
<P>
   If only they'll let us back now that we've almost burned down a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   You're familiar with two-alarm chili? This was four-alarm beef
fondue. We were about three bites into a delectable repast
(self-cooked, Swiss-style) when the Sterno _ the fuel beneath the
fondue pot _ escaped its container and began spreading fire across
our table.
</P>
<P>
   As we panicked and fellow diners shrieked, the waiter calmly
capped the Sterno, doused the flames and said, ``Care for
seconds?''
</P>
<P>
   That bit of drama set the stage for London.
</P>
<P>
   Including matinees and allowing for theaters being dark on
Sundays, the maximum number of performances we figured we could see
was nine. We saw nine.
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive evenings were reserved for the musicals ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Chess,'' each
still featuring part of its original cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hankie packs, 2 pounds each,'' an usher barked in the lobby
before the curtain opened for Les Miz. ``Better buy one, luv,'' a
woman advised, wisely (but then we teared up when we saw Fantine
and Eponine perish in Munich two years later, too, and we didn't
understand a word of the German lyrics).
</P>
<P>
   The highlight was a Saturday ``double-header,'' Maggie Smith and
Margaret Tyzack in ``Lettice and Lovage'' in the afternoon and John
Gielgud and Rosemary Harris in ``The Best of Friends`` at night.
Try sleeping after that combination.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Koo. Starring in Agatha Christie's ``And Then
There Were None.'' This was Koo Stark's West End debut, but she was
familiar _ all of her _ to many Londoners via some (how do we say
this gently?) modeling and film endeavors. Thanks to the British
tabloids, she also was familiar as a former companion of Prince
Andrew's. Before Fergie came and went.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical talent? Suffice it to say that in this particular
mystery she rated higher only than the troupe of Brits we watched
impersonate Puerto Rican singers and dancers in a revival of ``West
Side Story.'' (Try mixing those accents.) Koo, I understand, now
focuses on free-lance photography _ behind the lens.
</P>
<P>
   There was more suspense at our hotel when we returned from 14
hours of theater-hopping, shopping and dining (on mee krob and
chicken tikka) to find wedding attire pressed and cleaned and
draped over chairs, hanging in the closet and laid neatly on the
bed, ready for wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the ceremony wasn't planned for today,'' a
typically unfluttered British concierge said when I explained the
mistaken delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, room service brought flowers and champagne _
whether as an apology or as congratulations on my nuptials I'm
still not certain.
</P>
<P>
   One last adventure awaited at Gatwick Airport on the morning of
our return. Our flight to Houston was canceled, for real this time.
But as freeloading first-class passengers, we'd rate priority _ we
would, wouldn't we? _ and as we reached the front of the line, two
seats remained on a painless connection through New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' a harried man in a rush elbowed us aside and
pointed to a dapper, gangling fellow standing nearby. ``We've got
to get Tommy Tune on this flight to New York. It's important.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tommy Tune whistled his way to New York. ``And I can get you
and your companion on the next connection to Houston via Denver,''
the ticket agent offered consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Denver is two hours beyond Houston,'' I argued. ``And
there is a snowstorm in Denver. We'll get stranded.''
</P>
<P>
   What the hay. On a subsequent theater pilgrimage, I'd see
Tune-directed ``Grand Hotel'' and ``The Will Rogers Follies.''
Loved both. And we got in and out of Denver. Eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, almost 12 years later, rekindling memories is almost as
much fun as life on the road.

   &UR; IS FBI LEAKING IRRESPONSIBLE THEORIES ON EGYPTAIR CRASH? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: Note last graf) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ANDREW MARSHALL, The Independent, London &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The mystery of what happened to the Egyptair Boeing
767 which crashed off the U.S. coast two weeks ago may finally be
solved this week, as the tape from the cockpit voice recorder is
painstakingly transcribed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in British and American media has so far blamed
mechanical failure, a struggle between the crew, a bomb, a hijack
and a suicidal crew member _ without any evidence whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationality of the crew and the plane have apparently
encouraged reporters to make irresponsible guesses at what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Also, anonymous sources from one U.S. agency have repeatedly
leaked their views to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the leaks may be coming from the FBI, which would take
over the investigation if there was a strong presumption of
criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a number
of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for an
expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The change seemed to be a small one. British people buying the
new version of Apple Computer's operating system, OS9, noticed the
icon for deleting files wasn't called the Wastebasket anymore. It
was called the Trash.
</P>
<P>
   The result was uproar last week: for British users, accustomed
to having an English name for something, this was seen as part of a
creeping _ or possibly rampant _ change worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, British spellings such as ``colour'' and
``favour'' are being overwhelmed by the American versions _ color,
favor and so on.
</P>
<P>
   American culture, exported in TV series, the Internet and the
language of computers, is overwhelming ``British English'' so fast
that it may not be a question of if, but when, our spellings and
colloquial uses are forgotten. &QL;

   LONDON _ Two hundred women being treated for infertility have
had their embryos screened for genetic defects, and 20 children
have already been born in what critics warn could be the first step
towards ``designer'' babies.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial technique, called pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis, involves selecting embryos that are then checked for
genetic defects. Only those embryos free of defects are replanted
in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-life groups say scientists are ``meddling in human
evolution'' and that the technique could be used to select
qualities such as intelligence and sporting prowess. They fear
advances in the technique will trigger growing demands from parents
seeking the ``perfect'' child. &QL;

BERMUDA GRASS THRIVES IN SUNLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON_ Q: Could you give information on the care and
maintenance of Bermuda grass?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bermuda grass is a warm-season perennial turf grass that
spreads by stolons, deep rhizomes and seed. You may have noticed
how easily the stolons root at the nodes. The leaf blades are more
narrow than those of St. Augustine, another turf grass commonly
used in our area.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda grass needs a lot of sunlight. Don't expect good growth
in shade. Bermuda grass will thin in moderate shade.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda grass prefers a fair amount of rainfall or irrigation.
However, extended dry conditions can trigger semidormancy, and
often the grass will survive a drought. But this is a grass that's
at its best with moisture and good drainage.
</P>
<P>
   How much you should water depends, of course, on temperature,
sunlight, rainfall and soil type. A clay soil holds moisture, while
water quickly runs through sand. Deep, infrequent watering is
better than light, frequent watering. Supposedly, Bermuda grass can
survive on 20 inches of water a year, is green with 30 inches, and
is green and growing with 40 inches.
</P>
<P>
   While Bermuda grass tolerates acidic or alkaline and clay or
sandy soils, it must have a good supply of nitrogen to look its
best.
</P>
<P>
   Use and grass variety determines the amount of fertilizer
needed. Golf-course Bermuda grass gets daily care and demands a lot
of water, fertilizer and mowing. Your lawn needs less nitrogen but
enough to keep it vigorous and green. Fertilize in the spring when
the grass has greened. Fertilize again in fall. Potassium is
important for good root development. Some gardeners add a summer
application. Keep in mind that frequent fertilization and
irrigation, as with St. Augustine, seem to up the insect- and
disease-risk factor, so don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   Proper mowing is also important. Since Bermuda grass tolerates a
great deal of traffic, it's used on sports fields and golf courses
as well as home lawns. Mowing depends on use and variety. Hybrid
Bermudas on athletic fields and golf courses are clipped to an inch
or less. Hybrids on lawns are kept at an inch, and common Bermuda
is kept at 1-1 1/2 inches. Mow frequently during vigorous growth
periods so you don't remove too much top growth at one time. When
more than 30 percent of the leaf blade is removed during mowing,
the root system temporarily slows, since loss of top growth hinders
the plant's ability to make food.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda grass grows best when we have extended periods of heat,
mild winters and moderate to high rainfall. While Bermuda is green
year-round in frost-free areas, growth slows with cooler night
temperatures. Low day and night temperatures trigger discoloration;
below-freezing temperatures kill the leaf blades. The turf grass
remains dormant until there is an extended period of warmer day
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Various fungal diseases attack Bermuda _ dollar spot, leaf spot,
even brown patch. Always consult a certified nurseryman before
purchasing and applying a fungicide.
</P>
<P>
   Weeds can be pests in a Bermuda lawn, too, and healthy grass
encouraged by proper fertilization, adequate water and sunlight,
aeration and dethatching is your first line of defense.
Broad-leaved weeds such as chickweed and dandelion and grassy weeds
such as crabgrass will invade a thin, stressed area. There are
various pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides that can be used,
but I would first strive for a healthy lawn through good culture.
</P>
<P>
   Check the Yellow Pages for turf farms and information on retail
sources for sod or sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have just obtained a potato from a potato vine. When can I
plant it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The air potato, ``Dioscorea bulbifera,'' is a native of the
tropics. This fast-growing vine has large, spade-shaped leaves that
gardeners grow to cover a fence or trellis for a green sun shade.
</P>
<P>
   The vine gets its name from the potatolike tubers that appear
under the foliage in late summer and fall. These are harvested in
late fall before frost and planted in spring when the soil has
warmed. Full sun and an organically enriched, well-draining soil is
best. Vines freeze back to the ground and reappear in warm weather.
Store your potato in a cool, dry place until planting time. While
the tubers are in some countries, they are treated only as
ornamentals here.

HOLIDAY ON TAPE: GOOD THINGS IN SMALL PACKAGES

<P>
   It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Let it snow, let it
snow, let it snow.
</P>
<P>
   Just so long as that ``snow'' isn't visual drop-outs on a
defective VHS tape. That could turn someone's holiday gift into
slush.
</P>
<P>
   More often, our December tidings come with comfort, joy and _
boy _ lots of videos. While rentals drive the couch-potato market
month in and month out, year's end is the living end for video
sales.
</P>
<P>
   That means sleighs full of boxed sets, special editions and
holiday-themed videos are dropping into stores like snowflakes on a
reindeer's hide _ not to mention all those spiffy new DVDs that are
taking the United States by storm.
</P>
<P>
   So here's an overview and a guide to home entertainment's annual
gift-grabber campaign. Hopefully there's something here for
everyone _ just hold the snow, please.
</P>
<P>
   (Prices are suggested by the manufacturers. Prices are for VHS
tapes only, unless noted. Some stores and Internet outlets may sell
for less.)

   ``Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'': This entwines three tales
featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy and son Max, Donald and
nephews Huey, Duey and Louie _ and even pets Pluto and Figaro.
Their stories offer music, humor, fun and feeling, as the nephews
experience a spin on ``Groundhog Day'' (it's Christmas every day)
and Mickey and Minnie update O. Henry's classic 1906 short story,
``Gift of the Magi.'' Kelsey Grammer narrates. (VHS $22.99, DVD
$39.99)

<P>
   ``Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving'': Pooh Bear adds his honey
flavor with five new songs. This film, too, stitches together three

Acre Wood, from Pooh and Rabbit to Tigger and Piglet. ($22.99)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'': Disney also has issued the video

Jonathan Taylor Thomas. He plays a college student who must cross
America to get home by Christmas Eve. (VHS $22.99, DVD $29.99).

 &HT;    PHYSICIANS AND NURSES WAR OVER THE BUSINESS OF PUTTING YOU TO
SLEEP
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Nov. 28
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The next time they lay you on an operating table
and tell you to count to ten backwards, who's going to open that
little valve on the side of the clear tube running down to your
arm?
</P>
<P>
   Will a physician, an anesthesiologist, put you to sleep?
</P>
<P>
   Or will it be a certified registered nurse anesthetist, a
``CRNA,'' the kind of nurse whose profession has been giving
patients anesthesia since before there were any anesthesiologists?
</P>
<P>
   A big time struggle is underway over the answer to those
questions. It has about as many twists and subplots as an episode
of ``ER.'' But between patients, the anesthesiologists and the
CRNAs are not groping it up in the linen closet. This is an angry
row.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it erupted into public view two weeks ago at the
National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., when the hospital's
top anesthesiologist was sacked for refusing to carry out orders
giving CRNAs unsupervised authority to administer anesthesia to
certain healthy and moderately ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin Manalaysay, a Navy captain, was relieved of his
command as chief of anesthesiology at the hospital where
presidents, Supreme Court justices and members of Congress are
treated, along with sailors and
</P>
<P>
   admirals.
</P>
<P>
   The action touched off an uproar among Manalaysay's fellow
military and private practice anesthesiologists. For the past week
they have been filling up each other's computer screens with
indignant e-mail about what one called the ``dumbing down'' of
anesthesiology and medicine in general.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Anesthesiologists called for a
congressional investigation and Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., a
physician, said he was talking with members of the Armed Services
Committee about having one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something goes wrong in an operating room, it can be
horrible,'' said Weldon, a Melbourne, Fla., internist. ``The
patient's heart may stop beating. He or she may have a stroke.
Blood pressure may drop to zero. He may start inhaling his own
vomit. It's usually an absolutely catastrophic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such circumstances require the presence of a physician,
preferably an anesthesiologist, who has spent years in post-medical
school specialty training, Weldon believes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carolyn Bannister, an Atlanta anesthesiologist and former
CRNA, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the training is for both professions,'' said
Bannister, who practices pediatric anesthesiology at Children's
Health Care. ``In nurse anesthetist school, you hear about a lot of
diseases very broadly, in very little depth. You get very little
detail about the disease process. You get that training only in
medical school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a nurse anesthetist, I knew there was a lot I
didn't know, but I didn't now how much I didn't know,'' she added.
``It's kind of scary to think about what I was doing and how little
I knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists deal with
some pretty scary stuff _ operating room drugs that put a patient
to sleep, block pain and even induce paralysis so that surgeons or
other specialists can work.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery rate from anesthesia in America is incredibly
good _ something like one death for every 250,000 patients who are
anesthetized. Both professions claim credit for that and the
Bethesda affair is only part of a much larger struggle over whether
doctors or nurses will be in charge of anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Health Care Financing Administration requires
hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement to provide physician
supervision of nurses who administer anesthesia. The supervising
physician does not have to be an anesthesiologist and may be a
surgeon, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the government proposed removing the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists and the American
Society of Anesthesiology went to war, with each side whipping
together the customary public opinion polls, scientific surveys of
operating room
</P>
<P>
   survival rates and other ``facts'' that make up the raw material
of a national public policy debate. Comments were submitted to the
proposed rule change. Congressional testimony was drafted and
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The health financing agency received ``tens of thousands'' of
comments, said spokesman Chris Peacock, and decided to postpone
action.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget which Congress passed recently contained
language prohibiting any change in the Medicare regulation until a
``study'' has been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``CRNAs administer anesthesia for all types of surgical cases,
from the simplest to the most complex,'' declares the American
Association of Nurse Anesthetists. CRNAs are the sole anesthesia
providers in
</P>
<P>
   two-thirds of rural hospitals in the United States, the
association's literature points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is the operating surgeon often becomes the
supervisor,'' Jan Stewart, a Chicago CRNA and president of the
nurse anesthetist group, said in a telephone interview. ``But their
input is often minimal-to-none, because they know much less about
anesthesia than does the nurse anesthetist.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that her members are ``highly trained and qualified
professionals who are competent to do all the steps of
anesthesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta considered doing a national survey of
anesthesia outcomes but dropped the idea because poor anesthesia
outcomes are so rare, ``it would
</P>
<P>
   be a waste of government money to study it,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that as a nurse anesthetist, she can submit a bill to
Medicare under the plan's Part B, which pays fees to care
providers, and will be paid, with or without supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Part A, which pays for hospitalization, ``still contains the
original language from when Medicare was created in 1964''
requiring hospitals to provide physician supervision, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When a CRNA is supervised by an anesthesiologist, the two
professionals typically split the Medicare fee 50-50. But one
anesthesiologist can supervise up to four nurse-anesthetists
simultaneously. Of the four fees generated in such a case, the
anesthesiologist winds up with two and the four nurses split the
other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with nurse anesthetists every day, and I would never do
anything to demean or degrade them as individuals or as a group or
a specialty in nursing,'' said Dr. James McMichael, an Austin,
Texas,
</P>
<P>
   anesthesiologist. ``They have not only a reasonable role but an
absolutely necessary role in the delivery of care, but I think the
public is best served when a nurse anesthetist works under the
direct supervision of an anesthesiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Neeld of Atlanta, immediate past president of the
American Society of Anesthesiologists, said the debate between the
two professions needs to be toned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take the rhetoric off the table,'' he said. ``We,
the physicians, need to say that nurse anesthetists are indeed
skilled medical professionals who do a good job at what they are
educated to do. Our professions complement each other and we take
care of patients better when we work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we fight, the only people who do well are our
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon believes pressure from nurse anesthetists for
unsupervised privileges in military operating rooms and full
Medicare reimbursement for providing anesthetics in civilian
hospitals is part of a struggle ``that is old as the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of people who want to practice medicine who
aren't doctors,'' he said. ``Optometrists want to do laser surgery.
Psychologists want to prescribe psychiatric drugs. Nurse
practitioners and physician
</P>
<P>
   assistants want to open clinics and see patients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about an issue of patient safety,'' Weldon
added. ``We are talking about people dying if we let this camel get
his nose in the tent.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Jackson right on all counts in Illinois case
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson is taking a lambasting for his trouble on behalf
of seven unruly high school kids in Decatur, Illinois, but he
appears to be right on the merits of the instant case and even more
right against the larger background of worsening racial disparities
in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   For arguing that the crime (a student brawl in the stands at a
football game) didn't fit the punishment (two-year suspensions from
school), Jackson is denounced, falsely, as wanting to give
out-of-control kids carte blanche.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur school board scaled the suspensions down to a year,
with the students permitted to study at an alternative school, but
then four suspended students were charged with felonies, as if to
show Jackson a thing or two for butting in. Long suspensions and
criminal charges are heavy wages for a fight in which no one was
seriously hurt and was of a kind that unfortunately is far from
unheard of at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The anger of Decatur's black community and Jackson's mediation
are best read against growing black distress at the compounding
inequities in criminal justice, which have reached levels that are
devastating African-American life _ undermining family formation,
seeding unemployment and underemployment and disenfranchising
hundreds of thousands by creating a huge caste of men branded by
criminal records and embittered and socially lamed by imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is consistent: At every step, blacks are more likely
than whites to get the short end of the stick in comparable
circumstances. More likely in close calls to be charged, more
likely to be tried if charged, more likely to be convicted, to be
imprisoned _ and, on average, likely to be imprisoned longer.
</P>
<P>
   Take kids. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, black
youths between 10 and 17 account for 26 percent of arrests but 32
percent of juvenile court referrals, 41 percent of kids detained,
46 percent of juveniles sent to correctional facilities and finally
52 percent of youths transferred to adult courts _ at the end,
nearly double their in-take proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Or look at drugs. The U.S. Public Health Service found that 14
percent of drug users are black, but African-Americans account for
35 percent of drug arrests, 55 percent of convictions, 74 percent
of prison sentences. Some 65 percent of crack users are white, but
a 1992 study found 93 percent of crack convictions were of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. And on, with toxic outfall. In parts of South
Central Los Angeles, 70 percent of the young men are under court
control of one sort or another. And do we expect stable family
lives there?
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, in Decatur, is not asking us to shrug off
misbehavior. He has made that clear. He is asking us to recognize
that law-and-order overkill against teens virtually assures us not
better adults but dysfunctional adults, the more so when the
excesses heedlessly _ or might it be malignly? _ compound an
already gross and damaging racial inequity.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another stay-at-home New Year's Eve
 &HT;    For release, SUNDAY, Nov. 28, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ During my most recent visits to the super market, I have
paused at the section that displays champagne. It is stocked
heavily this year to meet our needs not only for a traditional New
Year's Eve but for the ersatz end of the century and new millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   (I strongly suspect that those entrepreneurs, propelling their
sales toward a century and millennium culmination will, sometime
around mid-2000, admit they were wrong and that the new century and
millennium really starts on Jan. 1, 2001_ to be celebrated with
their champagne and ocean cruises and lots of chicken wings all
over again.)
</P>
<P>
   There have been several times when I was tempted to reach for
the super market champagne, afraid in October and November that if
I really wanted it for Dec. 31, it would be gone by then.
</P>
<P>
   No bottle of bubbly made it into the shopping cart, however.
</P>
<P>
   This old fool plans to watch the clock turn midnight within the
confines of his own house. If any champagne is poured, it will be
there. Likely, I will put down a Diet Dr. Pepper. More likely, I
will be asleep at the celebrating moment, as I was last year.
</P>
<P>
   This can be chalked up to age, but not in the way that you might
think. Indeed, I am aging, but that's not why I became disenchanted
with New Year's Eve. It's just that, through experience, I tired of
the silly hats and horns, of all the tossed away money and of all
the booze so many of us sloshed down even before the champagne was
poured _ not to mention the hefty ransom I had to pay the
babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I tired of those awful hangover head and eyeball aches
that made watching bowl games on TV the next day an unbearable
chore.
</P>
<P>
   (This counsel is not aimed at young couples _ or singles _ as
they are daily in combat with their demanding jobs, their jumbo
bills and their merciless children. Many have earned the right to
turn loose, if for one night. Celebrate it, guys, but be heedful.
You'll be yearning to stay home in just a few years.)
</P>
<P>
   Supplemented by the century and millennium frenzy, this coming
celebration is beyond bounds. I say ``frenzy'' but I am beginning
to wonder if it is.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami Herald story last week uncovered that many of the major
events across the country as well as hotels and cruise ships have
not yet sold out for the millennium weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, they won't for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is the inflated cost of tickets and room rates to these
venues. As evidence was the cancellation announced last week of a
$1,000 to $2,500 per ticket New Year's Eve gala in New York City
that featured Aretha Franklin, Andrea Bocelli, Sting, Enrique
Iglesias and Tom Jones. Slow ticket sales were cited for the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is shown in a study by the Travel Industry
Association of America that says 76 percent of Americans likely
will not travel more than 100 miles from home that night. People
simply want to avoid potential chaos; even augured danger.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the premature centennial and millennium
mileposts, even more would be staying home _ not tempted to party
just a couple of weeks in front of Super Bowl, when the parties
seemingly are bigger and more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, I likely will go to the Orange Bowl Parade early in
the evening then get out of the downtown area and well within the
walls of my home before 10 p.m., as that is when what is attributed
to the cultures of the city's Hispanic population, guns are fired
into the air to welcome the new year. (What goes up, must come
down; but where?)
</P>
<P>
   The century/millennium hubbub is a well-done strategy of the
business world. We need to keep inventing things to celebrate, at
least one a month. But if there is anything to celebrate this time,
it would be that the clock clicks past midnight throughout the
world and the Y2K bug turns out to be nothing more than yet another
overstated anxiety.

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA1125: Pilgrims to Christ statue are united in
prayer, faith on annual ascent
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNLAND PARK, N.M. _ So many arduous steps taken. So little
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by unwavering faith, beckoned by the spirit of previous
generations, a people separated by the borders of three states and
two countries drew on their common belief that a journey to a
mountain peak on a Sunday might deliver answers to their humble
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   They drew deep breaths and stepped up steep paths, pushed aside
the pain of tired muscles to arrive atop Mount Cristo Rey, where
4,576 feet above sea level an opened-armed statue of Christ
welcomes them, their worries, their pleas, their gratefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for peace in the world, for all the world's needs, for
what is happening to our brothers and for all who need the love of
God,'' said Maria Consuelo Cordova, 78, one of the thousands who
made the trek.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova's voice boomed atop the summit, where she stood, arms
stretched to the face of Christ looming above her, as she sang in
Spanish the song, ``Cristo Rey'' _ ``Christ the King.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd that formed behind her joined in on the chorus and
followed along as she recited the rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years have passed since the first pilgrimage to the
32-foot-high statue of a robed Jesus Christ and the 40-foot cross
behind him. In those years, the statue has become a thread through
generations of families, as children and grandchildren take up the
tradition of preparing the path to the top, maintaining the statue
and organizing the annual pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration for building the icon is attributed to Monsignor
Lourdes Acosta, the parish priest of the extinct village of
Smeltertown, home to Mexican Americans who worked in the nearby
smelters. A short history book written in 1989 says Acosta
envisioned the mountaintop sanctuary on Oct. 25, 1933.
</P>
<P>
   He went to his parishioners with his vision about the desert
mountain that some knew then as Cerro de Muleros, Mule Drivers
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our parents in Smeltertown, Father Acosta had a meeting
before the monument was completed, and he asked the parents if they
would make a promise that they and their children and their
children's children would continue to maintain the monument and the
road and the pilgrimages,'' said Felix Vasquez Jr., president of
the volunteer Mount Cristo Rey Restoration Committee, which is
funded through donations.
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of the committee, Vasquez's parents helped
build the statue with white limestone from Austin quarries. The
statue faces east, capturing the dawn's light. Despite the years,
the faith and the rituals persevere. People come from throughout
the area, with congestion forming on the paths. A recent Mass was
said by the bishops of El Paso, Las Cruces, N.M., and Ciudad
Juarez, Chihuahua. The readings were lessons on humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like nature, the land. I like to see the faith of the
Catholic people. I like seeing that all the people have faith,
belief and feel good,'' said Jesus Maldonado, 75, of Anthony, N.M.
``I like to see that people will take the time to make a sacrifice
to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of votive candles brought up the dusty paths in plastic
grocery bags were placed at the statue's base, each holding a
personal invocation. A few bouquets of roses were squeezed between
the candles. But much of what comes along with the people is their
deep faith. Guadalupe Villeja, 37, walked barefoot up the sandy
switchbacks that cut through the rugged desert mountain. She held
her year-old daughter Emily in her arms, wrapped in a green
blanket. Three months into her pregnancy with Emily, a doctor had
told her that her daughter had died in her womb, she said. He
recommended the fetus be removed. But she said she visited another
doctor who found Emily's heartbeat, and when the girl was born at 7
pounds, Villeja promised the Virgin de Guadalupe that she would
make the Cristo Rey pilgrimage in her bare feet to give thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My baby's heavy,'' she said in Spanish as she neared the
trail's end, ``but it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalinda Armendariz was in her 25th year of ascending the
mountain. This year she went barefoot to thank God for the miracle
of her grandchild. Doctors told her daughter her son had spina
bifida, a congenital defect that causes paralysis and other
problems. Armendariz said she asked for divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked God for the miracle he created, and two weeks later,
he came out OK,'' said Armendariz, 47, of El Paso. ``If you see him
now, he's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some come for the fellowship, for the chance for a Sunday walk
with family and friends. Maria Teresa Loera, 53, of Sunland Park
and her friend Ricarda Santiago, 54, of Ciudad Juarez started early
and said they ran into people they'd met the year before along the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cristo Rey monument was built, the world was at war.
The statue, designed by Spanish sculptor Urbici Soler, was meant to
be a symbol of peace. Its purpose seems understood by the people
who come. Loera shook her head at the suggestion that she might
pray to win the lottery or for wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ask Christ for riches,'' Loera said in Spanish. ``The
only thing I ask of Christ is he give tranquility to me and my
family and to my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Such religious treks may become more popular as the turn of the
century looms, but most here said they would simply ask that all
goes well in the year 2000. None interviewed said they believed the
end of time approached, although some said that just to be sure,
they'd confess their sins and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, the El Paso bishop, said, ``We shouldn't have to wait for
the millennium. We don't have to wait for Christmas Eve or New
Year's Eve. We should live every day as if it's the last day of our
life, ready and willing to be accountable to the Lord Jesus as
Christ the King.''

The pilgrims come to the Christ the King statue from three counties
and two countries, for different reasons, but in shared fellowship.

</P>
<P>
   Such religious treks may become more popular as the turn of the
century looms, but most here said they would simply ask that all
goes well in the year 2000. None interviewed said they believed the
end of time approached, although some said that just to be sure,
they'd confess their sins and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, the El Paso bishop, said, ``We shouldn't have to wait for
the millennium. We don't have to wait for Christmas Eve or New
Year's Eve. We should live every day as if it's the last day of our
life, ready and willing to be accountable to the Lord Jesus as
Christ the King.''

 &HT;    A museum college kids could relish
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since University of Texas regents want a
building design that will be familiar to Texans for their $60
million to $70 million Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art, why don't
they build an art museum that looks like a Dairy Queen?
</P>
<P>
   When you're talking about Texas architecture, it just doesn't
get much more familiar than DQ. Everybody in Texas knows what a
Dairy Queen looks like. Van Gogh. To go. What's the difference?
I'll have the Picasso -- asket. Mr. Matisse, would you like fries
with that?
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to get a swelled head, but this is a darned good
idea on my part. UT regents were at loggerheads with the heralded
Swiss architectural firm of Herzog &AMP; de Meuron. The regents didn't
like the unusual one-story building with the undulating roof
proposed by the architects. It's a real mess. After the architects
quit the project in frustration, UT Architecture Dean Larry Speck
resigned, saying the Swiss architects were treated badly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the regents want an art museum with a more
traditional look. What could possibly be more traditional in Texas
than an art museum that looks like the home of the Hungr-Buster?
With 722 DQs, the Lone Star State has more DQs than any other
state.
</P>
<P>
   Just think how much money UT would save if it built a Dairy
Queen-look-alike art museum. Heck, the regents could put the extra
loot into additional luxury boxes at Royal-Memorial Stadium. What
Texan in his right mind wouldn't trade a couple of Renoirs for a
Yugoslavian place-kicker who can knock them home from 60 yards and
a running back to be named later?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, DQs are as much a part of Texas culture as football, a
bowl of red and the smog drifting in from Houston. Everybody who
was raised in a small Texas town has seen the building with the
familiar red mansard roof.
</P>
<P>
   And you didn't think I knew anything about architecture. I'll
bet Rita Clements, wife of former Gov. Bill Clements; retired Tyler
financier Dub Riter; Laredo oilman Tony Sanchez; and Houston
businessman Raul Romero didn't know DQs have a mansard roof.
</P>
<P>
   These four UT regents make up the Facilities Planning and
Construction Committee, the group that scrutinized the undulating
roof building design the Swiss architects presented.
</P>
<P>
   What do these people know about architecture? On Sanchez's
resume, it says he is ``an avid fisherman.'' Great. Just what we
need. An art museum that looks like Roy Bob's Bait &AMP; Tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's this business of having a man called Dub helping
pick out the architectural design. At this rate, UT could become
the only university in the country that has an art museum with
liquid propane on the side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   If the regents don't like my DQ suggestion, why not go with a
Taco Bell design? Taco Bell has that faux-Alamo facade on the
front, which is very Texan. Besides, the university advertises the
fast-food chain every football game at Royal-Memorial Stadium with
an annoying loud BONG sound emanating from the JumboTron video
display board.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, the Taco Bell building plan blends in well with
the Southwestern architecture of many of the buildings on campus.
</P>
<P>
   So what if it has a drive-up window? Maybe Jack S. Blanton likes
burritos.

 &HT;    Thankful the big people's table got everything wrong
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I have a near-superstitious reluctance to
count my blessings. Even on Thanksgiving. Particularly on
Thanksgiving. I am thankful when we don't get around to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Blessings, real blessings, don't announce themselves.
Enumerating them in a blessing census seems to endanger them, even
cheapen them. But sometimes you can't escape the topic.
</P>
<P>
   When cornered, I will admit one of the big things I'm thankful
for is that nearly everything wise grownups told me when I was a
kid about the way the world would be right now, at the turn of the
millennium, was just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   First some chronology: I was among the last group of American
first graders to be marched into a school cafeteria and told to
practice cowering under tables in preparation for nuclear war.
Being a little kid, I just assumed world wars were things that
break out
</P>
<P>
   from time to time and that crouching under a table could help.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a half-inch of varnished pine offered minimal
protection from atomic fallout, it did get across the idea that
this was a bad, dangerous world we were heading toward, walking
single-file into the future with no talking or cutting up in back.
</P>
<P>
   I tell all this to my kids and they roll their eyes. But they
are 14 and do that no matter what I say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when I think about the how 20th century was supposed to
end, and I compare it to the world this Thanksgiving, the contrast
is striking and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: The Soviets will expand into a divided free
world. Stay under the table.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: McDonalds expanded into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: Motorists will be enraged as the global oil
supply begins running dry. We will face high prices, long lines,
rationing and dinky cars.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: Motorists are enraged after gasoline prices clib
from 99 cents a gallon to $1.40 a gallon in less than year. Car
commercials mention built-in cup holders but not miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: Congress will be locked in battle and unable
to react to the depression caused by our insurmountable budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: Congress is locked in battle and fortunately
unable to jeopardize the national economic expansion helped along
by a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: Computerization will cause widespread
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: The computer industry worries about finding
enough employees.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: We'll all end up working for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: We'll end up working for Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: Information will be more controlled as
newspapers are replaced by a few centralized television networks.
People will think more alike as a result.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: Television networks are being replaced by cable
and the Internet. I turn off The Coleslaw Wrestling Channel and
check out the Web site of the Southern Red-haired Dyslexic League.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: World famine will break out as population
outstrips farm production.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: Farmers are threatened by depressed prices
because of a worldwide grain glut.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: Florida will be invaded by Cuban communists.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: Florida was invaded by Cuban capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: Global warming will melt the ice caps in
another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: Global warming will melt the ice caps in yet
another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What we were told: We're on the verge of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: We're on the verge of figuring out how to dispose
of outdated nuclear missile parts.
</P>
<P>
   What I was told: You will grow up, straighten out and lead a
normal life.
</P>
<P>
   What happened: I became a newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
   So this Thanksgiving, I look across the table, joyful that I
wheedled my way into the house of someone who can cook. I wish upon
my children a continuation of these blessings continue and that
everything I warn them about is wrong.

 &HT;    In America people can speak their minds no matter how narrow
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Ku Klux Klan, in all it slimy variations, is a
despicable organization with un-American views.
</P>
<P>
   That's my view. I have a constitutional right to express my
views on the Ku Klux Klan, which is the American way.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Klan members have a constitutional right to
express their views, which also is the American way.
</P>
<P>
   While their ability to express their views may be the American
way, I believe the Klan's views of white supremacy, racial
divisiveness, intolerance and bigotry oppose the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month about a dozen hooded members of a Ku Klux
Klan faction from Indiana came to Waco. Oh, happy day.
</P>
<P>
   The masked bigots held a rally on the courthouse steps to
express their views on the government's actions at the Branch
Davidian compound in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up letter to the editor from Waco's Katie Mayfield
expressed the opinion that McLennan County Commissioner Lester
Gibson's proposal to require a five-day notice for people who want
to speak on county property should have been given more
consideration by the other commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   She said it cost thousands of dollars for extra police and
security during the Klan's courthouse rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would have been all right if they would have burned
a cross on the courthouse lawn,'' Mayfield concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield evidently feels the same way I do about the Klan. But
there is a difference between the Klan's right to express their
views and burning a cross on the courthouse lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan's views are protected by the First Amendment.
``Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech
... or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for redress of grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan has just as much right to make a speech on the
courthouse steps as does the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Burning a cross on the courthouse lawn, however, likely would
get them arrested. There are laws against the destruction of public
property. Besides, the county has a burn ban in effect due to our
prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
   Besides harming property, there also are laws against harming
people _ or even making imminent threats to harm people.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have a right to express their views, but they do not
have a right to act on those views if their actions violate
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan members expressed their views on the courthouse steps
and slimed their way back home again to Indiana where I hope they
stay.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier, Ku Klux Klan members met at Foley Square in
New York City. They had been denied sound equipment by the courts.
They also had been denied the ability to wear masks. Supreme Court
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg upheld an old New York state law that
prohibits masks at public demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Washington Post, constitutional expert Nat
Hentoff said the children brought by their parents to the rally to
see the bigots ``got a vivid First Amendment lesson when a young
woman in the crowd said of the Klan members, `This is America. They
have a right to speak.'''
</P>
<P>
   For expressing that view, Hentoff said a mob of
counter-demonstrators surrounded the woman, kicked and spat at her
and, according to the New York Times, beat her on the head with
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they didn't burn the flags,'' Hentoff wrote. After being
pummelled to the ground, the woman finally escaped into the
Municipal Building.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the woman who defended free speech was
un-American.
</P>
<P>
   For America to remain free, free speech must be preserved, even
for repulsive Ku Klux Klan members.

 &HT;    Kicking out a laminated window impossible
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The National Highway Safety
Transportation Administration is trying to drown sports-utility
vehicle drivers, and I guess it's up to me to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   But before I save our government from folly, a bit of good news:
Judith Silverman of Flushing, N.Y., writes to say that where
decades of quality nagging failed to get her husband to wear his
seat belt, one of my columns turned him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been living with a man for 34 years, and for those 34
years he has refused to wear a seat belt. He has maintained that he
would rather rely on his reflexes than be trapped by a seat belt in
a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed this summer during the Silvermans' annual visit.
``You wrote your article and John has been wearing his seat belt
ever since.... Thank you, thank you, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   When I went back to the article to see what thunderclap of logic
won the former knucklehead over, I was somewhat deflated to see
that all credit goes to members of West Palm Beach Fire Department
No. 5. Turns out it was their vivid accounts of attending hundreds
of ``ejection'' crash scenes that proved so _ well, instructive.
Typical was fireman Jim Harmon's explanation of how passengers
manage to leave a side window.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go out a side window, it's usually only half way,
and then the car crushes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers agreed that when most passengers leave the car,
it's face first through the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The exception seems to be SUVs, which according to the NHTSA,
tend to roll because of their high centers of gravity, and fling
passengers out side windows, which are designed to shatter into
harmless pebbles. According to The Washington Post, NHTSA is
proposing to replace the disintegrating glass with a laminated
glass. Laminated glass, the kind in your windshield, is super tough
and designed to crack and sag, but not shatter.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's good when it keeps arms and heads inside the SUV.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so good when a car goes into a canal or a lake or a
river.
</P>
<P>
   To escape a submerged car, it is often necessary to break out a
side window, especially if the doors are stuck and the power
windows have shorted out.
</P>
<P>
   I know whereof I speak. A few years ago after a spate of local
canal drownings, I did some field work in the desperate art of
breaking out of an automobile with inoperable windows and learned
some things that could save your life:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never mind what you may have seen in the movies: A windshield
cannot be kicked out or broken by the strongest man. I swung a
sledge hammer against the windshield of a junkyard car and with
repeated hard blows, could make it only crack and sag. You must go
out a side window or the back window.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the easiest ways to break a side window is to rap it
smartly with a heavy metal tool. The metal end of a large
flashlight battery will do the job splendidly. But can you keep a
battery where you can find it in pitch darkness while you are
fighting panic?
</P>
<P>
   _ A heavy slot screwdriver will shatter a window if you force it
into the top edge, pry and twist. It works like magic. Again, do
you keep a heavy screwdriver in the front seat with you?
</P>
<P>
   _ Other than a hammer, the best tool for breaking out of a car
is a spring center-punch, available for under $10 at most hardware
stores. With this device, you jam the pointed end of the tool
against the glass, causing a spring to retract and deploy with
shattering force.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's say the NHTSA at some future date does mandate
laminated side glass for SUVs. This may save some unbelted nitwits
from ejection, but it's going to be a death sentence to those who
end up in a canal. Why? Because when side windows become as tough
as windshields, no screwdriver or spring center punch is going to
save you in 15 feet of water with three minutes of air.
</P>
<P>
   Just to let NHTSA know what I think of their unbreakable side
glass idea, I called up the agency and told crash research engineer
Stephen Summers, and he said that I was right, that if future
automobiles have unbreakable side glass and people can't get their
doors open in deep water, they're going to have to wait until
somebody can cut them out. That, he conceded, can get tedious when
you're holding your breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our studies show that only 0.3 percent of auto fatalities
involve entrapment,'' Summers said. ``It just doesn't happen as
often as people think.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brutal numbers game of crash deaths, the crash specialist
said, for every person who perishes from fire or drowning, 300 are
killed by ejection through a side window. ``Crime prevention is
another concern,'' he added. ``With laminated side windows, smash
and grab thefts are prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in all probability according to the researcher, all cars
will come equipped with tough glass all around. And when that day
comes and you find yourself at the bottom of a canal with your
doors stuck, as for all the break-out advice given above:
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.

 &HT;    Traffic incivility is scary
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The unopened beer can hit the side of our car
with all the force of irrational hatred.
</P>
<P>
   A van passenger in the left lane shouted at us, his face
contorted with rage.
</P>
<P>
   It was, we assumed, a bad review of Jim's driving, though we
were mystified as to the exact nature of our breach in highway
etiquette. Driving the speed limit, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   The van sped away before we could get a license plate number. We
thought about reporting the incident, but never got around to it.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to hear about road rage, and another to see its
face.
</P>
<P>
   The stranger in the van didn't know whether that beer can would
smash our window and cause injury or an accident. He didn't stop to
think whether there was a child in the car seat.
</P>
<P>
   The beer can left only a slight nick in our Saturn _ and a far
greater dent in our psyches. It made me feel less secure, knowing,
in such a visceral way, that there are folks out there who could
turn murderous for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, N.Y., Monday, John Creel, 29, was convicted of
assault in the beating of retiree Ross Sperring, 79. Creel
apparently became so enraged by the older man's slow driving that
he jumped out at a red light and beat Sperring severely.
</P>
<P>
   Sperring died of complications from pneumonia two months after
the July 1998 beating. Just a coincidence, probably. Authorities
were unable to establish a link.
</P>
<P>
   But a part of me can't help wondering if the old man just didn't
give up. If he grew weary of a society in which such incivility
could take place. In which a young man, instead of helping his
elder across the street, beats him up for not moving it along fast
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, car ads glorify highway chauvinism. A current
Mitsubishi ad mocks the concept of good sportsmanship: No matter
how gracious a winner you are on the surface, deep inside you're
crowing: ``Nah nah nah nah nah, I'm better than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, folks are driving Humvees, and SUVs are getting
bigger and bigger, with more and more testosterone-dripping names.
Can the Intimidator or the Devastator be too far in our future?
</P>
<P>
   There's no real way of tracking whether highway barbarity is on
the rise or not, said Lt. John Born, spokesman for the Ohio Highway
Patrol: ``There is no scientific formula for determining a road
rage incident, other than aggressive or violent driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Are such incidents on the rise? Born can only offer anecdotal
evidence: In Mansfield, a motorist throws a cast-iron bottle jack
into a car, injuring another motorist in the face. In Madison
County, an off-duty police officer is shot at random, with his
entire family in the car. He survived.
</P>
<P>
   Highway Patrol officials can't quantify or explain the problem.
They can only work toward solving it.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Highway Patrol established a program known as
TRIAD (Targeting Reckless Intimidating and Aggressive Driving).
Working with local agencies, the Highway Patrol sends up 12
aircraft in heavily congested areas to monitor aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists should report incidents such as ours, Born said. If
patrol officials receive several calls on the same incident, they
may be able to nab a suspect. The Highway Patrol has recently
established its toll-free I-877-7PATROL number for motorists who
need help with emergency or non-emergency situations. ``Many people
are hesitant to call if it's not an emergency,'' Born said.
</P>
<P>
   I know what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't call. In 1999, we knew, that would never qualify as an
emergency.

THANKFUL FOR THE PILGRIMS _ AND ALL THE IMMIGRANTS SINCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not against immigration, said the prominent American
political figure _ a media personality who made his mark as a
writer and polemicist long before he got involved in political
affairs _ but the immigrants of today just don't measure up to
those who came before them. They're not well-educated. They don't
bother to learn English. And at the rate they multiply there will
soon be more of them than there are of us.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan on the Mexicans pouring into Texas? No, Benjamin
Franklin on the Germans pouring into Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Measures of great temper are necessary with the Germans,''
wrote Franklin in May 1753, since ``those who come hither are
generally of the most ignorant, stupid sort of their own nation,
and . . . 'tis almost impossible to remove any prejudices they
entertain. . . . Few of their children in the country learn
English; they import many books from Germany; and of the six
printing houses in the province, two are entirely German. . . .
Advertisements intended to be general are now printed in Dutch'' _
i.e., Deutsch _ ``and English; the signs in our streets have
inscriptions in both languages and in some places only German. They
begin of late to make all their bonds and other legal writings in
their own language, which . . . are allowed in our courts, where
the German business so increases that there is continual need of
interpreters.''
</P>
<P>
   It was necessary, concluded Franklin, to cut back the
immigration of Germans into Pennsylvania. Otherwise, ``they will
soon so outnumber us, that all the advantages we have will not in
my opinion be able to preserve our language, and even our
government will become precarious.''
</P>
<P>
   No pastime is more quintessentially American than fretting about
the low quality and high number of immigrants. History doesn't
record what the Pilgrims thought of the settlers who stepped off
the boat that came after the Mayflower, but no doubt they grumbled
about how the newcomers weren't up to the caliber of those who
arrived first.
</P>
<P>
   We can forgive Franklin for imagining that the ``most ignorant''
German immigrants of his day were indigestible invaders who would
wreck the Colonies' cohesion. In 1753, the American melting pot had
scarcely begun to operate. A century later, the assimilation of
immigrants was a plain and obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in 1888, Theodore Roosevelt could praise James Bryce's
``The American Commonwealth'' for having ``thoroughly understood
that instead of the old American stock being `swamped' by
immigration, it has absorbed the immigrants and remained nearly
unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet over and above every other concern, those who would slam the
Golden Door shut persist in worrying that immigrants no longer
blend into the American mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   What Franklin said of the Germans in the 18th century, Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge said of the Russians, Poles, and Italians in the
19th. ``Races with which the English-speaking people have never
hitherto assimilated,'' he called them, ``and who are most alien to
the great body of the people of the United States.'' When the
Supreme Court upheld the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1889 it observed
that ``it seems impossible for them to assimilate with our own
people or to make any change in their habits of modes of living.''
A century later, endorsing California's Proposition 187, the
conservative journal National Review would write that popular
resentment of immigrants is a mark of how ``the American nation
resists its own dissolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a bum rap. Immigration is not a catalyst for disunity.
Most immigrants want nothing more than to be thought of as ``real''
Americans, and they show it in countless ways.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dream of owning a home, for example, is alive and
well among immigrants. Half of all foreign-born Americans live in
homes they own. According to a Census Bureau survey in 1996, 75.6
percent of immigrants who came to the United States before 1970
were homeowners, compared with only 69.8 percent of native-born
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants learn our language. At the beginning of the 20th
century, three out of four immigrants spoke some English. By 1990,
the ratio was 11 out of 12. Within 10 years of arriving in the
United States, more than 75 percent of immigrants speak English
with high proficiency. And among the children of immigrants, the
use of English is almost universal.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing fires the melting pot like marriage, and immigrants
marry across racial and ethnic lines. Of married Asian immigrant
women, to take one striking example, 18.6 percent were wedded to
non-Asians in 1994. Their children and grandchildren were even more
likely to ``marry out:'' More than 29 percent of second-generation
Asian women and more than 41 percent in the third generation had
non-Asian husbands. Could anything attest more beautifully to the
reality of America's motto? E pluribus unum _ out of many, one.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of plunging unemployment and soaring cynicism, we need
immigrants more than ever. They are the secret of our success,
these hardworking risk-takers who so esteem our way of life that
they are willing to uproot themselves from their homelands to live
among us. The Pilgrims stepped ashore at Plymouth 379 years ago.
What a debt of gratitude we owe them, and all the immigrants who
followed in their wake.
</P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What connection, if any, did presidential candidate George W.
Bush have to the failed savings and loan institution and subsequent
bailout by the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've answered this question before, but since there seems to
be continuing interest, let's give it another shot in hopes it will
put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush had no connection to the case you're asking
about. It was Neil Bush, one of George W.'s brothers, who was a
figure in the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Colorado. Silverado failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an estimated
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Neil Bush never was charged with criminal wrongdoing,
he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil lawsuit lodged
two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles about British Home Secretary Jack Straw raise
a question I've always wondered about. What does Britain's Home
Office do? What is the equivalent in the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Home Office is the department of the British government
responsible for internal affairs in England and Wales. As its
Internet site states, the office's principal goal is ``to build a
safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and
responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are
properly balanced and the protection and security of the public are
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the Home Office says its aims are the
reduction of crime and the fear of crime; the maintenance of public
safety; the delivery of justice through effective and efficient
investigation, prosecution, trial and sentencing, and through
support for victims of crime; the prevention of terrorism and
protection against threats to national security; the regulation of
the entry of non-citizens into the United Kingdom; and the
maintenance of the safety of the public through civil protection.
</P>
<P>
   There's no exact equivalent in this country. Gillian Cooper of
the British Consulate in Atlanta said that what the Home Office
does is ``a bit of a mixture of the duties and responsibilities of
several agencies at both the federal and state levels'' in the
United States. Think of the FBI, State Department, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and state-level secretaries of state,
and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a Seabee museum that is
being built somewhere in the East? My uncle was a Seabee in World
War II and I inherited many souvenir objects from him. Perhaps a
museum would be interested in the memorabilia. Who can I contact?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Navy Seabee Veterans of America is in the beginning
stages of creating its new museum in Rhode Island. Ed Turner,
former Seabee who is coordinating the project, said it will be part
of the U.S. Navy Seabees Memorial Park, on a 6-acre site at what
used to be the Seabee Center at Davisville, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the veterans' group, ranging in age ``up to
85-plus,'' is very enthusiastic about the museum, and indeed does
welcome donations of memorabilia as well as money. Some items
already donated include uniforms and medals as well as a large
Quonset hut to house the museum.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the park will have several more Quonset huts and
other buildings, Turner said, including the restored Chapel in the
Pines. Construction is expected to take several more years. ``We're
moving along a little at a time,'' he added. ``Most of us are from
World War II and Korea, so we're along in age. Things don't move as
fast as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   For information about donating items, call Turner at
401-732-4565. Checks can be made out to Seabee Memorial Park Fund
and mailed to: Seabee Memorial Park, P.O. Box 646, North Kingstown
02852. Information online can be viewed at www.nsva.org and click
on Davisville Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify Adolf Hitler's last name for me? I thought he
was born with the surname Schicklgruber. If that's the case, why
did he change it to Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   A: Adolf Hitler was the Nazi dictator's birth name. He never
used any other. Born on April 20, 1889, he was the fourth child of
the third marriage of Alois Hitler, a customs official, and Klara
Polzl Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It was Alois Hitler's mother whose surname was Schicklgruber
(first names: Maria Anna). She was unmarried when Alois was born,
but about five years later she married Johann Georg Hiedler, a
wandering miller. Some sources say Hiedler may have been Alois
Hitler's father.
</P>
<P>
   Hiedler died in 1856, when Alois was 20, never having officially
recognized Alois as his child. In 1877, Hiedler's brother arranged
for Alois to be registered as the legitimate son of Johann Georg
and Maria Hiedler. World Book Encyclopedia theorizes that the
priest who made the official entry misspelled the name as
``Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, before he came to power, some of Adolf Hitler's
political opponents in Germany and Austria called him
Schicklgruber, intending it as an insult. That may be the source of
your confusion over his birth name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the recent earthquakes all over the world, can
you give us any tips on what we should do if we're inside a
building when an earthquake strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Emergency Management Agency advises taking cover
under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall. It
warns that the most dangerous thing to do during the shaking is
attempting to leave the building, because objects can fall on you.
So stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross gives similar pointers, adding that you
should stay away from windows and, in a high-rise building, be
prepared for the fire alarms and sprinklers to go off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle a bet? A friend swears that Leonardo DiCaprio
got his start on a TV program when he was a teenager. I think his
show business career is based entirely on his movies. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chalk this one up for your friend. As a teen, DiCaprio landed
a successful, regular role as Luke Brower, a homeless youngster in
ABC's teen sitcom, ``Growing Pains.'' It was a small part that
lasted only for the program's 1991 season, but Leo-watchers say his
performance proved that he had great potential, outshining the rest
of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he had done some minor TV work in commercials and
educational programs such as ``How to Deal With a Parent Who Takes
Drugs'' and ``Mickey's Safety Club.'' He appeared in more than 30
commercials and made guest appearances on such TV shows as
``Lassie,'' ``The Outsiders,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break on the silver screen was his leading role as Toby
in ``This Boy's Life.'' But he'll always be known worldwide for his
role as Jack Dawson in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Ted Turner once managed the Atlanta Braves
for one game. What was that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in May 1977. The Braves were in the midst of a 16-game
losing streak, and the Pittsburgh Pirates were on an 11-game
winning streak. In one of the most hilarious chapters in Braves
history, Turner decided to take over the duties of then-manager
Dave Bristol, giving Bristol a short sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   Turner sensed trouble looming with the National League offices
and even attempted _ and failed _ to reach Chub Feeney, the league
president, for clearance before the game. After Cito Gaston showed
him how to put on his socks, Turner called the staff together and
realigned their responsibilities. The upshot was that the Braves
lost again, 2-1. The next day, Feeney banished Turner from the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is ``racketeering'' defined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simple definition is ``the practice of conducting or
engaging in a racket, such as extortion or bootlegging.'' Black's
Law Dictionary explains further that racketeering is an organized
conspiracy to commit the crimes of extortion and coercion. From the
standpoint of extortion, the dictionary continues, it's the
obtaining of money or property from another, without his consent,
induced by the wrongful use of force or fears. The fear which
constitutes the legally necessary element in extortion is induced
by verbal or written threats of bodily or property harm, it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Racketeering activity, according to the U.S. Code, is organized
criminal activity to commit certain offenses, which include credit
card fraud, loan sharking, money laundering, police corruption and
interstate prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Medal of Honor recipient who was protesting the School of
the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., was quoted as saying he
``renounced the special privileges the medal brought: a lifetime
job with the Veterans Administration and a $600-a-month pension.''
Is that correct? I was under the impression that Medal of Honor
winners received a $200-a-month pension, and that was all.
</P>
<P>
   A: Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to a $600-a-month
stipend from the Department of Veterans Affairs, said VA spokesman
Tom Thomas, ``and that's it,'' unless there's some additional VA
compensation they would be entitled to for disability. Thomas added
that he isn't aware of any kind of federal employment benefits to
which Medal of Honor recipients are entitled through VA programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Charlton Heston, a leading proponent of the right to bear
arms for the purpose of having a ready militia, ever serve in the
military? Or is he strictly a ``silver screen'' veteran?
</P>
<P>
   A: During World War II, Heston served with the 11th Army Air
Force in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. He was an aircraft radio gunner
there for most of his three-year tour, according to Current
Biography Yearbook. He was discharged in early 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As you say, Heston, president of the National Rifle Association,
is outspoken about his belief in the right of citizens to own guns.
He was in the news earlier this month when he spoke before the
House Government Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug
policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that in order for a department store's huge Christmas
tree to stay healthy, it needed 300 gallons of water and 200
aspirin tablets. What would the aspirin have been for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aspirin helps suppress bacteria and micro-organisms that
might clog the cells that transport the water to the top of the
tree. The leaves (or needles) are still pulling water from the base
of the tree, and if micro-organisms plug those cells the tree can't
get any water and will dry out.
</P>
<P>
   The same theory holds true for cut flowers, so if someone gives
you a dozen roses, pop an aspirin or two into their water and trim
their stems to make them last longer.

 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The fight and subsequent expulsion from school of several
black students in Decatur, Ill., has received extensive news
coverage. But I don't remember seeing any reports at the time it
happened in September. What was the background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Described variously as a riot, a grandstand-clearing brawl or
a simple fistfight, the incident occurred Sept. 17 at a football
game between the Eisenhower High School Panthers and the MacArthur
High School Generals. It appears to have been preceded by a fight
that same day between students at the two schools.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chicago Sun-Times reported, the football teams at both
schools were having a dismal season, so city bragging rights were
at stake. The Panthers, who had lost every game before this one,
were leading at the half. At the start of the third quarter,
screams were heard erupting from the stands when the fighting broke
out. It isn't known who started it, but the scene was partially
captured by a spectator's video camera, so some of those involved
could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Four youths were charged with mob action, a felony. One also was
charged with felony aggravated battery and resisting a police
officer, a misdemeanor. Ed Boehm, the MacArthur principal, said his
school received seven injury reports after the fight, mostly for
bruises and abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is leading an effort in support of
the expelled students, pointed out that no bullets were fired and
no bones broken. ``We see more violence than this at a hockey
match,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Dahlonega, Ga., made me wonder about the
discovery of gold in Charlotte, N.C., many years earlier. Can you
refresh my memory about the time lines of gold in both places?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be thinking of the Reed gold mind, now a North
Carolina state historic site, about 30 miles east of Charlotte. It
was the site in 1799 of one of the earliest discoveries of gold in
America. Charlotte's gold discovery came in 1825 when Samuel McComb
found gold at Irwin Creek. The ``rush'' to Charlotte's mines
followed, circa 1830. The Charlotte branch of the U.S. Mint opened
in 1838 and closed in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlonega historians say that in 1828, Benjamin Parks was deer
hunting when he overturned a rock and discovered it to be laced
with gold. In 1838, the Dahlonega branch of the U.S. Mint opened;
it closed, never to reopen, in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849, the California gold rush drew most miners west, with
promises of far more gold than could be found in North Carolina or
Georgia. By 1906, the last large Dahlonega mining company,
Consolidated Mining, closed its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the EgyptAir crash occur in international waters? Why
don't we hear much about Egypt's involvement in the investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The site of the Oct. 31 crash _ which occurred in the
Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Mass. _ is
indeed international waters. Under the International Civil Aviation
Organization treaty, the investigation of a plane crash in
international waters is under the jurisdiction of the country of
registry of the aircraft. However, the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board said the Egyptian government requested that it take
the lead in this investigation, which it initially did. The FBI
took over the investigation later when there was an indication of a
criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian representatives have helped review cockpit
voice recordings. Other agencies and organizations involved in the
early stages included the Federal Aviation Administration, Defense
Department, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Boeing Co., EgyptAir and Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Soon after the crash of EgyptAir flight 990, I heard that
after the plane took off from Los Angeles, it landed at Edwards Air
Force Base in California before continuing to New York. I haven't
seen or heard anything more about that. What can you tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board records show no such
thing, said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. Flight 990 left Los
Angeles at 4:30 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. EDT) Oct. 30. It landed
at Kennedy Airport in New York just over five hours later, at 12:48
a.m. EDT Oct. 31. There was no stop anywhere in between, Holloway
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early reports after the crash of EgyptAir 990 stated that one
body had been recovered. Was that person ever identified?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway
in Washington said the NTSB ``heard that initial report'' about a
body being recovered, but it was false. ``We never stated that we
found a body,'' he addded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The language difficulties encountered with the crash of
EgyptAir flight 990 prompt my question: How do pilots of foreign
airlines communicate with English-speaking people in control
towers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Even those pilots whose first language isn't English are
required to communicate in English with traffic controllers. In
other words, English is the universal language in this situation. A
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said, however,
that the language spoken in the cockpit among pilots and crew is
totally up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of all the known meteors in space, are there any that
actually could break the Earth apart in the event of a collision?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most of the objects we see as meteors are about the size
of a grain of sand. J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy at the
University of Georgia, explains that larger objects, such as small
asteroids _ ranging in diameter from hundreds of feet up to a few
miles _ have hit the Earth over its 4.5-billion-year history and
have been very devastating, forming craters many miles in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, the only object that even came close to
splitting the Earth apart was the collision with an object about
the size of Mars soon after the Earth formed. This collision
produced the debris that formed the moon. ``We know where all the
Mars-sized objects are in the solar system,'' Shaw said. ``They are
the planets, and they're not going to collide with the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A museum exhibit of Norman Rockwell's paintings includes many
years' worth of Saturday Evening Post covers using his artwork.
They appear to have been collected by someone from Burlington,
Iowa, whose name is on the address labels. Do you know anything
about that person, and how he happened to collect them all?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has no
information about the person, or couple, who subscribed to the
Saturday Evening Post and saved all the issues whose covers are on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Rawson of the Rockwell Museum said all that is known is
that the collection was donated in memory of G. Robert Rapp by his
family after his death. It appears that Rapp had purchased the
covers from the original collector, but other than that, she had no
details about the original collector or about Rapp himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockwell Museum, incidentally, says its reference center
welcomes donations to its collections relating to Rockwell's life
and work. The collection presently includes first uses of
Rockwell's artwork, such as magazine covers, and correspondence,
photographs, negatives, slides, films, recordings and original
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available online at www.nrm.org or from the
Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, P.O. Box 308/Route 183,
Stockbridge, MA 01262 (413-298-4100).
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Baby Sitter with Screaming Infant,'' one of Norman
Rockwell's paintings, has an actual diaper pin embedded through the
canvas. Who put it there, and why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rockwell himself gets the credit. ``He was a very funny man
who often included that kind of playful, funny gesture in his
art,'' said Ann Knutson, curator of the Rockwell exhibit at
Atlanta's High Museum of Art. He also did it to add texture and
three dimensions. Rockwell thought that if he simply painted the
pin, and then it was photographed for a Saturday Evening Post
cover, it might not reproduce well. Hence, the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of Norman Rockwell's paintings depicts Rosie the Riveter
of World War II fame. Someone told me there was a real Rosie, but I
never heard that before. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rose Will Monroe, a United Auto Workers riveter in an
aircraft plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., is the real-life person behind
the famous poster character. Her image was created to celebrate the
dedication and resourcefulness of millions of American women who
worked in factories to produce armaments for the United States and
the Allies during the war. The National World War II Memorial
Campaign, which is raising money for a memorial in Washington,
formed the Rose Monroe Society in her name to honor the sacrifice
and effort of those pioneering women. Information: 1-800-639-4992.

<P>
   Q: Is it possible to have veterans' names inscribed on the
proposed World War II memorial in Washington by making a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean having names carved into the memorial, no, that's
not part of the design plan. But Betsy Glick of the National World
War II Memorial Campaign says a Registry of Remembrances will be
part of the memorial. She described it as an electronic site on the
order of an Internet site. ``People can honor a family member, a
friend, or a loved one who either served in uniform or who made a
contribution from the home front, such as working in a factory,
growing a Victory Garden, or selling war bonds,'' Glick told Q&AMP;A.
To request a registry form, call 1-800-639-4992. A donation isn't
required to enter a name.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's Donor Book of Remembrances is separate. The book,
with personal listings, will be circulated after the memorial is
dedicated. Donors at various amount levels, starting at $20, will
receive certain items. Those who contribute $1,000 or more will
receive, among other things, prints of the memorial and Norman
Rockwell's ``The Homecoming,'' as well as a listing in the Book of
Remembrances.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions are tax-exempt. Information can be obtained from
the same toll-free number, or online at www.wwiimemorial.com

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What connection, if any, did presidential candidate George W.
Bush have to the failed savings and loan institution and subsequent
bailout by the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've answered this question before, but since there seems to
be continuing interest, let's give it another shot in hopes it will
put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush had no connection to the case you're asking
about. It was Neil Bush, one of George W.'s brothers, who was a
figure in the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Colorado. Silverado failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an estimated
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Neil Bush never was charged with criminal wrongdoing,
he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil lawsuit lodged
two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles about British Home Secretary Jack Straw raise
a question I've always wondered about. What does Britain's Home
Office do? What is the equivalent in the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Home Office is the department of the British government
responsible for internal affairs in England and Wales. As its
Internet site states, the office's principal goal is ``to build a
safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and
responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are
properly balanced and the protection and security of the public are
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the Home Office says its aims are the
reduction of crime and the fear of crime; the maintenance of public
safety; the delivery of justice through effective and efficient
investigation, prosecution, trial and sentencing, and through
support for victims of crime; the prevention of terrorism and
protection against threats to national security; the regulation of
the entry of non-citizens into the United Kingdom; and the
maintenance of the safety of the public through civil protection.
</P>
<P>
   There's no exact equivalent in this country. Gillian Cooper of
the British Consulate in Atlanta said that what the Home Office
does is ``a bit of a mixture of the duties and responsibilities of
several agencies at both the federal and state levels'' in the
United States. Think of the FBI, State Department, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and state-level secretaries of state,
and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a Seabee museum that is
being built somewhere in the East? My uncle was a Seabee in World
War II and I inherited many souvenir objects from him. Perhaps a
museum would be interested in the memorabilia. Who can I contact?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Navy Seabee Veterans of America is in the beginning
stages of creating its new museum in Rhode Island. Ed Turner,
former Seabee who is coordinating the project, said it will be part
of the U.S. Navy Seabees Memorial Park, on a 6-acre site at what
used to be the Seabee Center at Davisville, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the veterans' group, ranging in age ``up to
85-plus,'' is very enthusiastic about the museum, and indeed does
welcome donations of memorabilia as well as money. Some items
already donated include uniforms and medals as well as a large
Quonset hut to house the museum.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the park will have several more Quonset huts and
other buildings, Turner said, including the restored Chapel in the
Pines. Construction is expected to take several more years. ``We're
moving along a little at a time,'' he added. ``Most of us are from
World War II and Korea, so we're along in age. Things don't move as
fast as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   For information about donating items, call Turner at
401-732-4565. Checks can be made out to Seabee Memorial Park Fund
and mailed to: Seabee Memorial Park, P.O. Box 646, North Kingstown
02852. Information online can be viewed at www.nsva.org and click
on Davisville Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify Adolf Hitler's last name for me? I thought he
was born with the surname Schicklgruber. If that's the case, why
did he change it to Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   A: Adolf Hitler was the Nazi dictator's birth name. He never
used any other. Born on April 20, 1889, he was the fourth child of
the third marriage of Alois Hitler, a customs official, and Klara
Polzl Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It was Alois Hitler's mother whose surname was Schicklgruber
(first names: Maria Anna). She was unmarried when Alois was born,
but about five years later she married Johann Georg Hiedler, a
wandering miller. Some sources say Hiedler may have been Alois
Hitler's father.
</P>
<P>
   Hiedler died in 1856, when Alois was 20, never having officially
recognized Alois as his child. In 1877, Hiedler's brother arranged
for Alois to be registered as the legitimate son of Johann Georg
and Maria Hiedler. World Book Encyclopedia theorizes that the
priest who made the official entry misspelled the name as
``Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, before he came to power, some of Adolf Hitler's
political opponents in Germany and Austria called him
Schicklgruber, intending it as an insult. That may be the source of
your confusion over his birth name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the recent earthquakes all over the world, can
you give us any tips on what we should do if we're inside a
building when an earthquake strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Emergency Management Agency advises taking cover
under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall. It
warns that the most dangerous thing to do during the shaking is
attempting to leave the building, because objects can fall on you.
So stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross gives similar pointers, adding that you
should stay away from windows and, in a high-rise building, be
prepared for the fire alarms and sprinklers to go off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle a bet? A friend swears that Leonardo DiCaprio
got his start on a TV program when he was a teenager. I think his
show business career is based entirely on his movies. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chalk this one up for your friend. As a teen, DiCaprio landed
a successful, regular role as Luke Brower, a homeless youngster in
ABC's teen sitcom, ``Growing Pains.'' It was a small part that
lasted only for the program's 1991 season, but Leo-watchers say his
performance proved that he had great potential, outshining the rest
of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he had done some minor TV work in commercials and
educational programs such as ``How to Deal With a Parent Who Takes
Drugs'' and ``Mickey's Safety Club.'' He appeared in more than 30
commercials and made guest appearances on such TV shows as
``Lassie,'' ``The Outsiders,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break on the silver screen was his leading role as Toby
in ``This Boy's Life.'' But he'll always be known worldwide for his
role as Jack Dawson in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Ted Turner once managed the Atlanta Braves
for one game. What was that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in May 1977. The Braves were in the midst of a 16-game
losing streak, and the Pittsburgh Pirates were on an 11-game
winning streak. In one of the most hilarious chapters in Braves
history, Turner decided to take over the duties of then-manager
Dave Bristol, giving Bristol a short sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   Turner sensed trouble looming with the National League offices
and even attempted _ and failed _ to reach Chub Feeney, the league
president, for clearance before the game. After Cito Gaston showed
him how to put on his socks, Turner called the staff together and
realigned their responsibilities. The upshot was that the Braves
lost again, 2-1. The next day, Feeney banished Turner from the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is ``racketeering'' defined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simple definition is ``the practice of conducting or
engaging in a racket, such as extortion or bootlegging.'' Black's
Law Dictionary explains further that racketeering is an organized
conspiracy to commit the crimes of extortion and coercion. From the
standpoint of extortion, the dictionary continues, it's the
obtaining of money or property from another, without his consent,
induced by the wrongful use of force or fears. The fear which
constitutes the legally necessary element in extortion is induced
by verbal or written threats of bodily or property harm, it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Racketeering activity, according to the U.S. Code, is organized
criminal activity to commit certain offenses, which include credit
card fraud, loan sharking, money laundering, police corruption and
interstate prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Medal of Honor recipient who was protesting the School of
the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., was quoted as saying he
``renounced the special privileges the medal brought: a lifetime
job with the Veterans Administration and a $600-a-month pension.''
Is that correct? I was under the impression that Medal of Honor
winners received a $200-a-month pension, and that was all.
</P>
<P>
   A: Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to a $600-a-month
stipend from the Department of Veterans Affairs, said VA spokesman
Tom Thomas, ``and that's it,'' unless there's some additional VA
compensation they would be entitled to for disability. Thomas added
that he isn't aware of any kind of federal employment benefits to
which Medal of Honor recipients are entitled through VA programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Charlton Heston, a leading proponent of the right to bear
arms for the purpose of having a ready militia, ever serve in the
military? Or is he strictly a ``silver screen'' veteran?
</P>
<P>
   A: During World War II, Heston served with the 11th Army Air
Force in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. He was an aircraft radio gunner
there for most of his three-year tour, according to Current
Biography Yearbook. He was discharged in early 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As you say, Heston, president of the National Rifle Association,
is outspoken about his belief in the right of citizens to own guns.
He was in the news earlier this month when he spoke before the
House Government Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug
policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that in order for a department store's huge Christmas
tree to stay healthy, it needed 300 gallons of water and 200
aspirin tablets. What would the aspirin have been for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aspirin helps suppress bacteria and micro-organisms that
might clog the cells that transport the water to the top of the
tree. The leaves (or needles) are still pulling water from the base
of the tree, and if micro-organisms plug those cells the tree can't
get any water and will dry out.
</P>
<P>
   The same theory holds true for cut flowers, so if someone gives
you a dozen roses, pop an aspirin or two into their water and trim
their stems to make them last longer.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The fight and subsequent expulsion from school of several
black students in Decatur, Ill., has received extensive news
coverage. But I don't remember seeing any reports at the time it
happened in September. What was the background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Described variously as a riot, a grandstand-clearing brawl or
a simple fistfight, the incident occurred Sept. 17 at a football
game between the Eisenhower High School Panthers and the MacArthur
High School Generals. It appears to have been preceded by a fight
that same day between students at the two schools.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chicago Sun-Times reported, the football teams at both
schools were having a dismal season, so city bragging rights were
at stake. The Panthers, who had lost every game before this one,
were leading at the half. At the start of the third quarter,
screams were heard erupting from the stands when the fighting broke
out. It isn't known who started it, but the scene was partially
captured by a spectator's video camera, so some of those involved
could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Four youths were charged with mob action, a felony. One also was
charged with felony aggravated battery and resisting a police
officer, a misdemeanor. Ed Boehm, the MacArthur principal, said his
school received seven injury reports after the fight, mostly for
bruises and abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is leading an effort in support of
the expelled students, pointed out that no bullets were fired and
no bones broken. ``We see more violence than this at a hockey
match,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Dahlonega, Ga., made me wonder about the
discovery of gold in Charlotte, N.C., many years earlier. Can you
refresh my memory about the time lines of gold in both places?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be thinking of the Reed gold mind, now a North
Carolina state historic site, about 30 miles east of Charlotte. It
was the site in 1799 of one of the earliest discoveries of gold in
America. Charlotte's gold discovery came in 1825 when Samuel McComb
found gold at Irwin Creek. The ``rush'' to Charlotte's mines
followed, circa 1830. The Charlotte branch of the U.S. Mint opened
in 1838 and closed in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlonega historians say that in 1828, Benjamin Parks was deer
hunting when he overturned a rock and discovered it to be laced
with gold. In 1838, the Dahlonega branch of the U.S. Mint opened;
it closed, never to reopen, in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849, the California gold rush drew most miners west, with
promises of far more gold than could be found in North Carolina or
Georgia. By 1906, the last large Dahlonega mining company,
Consolidated Mining, closed its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the EgyptAir crash occur in international waters? Why
don't we hear much about Egypt's involvement in the investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The site of the Oct. 31 crash _ which occurred in the
Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Mass. _ is
indeed international waters. Under the International Civil Aviation
Organization treaty, the investigation of a plane crash in
international waters is under the jurisdiction of the country of
registry of the aircraft. However, the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board said the Egyptian government requested that it take
the lead in this investigation, which it initially did. The FBI
took over the investigation later when there was an indication of a
criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian representatives have helped review cockpit
voice recordings. Other agencies and organizations involved in the
early stages included the Federal Aviation Administration, Defense
Department, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Boeing Co., EgyptAir and Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Soon after the crash of EgyptAir flight 990, I heard that
after the plane took off from Los Angeles, it landed at Edwards Air
Force Base in California before continuing to New York. I haven't
seen or heard anything more about that. What can you tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board records show no such
thing, said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. Flight 990 left Los
Angeles at 4:30 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. EDT) Oct. 30. It landed
at Kennedy Airport in New York just over five hours later, at 12:48
a.m. EDT Oct. 31. There was no stop anywhere in between, Holloway
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early reports after the crash of EgyptAir 990 stated that one
body had been recovered. Was that person ever identified?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway
in Washington said the NTSB ``heard that initial report'' about a
body being recovered, but it was false. ``We never stated that we
found a body,'' he addded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The language difficulties encountered with the crash of
EgyptAir flight 990 prompt my question: How do pilots of foreign
airlines communicate with English-speaking people in control
towers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Even those pilots whose first language isn't English are
required to communicate in English with traffic controllers. In
other words, English is the universal language in this situation. A
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said, however,
that the language spoken in the cockpit among pilots and crew is
totally up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of all the known meteors in space, are there any that
actually could break the Earth apart in the event of a collision?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most of the objects we see as meteors are about the size
of a grain of sand. J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy at the
University of Georgia, explains that larger objects, such as small
asteroids _ ranging in diameter from hundreds of feet up to a few
miles _ have hit the Earth over its 4.5-billion-year history and
have been very devastating, forming craters many miles in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, the only object that even came close to
splitting the Earth apart was the collision with an object about
the size of Mars soon after the Earth formed. This collision
produced the debris that formed the moon. ``We know where all the
Mars-sized objects are in the solar system,'' Shaw said. ``They are
the planets, and they're not going to collide with the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A museum exhibit of Norman Rockwell's paintings includes many
years' worth of Saturday Evening Post covers using his artwork.
They appear to have been collected by someone from Burlington,
Iowa, whose name is on the address labels. Do you know anything
about that person, and how he happened to collect them all?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has no
information about the person, or couple, who subscribed to the
Saturday Evening Post and saved all the issues whose covers are on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Rawson of the Rockwell Museum said all that is known is
that the collection was donated in memory of G. Robert Rapp by his
family after his death. It appears that Rapp had purchased the
covers from the original collector, but other than that, she had no
details about the original collector or about Rapp himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockwell Museum, incidentally, says its reference center
welcomes donations to its collections relating to Rockwell's life
and work. The collection presently includes first uses of
Rockwell's artwork, such as magazine covers, and correspondence,
photographs, negatives, slides, films, recordings and original
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available online at www.nrm.org or from the
Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, P.O. Box 308/Route 183,
Stockbridge, MA 01262 (413-298-4100).
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Baby Sitter with Screaming Infant,'' one of Norman
Rockwell's paintings, has an actual diaper pin embedded through the
canvas. Who put it there, and why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rockwell himself gets the credit. ``He was a very funny man
who often included that kind of playful, funny gesture in his
art,'' said Ann Knutson, curator of the Rockwell exhibit at
Atlanta's High Museum of Art. He also did it to add texture and
three dimensions. Rockwell thought that if he simply painted the
pin, and then it was photographed for a Saturday Evening Post
cover, it might not reproduce well. Hence, the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of Norman Rockwell's paintings depicts Rosie the Riveter
of World War II fame. Someone told me there was a real Rosie, but I
never heard that before. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rose Will Monroe, a United Auto Workers riveter in an
aircraft plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., is the real-life person behind
the famous poster character. Her image was created to celebrate the
dedication and resourcefulness of millions of American women who
worked in factories to produce armaments for the United States and
the Allies during the war. The National World War II Memorial
Campaign, which is raising money for a memorial in Washington,
formed the Rose Monroe Society in her name to honor the sacrifice
and effort of those pioneering women. Information: 1-800-639-4992.

 &HT;    Memories fresh from the oven
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Holidays are for making memories.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the holidays can be memorable as well. Just ask
Jane Breskin Zalben.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holidays bring families and friends together to share special
times, special traditions and special foods,'' writes the popular
author-illustrator in the introduction to her recently published
book, ``To Every Season: A Family Holiday Cookbook'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``When children work alongside adults to help prepare these
special dishes, cooking becomes fun,'' she adds. ``By sharing love,
family histories and dreams while we cook, we turn an ordinary task
into something meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Zalben, who has written and illustrated a number of children's
books featuring lovable animal characters and charming watercolor
paintings, is perhaps best-known for her Jewish holiday series
featuring Pearl the lamb. She has also written novels for older
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Zalben said families become close emotionally and physically
when they cook together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives everyone a sense of accomplishment,'' she adds.
``You're taking different ingredients, putting them together and
getting something tangible at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking is a way for generations to connect. It is a time to
talk, to teach customs and values, to allow children to take
chances and to get close.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids learn practical skills as well: math when they measure,
chemistry when they see things rise and fall, and art when they
decorate a cupcake.
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Zalben: ``And nothing can top the moment when a
special treat comes to the table, the child says, `I made it!' and
everyone sighs `ooh!' and `aah!'''

refrigerator-freezer. Turkeys must stay frozen and be thawed in
cool temperatures to prevent food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Plan on serving 1/2 pound to 3/4 pound of turkey meat per
person, but consider the other foods on the menu, kids' appetites
and whether you want leftovers. Remember that only about 50 percent
to 58 percent of a whole turkey is edible.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have 12 guests, you'd need 6 to 9 pounds of meat,
which you would find on a 12- to 18-pound turkey. (If you want
leftovers, go for the 18-pounder.)
</P>
<P>
   How to store the turkey: Store the turkey in the freezer, and
allow 5 hours per pound to thaw in the refrigerator, or 1/2 hour
per pound in cold water. So an 18-pound bird would take 90 hours to
thaw in the fridge; 9 hours in cold water. If using cold water,
change it every half hour. The thawed turkey will keep in the
refrigerator, wrapped, until Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Never thaw the turkey on the counter, and do not stuff the
turkey in advance, because bacteria may grow. U.S. Department of
Agriculture suggests you not stuff it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the bird: In a clean sink, unwrap the turkey and wash
skin well. Unhook the legs from the leg clamp and remove the bags
of giblets and neck from the cavity. Set these aside for making
gravy or stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the inside of the bird, and cut off the fatty knob of skin
at the rear of the bird. Season the inside and skin of bird with
salt and pepper; set on a tray. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   How to roast the turkey: For open-pan roasting, preheat the oven
to 325 degrees. Put the bird in a roasting pan large enough to hold
the drippings. Sturdy, disposable aluminum pans are fine for this.
If you decide to stuff the bird, stuff it from the back cavity
first, then from the front. Important: The stuffing should be
packed loosely so that it will cook through.
</P>
<P>
   Sew up the front of the bird; put the legs back in the leg-lock
to hold the rear cavity closed. Sew the rear cavity if it gapes.
</P>
<P>
   Spread butter or oil and seasonings, such as poultry seasoning,
thyme or sage, over the skin of the turkey. Use a loose tent of
aluminum foil (shiny side down) over the bird during the first 2
hours of roasting to keep it from overbrowning.
</P>
<P>
   Baste the turkey with pan drippings, or use flavored liquids
such as fruit juice, honey-mustard or bourbon.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey will continue to cook once it's removed from the
oven, so take care not to overcook. After 2 hours in the oven,
check it with a meat thermometer. Cook it to 180 degrees on a
thermometer stuck in the thickest part of the thigh meat _ don't
let the thermometer touch a bone. Juices should run clear. Check
the stuffing also with the thermometer _ it should read 165
degrees. (See chart below for approximate roasting times.) Let the
turkey sit at least 30 minutes on the counter after it's cooked for
perfect slicing.
</P>
<P>
   CRANBERRY-ORANGE RELISH
</P>
<P>
   1 (12-ounce) bag fresh cranberries
</P>
<P>
   1 orange, washed, cut in quarters, seeded
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, washed, cut in quarters, seeded
</P>
<P>
   1 lime, washed, cut in quarters, seeded
</P>
<P>
   Sugar to taste
</P>
<P>
   Wash berries and pick out the bad ones. Place berries in food
processor or blender container and pulse until very coarsely
chopped.
</P>
<P>
   Put orange, lemon and lime in container (note: do not peel).
Process until all are chopped finely, and the mixture is of relish
consistency. Sprinkle with sugar to taste; blend a few seconds
more. Adjust sweetness, and store in refrigerator until ready to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   HERB STUFFING WITH MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   8 cups toasted bread cubes _ white,
</P>
<P>
   rye or cornbread
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 stalks celery, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cream sherry
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground sage
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   bunch parsley, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chicken or turkey broth
</P>
<P>
   (use broth from cooking giblets)
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter over medium heat in large skillet. Add onion, garlic
and celery and saute for 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and sherry
and continue to cook for another 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Add vegetables, liquid and all, to cubed bread and mix well. Mix
in seasonings. If stuffing seems dry, moisten with broth.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking stuffing outside the bird is recommended. But if you are
stuffing the turkey, stuff cavities immediately before roasting _
not any earlier. Otherwise, place stuffing in a buttered casserole
and bake at 325 degrees until golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough for a 16- to 20-pound turkey.
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT MASHED POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   8 pounds potatoes
</P>
<P>
   (about 16 medium potatoes)
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons butter, more if desired
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups milk or half-and-half, slightly heated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Parsley for garnish, as desired
</P>
<P>
   Scrub potatoes; peel and cube. Put in a large pot, cover with
cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a firm simmer, and
cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with fork; about 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Drain potatoes; spread
them on a pan and heat in oven for 10 minutes. (Note: This helps
remove moisture and makes for the fluffiest mashed potatoes.)
</P>
<P>
   Put potatoes in large bowl. Mash potatoes slightly with mixer
before beginning; add a fourth of the milk. Beat on medium speed
until mixture begins to turn smooth; add remaining milk and other
ingredients; beat on high to whip. Scrape bowl frequently to assure
there are no solids left.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and taste; adjust seasonings and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Place potatoes in buttered bowl; set in oven that has been
turned off to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: For garlic mashed potatoes, add 2 tablespoons (or to
taste), roasted garlic puree to the potatoes after whipping; whip
again to mix.
</P>
<P>
   GIBLET GRAVY
</P>
<P>
   1 package turkey giblets and neck
</P>
<P>
   1 celery heart
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1/4 onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, cover giblets and turkey neck with water.
Add celery heart, onion and seasoning. Bring to a boil, cover and
simmer 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until meats are tender. Strain into
bowl; set bowl of broth aside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all meats from neck bone; discard bones. Coarsely chop
all giblets and place in small bowl in refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   When turkey is done, pour drippings from roasting pan into a
large measuring cup or bowl (reserve roasting pan for later use);
allow drippings to stand for a moment _ the fat will come to the
surface. Skim off 1/3 cup fat into a 2-quart saucepan; set saucepan
aside. Skim and discard remaining fat from measuring bowl of
drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Add reserved giblet broth in bowl to roasting pan; stir to
remove browned bits on bottom of pan. Add contents of roasting pan
to bowl of drippings. Add enough water to measure 4 cups liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In saucepan with the 1/3 cup fat, stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt
until blended. Gradually stir in meat juice mixture. Cook, stirring
constantly, until mixture thickens.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in reserved giblets and neck meat; cook 2 more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into gravy boat.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 18.
</P>
<P>
   TRADITIONAL PUMPKIN PIE

cream, beating until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the filling into the chilled pie shell; put on cookie sheet
for easy handling.
</P>
<P>
   Place on bottom rack of oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce

 &HT;    At meal where bird is the star,
 &HT;    make sides stand out, too
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ That darned turkey. Probably because of
its size alone, the bird steals the show no matter how much work
goes into the side dishes. Yet they're the foods that make the meal
stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Where would the big bird be without the supporting cast of
stuffing, candied yams or the ubiquitous green bean casserole? Just
another fowl centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with mere roasting, today's cooks are trying new
tricks with turkey. But why not work on the side dishes?
</P>
<P>
   Turn the vegetables and soups into delicious foods that can
stand on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed onions and caramelized Brussels sprouts put some zip in
the otherwise bland meal. Take the cranberries out of the relish
and put them into the stuffing. Here are other ideas for making
stars out of sides.
</P>
<P>
   STUFFED ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   1pound bulk sausage, hot or mild, or a mix of both
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon ground sage (if sausage has sage, omit)
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon olive oil or butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup finely chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup grated carrots
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup finely chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   1cup seasoned breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   Parmesan cheese for topping
</P>
<P>
   8large sweet onions, peeled and cored to 1/2-inch shells (save
inner onion for other dishes)
</P>
<P>
   12ounces vegetable or chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   In nonstick skillet, lightly saute sausage until no pink
remains. Drain well; place in mixing bowl. Sprinkle with ground
sage.
</P>
<P>
   In same skillet, add butter or oil; saute onion, celery, carrots
and green onions until just tender. Pour over sausage; mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in bread crumbs, tossing well.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon mixture lightly into onions; sprinkle with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Place onions in large baking dish, pour broth into pan. Cover
lightly with foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 375 degrees until onions are just softened, about 25
minutes. Remove foil and allow to brown lightly on top.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 large or 16 half servings.
</P>
<P>
   CARAMELIZED BRUSSELS SPROUTS
</P>
<P>
   Roasting brings out the natural sugars in any vegetable;
Brussels sprouts are no exception. Add to that a syrup made from
balsamic vinegar, and you've got a winning dish. Best part for the
cook: They can be in the oven with the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds Brussels sprouts for every six people
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil for baking sheet
</P>
<P>
   1cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Wash Brussels sprouts and trim ends. Cut larger ones in half,
leave small ones whole. Roll until coated with oil on an oiled,
foil-lined cookie sheet or roasting pan; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, heat vinegar to boiling, and reduce heat.
Allow to simmer about 30 minutes to reduce volume by half. At this
point it should be of syrup consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle vinegar syrup over Brussels sprouts and roast, at 375
degrees for 20 minutes or until lightly browned and done.
</P>

 &HT;    Turkeys surviving better in wild than on your table
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 25.
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy Thanksgiving. This is the day when the turkey is the most
celebrated bird in America. The turkey you munch today most
probably was raised by commercial growers in turkey houses strictly
controlled for temperature, humidity, water and food supply. But in
the wild, the wild turkey is one of Georgia's greatest examples of
a successful wildliflly sound hunting seasons, and enhancing the
turkeys' habitat, such as deciduous woodlands and wooded
bottomlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy habitat is the most important aspect of turkey
populations,'' says WRD biologist Reggie Thackston. Turkeys were
trapped in various parts of the state and relocated to establish
new breeding populations. More than 4,000 of them were relocated to
over 400 areas. Private landowners, hunting organizations and cone
spring and early summer of 1997 resulted in poor reproduction rates
for wild turkeys in Georgia. But their reproduction rates were high
in 1998 and this year.
</P>
<P>
   Long may the turkey gobble!

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tips for cooking with the kids from cookbook
author/illustrator Jane Breskin Zalben:
</P>
<P>
   _ READ RECIPES carefully with your children and make list of
ingredients you don't have.
</P>
<P>
   _ TAKE YOUR LIST _ and the kids _ with you to the store.
</P>
<P>
   _ BE ORGANIZED. Line up ingredients in order of use.
</P>
<P>
   _ WASH HANDS and wear comfortable clothing you don't mind
getting messy.
</P>
<P>
   _ DECIDE WHICH tasks are suitable for the child. Some kitchen
equipment such as knives, graters, scissors, beaters, mixers, food
processors, ovens and stoves should only be used with adult
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ OVEN MITTS, pot holders and aprons should be used every time
you cook.
</P>
<P>
   _ FOLLOW THE recipe, cleaning up along the way.
</P>
<P>
   _ HAVE FUN! Enjoy the wonderful smells wafting through the
house. Says Zalben: ``I don't own a microwave because I love the
aromas of good food cooking or baking!''

   Music pirates aided by technology upgrades
</P>
<P>
   By John Keilman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Erich, a 23-year-old University of Dayton senior,
hasn't been to the record store for awhile _ and he may never go
again.
</P>
<P>
   Erich gets his music free from the Internet. Using the
university's high-speed computer lines, he and his friends download
songs known as MP3 files from web sites that post them illegally.
He says his roommate has built a trove of 2,000 songs, and that he
has created his own compact discs from Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everyone I know does it,'' he says. ``I know people who
are filling up their hard drives (with pirated music).''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to a 21st century headache for college administrators.
Schools have invested millions to create cutting-edge computer
infrastructures, opening new frontiers of research and learning.
However, those same networks have made it easy for students to
trample copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of digital, CD-quality music files are floating across
the World Wide Web. Some are offered by their creators, who hope to
spur interest in their work by giving away a sample. But many are
copied and traded illegally, depriving musicians and record
companies of money that, in all likelihood, is exponentially
greater than the $1 million a day lost from bootleg tapes and CDs,
according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an Internet connection can download these files, but
cyber-swiping appears to be especially rampant on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got young people with free time, lots of access, and
they're curious,'' says Barbara Deschapelles, a network
administrator at UD. ``It's kind of a climb the mountain thing:
'What can I get away with?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Dormitories and computer labs at UD, Wright State University,
Sinclair Community College and Antioch use network connections that
are up to 200 times faster than the 56k modems standard on home
computers. That means instead of taking a half hour to download a
5-minute MP3 song, students can do it in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have a song stored on their computer, they can play it
whenever they like. They also can put it on their personal web
sites for others to copy.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually how students are caught with pirated music.
Recording industry agents constantly search for web sites that
illegally post copyrighted songs, notifying colleges when such
material is on their networks. That has happened four times at UD
over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Those nabbed with bootlegged music on their web pages can lose
network access and suffer other penalties, such as fines or
community service. But such busts, rare to begin with, may soon
become non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they rarely put MP3s on their web pages these days.
They usually store the music on their computers' hard drives, which
cannot be accessed by Internet snoopers.
</P>
<P>
   They swap tunes using e-mail and Zip disks, or, in the case of
students at Wright State, through private networks accessible to a
limited number of people. Travis, an 18-year-old freshman, says
that has allowed him to quickly build a huge collection of MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have almost 1 gigabyte, and that's probably over 10 hours,
probably around a couple of hundred songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators say they're aware of the vast MP3
exchanges on campus, but maintain there's little they can do about
it. They don't know what students have on their computers unless
they spot a guilty web site or get tipped off by a foolish action
(one UD student was caught when he tried to send an e-mail
containing a whopping 100MB of MP3s; the transmission failed,
giving technicians a copy of the message).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to spread the word that this is illegal and
people are being caught,'' said UD's Deschapelles. `` ... Most
people probably aren't thinking. I think if they did, it would
occur to them that it was illegal and immoral. It's theft of ideas
and theft of property.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes as news to Andrew, a 20-year-old UD junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal?'' he says. ``That definitely changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his housemates have hooked a computer loaded with 1,500
MP3 files to a sound system, using it to supply the music during
parties. They also burn songs onto recordable CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew says MP3 search engines and television commercials for
products such as CD burners made him think downloading bootleg
music was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's such a new thing that people haven't gotten used
to it being illegal,'' he says. ``It's like, 'I never have to go to
Best Buy again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other students, well aware that they are stealing music, have
mixed feelings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, I think we should be able to do it, because
it's our freedom,'' says Jason, an 18-year-old Wright State
freshman. ``But I'm in a band. I think, 'What if we eventually put
out a CD and everyone copied it?' That thought is there, and to be
honest, it probably is hurting the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   UD and Wright State are rewriting their computer ethics
guidelines to be more specific about copyright violations, and both
vow to increase their educational efforts and punish those they
find with illegal files. Meanwhile, the recording industry is
trying to establish a new standard for digital music that will
ensure security.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s, however, are not the final frontier of piracy. Bootleg
software programs and digitized, full-length movies are showing up
on some university networks. UD administrators recently caught one
student offering several downloadable films on his computer,
including one that isn't even available on videotape yet.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the huge movie files download slowly, even
on super-fast networks, and don't run smoothly. That discourages
many students from pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth it,'' says Erich, the UD senior. ``Not yet
anyway.''

 &HT;    Walking parity line is boring
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARITYVILLE, USA _ Well, here we are in the National Even-Steven
League, where every team _ with a couple of exceptions from Ohio _
can beat any other team on any given Sunday, Monday and, on
occasion, Thursday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League has reached its nirvana, and it is
not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has managed, through legislation, injury, substance
abuse and bad luck to produce 31 teams and one flavor _ vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   There is nobody to love, nobody to hate, nobody to root for or
against.
</P>
<P>
   No excellence. Just rampant balance, which also goes by the
names equality, similarity and, unfortunately, mediocrity. I look
at the league on a weekly basis, and there are no more must-see
games.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, there are 18 teams that are unwatchable. Look at the
standings. That 18 number is negotiable _ you might find more; you
won't find fewer.
</P>
<P>
   To bring this as close to home as possible, check the dearly
beloved AFC Central, but only if you haven't eaten in the last
hour. From the bottom up, Bengals, Browns, Ravens, Steelers,
Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Titans are 8-2. But they are as tasteless as grits.
</P>
<P>
   But even with five of six AFC Central teams on the endangered
species list, we don't hold title to the worst division in
football.
</P>
<P>
   No, that surely goes to the NFC East. Find a team among these
worth even 10 minutes of your time on a Sunday afternoon: Redskins,
Cowboys, Giants, Cards, Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   That's the entire NFC East. They go 5-for-5 on the
sadsackometer.
</P>
<P>
   I long for those old Cowboy-Redskin-Cardinal games when the
teams actually had personalities. It was Staubach, Jurgensen and
Jim Hart playing 35-34 games that weren't decided until the last
ambulance had left the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders-Chiefs used to be an event. Now, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Browns-Bengals; Steelers-Browns; Steelers-Bengals once raised a
clamor. Now, those games are as interesting as the production of
porridge.
</P>
<P>
   And what has the NFL found to replace those rivalries?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the league is a victim of its own plan. Unlike
baseball, it wanted equality, and it got it. Unfortunately, the
price of equality has been the loss of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The league's onetime headline quarterbacks are either sitting
home in Barcaloungers _ John Elway, Jim Kelly, Joe Montana _ or
trying to recover from injuries _ Steve Young, Dan Marino, Brett
Favre, Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one good, young quarterback who has had more than
six good games _ Peyton Manning _ and a few others the league is
praying for because they're so badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   The teams with the best records are frail imitations of the old
Steelers, 49ers or Bears. Two weeks ago, the supposed best team in
the league, Jacksonville, won a game 6-3 against a team with Hansel
and Gretel at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the NFL has achieved what it wanted _ 25 of its 31
lambs are still in contention for the playoffs. As they stuff their
faces with cranberry sauce on Thursday, fans in those cities can
raise a turkey leg to their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Not around here, of course. Here we're afraid to raise a turkey
leg to our two powerhouses because it might be part of the team.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Jesse Jackson is taking a lambasting for his
trouble on behalf of seven unruly high school kids in Decatur,
Illinois, but he appears to be right on the merits of the instant
case and even more right against the larger background of worsening
racial disparities in the criminal justice system. (Teepen, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA, Fla. _ Blessings, real blessings, don't
announce themselves. Enumerating them in a blessing census seems to
endanger them, even cheapen them. But sometimes you can't escape
the topic. When cornered, I will admit one of the big things I'm
thankful for is that nearly everything wise grownups told me when I
was a kid about the way the world would be right now, at the turn
of the millennium, was just plain wrong. (Lane, Daytona Beach
News-Journal) MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Since University of Texas regents
want a building design that will be familiar to Texans for their
$60 million to $70 million Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art, why don't
they build an art museum that looks like a Dairy Queen? When you're
talking about Texas architecture, it just doesn't get much more
familiar than DQ. Everybody in Texas knows what a Dairy Queen looks
like. Van Gogh. To go. What's the difference? I'll have the Picasso

previous generations, a people separated by the borders of three
states and two countries drew on their common belief that a journey
to a mountain peak on a Sunday might deliver answers to their
humble prayers. They drew deep breaths and stepped up steep paths,

SERIAL SEQUEL: THE RETURN OF DONNIE PFASTER TO `THE X-FILES'

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Nick
Chinlund in a scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jeffrey Dahmer was in the air.
 &HT;    It was five years ago, on the set of the second-season
``X-Files'' episode ``Irresistible,'' as Chris Carter and Nick
Chinlund conferred. Series creator Carter had written the episode,
and Chinlund was there to play Donnie Pfaster, a death fetishist
moving on to live victims.
 &HT;    ``Chris talked to me a little bit about Dahmer and people like
him just before we started,'' Chinlund says. ``I didn't know what
Dahmer looked like, but when I saw a picture of him later on I
thought, `Wow, Pfaster looks a bit like him.'
 &HT;    ``Right before the very first take on the episode, I was sitting
in a van, getting ready for a drive-up shot,'' he recalls. ``It
took a long time to get the shot ready, so I turned on the radio in
the van, and on the news they reported that Dahmer got killed in
prison.
 &HT;    ``And that's when I heard them say, `Roll camera,''' he says.
``I had to turn off the radio and go right into the episode. It was
pretty weird.''
 &HT;    Pfaster ultimately went down in ``X-Files'' history as one of
the show's most memorable _ and most sinister _ characters. And
now, on Dec. 12, Chinlund returns to action as Pfaster in the
episode ``Orison,'' written by Chip Johannessen and directed by Rob
Bowman.
 &HT;    ``Donnie has been in prison,'' Chinlund says by telephone from
his Los Angeles home. ``He's been incubating all of his disease.
 &HT;    ``It's a heightened five-years-in-wait version of him that
you'll see,'' the actor promises. ``He's stepped up a notch. Orison
is a prison preacher who tries to save Donnie, and so you have a
battle there.
 &HT;    ``Basically, Donnie and the Devil are released from prison and
havoc ensues,'' he says. ``There's more religious significance to
`Orison' than `Irresistible,' and more of the devilish aspect is
explored.''
 &HT;    Chinlund, a 37-year-old actor whose credits include such films
as 1997's ``A Brother's Kiss'' and 1996's ``Eraser,'' as well as a
recurring role on the television drama ``Third Watch,'' reports
that he found it relatively easy to slip back into character as
Pfaster.
 &HT;    ``You take a blank canvas, just put one dot on it and let people
think what they want,'' he says. ``You don't have to do much with
this character. They can do so much with the writing, the lighting
and the camerawork _ it's almost a role where I step out of my own
way and allow everything to happen.
 &HT;    ``I did watch `Irresistible' again to reacquaint myself with his
tone and his behavior,'' he adds. ``There was one very powerful
graveyard scene we did for `Orison' _ which I can't tell you about
_ that was very difficult for me. Other than that, it was very
familiar.''
 &HT;    Reuniting with Carter, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson was
great, Chinlund says. But the real surprise for him involved
director Bowman, who he says not only helped shape the
performances, but also oversaw the intricate special effects
required to pull off several scenes in which Pfaster maneuvers in
real time as everyone around him carries on in super-slow motion.
 &HT;    ``Bowman is the most technically adept director I've ever worked
with,'' the actor says. ``He really knows what the camera and
lighting can do, and he knows his options and what he wants. He got
very excited about this episode.
 &HT;    ``It's going to look incredible, especially for a television
show,'' Chinlund says. ``He might be the star of this one.''
 &HT;    After completing ``Orison,'' the actor shot ``Something Sweet,''
his eighth independent feature in two years. He hopes one of them
will ``strike a nerve'' in Hollywood, prompting the producers and
directors of studio projects to hire him for the kind of
leading-man roles he so far has enjoyed only in indie films and
television guest spots.
 &HT;    If it were possible, though, would he consider playing Donnie
Pfaster one last time?
 &HT;    ``They're talking about doing a sitcom now,'' Chinlund jokes.
``I don't know. I don't want to become known as a serial killer,
but Donnie is such a specific, out-there character that I'm not
worried about it.
 &HT;    ``If they want me to do Donnie again, if they want to make it a
trilogy, I'd probably be all for it.''
 &HT;    Oh, and for the record, Nick Chinlund is nothing like Donnie
Pfaster.
 &HT;    ``I'm the farthest thing from this creepy guy,'' Chinlund says.
``Donnie Pfaster is really night and day from me.''
 &HT;    Nick Chinlund, Pfaster pussycat.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER DIES IN BROOKLYN BUILDING COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-NY-BUILDING-COLLAPSE-425&AMP;ADD-NYT  (gm) 
 By JOHN KIFNER and JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A building under construction in Brooklyn collapsed
Tuesday, plunging a dozen immigrant workers down four stories in a
cascade of wet concrete, killing one and badly injuring the others.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the collapse was apparently a result of
shoddy construction, as the contractor apparently failed to provide
enough support for the upper floors, where the collapse occurred.
The site, on Middleton Street in the Williamsburg section, was also
the scene of a collapse three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims were Mexican immigrants, and one law
enforcement official said the contractor was being investigated for
possible use of undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse came about 8:35 a.m., as the construction crew had
just begun to pour concrete for the third floor of a residential
complex. Fire and ambulance crews arrived within minutes and found
the injured workers in the basement, stunned and half buried in a
pool of wet concrete several feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would just see hands and feet in the cement, some lying
face up, some lying face down,'' said Officer William Pieszak of
the Emergency Services Unit, who arrived minutes after the
collapse. ``They thought they were drowning. They thought they were
being buried alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chaos around here,'' Pieszak went on. ``They just went
into a hole. Guys were running around with their mouths bloody,
with their nose bloody. Guys were in a daze.''
</P>
<P>
   Peering into the wrecked basement, Capt. Edward Kearon of Ladder
Company 108 could see at least four men lying in the pool of wet
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used portable ladders to get down to the basement and put
the victims onto backboards and bring them out,'' Kearon said.
``One man was wedged underneath a pile of metal, and we had to cut
him out while his body was covered with concrete and metal.''
</P>
<P>
   The worker who was killed, tentatively identified as Daniel
Eduardo, 22, was crushed by concrete building blocks, metal
reinforcing rods and other debris as the intervening floors gave
way.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, whose name was not known by the authorities, was
in critical condition Tuesday night in the operating room at
Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. Two others were in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Buildings Department immediately shut down the
construction site, a six-building row house residential complex. It
is in a primarily Hasidic section of Williamsburg that has been
undergoing a construction boom to accommodate the swelling
population of Hasidim.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the collapse, several agencies immediately began
investigations, officials said, including the Brooklyn district
attorney's office, which was looking into possible criminal
negligence, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in the
event that illegal immigrants were being employed, and the
Occupation Safety and Health Administration in case federal
workplace regulations were violated.
</P>
<P>
   The Buildings Department had ordered the site closed on Aug. 10,
said Paul Wein, a department spokesman, when another unit collapsed
because the builders had overloaded the second-floor unit with
concrete blocks. Construction was allowed to resume a week later.
</P>
<P>
   The building permit lists the site's owner as Faye Schwimmer of
Faye Industries Corp. and the contractor as Chaim Ostreicher of
Industrial Enterprises, both of Brooklyn. There was no answer
Tuesday at the telephone numbers listed for both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Buildings Commissioner Richard C. Visconti said it
appeared that the floor gave way because the joists, or supports
that hold it up, were not properly secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the collapse was caused by not properly bracing the
floor joists before pouring the concrete,'' Visconti said. ``We're
investigating the building's blueprints and the size and gauge of
the joist.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, law enforcement officials said, there would
be inquiries into whether the construction company was violating
the law by failing to pay the prevailing wage or by employing
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These both became issues during interviews with the injured
workers,'' one law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the site who spoke to reporters afterward said the
dead man, Eduardo, was one of a group of illegal immigrants on the
job. One worker said he was being paid $8 an hour, while others on
the site were being paid $6 to $10 an hour. A construction union
official said the union wage for jobs such as pouring or smoothing
concrete was $20 to $25 an hour, plus benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Many illegal immigrants, including Mexicans, Poles and
Jamaicans, gather early in the morning at Division Street and
Bedford Avenue, hoping to pick up day jobs on construction or
maintenance from contractors cruising by. Men at that corner on
Tuesday, however, said the same crew, most of whom were Latino, had
been working steadily on the Middleton Street project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live near the accident and see the same crew going to lunch
all the time,'' said Daniel Ayala, 26, who worked at a nearby site
for three hours Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these jobs, you bust your butt and they want to pay you
$6 an hour,'' Ayala said. ``It isn't right. The bosses are always
rushing us to do the job fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department officials said the collapse occurred as the
concrete mixing truck's chute and hose were raised to the
unfinished fourth level of the brick-faced building and began to
pour concrete down to the northeast corner of the unfinished third
floor. Workers there waited to rake it smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laying down cement,'' said Lauriano Avilez, from the
southern Mexican state of Guerrero, who said he had been in New
York for five years. ``I didn't even notice. All of a sudden,
everything fell, all of it. I was left hanging. I just hung on with
my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less fortunate. Rescuers pulled battered workers out
with the concrete hardening white on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a harrowing scene when we first arrived,'' said a
deputy assistant chief, Salvatore Cassano, the Fire Department's
citywide tour commander. ``People were trapped up to their necks in
wet cement. We dug them out by hand and shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, two emergency medical technicians, Julie
Moreland and Jeanette Perez, took their first call of the day and
went to the collapse site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled our stretcher out of the truck, and Fire brought
this guy out strapped to their longboard, fully immobilized,'' Ms.
Moreland said. ``His whole body was cement. He was covered with
cement, his nose, his ears, his eyes were closed shut and
everything. He had multiple fractures, his shoulder, the whole left
side of his face and jaw, his lower left leg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We washed his face so we could give him oxygen, he was
combative, moaning and groaning,'' she said, describing the ride to
Bellevue. Tuesday night the unidentified man was in critical
condition after more than three hours of surgery.

 &HT;    IN RUSSIA, CRIME AND NO PUNISHMENT FOR POLITICAL CANDIDATES
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 28 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Murder, arson and jail time. These are
not the sort of credentials that make for a promising political
career.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Russia and, more specifically St. Petersburg, where
the politics are not just bare-knuckled; sometimes they're deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Shutov, a member of the local city council, wants to be
elected to the national lower house of parliament, the Duma, in the
Dec. 19 elections. He's running for office from a grim prison cell,
and his aides have collected enough signatures to place his name on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   A popular political maverick, Shutov was arrested last February
on charges of arranging at least three contract murders of
businessmen and politicians. Shutov claims that political enemies
have framed him. Until he is formally charged and a trial date has
been set, he's free to hold his local office and run for a national
seat in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia votes for a new parliament next month, it will
determine the future of the troubled nation, and signal the
political mood in advance of a more critical choice next summer _
the election to replace President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the elections to fill the Duma's 450 seats also are burdened
by a faulty political system and a cast of colorful and dubious
characters that make Russia's experiment with democracy look at
times like mad science.
</P>
<P>
   Perks and power _ not public service _ provide the motivation
for most candidates, political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian election system, voters will cast two votes _
one for a candidate from the local district and one for a political
party and its list of candidates. So, for example, while popular
and respected politicians like former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov will head the list and attract votes to his Fatherland-All
of Russia party, he'll also carry with him into office lesser-known
candidates down the party list.
</P>
<P>
   The lists drawn up by eligible political parties will fill half
the Duma seats, and those lists are riddled with candidates
currently under criminal investigation or with people alleged to
have paid large sums _ in the millions of dollars _ to become
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who are criminals, or accused of crimes, or simply
fearful that they may face criminal charges sometime in the future,
are seeking seats in the Duma because it provides limited, yet
substantial, immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary Russians are very disillusioned with politics and
politicians of all kinds,'' said Sergei Markov, of the Moscow-based
Institute of Political Studies, a think tank. ``They have been
deceived many times in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials have sought and failed over
the years to push legislation to eliminate the immunity benefit.
Russia's interior ministry estimates that there are about four
million current and former elected officials, judges and
prosecutors at the federal and regional level who enjoy immunity
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is nothing to prevent Shutov or others from
running for office from jail _ and avoiding imprisonment once
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Shutov, 53, insists he is not in this category. He wants to
serve the people, not use the office to evade prison, said his
lawyer. Yet, he is no stranger to the penitentiary. In Soviet
times, he served five years for forgery and embezzlement. He served
another 18-month stint earlier in this decade awaiting trial on
charges of arson, extortion and smuggling until winning acquittal
from a local court.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faces charges that he was part of a ring that ordered up
the executions of prominent businessmen and politicians in St.
Petersburg, a city that has been plagued by sensational mob-style
hits since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shutov's lawyer claims it is a smear campaign and that his
client continues to be among the city's more effective lawmakers,
not a lawbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still involved in making daily decisions (on the city
council) through his assistants and his lawyers,'' said Andrei
Pelevin, who says his client should be freed while awaiting trial.
``It seems to me that now he is more active than other council
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities rejected Cox Newspapers' request to interview Shutov
at the Vyborg prison, a two-hour drive northwest of St. Petersburg.
Pelevin said authorities did not want to allow Shutov to talk to
journalists and that Russian newspapers were being pressured not to
publish Shutov's commentaries written from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia's young democracy, where competing political parties
are still a new phenomenon, there is little party loyalty _ aside
from the Communist Party, which opinion polls show has the support
of about 20 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters tend to be attracted to nationally known politicians.
Political alliances are forged not so much along ideological lines,
but with business ties and power-sharing pacts.
</P>
<P>
   In Shutov's case, he is a political ally of powerful St.
Petersburg Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev, but essentially running as an
independent. He failed in a bid for the Duma in 1995, but won
election to the city council in 1998 with 60 percent of the vote in
his district.
</P>
<P>
   Could he be elected this time from prison? The odds are against
him, particularly since he was re-arrested and allegedly beaten up
by security forces in a bizarre episode earlier this month after
briefly getting out on bail.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one independent political analyst in St. Petersburg
says Shutov has an allure that others in the race for the Duma may
not possess: At least voters will know whom they would be getting.
And since the public perceives government as corrupt and
untrustworthy, prosecution could be a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prison _ this is not a condition that makes a person less
attractive,'' said analyst Leonid Kesselman. ``We have our own
value system in Russia and in the old (Soviet) days, nearly every
Russian knew someone or had a member of their family in prison.''

 &HT;    CHINA'S GREAT TAKLIMAKAN DESERT RESISTS WORLD OIL HUNTERS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: With map-graphic.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Nov. 21 and Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUNNAN OIL BASE, China _ The fearsome Taklimakan Desert, one of
the earth's last great natural barriers to human penetration, is
grudgingly yielding up some of its liquid treasure.
</P>
<P>
   But not without a desperate fight.
</P>
<P>
   With its dreaded sandstorms called ``black hurricanes'' and its
almost indecipherable underground rock formations, the mighty
Taklimakan has managed to frustrate some of the world's smartest,
most tenacious oil hunters for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Known to centuries of camel travelers as ``the sea of death,''
the Taklimakan looks like a set for ``Lawrence of Arabia'' with its
endless undulating dunes of golden powder-fine sand.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that China, the world's most overcrowded
country, could include an egg-shaped ``empty quarter'' 600 miles
wide that is reminiscent of the most desolate deserts of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan ranks as the most inaccessible part of the world,
lying further from the sea than any other point on the globe. It is
protected on three sides by walls of mountains leading to Siberia,
Afghanistan and Tibet, and on the fourth side by China's Gobi
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago China's national oil company hit a gusher smack
in the middle of the Taklimakan. An international rush for oil was
on, centered in the desert a few hundred miles north of the ancient
Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   That first discovery shaft sunk by China National Petroleum
Company tapped into a world-class oil deposit said to be 70 miles
long. Within months Western oil companies plunged in to lease
quadrants of the desert fringes put up for wildcatting by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinese and Western drillers were gambling that this
austerely beautiful terrain would yield a string of super-giant oil
fields and turn China's western frontier into another Caspian Sea
bonanza. But it hasn't happened, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of bidding British Petroleum (now BP/Amoco),
Exxon and Agip paid the Chinese a total of $500 million in 1993 for
the right to explore and share in any commercial-sized oil finds.
The deal was that the Western companies would pay for the
exploration and keep a 49-percent share of profits if oil was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Chinese geologists told the World Petroleum
Congress that the Taklimakan and the surrounding wasteland of the
so-called Tarim Basin had potential reserves of 88 million barrels.
Thus, this nearly uninhabited desert about half the size of Texas
was said to be perched on top of four times the proven oil reserves
of the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before a spread in the National Geographic
magazine told of ``an enormous underground pool of oil'' beneath
the Taklimakan. Western companies bought up more drilling blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some geologists still think there could be numerous super-giant
``elephant'' oil fields lurking somewhere beneath these shifting
sands. But so far they've only found a few baby elephants, not
nearly enough to justify the ambitious Chinese oil estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Through enormous expense and almost inhuman endurance by 4,000
Chinese oil workers, China's national oil company is managing to
squeeze 75,000 barrels a day of oil from the desert and its
northern fringe.
</P>
<P>
   From March to June of each year, wind currents slash down from
Siberia and collide with northbound airflows from the Tibetan
plateau. The result is killer sandstorms in which the sky blackens
and the air fills with sand and gravel that hits like bird-shot.
That's why Taklimakan in local dialect means ``go in and don't come
back out.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer isn't much more pleasant. The sun bakes the desert
floor until the temperature reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In the
winter, the wind blows and the desert chills to 20 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   One of every four barrels produced in the Tarim Basin comes out
of the ground here at the Lunnan Oil Base, a cluster of buildings
and oil processing apparatus huddled on hardscrabble wasteland 70
miles north of Taklimakan's first ridge of flowing sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the difficulties of working in the Tarim Basin, the
Chinese are finding increasing volumes of brackish water flowing up
the well casing along with the oil in Lunnan. And even though
Lunnan's 67 wells have been producing for only a decade or less,
the Chinese are being forced to install some big mechanical
rocker-arm pumps to bring up crude that used to flow up freely
under natural pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarim Basin now ranks as China's seventh-largest oil field,
far less than its original promise.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the oil, Chinese drillers have found impressive
supplies of natural gas, which may be piped to eastern China and
help replace dirty coal as the main heating source in Shanghai and
other heavily polluted cities. Tarim's proven natural gas reserves
are estimated at 200 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we hoped we could discover a huge oil reserve
here,'' acknowledged Jia Chengzao, deputy chief of China's Tarim
oil and gas prospecting zone. ``But from our experience, we have
found more gas than oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese have had some successes on their own
exploration blocks, nothing the Western drillers have tried here
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the suspected oil layers lie up to 20,000 feet below the
dunes, drillers are forced to use new and expensive wildcatting
tricks, including three-dimensional seismic modeling, digital
simulation and high-pressure jetting for super-deep drilling. And
the high-tech hasn't been working.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, which has been hunting for oil in the Taklimakan since
1993, is the only Western company still drilling. Unless Exxon's
fortunes get better, it may pull out before long.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon spokesman in Dallas said the oil company was not
currently drilling in the Tarim Basin, but Jia confirmed that Exxon
is now drilling a wildcat well on one of its New Jersey-sized
lease-holdings on the northwestern edge of the desert and should
learn within two months if it is a winner. Jia said Exxon already
abandoned another similar-sized block after another wildcat well
found no commercial-sized oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon spokesman did not return follow-up phone calls from
Cox Newspapers inquiring about the exploratory well of which Jia
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum, which won one of the first lease blocks in
1993, has already dropped out after finding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Agip, which hold the rights to explore a territory
bigger than Wisconsin, have drilled two dry holes and have told the
Chinese they have no plans for further exploration, according to
Jia. The Agip-Texaco leases are due to expire at the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan hasn't been tamed so far. Maybe it never will be.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Playing wordlessly through Lionel Ritchie and
Dire Straits, Iranian electric guitarist Nima Moghimi and his band
test their freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   They are a pop band in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the
right to rock is still fragile and thin. Though their instrumental
covers are tame by western tastes, they are right on the edge for
an edgy fundamentalist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric guitar,'' the stylish 22-year-old Moghimi
explains, ``is not familiar to my government.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the government is coming to understand popular music.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Iranian revolution 20 years ago,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini at times banned nearly all music. The
clerics, or mullahs in charge saw it as an instrument of western
corruption, dangerous for a country dedicated to religion and
fighting a war for existence against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Iran opened up to folk tunes, classical works and
balladeers singing in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the two-year-old government of President Mohammad
Khatami, even electric guitarists enjoy the freedom he has extended
to movie producers, newspaper editors and authors. Khatami's
popularity is especially high with young Iranians, who often
complain they have few outlets for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi's so-far-unnamed band played its first three concerts at
a small movie theater in Tehran last month. The shows, billed as a
``Pop Music Concert'' of ``Old Songs,'' sold out the theater's 400
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the musicians are not allowed to sing western lyrics,
their fans occasionally sing along to the songs they know. Western
pop is banned here. But, within private homes, Iran enforces its
social laws loosely and black-market cassette collections are
common.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is forbidden, so the fans stay in their seats but clap
rhythmically to nes.
</P>
<P>
   A few female concertgoers even push through the post-concert
crowd for autographs. They wear the head scarves and overcoats
required by modesty laws, but the scarves show plenty of hair while
blue jeans and high-heels show beneath the hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the Beatles in Hamburg, but something new is
happening _ something beyond the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the government is interested in the arts,'' says
fan Navid Assar, a business student. ``It can be a kind of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big changes,'' says Saghar Amirazimi, reviewing the
show as music writer for one of Tehran's reform-oriented daily
newspapers. ``Before Mr. Khatami, the performance of popular music
was not like now. We had many concerts, but mostly folk music or
the Iranian symphonies.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, strobe lights flash but the seven band members, in
slacks and button-down shirts, mostly keep to their spots.
</P>
<P>
   The lead figure is Ehsan Sabuhi, an-18-year-old saxophonist
whose instrument fills in where lyrics would be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the sometimes-rowdy banter that western rock
stars share with their audiences, these shows have little talk. In
one break, 25-year-old bassist Amir Hossein Mostaed politely thanks
the people who truly make the show possible _ the Iranian
government's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The band had to give the ministry a tape and a live audition
before it won permission for the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials are really doing their best, and trying to
improve and better things for people who can make a good
performance,'' says Khosro Mohadeth Khalesi, a music teacher who
formed the band.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that did not make it through the audition was the
band's name. Band members wanted to use a Persian tribal name, but
it was not approved.
</P>
<P>
   About six approved bands play pop music now.
</P>
<P>
   There are also other young musicians who sometimes gather in
private parties to play and sing lyrics at parties _ sessions prone
to raids from modesty police, fines or short detentions.
</P>
<P>
   But, the public bands stick to instrumentals. Khalesi's
selections include George Michael's ``Careless Whisper'' and Abba's
``Money Money.'' They also play their own compositions, mixtures of
western and Persian tones.
</P>
<P>
   The band members get paid just enough to cover expenses and
complain, like young musicians anywhere, that they do not have
enough money for good equipment or instruments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they hope to make a name for their nameless
group and expand their repertoire as Iran expands its freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi says that he still has to hold back some guitar riffs
that are too raucous.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears are mine and my fingers are mine,'' he says. ``I
should play the things I like.''

THE REALITY
 &HT;    (With optional trims.)

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Late one recent afternoon, a formation
of French soldiers in full combat gear escorted a few children and
women _ one pushing a baby in a stroller _ across the bridge that
divides this city in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were ethnic Albanians attempting to get
to their apartments in the Serb-dominated northern district. Facing
the soldiers and their wards across the bridge were maybe 100
watchful Serb vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed wire-draped span is the primary link between the Serb
and Albanian sides of town. It also marks the frontier between
Christian and Muslim worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, a French officer crossed the bridge to
give the edgy Serb men his word that his troops would allow no
Albanian men to cross. In exchange for this pledge, he demanded
safe passage for the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, women and children,'' responded one of the vigilantes as
the crowd pressed around the officer. ``But no men. No men!''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb men stared coldly as the women and children crossed and
vanished into the fading evening light.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reality of peace in Kosovo: Heavily armed foreign
troops struggle each day to keep people who have shared this land
for centuries from ripping one another to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In south Kosovo, heavily armed American soldiers guard ancient
Serb Orthodox churches. Guard posts have been set up in the front
yards of elderly Serbs who otherwise would be defenseless. They
patrol neighborhoods in Humvees and respond to everything from the
crackle of firecrackers tossed in doorways as pranks to the
thudding blast of a rocket attack on a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers don't always prevail. In a cycle of revenge and
retribution, old men and women are beaten to death; young men are
kidnapped and murdered; churches and houses are plundered and
burned; cornfields are mined with devices meant to blow a man to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In the five months since 45,000 NATO troops rolled into Kosovo,
more than 380 people _ slightly more ethnic Albanians than Serbs _
have been murdered. Nearly 120 have been abducted, and more than
1,100 houses and businesses have been set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   As the international community struggles to bring order to this
troubled province, ethnic hatred remains the one intractable and
potentially mortal issue. It makes the once heralded vision of a
peaceful multi-ethnic Kosovo seem hopelessly idealistic. It also
deeply complicates the reality that Kosovo with its ethnic Albanian
majority remains the legal dominion of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring and early summer, the Serb troops under the
leadership of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic herded the
Albanians out of Kosovo at gunpoint in what the world decried with
horror as ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many international observers here, the ethnic
Albanians have returned the favor through the summer and autumn.
Officials estimate that before the 78-day NATO air war that ended
in June, there were 200,000 Serbs in Kosovo. An estimated 70,000
remain, many too old, poor or stubborn to quit their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials expect the remaining Serbs to leave in the spring
when the diversion of surviving the winter gives way to renewed
rounds of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of ethnic violence are less frequent these days, but
this is most often explained by the simple truth that most of the
targets of the violence _ the Serbian and Gypsy minorities _ have
nearly ceased to exist in much of Kosovo. In Urosevac, a city in
the U.S.-patrolled region of southern Kosovo, only 28 remain of the
pre-war Serbian population of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the provincial capital and largest city, the Serb
population has dwindled from about 20,000 before the war to perhaps
400 now, security officials say. Many of those who remained face
lives consumed by fear and a struggle for basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   International aid and diplomatic officials here fear that ethnic
tensions will leave the world's community of humanitarian aid
donors cool to Kosovo as neither side seems worthy of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community did intervene in Kosovo to protect
human rights and not to pave the way for a new wave of ethnic
harassment and violence,'' said Daan Everts, the head of the Kosovo
mission for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
``The population of Kosovo and their leaders must understand this
violence jeopardizes the international reputation and the standing
of Kosovo. It is likely to affect donors' sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   The runaway ethnic violence forced officials to downgrade the
status of a Nov. 17 international donors meeting in Brussels from a
celebratory gathering of top echelon national leaders to work
session of lower-level officials. Even so, the representatives of
47 donor countries and the European Commission pledged $1 billion
to finance Kosovo's recovery effort
</P>
<P>
   for one year. Yet, officials at the meeting expressed deep
reservations about the future because of the ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cline, a worker for Adventist Development and Relief
Agency, said the remaining Serbs tend to be the ones who could not
leave. ``These are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable,'' Cline
said. ``They're old, they're paralyzed. In many cases they've been
abandoned by their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Their protection often comes from a young soldier posted outside
their homes. ``Having an American soldier with a machine gun in
your front yard is a real deterrent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers can't stay forever. Unless the climate changes
dramatically, the fate of the remaining Serbs seems bleak at best
when the troops leave. ``In reality, if the KFOR troops weren't
here to protect them, they'd be dead,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities also
complicates relief efforts. Cline said the Albanians she works with
try to pressure her to keep her attention focused on the Albanians.
``They like to remind me why I came to Kosovo _ to help the
Albanian refugees, not the
</P>
<P>
   Serbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups often must tread lightly. For example, C.A.R.E.
International has been criticized for providing food assistance to
Serbs in the Urosevac/Ferajai district because not all needy
Albanians had been served first
</P>
<P>
   But if C.A.R.E. neglected the Serbs, the organization would be
criticized for ignoring a vulnerable minority. ``It's damned if you
do, damned if you don't,'' said Brendan McDonald, C.A.R.E.'s food
distribution manager for the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns and villages, many houses were put to the torch
after the KFOR troops arrived. In one Urosevac/Ferajai neighborhood
of Gypsies _ called Romas in Kosovo _ more than 40 houses have been
burned by marauding Albanians. Albanians accuse the Romas of
collaborating with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald expressed a common frustration. ``It's hard when we
from the west tell them they have to stop the killing,'' he said,
while driving a C.A.R.E. vehicle by a Roma enclave ``They only get
angry and say, 'What right do you have to come here and tell us to
stop killing each other?' Don't you know what they did?'''
</P>
<P>
   An ache for revenge fills Rabit Njeti, 30, when he looks across
a pasture in the countryside near his burned out home in southern
Kosovo. A mile or so away stands a Serb village. There, Njeti
believes, lives the man who burned his home and belongings last
April. Njeti's three-story, 10-year-old house was the product of
two generations' labor and represented his family's future in
Kosovo. Now, the 14 members of his family struggle for shelter as
the winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people who do these crimes, we feel we need to take
the revenge,'' he said as he toured the charred interior of his
house. ``This is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians say Serbs who didn't harm Albanians have nothing
to fear. But innocence and guilt are determined without benefit of
judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, a 73-year-old Serb woman was murdered in her
home in Mitrovica with an axe. In another case, a Serb farmer
discovered that mines with trip wires had been placed among the
stalks of his corn crop. Also in October, a U.N. staff member was
murdered in Pristina, apparently after he was overheard speaking
Serbo-Croatian in public.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials take little comfort from the role of the members of
the rebel army that went to war against Serbia, the dominant
republic in what remains of Yugoslavia. Former Kosovo Liberation
Army leaders have publicly condemned violence against Serbs and
have provided investigators a list of likely suspects in the crimes
against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a U.N. report also indicates that members of the Kosovo
Protection Corps, the militia residual of the KLA, have been
intimidating and beating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities blame the rebels for planting a landmine
that killed two Serb police a week ago near the boundary between
Kosovo and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In north Mitrovica, the 15,000 to 17,000 Serbs _ nearly twice as
many as before the war _ feel trapped and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   South of the river _ the Albanian side _ the town bustles. The
mood is triumphant. Markets are full of color with fresh meat and
produce. New lumber frames top houses burned in the war. Streets
are jammed with cars, military vehicles and the endless variations
of sport-utility vehicles bearing logos of U.N. agencies and
humanitarian relief groups that have spread across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   North of the river, there is little such activity. The dominant
color is gray. Reconstruction is rare. Basic supplies are short.
Children make a playground of the gnarled steel and stone of a
police station crushed by three NATO bombs in May. People still use
Yugoslavian dinars to trade, unlike the rest of Kosovo, which uses
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   Here people are angry at both NATO and at their government in
Belgrade, for stumbling into a war and then losing it and perhaps
Kosovo as well. They feel deserted and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, the leader of the Serb community in Mitrovica,
believes Kosovo ultimately may be ethnically cleansed of Serbs with
the help of what he considers tragically misguided Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic, a former factory manager in Pristina, said the KFOR
soldiers believe they are in Kosovo to secure the province for
Albanians not to protect Serbs. Yet, he argues, it is the Serbs now
who are threatened with annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want a multi-ethnic Kosovo, and then they bring
in 800,000 Albanians and kick out 200,000 Serbs,'' he said. ``They
don't have enough courage to explain to the Albanians that they
didn't just come here to protect the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at contrived efforts to bring Serbs and Albanians
together, such as a proposal for mixed police patrols. ``To get six
Serbs and six Albanians in a patrol, you would have to have 15
French soldiers to keep them apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the sense of hopelessness has sparked an intense
desire to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Aleksic wants to escape with her husband and two
children and head for New Zealand, primarily because it is as far
away from Kosovo as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Her family lived in an apartment just south of the Mitrovica
bridge. She says they were forced to abandon the apartment, which
is now occupied by Albanians. They now live in a makeshift
apartment in the school where she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   She is bitter about the way Serbs have been portrayed to the
world, and she despises CNN because she believes the news network
unfairly demonized her people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not terrorists,'' she said over coffee in her
apartment. ``We are not dangerous. We are just family people. We
just want to work and live and have our children. We didn't do
anything to deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Her twin sister, Tanja Jaksic, says she often dreams longing
stories of living in what seems to her to be a black township in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that people there can go to these towns and no
matter what is going on elsewhere, they can feel safe there,'' she
says as she walks down a grim street in her part of the city.
``That's what I dream about, to have peace and to feel safe in my
own village with my own people.

 &HT;    CHINA'S GREAT TAKLIMAKAN DESERT RESISTS WORLD OIL HUNTERS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: With map-graphic.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUNNAN OIL BASE, China _ The fearsome Taklimakan Desert, one of
the earth's last great natural barriers to human penetration, is
grudgingly yielding up some of its liquid treasure.
</P>
<P>
   But not without a desperate fight.
</P>
<P>
   With its dreaded sandstorms called ``black hurricanes'' and its
almost indecipherable underground rock formations, the mighty
Taklimakan has managed to frustrate some of the world's smartest,
most tenacious oil hunters for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Known to centuries of camel travelers as ``the sea of death,''
the Taklimakan looks like a set for ``Lawrence of Arabia'' with its
endless undulating dunes of golden powder-fine sand.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that China, the world's most overcrowded
country, could include an egg-shaped ``empty quarter'' 600 miles
wide that is reminiscent of the most desolate deserts of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan ranks as the most inaccessible part of the world,
lying further from the sea than any other point on the globe. It is
protected on three sides by walls of mountains leading to Siberia,
Afghanistan and Tibet, and on the fourth side by China's Gobi
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago China's national oil company hit a gusher smack
in the middle of the Taklimakan. An international rush for oil was
on, centered in the desert a few hundred miles north of the ancient
Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   That first discovery shaft sunk by China National Petroleum
Company tapped into a world-class oil deposit said to be 70 miles
long. Within months Western oil companies plunged in to lease
quadrants of the desert fringes put up for wildcatting by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinese and Western drillers were gambling that this
austerely beautiful terrain would yield a string of super-giant oil
fields and turn China's western frontier into another Caspian Sea
bonanza. But it hasn't happened, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of bidding British Petroleum (now BP/Amoco),
Exxon and Agip paid the Chinese a total of $500 million in 1993 for
the right to explore and share in any commercial-sized oil finds.
The deal was that the Western companies would pay for the
exploration and keep a 49-percent share of profits if oil was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Chinese geologists told the World Petroleum
Congress that the Taklimakan and the surrounding wasteland of the
so-called Tarim Basin had potential reserves of 88 million barrels.
Thus, this nearly uninhabited desert about half the size of Texas
was said to be perched on top of four times the proven oil reserves
of the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before a spread in the National Geographic
magazine told of ``an enormous underground pool of oil'' beneath
the Taklimakan. Western companies bought up more drilling blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some geologists still think there could be numerous super-giant
``elephant'' oil fields lurking somewhere beneath these shifting
sands. But so far they've only found a few baby elephants, not
nearly enough to justify the ambitious Chinese oil estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Through enormous expense and almost inhuman endurance by 4,000
Chinese oil workers, China's national oil company is managing to
squeeze 75,000 barrels a day of oil from the desert and its
northern fringe.
</P>
<P>
   From March to June of each year, wind currents slash down from
Siberia and collide with northbound airflows from the Tibetan
plateau. The result is killer sandstorms in which the sky blackens
and the air fills with sand and gravel that hits like bird-shot.
That's why Taklimakan in local dialect means ``go in and don't come
back out.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer isn't much more pleasant. The sun bakes the desert
floor until the temperature reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In the
winter, the wind blows and the desert chills to 20 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   One of every four barrels produced in the Tarim Basin comes out
of the ground here at the Lunnan Oil Base, a cluster of buildings
and oil processing apparatus huddled on hardscrabble wasteland 70
miles north of Taklimakan's first ridge of flowing sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the difficulties of working in the Tarim Basin, the
Chinese are finding increasing volumes of brackish water flowing up
the well casing along with the oil in Lunnan. And even though
Lunnan's 67 wells have been producing for only a decade or less,
the Chinese are being forced to install some big mechanical
rocker-arm pumps to bring up crude that used to flow up freely
under natural pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarim Basin now ranks as China's seventh-largest oil field,
far less than its original promise.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the oil, Chinese drillers have found impressive
supplies of natural gas, which may be piped to eastern China and
help replace dirty coal as the main heating source in Shanghai and
other heavily polluted cities. Tarim's proven natural gas reserves
are estimated at 200 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we hoped we could discover a huge oil reserve
here,'' acknowledged Jia Chengzao, deputy chief of China's Tarim
oil and gas prospecting zone. ``But from our experience, we have
found more gas than oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese have had some successes on their own
exploration blocks, nothing the Western drillers have tried here
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the suspected oil layers lie up to 20,000 feet below the
dunes, drillers are forced to use new and expensive wildcatting
tricks, including three-dimensional seismic modeling, digital
simulation and high-pressure jetting for super-deep drilling. And
the high-tech hasn't been working.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, which has been hunting for oil in the Taklimakan since
1993, is the only Western company still drilling. Unless Exxon's
fortunes get better, it may pull out before long.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon spokesman in Dallas said the oil company was not
currently drilling in the Tarim Basin, but Jia confirmed that Exxon
is now drilling a wildcat well on one of its New Jersey-sized
lease-holdings on the northwestern edge of the desert and should
learn within two months if it is a winner. Jia said Exxon already
abandoned another similar-sized block after another wildcat well
found no commercial-sized oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon spokesman did not return follow-up phone calls from
Cox Newspapers inquiring about the exploratory well of which Jia
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum, which won one of the first lease blocks in
1993, has already dropped out after finding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Agip, which hold the rights to explore a territory
bigger than Wisconsin, have drilled two dry holes and have told the
Chinese they have no plans for further exploration, according to
Jia. The Agip-Texaco leases are due to expire at the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan hasn't been tamed so far. Maybe it never will be.

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Playing wordlessly through Lionel Ritchie and
Dire Straits, Iranian electric guitarist Nima Moghimi and his band
test their freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   They are a pop band in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the
right to rock is still fragile and thin. Though their instrumental
covers are tame by western tastes, they are right on the edge for
an edgy fundamentalist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric guitar,'' the stylish 22-year-old Moghimi
explains, ``is not familiar to my government.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the government is coming to understand popular music.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Iranian revolution 20 years ago,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini at times banned nearly all music. The
clerics, or mullahs in charge saw it as an instrument of western
corruption, dangerous for a country dedicated to religion and
fighting a war for existence against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Iran opened up to folk tunes, classical works and
balladeers singing in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the two-year-old government of President Mohammad
Khatami, even electric guitarists enjoy the freedom he has extended
to movie producers, newspaper editors and authors. Khatami's
popularity is especially high with young Iranians, who often
complain they have few outlets for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi's so-far-unnamed band played its first three concerts at
a small movie theater in Tehran last month. The shows, billed as a
``Pop Music Concert'' of ``Old Songs,'' sold out the theater's 400
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the musicians are not allowed to sing western lyrics,
their fans occasionally sing along to the songs they know. Western
pop is banned here. But, within private homes, Iran enforces its
social laws loosely and black-market cassette collections are
common.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is forbidden, so the fans stay in their seats but clap
rhythmically to some tunes.
</P>
<P>
   A few female concertgoers even push through the post-concert
crowd for autographs. They wear the head scarves and overcoats
required by modesty laws, but the scarves show plenty of hair while
blue jeans and high-heels show beneath the hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the Beatles in Hamburg, but something new is
happening _ something beyond the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the government is interested in the arts,'' says
fan Navid Assar, a business student. ``It can be a kind of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big changes,'' says Saghar Amirazimi, reviewing the
show as music writer for one of Tehran's reform-oriented daily
newspapers. ``Before Mr. Khatami, the performance of popular music
was not like now. We had many concerts, but mostly folk music or
the Iranian symphonies.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, strobe lights flash but the seven band members, in
slacks and button-down shirts, mostly keep to their spots.
</P>
<P>
   The lead figure is Ehsan Sabuhi, an-18-year-old saxophonist
whose instrument fills in where lyrics would be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the sometimes-rowdy banter that western rock
stars share with their audiences, these shows have little talk. In
one break, 25-year-old bassist Amir Hossein Mostaed politely thanks
the people who truly make the show possible _ the Iranian
government's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The band had to give the ministry a tape and a live audition
before it won permission for the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials are really doing their best, and trying to
improve and better things for people who can make a good
performance,'' says Khosro Mohadeth Khalesi, a music teacher who
formed the band.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that did not make it through the audition was the
band's name. Band members wanted to use a Persian tribal name, but
it was not approved.
</P>
<P>
   About six approved bands play pop music now.
</P>
<P>
   There are also other young musicians who sometimes gather in
private parties to play and sing lyrics at parties _ sessions prone
to raids from modesty police, fines or short detentions.
</P>
<P>
   But, the public bands stick to instrumentals. Khalesi's
selections include George Michael's ``Careless Whisper'' and Abba's
``Money Money.'' They also play their own compositions, mixtures of
western and Persian tones.
</P>
<P>
   The band members get paid just enough to cover expenses and
complain, like young musicians anywhere, that they do not have
enough money for good equipment or instruments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they hope to make a name for their nameless
group and expand their repertoire as Iran expands its freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi says that he still has to hold back some guitar riffs
that are too raucous.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears are mine and my fingers are mine,'' he says. ``I
should play the things I like.''

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Late one recent afternoon, a formation
of French soldiers in full combat gear escorted a few children and
women _ one pushing a baby in a stroller _ across the bridge that
divides this city in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were ethnic Albanians attempting to get
to their apartments in the Serb-dominated northern district. Facing
the soldiers and their wards across the bridge were maybe 100
watchful Serb vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed wire-draped span is the primary link between the Serb
and Albanian sides of town. It also marks the frontier between
Christian and Muslim worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, a French officer crossed the bridge to
give the edgy Serb men his word that his troops would allow no
Albanian men to cross. In exchange for this pledge, he demanded
safe passage for the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, women and children,'' responded one of the vigilantes as
the crowd pressed around the officer. ``But no men. No men!''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb men stared coldly as the women and children crossed and
vanished into the fading evening light.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reality of peace in Kosovo: Heavily armed foreign
troops struggle each day to keep people who have shared this land
for centuries from ripping one another to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In south Kosovo, heavily armed American soldiers guard ancient
Serb Orthodox churches. Guard posts have been set up in the front
yards of elderly Serbs who otherwise would be defenseless. They
patrol neighborhoods in Humvees and respond to everything from the
crackle of firecrackers tossed in doorways as pranks to the
thudding blast of a rocket attack on a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers don't always prevail. In a cycle of revenge and
retribution, old men and women are beaten to death; young men are
kidnapped and murdered; churches and houses are plundered and
burned; cornfields are mined with devices meant to blow a man to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In the five months since 45,000 NATO troops rolled into Kosovo,
more than 380 people _ slightly more ethnic Albanians than Serbs _
have been murdered. Nearly 120 have been abducted, and more than
1,100 houses and businesses have been set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   As the international community struggles to bring order to this
troubled province, ethnic hatred remains the one intractable and
potentially mortal issue. It makes the once heralded vision of a
peaceful multi-ethnic Kosovo seem hopelessly idealistic. It also
deeply complicates the reality that Kosovo with its ethnic Albanian
majority remains the legal dominion of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring and early summer, the Serb troops under the
leadership of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic herded the
Albanians out of Kosovo at gunpoint in what the world decried with
horror as ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many international observers here, the ethnic
Albanians have returned the favor through the summer and autumn.
Officials estimate that before the 78-day NATO air war that ended
in June, there were 200,000 Serbs in Kosovo. An estimated 70,000
remain, many too old, poor or stubborn to quit their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials expect the remaining Serbs to leave in the spring
when the diversion of surviving the winter gives way to renewed
rounds of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of ethnic violence are less frequent these days, but
this is most often explained by the simple truth that most of the
targets of the violence _ the Serbian and Gypsy minorities _ have
nearly ceased to exist in much of Kosovo. In Urosevac, a city in
the U.S.-patrolled region of southern Kosovo, only 28 remain of the
pre-war Serbian population of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the provincial capital and largest city, the Serb
population has dwindled from about 20,000 before the war to perhaps
400 now, security officials say. Many of those who remained face
lives consumed by fear and a struggle for basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   International aid and diplomatic officials here fear that ethnic
tensions will leave the world's community of humanitarian aid
donors cool to Kosovo as neither side seems worthy of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community did intervene in Kosovo to protect
human rights and not to pave the way for a new wave of ethnic
harassment and violence,'' said Daan Everts, the head of the Kosovo
mission for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
``The population of Kosovo and their leaders must understand this
violence jeopardizes the international reputation and the standing
of Kosovo. It is likely to affect donors' sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   The runaway ethnic violence forced officials to downgrade the
status of a Nov. 17 international donors meeting in Brussels from a
celebratory gathering of top echelon national leaders to work
session of lower-level officials. Even so, the representatives of
47 donor countries and the European Commission pledged $1 billion
to finance Kosovo's recovery effort
</P>
<P>
   for one year. Yet, officials at the meeting expressed deep
reservations about the future because of the ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cline, a worker for Adventist Development and Relief
Agency, said the remaining Serbs tend to be the ones who could not
leave. ``These are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable,'' Cline
said. ``They're old, they're paralyzed. In many cases they've been
abandoned by their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Their protection often comes from a young soldier posted outside
their homes. ``Having an American soldier with a machine gun in
your front yard is a real deterrent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But he soldiers can't stay forever. Unless the climate changes
dramatically, the fate of the remaining Serbs seems bleak at best
when the troops leave. ``In reality, if the KFOR troops weren't
here to protect them, they'd be dead,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities also
complicates relief efforts. Cline said the Albanians she works with
try to pressure her to keep her attention focused on the Albanians.
``They like to remind me why I came to Kosovo _ to help the
Albanian refugees, not the
</P>
<P>
   Serbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups often must tread lightly. For example, C.A.R.E.
International has been criticized for providing food assistance to
Serbs in the Urosevac/Ferajai district because not all needy
Albanians had been served first
</P>
<P>
   But if C.A.R.E. neglected the Serbs, the organization would be
criticized for ignoring a vulnerable minority. ``It's damned if you
do, damned if you don't,'' said Brendan McDonald, C.A.R.E.'s food
distribution manager for the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns and villages, many houses were put to the torch
after the KFOR troops arrived. In one Urosevac/Ferajai neighborhood
of Gypsies _ called Romas in Kosovo _ more than 40 houses have been
burned by marauding Albanians. Albanians accuse the Romas of
collaborating with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald expressed a common frustration. ``It's hard when we
from the west tell them they have to stop the killing,'' he said,
while driving a C.A.R.E. vehicle by a Roma enclave ``They only get
angry and say, 'What right do you have to come here and tell us to
stop killing each other?' Don't you know what they did?'''
</P>
<P>
   An ache for revenge fills Rabit Njeti, 30, when he looks across
a pasture in the countryside near his burned out home in southern
Kosovo. A mile or so away stands a Serb village. There, Njeti
believes, lives the man who burned his home and belongings last
April. Njeti's three-story, 10-year-old house was the product of
two generations' labor and represented his family's future in
Kosovo. Now, the 14 members of his family struggle for shelter as
the winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people who do these crimes, we feel we need to take
the revenge,'' he said as he toured the charred interior of his
house. ``This is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians say Serbs who didn't harm Albanians have nothing
to fear. But innocence and guilt are determined without benefit of
judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, a 73-year-old Serb woman was murdered in her
home in Mitrovica with an axe. In another case, a Serb farmer
discovered that mines with trip wires had been placed among the
stalks of his corn crop. Also in October, a U.N. staff member was
murdered in Pristina, apparently after he was overheard speaking
Serbo-Croatian in public.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials take little comfort from the role of the members of
the rebel army that went to war against Serbia, the dominant
republic in what remains of Yugoslavia. Former Kosovo Liberation
Army leaders have publicly condemned violence against Serbs and
have provided investigators a list of likely suspects in the crimes
against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a U.N. report also indicates that members of the Kosovo
Protection Corps, the militia residual of the KLA, have been
intimidating and beating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities blame the rebels for planting a landmine
that killed two Serb police a week ago near the boundary between
Kosovo and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In north Mitrovica, the 15,000 to 17,000 Serbs _ nearly twice as
many as before the war _ feel trapped and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   South of the river _ the Albanian side _ the town bustles. The
mood is triumphant. Markets are full of color with fresh meat and
produce. New lumber frames top houses burned in the war. Streets
are jammed with cars, military vehicles and the endless variations
of sport-utility vehicles bearing logos of U.N. agencies and
humanitarian relief groups that have spread across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   North of the river, there is little such activity. The dominant
color is gray. Reconstruction is rare. Basic supplies are short.
Children make a playground of the gnarled steel and stone of a
police station crushed by three NATO bombs in May. People still use
Yugoslavian dinars to trade, unlike the rest of Kosovo, which uses
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   Here people are angry at both NATO and at their government in
Belgrade, for stumbling into a war and then losing it and perhaps
Kosovo as well. They feel deserted and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, the leader of the Serb community in Mitrovica,
believes Kosovo ultimately may be ethnically cleansed of Serbs with
the help of what he considers tragically misguided Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic, a former factory manager in Pristina, said the KFOR
soldiers believe they are in Kosovo to secure the province for
Albanians not to protect Serbs. Yet, he argues, it is the Serbs now
who are threatened with annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want a multi-ethnic Kosovo, and then they bring
in 800,000 Albanians and kick out 200,000 Serbs,'' he said. ``They
don't have enough courage to explain to the Albanians that they
didn't just come here to protect the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at contrived efforts to bring Serbs and Albanians
together, such as a proposal for mixed police patrols. ``To get six
Serbs and six Albanians in a patrol, you would have to have 15
French soldiers to keep them apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the sense of hopelessness has sparked an intense
desire to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Aleksic wants to escape with her husband and two
children and head for New Zealand, primarily because it is as far
away from Kosovo as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Her family lived in an apartment just south of the Mitrovica
bridge. She says they were forced to abandon the apartment, which
is now occupied by Albanians. They now live in a makeshift
apartment in the school where she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   She is bitter about the way Serbs have been portrayed to the
world, and she despises CNN because she believes the news network
unfairly demonized her people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not terrorists,'' she said over coffee in her
apartment. ``We are not dangerous. We are just family people. We
just want to work and live and have our children. We didn't do
anything to deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Her twin sister, Tanja Jaksic, says she often dreams longing
stories of living in what seems to her to be a black township in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that people there can go to these towns and no
matter what is going on elsewhere, they can feel safe there,'' she
says as she walks down a grim street in her part of the city.
``That's what I dream about, to have peace and to feel safe in my
own village with my own people.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass opdbations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

UNWITTING HERO VS. NET CLODS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody wants a piece of Mahir Cagri.
</P>
<P>
   There's the designer in Dallas who is showing movies featuring
Cagri on his Web site and who plans to sell T-shirts and ads soon.
There's the guy in Toronto who designed the Mahir Cagri Ping-Pong
game who readily admits he's driven by ``shameless
self-promotion.'' There's the guy in England hawking Mahir coffee
mugs and mouse pads who claims that the proceeds will go to the Red
Cross in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the columnists sending frantic e-mail to the
overnight cultural icon, assembling pathetically urgent missives
from a dogeared Berlitz phrasebook: ``Merhaba. I am gazeteci. I
want bilmek. Lutfen.'' (``Hello. I am journalist. I want speak.
Please.'')
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Cagri ignored that poignant plea.
</P>
<P>
   For folks who haven't been on line recently, Cagri is reportedly
an ordinary Turkish fellow who awoke one day to find himself an
Internet superstar, the central character in a Kafkaesque tale. The
story goes something like this: About a year ago, Cagri set up a
home page describing his hobbies and interests in fractured
English. Apparently, someone in Turkey doctored the page (which
began ``I kiss you!!!!!''), adding such sentiments as ``I like
sex'' and ``I like to take foto-camera . . . nice nude models and
peoples.'' That page found its way to Netizens at the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, who circulated the Web address
to colleagues worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Cagri was bombarded with e-mail and phone calls and
requests for interviews (``Lutfen!!''). Parodies sprouted all over,
with one page substituting President Clinton for the Turkish
lothario and another combining images of Cagri with the infamous
(and annoying) Hamster Dance. Cagri found himself on the front page
of the Turkish dailies, proving he exists.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually posted his own explanation of the purloined page
with an impassioned appeal for racial and religious tolerance.
``Everthing is for peace, friendship, huminity and love,'' he
wrote. ``As a world's citizen, I love all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the earnest world citizen's page was inspiring
parodies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And in the twisted and complex spirit of the Internet, some
folks were having good-natured fun with the existential hero of the
moment while others were trying to make a quick buck or garner good
PR. The original site was posted on Xoom.com, an on-line community
that offers free home pages. ``We tried to send him a digital
camera so he can use his Xoom membership,'' says Stacey Irvine,
senior director at Xoom. She skirted questions about the identity
of the person who posted the first phony page, answering every
query with a pitch for Xoom.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it doesn't matter how much of the story is true, since
Cagri doesn't own his identity any more. He's part Peter Sellers in
``Being There,'' part Jamaican bobsled team, and part Eddie Edwards
(the British ski jumper whose ineptitude brought instant fame).
He's the guy who makes us all feel a little bit superior because
he's so touchingly naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something deeply endearing about the combination of
earnestness and cheesiness,'' says Jacob Park, a specialist at the
Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights in New York, who runs a site
called Mahir Central. ``Most people think he's charming and cute,
but certainly there were snide comments from people who say, `He
can't speak English good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of imperialism to all the parodies: None of
this would be funny if it weren't assumed that English is the
language of cyberspace. Just who is making fun of whom?
</P>
<P>
   Park has many human-rights colleagues in Turkey, and he says
that the phrase ``I kiss you'' is the Turkish equivalent of ``Hi''
or ``Ciao.'' By the way, Park now signs his e-mails with kisses,
too.
</P>
<P>
   So do the rest of the Mahir maniacs _ profiteers and fans alike.
Michael Simpson created an interactive game that uses Mahir's head
as a torpedo. So much for Cagri's message of peace. ``There isn't
anything productive or virtuous about it,'' says Simpson, a Web
content developer who lives in Toronto. ``It's a way of shamelessly
promoting myself, like spray-painting your name on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stachowski, a Web designer in Dallas, is obsessed with the
cult hero, but he also wouldn't mind making a little money off his
Web page, which features animated movies starring Cagri. He is
selling ads on the page and says T-shirts will be available soon.
``I've gotten a couple of leads, but nothing serious,'' he says. So
why has he been spending so much time on the craze? He pauses, as
if in disbelief. ``Because,'' he says, exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cagri promises to post another update to the page in
the next few days. According to on-line reports, he has asked CNN
to pay him $50,000 for an interview, but a CNN spokesperson said
those reports were false. ``He never asked to be paid,'' the
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cagri comes out looking classier than the folks who are
having so much fun with his image and Mediterranean stereotypes. He
seems to lack the cynicism of most opportunists: If he were in
Hollywood, he would already have ``peoples,'' from agents to
publicists to personal assistants. And he'd be sure to have a movie
deal and a book contract.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he's not answering e-mails from unsophisticated
scribes who contact him in fractured Turk-glish. ``I want bilmek.
Lutfen.'' Maybe we should have tried, ``I kiss you. Ciao.''
</P>

WHO'LL RULE CYBERSPACE?

   CODE AND OTHER LAWS OF CYBERSPACE
</P>
<P>
   By Lawrence Lessig
</P>
<P>
   Basic Books, 240 pages, $30
</P>
<P>
   Two kinds of code regulate the Internet, Harvard Law School
professor Lawrence Lessig writes in his first book, ``Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace.'' The first is embodied in computer
programs. This is the actual code that creates Web browsers, Web
servers, e-mail systems, and the rest of the Internet
infrastructure. Lessig calls this ``West Coast Code,'' because it
is written primarily on the West Coast of the United States in such
places as Silicon Valley and Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The second code, says Lessig, is one made up by lawmakers and
regulators in countries where the Internet's computers reside. Not
surprisingly, Lessig calls this ``East Coast Code,'' since much of
the drafting takes place in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's distinction between East and West is sure to ruffle
feathers at MIT and Bell Labs, two great East Coast institutions
that have been at the forefront of Lessig's so-called West Coast
Code revolution. Nevertheless, the idea of dividing regulation into
that which is accomplished by computer programs and that which is
accomplished by law is a useful tool for those thinking about the
nature of today's Internet and possible futures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet is weakly regulated today, Lessig argues,
it is sure to be well-regulated in the future. The primary reason
for this push is electronic commerce. Many businesses rightly see
the Internet as the ultimate tool for selling products, reaching
new customers, and cutting the cost of distribution and support.
</P>
<P>
   But they also see the Internet as a threat _ a place where
customers can distribute stolen trade secrets, download pirated
software, and even post attacks on corporations. Their reaction to
these perceptions, says Lessig, will be to gradually remake
cyberspace into a place more friendly to selling things and less
friendly to individuals trying to act on their own.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of examples that support Lessig's thesis. One
is the creeping use of unique personal identifiers, or serial
numbers, on the Internet. Intel put a unique Processor Serial
Number into each Pentium III microprocessor; Microsoft puts a
unique Globally Unique Identifier into every document created by
Microsoft Word; and Real Networks puts a GUID into its Real Audio
Jukebox program. All these were designed to make it easier to track
computers and people on the Internet. They produce accountability
and destroy anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, more subtle ways corporations are regulating
the future of our information space. Consider America Online, which
tens of millions of Americans use to access the Internet. America
Online is a world with particular rules. These rules aren't handed
down by God or Congress. Instead, they are created by AOL's
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   One rule in the world of AOL has to do with public assembly.
AOL's president, Steve Case, can send an e-mail message to every
AOL subscriber. But all others on the AOL system are denied this
right. On other Internet chat services dozens or hundreds of people
can interact at the same time. But AOL's chat rooms are limited to
fewer than 30 people. AOL likes to think of itself as an electronic
town, but it's different than most towns, because none of the
citizens can vote. And it's a town where members will find it very
hard to organize to effect social change.
</P>
<P>
   All this wouldn't matter so much if the Internet were not
already an important part of our economy, and likely to become more
so. The future of the Internet is the future of our world. If we
make the Internet a highly regulated space where anonymity is an
illusion and voting is nonexistent, this can't help but have an
impact on the future of our real-space world.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, Lessig says it's time for East Coast Code to
start exerting more control over West Coast Code. Decisions are
being made that affect the future of the Internet and, by
extension, the future of the world. Do we want these decisions
being made by programmers and product managers, or by an open,
political process?
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's argument is sure to stir controversy. These days the
computer industry's predominant request to government is
laissez-faire. And indeed, says Lessig, the initial attempts of the
US government to regulate cyberspace haven't been too successful.
The Communications Decency Act of 1996 was attacked by
technologists and civil libertarians and ultimately struck down by
the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the Clinton administration asked the Internet's
Engineering Task Force to build provisions for wiretapping into the
very TCP/IP protocols _ the West Coast Code _ that drive the
Internet. So far the IETF has refused, arguing such perversions of
its code will make the Internet less secure, and ultimately won't
do much to help law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig reminds us that the alternative to no regulation by
government is, instead, regulation by corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand on the edge of an era that demands we make
fundamental choices about what life in this space, and therefore
life in real-space, will be like,'' he writes. ``These choices will
be made; there is no nature here to discover. And when they are
made, the values we hold sacred will either influence our choices
or be ignored.'' Lessig doesn't think government today is up to the
task. But he hopes it may one day take its rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's bias is obviously liberal, not libertarian. But even if
you disagree with his politics, there are still a lot of stories
and history that make this book an easy recommendation. ``Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace'' does a fabulous job pulling together the
most important issues facing the Internet, from wiretapping and
intellectual property protection to the battle between Microsoft
and Linux. And with a wonderfully conversational style, the book is
understandable by both non-lawyers and non-programmers _ an
impressive feat by itself.

A BIGGER THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've finally plowed through the findings of fact in the
Microsoft antitrust case, and it has almost made me want to go out
and buy stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates and his crew are exactly the sort of people you'd
want running your own business _ single-minded, relentless, always
ready to pounce on any threat to Microsoft's prospects. If every
software business had executives this sharp, they'd all be living
in $50 million houses.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what about Microsoft's efforts to crush its rivals?
Well, sure enough, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson makes the case
that Microsoft, in its zeal to stay on top, sometimes crossed the
line and engaged in questionable bullying tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive example is when Microsoft threatened
to stop producing its office software suite for Apple Computer
Inc.'s Macintosh computers, unless Apple agreed to use Internet
Explorer as its primary browser rather than Netscape Communications
Corp.'s Navigator. Keep in mind that Microsoft makes the only
top-of-the-line office suite for the Mac, and earns a lot of money
from it. Still, the company seemed willing to kill it to get a
better grip on Netscape's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty stuff. But perfectly kosher, unless you're a monopoly.
That's why Microsoft was so desperate to prove otherwise. Jackson
wasn't having any. He ruled, sensibly enough, that Microsoft holds
a monopoly on operating systems for machines that use
Intel-compatible processors.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Apple holds a monopoly on operating systems for
computers using Motorola PowerPC processors. And Apple has at times
been just as aggressive in protecting that monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Apple, bleeding cash and desperate for retail sales,
stopped other computer firms from making Macintosh clones. Apple
also put the kibosh on the Common Hardware Reference Platform, a
system that would have allowed PowerPC computers to run Windows NT
and the Mac OS. Apple thus prevented a flood of cheap Mac
knockoffs, which would have forced the firm to slash its
notoriously high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Apple interim chief executive Steve Jobs wasn't hauled into
court, perhaps because, if he hadn't made these moves, Apple would
probably be dead today. But what about now, with Apple's stock at
record highs and the profits rolling in? You could dramatically
enhance industry competition by forcing Apple to license its
operating system to all comers. Within a year, Macs would be as
cheap as PCs and almost as common. Come to think of it, Apple's
failure to license its operating system hurts consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you can make a case that Apple's policies are more
harmful than Microsoft's. At the end of Jackson's 200-page
document, he offers just three measly paragraphs explaining how
Microsoft's actions hurt you and me. For instance, Jackson says
that Microsoft's adding its browser to the Windows 98 operating
system hurts consumers because, well, doggone it, some consumers
don't want browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Such shabby reasoning is a blemish on an otherwise well-written
document. But this feeble addendum has to be there to justify the
Draconian remedies I think the judge would like to impose. He
plainly can't stand Microsoft, which has behaved throughout this
case with unseemly and foolish arrogance. Now it's payback time.
Longtime Microsoft haters are calling for a breakup of the company,
and maybe Jackson will give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe he'll notice the upsurge over the past two
years in rivals to Windows, particularly the operating system
Linux. Jackson is right to note that Linux is still a minor threat
to Microsoft. But ever since the trial began, Microsoft hasn't
dared twisting the arms of computer makers, with the result that
most major PC firms will now sell you a box with Linux instead of
Windows. That's real progress, made possible by self-imposed limits
on Microsoft's bully-boy tactics. Such limits should be enshrined
in a nice simple consent decree, and the lawyers then sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's competitors will say that this won't break the
company's power. They're right. So what? It's the abuse of such
power that should concern the government. With its baser impulses
in check, Microsoft will remain just about as fearsome and tough to
beat as ever. And rival software execs will have to settle for
living in $10 million mansions.

<P>
   Last month, Bob McNair agreed to pay a record $700 million for a
NFL expansion franchise for Houston. Now, he needs a little help
paying for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thanksgiving Day, McNair will begin selling 41,000
Permanent Seat Licenses for the 69,500-seat stadium scheduled to
open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The licenses -- priced from $600 for an end zone seat and $3,900
for a lower midfield one -- allow the buyer to own the seat as long
as he or she buys season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other chattel, the owner can sell the licenses, trade
them or bequeath them after death. In other cities, PSLs are so
coveted, they provide contention in divorces.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the licenses will pay for $50 million toward the
cost of the world's first retractable-roof, football-only stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That represents the football team's upfront payment for a
stadium budgeted at $310 million, but which could come in closer to
$350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for the stadium adjacent to the Astrodome is
slated March 8, when the new team's name will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one (financing) increment left -- the fan,'' said
North Carolina marketing guru Max Muhleman, who has helped sell
PSLs for other stadiums, including the one in Nashville, home of
the former Houston Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people will take pride in helping build the finest
football facility ever,'' Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as PSLs, the seat licenses have been used with great
success to finance stadiums for the Titans, Cleveland Browns,
Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some failures. The NFL Oakland Raiders had
problems selling PSLs for stadium renovations when they moved back
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Muhleman said he does not anticipate problems in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, he said, Houston has a burning desire to regain the
sport after Bud Adams moved his Oilers to Tennessee three seasons
ago. Muhleman noted that more than 7.5 million hits have reached
the new team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be the one-of-a-kind stadium, which Muhleman
predicted will attract more than one Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of McNair's enormous franchise fee, NFL officials
pledged to give Houston the 2004 Super Bowl. And because games can
be comfortably watched in the new stadium regardless of the
weather, NFL officials will give it priority with New Orleans,
Phoenix and Miami as preferred locations, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, PSL prices here will be fairly modest and
they will be fewer in number compared with NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, sold PSLs for 85 percent of their seats,
with the prices ranging from $2,500 to $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relative scarcity in Houston -- 60 percent --
they should have greater value in future years as owners consider
selling them, Muhleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the founding PSL owners will be etched on a ``wall of
honor'' inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who buy their PSLs by Dec. 10 will have first dibs on seat
assignments. Other assignments will be on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For any Super Bowl here, PSL buyers will be included in a
lottery for a smaller selection of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can pay for PSLs in three equal, annual payments,
interest-free. Southwest Bank of Texas, Wells Fargo and Chase Bank
of Texas will offer financing.
</P>
<P>
   If a PSL holder declines to buy season tickets, that fan will
forfeit their seat license.
</P>
<P>
   PSL applications will be available in Chronicle ads starting
Thursday, at www.2002stadiumfund.com on the Internet and in
brochures at participating banks.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent of the tickets will be sold in the
upper decks on a season or individual game basis. In addition, the
stadium will have pockets of seats below $20 each and an
alcohol-free zone for families.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority will chip in at least
$195 million of the stadium's cost through taxes on rental cars and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McNair will pay about $4 million and the Houston
Livestock Show and Rodeo $1.5 million in lease and maintenance
payments annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority will collect the revenues from the PSLs to
avoid tax liabilities. If the PSLs are privately issued, the issuer
has to pay income tax on them.
</P>
<P>
   Under McNair's October 1998 letter of agreement with the county,
sports authority and rodeo to build the stadium, $45 million in PSL
revenues would count against design and construction and $5 million
against the concession build-out.
</P>
<P>
   Additional revenues generated by PSLs would be counted against
additional items the football team desires.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL
Holdings, said the PSLs could raise $70 million, with the net
exceeding $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of agreement is under reconsideration as the cost
escalates, but McNair has said he will not pay any costs above what
he agreed to in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Authority Finance Chairman Ric Campo said there is
currently no consideration about using excess PSL revenues for the
additional stadium costs.

   HOLLYWOOD _ A digital video camera was perched like a bazooka on
the shoulder of director Mike Figgis as he carved a path through
the oblivious pedestrians on Sunset Strip, following actor Stellan
Skarsgard into a swanky glass-faced office. At the same moment, not
far away, three other digital cameras were following other actors
as they made their way down the sidewalk, chatted on cell phones or
bickered at curbside, the real world swirling all around them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever this film in progress might add up to artistically,
Figgis, the British director best known for the Oscar-winning
``Leaving Las Vegas,'' is at the very least extraordinarily
ambitious, some might say audacious, about exploiting the digital
technologies that are beginning to seep into the Hollywood
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   His film, ``Time Code 2000,'' is being shot in real time; that
is, as one continuous take, without editing, that lasts a
predetermined 93 minutes. The four cameras dance across a half
dozen sets and down city streets with a breathtaking seamlessness,
following the film's characters in and out of meetings,
assignations and confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis thought of doing the film just a few months ago, and he
said the digital technology would require only four to six weeks of
postproduction work instead of the typical several months, time
spent mostly fussing with the sound mix. The film potentially could
be available for theatrical release before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   When it appears in theaters, he said, the images from all four
cameras will be shown simultaneously, either in horizontal strips
with four images shown from left to right or stacked two-atop-two,
allowing audiences to edit the film in their own heads as they
switch attention from one image to another and try to follow the
plot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For years, digital moviemaking has been a grass-roots movement
among aspiring filmmakers who resented the dominance of the
Hollywood aesthetic. ``Time Code 2000'' brings the new technology
inside the walls of the major studios _ in this case, those of Sony
Pictures, which, not coincidentally, is owned by a company that
also manufactures digital equipment. Once inside the walls, many
believe, digital moviemaking will have a major impact on the way
movies are made and how people view them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many predictions that digital technology will transform
the industry, its potential influence is still far from certain.
For one thing, many filmmakers are extremely resistant to using
digital video because of the flat, bland image that videotape often
produces, particularly in comparison with the richer images
recorded by film.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of converting to digital projection systems is also
formidable _ $100,000 per projector multiplied by the more than
34,000 screens in the United States alone _ and theater owners and
studios have very different ideas about who should pay the tab.
Meanwhile, even the adventurous Figgis must transfer his digital
tape to old-fashioned film so it can be projected by the machines
now in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, digital proponents remain exultant. ``It's a
revolution,'' said Rodger Raderman, chairman of iFilm, a San
Francisco-based company that distributes digital films on the
Internet. ``And I believe it's coming faster than most people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Documentary filmmakers, in particular, have been at the
forefront, driven by economic necessity and a lack of interest from
the entertainment industry in financing their projects.
</P>
<P>
   Such respected directors as Penelope Spheeris and Spike Jonze
have done work in digital video, and earlier this month New Line
Cinema announced that it had signed a deal with Spike Lee to make
``Bamboozled,'' a movie entirely on digital video.
</P>
<P>
   When digital filmmaking's full potential is reached, a growing
number of people in the industry believe, it might even threaten a
studio power structure that has held firm since the advent of sound
and has absorbed such technological challenges as television and
VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond imagination what this is going to do to
filmmaking,'' said Figgis, whose roots are in music, theater and
experimental film. ``What has been an exclusive medium of high
finance, banking and financial exclusivity is now going to become
something that is within the reach of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that even the most modestly financed filmmaker
could afford to shoot a movie and transmit it to theaters digitally
at little expense.
</P>
<P>
   This revolution, if that's what it is, is being driven by the
convergence of several technologies: relatively inexpensive digital
video cameras, only now becoming widely available; digital
projectors that eliminate the need for film; and the growing
ability of the Internet and other information pipelines to transmit
digital sounds and images to multiplexes, living rooms and computer
screens without reliance on a studio's expensive production and
distribution services.
</P>
<P>
   It may even become possible to distribute and market those films
effectively on the Internet if the example of this summer's ``Blair
Witch Project'' is a guidepost to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole economics of the business are basically turned
upside down by digital technology,'' said Bruce Apar, editor in
chief of Video Business, a magazine published by Variety. ``It will
change the movie industry, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging technologies may push change even further. Some will
allow filmmakers to bypass not only film, but digital tape, making
it possible to shoot onto digital sticks, which resemble credit
cards, and computer disks, both of which break down images into
binary code. The images can be downloaded to a computer and
transmitted the same way that any other computer file is
transmitted. They can be edited on the computer screen,
extraordinary effects can be added and the resulting movie can be
sent by modem or satellite to any place in the world. Then theater
owners can download the movies and project them onto a screen with
the new generation of digital projectors.
</P>
<P>
   The financial savings can be considerable, even with available
digital equipment. Digital cameras cost a small fraction of what
film cameras cost, and prices are plummeting. New software allows
anyone to edit film on a home computer. There are no costs for
developing film, no need for reels of celluloid. Instead of paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars to make copies of a movie,
producers could make as many copies as necessary at the click of a
mouse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Figgis illustrated, picking up a small, hand-held camera that
was resting on a nearby chair. ``See this? It's a new,
state-of-the-art digital camera. Costs about $3,000,'' he said.
``I'd be using it on this movie except the tapes are only an hour
long and I need two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Code 2000'' is being made on a budget ``in the low
millions,'' Figgis said, about 5 percent of the $60 million that is
spent on the average major studio production. Most of his budget,
though, is going to pay the union wages of those working on the
film and for the handful of sets he is using.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were some young filmmaker in Ohio or someplace,'' Figgis
said, ``and I could use friends and shoot on found locations
instead of on sets, this movie, this very same movie, could be made
for about $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis' film looks little like the slick, visually sumptuous
films that Hollywood studios regularly produce. It is rapid, jerky
and definitely ragged around the edges, but Figgis believes that
moviegoers who accepted ``Blair Witch,'' which had many of the same
qualities, will accept his film, too.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the new technology is most visible on the
proliferation of Internet sites devoted to digital films (even the
major studios have begun to get involved in this) and in the growth
of the microcinema movement, in which digital filmmakers exhibit
their work in cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction to filmmakers is only partly economic. It is also
artistic. Digital video makes filmmakers more mobile, better able
to shoot scenes without cocooning themselves in studios or at
on-site locations, freer to move through the bustle of real city
streets, even interacting with real people they encounter. For most
of the century, filmmakers have been restricted to shots of no
longer than 10 minutes, a length limited by the size of film
magazines. (A 20-minute magazine has recently become available.)
Digital cameras, however, can shoot and shoot and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives, who acknowledge that the technology will
change their business, are not so sure that it will make them as
irrelevant as some filmmakers might hope. Studios, they argue, will
still be the marketplace where creative ferment produces the best
stories. And it will still be the studios _ and the surrounding
world of agents and producers _ that will retain control of the
copyrighted characters (think ``Batman'') and the top-name actors
who will be needed to make a movie, even a digital movie, rise
above the expected glut.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that production on ``Time Code 2000'' ends,
scheduled for Nov. 19, Figgis will have shot the film more than
seven times. Then he will choose the version he considers best.
</P>
<P>
   If his project feels a bit like a stunt, Figgis does not
disagree, though he prefers the term ``performance art.'' His movie
is intended, in part, to draw attention to the possibilities
created by digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is to have the film released, at least in a couple of
theaters, before the end of the year,'' he said. Columbia Pictures
has not decided whether it will release the film late this year or
early next year. What is telling, though, is that it is possible to
release a film so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be nice to have this look at the cinema of
the next century come out in the last week of this century.''

SQUIGGLY LINES INTERFERE WITH HUSBAND, WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Something is interfering with my marriage, and
I need help. We get five television channels at our house _ two
PBS, NBC, CBS and ABC. Most of the programs my husband wants to
watch are on NBC and CBS. I'd rather work on my computer than watch
any of them, but my computer causes interference on (only) those
two channels. What am I to do short of getting a husband who'd
rather watch PBS and ABC?
</P>
<P>
   _ Fine Tuning
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FINE: Well, you could wait for ABC to develop quality
programming aimed at mature adults, but your computer will be
obsolete by then. And PBS? I doubt if another nine-part Ken Burns
series on dollmaking in the Pennsylvania Dutch country will hold
your husband's attention long enough for you to finish Quake III.
</P>
<P>
   I know you never read the manual that came with your computer,
but somewhere inside it is a statement informing you that your
magic box generates radio frequency energy that can interfere with
radio or TV reception. In the United States, that interference has
to fall within certain limits or the computer can't be put on the
market. Even though your PC probably qualifies, that's no guarantee
you won't see squiggly lines on some channels.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing the Federal Communications Commission, one of our
least noxious agencies, has an in-depth guide to interference on
its Web site. Read through
www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Compliance/WWW/tvibook.html to learn everything
you could possibly want to know about why there are lines all over
Don Johnson's face. Other than the wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting to the chase, you're going to need a filter. You can buy
a toroid choke, which sounds like what you'd like to do to Aaron
Spelling's daughter every time you see her ``act,'' but is actually
something you clamp on a computer cable to keep it from spewing
squigglies. Try Radio Shack part No. 273-105.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, you'll have to escalate with a tunable
notch filter, which can selectively block interference. Find a TV
repair shop where they actually do the work instead of sending sets
back to the manufacturer, and they can probably help you. Or search
for ``notch filter'' on the Web for plenty of sources.
</P>
<P>
   What really intrigues me is that you have only five channels. If
you think ABC, CBS and NBC are bad, you should see UPN, WB and Fox.
You wouldn't be complaining about interference if you could see the
dreck they churn out.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've heard that Windows 2000 will continue to
use a DOS base, as has Windows 98. True?
</P>
<P>
   _ Same Old Same Old
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SAME: In the continuing game of three-card monty known as
Microsoft product development, Windows 2000 is no longer Windows
2000. At least not the Windows 2000 you're thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to merge Windows NT, the true 32-bit
network operating system used in commercial settings, with the
plain old garden-variety Windows you're used to. Didn't work. Too
much code to write. Windows 2000 would probably have been ready
around 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Win2K, due for release in February, will be a tarted-up
version of NT. Windows Millennium _ no scheduled release _ will be
a tarted-up version of Windows 98. And yes, DOS is still buried
deep in there.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay has already tried Windows 2000. He says it
should be called ``Windows 2000 Flushes,'' but he was feeling
really cranky that day. Microsoft lovers may complain to

SMALL DEVICES WON'T REPLACE PCS SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Twenty years ago, the Computer Dealers Exposition
hosted a mere 4,000 visitors who came to this ultra-tacky city in
the desert to make deals with each other. The IBM personal computer
was two years away.
</P>
<P>
   The PC not only changed Comdex, as the event became known, but
it also changed modern society. Personal computers are now on
nearly every white-collar desktop in America and in more than 50
percent of all homes. Connecting these machines is the Internet,
which is creating further astounding change in our day-to-day
lives.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's particularly interesting at the 20th anniversary of
Comdex that so many people here are ready to say the PC's time has
passed. The buzz among the 200,000-plus who have gathered this week
is that we are either moving into the post-PC era or the PC-plus
era.
</P>
<P>
   The former argument says the PC has outlived its usefulness, and
that a new generation of smaller, cheaper, easier-to-use
information appliances will take its place. The latter decrees that
these devices will indeed flourish and become more popular but will
serve to supplement the PC, which will remain the central
information manager in homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The official theme of this year's Comdex is ``Beyond the PC,''
with a heavy emphasis on these small, single-focus devices.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts and pundits have been falling all over themselves
to tout the coming of information appliances for several years,
I've been dubious. And after spending a few days wandering the
crowded booths on what is supposed to be the dawn of the
info-appliance age, I've not seen much to change my mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WRESTLING WITH DEVICES' LIMITATIONS
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there won't be _ or that there aren't already
_ useful information appliances. But it doesn't make sense that
these devices will overwhelm, supplant and become more popular than
the PC. The very thing that is supposed to be attractive about them
leads to their biggest downfall _ they have built-in limitations.
And when it comes to information, users hate limits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the products shown here this week is something called a
``Web companion,'' a type of small terminal used primarily to surf
the Web and send and receive e-mail. Houston's own Compaq Computer
Corp. was showing one of these at an event called Showstopper, and
branded the brief exhibition as a ``technology demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   It uses a small passive-matrix, flat-panel display propped up on
a base, with a nifty wireless keyboard. The keyboard has buttons _
similar in design to the Internet keyboard found on Compaq's
Presario desktops _ that can do specific tasks, such as launching
Web pages or an e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to find this device, which is still in search of a
name, on store shelves anytime soon. Once it's ready, Compaq plans
to sell it to companies who either offer Net access or services
over the Web, such as an online merchant, a bank or a stock trading
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The business would then resell the devices to its customers, or
even give them away. The business could then control what customers
see on the screen, essentially creating a window to the Web viewed
only through that business' brand.
</P>
<P>
   This is a smart move. By having other companies subsidize the
cost of the device when they make it available to their customers,
they get around a big problem with these information appliances _
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRICES COMPETE WITH DESKTOPS
</P>
<P>
   Most of the single-purpose devices I've seen here are going to
be selling in the $200 to $500 price range. The ones that are
capable of Web surfing are usually at the higher end of the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, they start competing in price with the
low-cost PCs that are out there. Why buy a device that will limit
your capabilities for $500 when you can get a device with no limits
for the same price or a little more?
</P>
<P>
   Information appliance boosters claim the PC isn't easy or
reliable enough for those who are not technically savvy. But given
the exploding consumer market for PCs _ and the fact that nearly
everyone who buys one gets onto the Net _ this seems to be a
specious argument. Certainly, people are figuring out PCs and
making them work.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept of the information appliance is, I think,
flawed. Their proponents use the toaster analogy, saying you don't
need a commercial kitchen just to make toast.
</P>
<P>
   But information isn't like toast. Most people, when they are
getting information, like to do something with it. They want to
change it, share it, create it. These devices, by and large, do not
allow that. You can look at the information, maybe print it out,
maybe forward it via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   (To Compaq's credit, its device has several Universal Serial Bus
ports and an Ethernet network connection. That means you will be
able to connect printers, scanners and external drives to it _ but
only if Compaq provides the support for them. You'll also be able
to hook it up to a home network, and receive from and send
information to _ you guessed _ a real PC.)
</P>
<P>
   I frequently get mail from frustrated users of Microsoft's WebTV
device who buy the television-based Web terminal for its
simplicity. But suddenly they discover that they can't see some of
the fancier features on Web pages, can't chat online with their
friends and can't do any of the myriad of things that their
PC-owning friends can do.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you insisted on carrying the toast analogy forward,
you could say that very few people eat their toast plain. They like
a little jelly on it.
</P>
<P>
   These information appliances don't have jelly. They're a bit
dry. And that's why I think the reports of the death of the PC are
greatly exaggerated.

MUSIC INDUSTRY FAILS TO MEET TARGET FOR START OF ONLINE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (js) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After scrambling to adopt a technical standard for sales of
music online, record companies and hardware makers last summer said
they had paved the way for Christmas sales of portable digital
players. But the holidays are ringing in a reality: neither the
tunes nor the players will be in place to make this the first big
digital music Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the delay, Sony Electronics, a consumer electronics
bellwether, last week introduced its digital music player, the
Memory Stick Walkman, but said that it would not be for sale until
January. Meanwhile, major music companies say that the delay in
adopting standards _ along with logistical challenges _ has forced
them to abandon their one-time goal of making much of their music
available over the Internet by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The delays suggest the complexity of the still evolving
technical standards being developed by the recording industry's
Secure Digital Music Initiative, and they hint at continued
uncertainty for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They also reflect competing interests. The music companies fear
that insecure digital players will lead to rampant piracy of music
downloaded from the Internet, while the consumer electronics
industry sees the digital players merely as heir to the portable
cassette and compact disc player.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a final agreement on the first phase of the
specifications being developed by the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, or SDMI, is not even scheduled to be signed until next
week. Initiative officials plan to meet in Maui, Hawaii, on Dec. 1
to sign a contract with Aris Technologies Inc., which makes a key
screening technology for the portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hardware vendors have sought to play down the delay, suggesting
that a single holiday shopping season lost will make little
difference in a still-nascent market. At the same time, some say
they are disappointed that they were pushed to adopt and comply
with standards but will not reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This delay hurts the ``credibility of SDMI,'' said Chris Smith,
portable audio program manager for Creative Labs. His company makes
the Nomad II, a portable player initially due out by Christmas but
now scheduled for distribution in the first quarter. When SDMI was
formed, he said, ``our stated goal was to have specifications by
June 30 so we could create products for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer electronics manufacturers said their concern had
been mitigated by the fact that their competitors' digital players
would not be on the shelves either. ``Our goal was Christmas,'' a
spokeswoman for Sony said, ``but in the grand scope of things,
missing one Christmas isn't going to make or break us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen portable digital players that record music
on tiny hard drives are already on the market. But those players
are not yet fully compatible with the technical standards, and it
is unclear how many of them will be able to be upgraded once the
new standards are in place. If they ultimately cannot meet SDMI
specifications, they would not be able to play the newest music _
either downloaded from the Internet or ``ripped'' from compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   What has made the issue so pressing from a music industry
perspective is that the downloading of music from the Internet has
gathered momentum. College students in particular, a huge music
audience, have taken advantage of the Internet to trade, download
and listen to music online in a format called MP3, opening both a
massive opportunity and a potential Achilles' heel for music
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The great fear of the music industry _ and of some musicians _
is that the existing MP3 technology makes it possible for people to
trade and distribute music freely, in blatant violation of
copyright laws and possibly costing the companies tens of millions
of dollars in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   The industry in turn regards the portable players as the
paraphernalia of music piracy because people will theoretically
have even more incentive to pirate music if they can copy, store
and play it on easy-to-use portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry's trump card is its vast catalogs of
popular music. Its promise to make this content available over the
Internet is what has lured the device manufacturers to cooperate in
SDMI. Without the content, the conventional wisdom goes, the market
for the devices will not thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Both the recording and consumer electronics industries expressed
optimism in June that they would meet the Christmas target. At the
time, a coalition of more than 100 companies from the two
industries agreed to the first SDMI specifications, which were
designed to eventually preclude the portable devices from playing
pirated music in the MP3 format. That first specification, called
Phase I, stopped short of preventing piracy but would have enabled
the players to be upgraded once the record industry settled on a
secure format for the delivery of music.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, these Phase I compatible players would screen
incoming music and prevent the devices from playing illegally
obtained songs. But despite the agreement in principle to Phase I
specifications, SDMI did not settle on the Aris screening
technology until Nov. 12. And, in fact, the final contract is not
slated to be signed with Aris until the Dec. 1 meeting in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The delays were so great that when Creative Labs begins selling
its Nomad II sometime in the first quarter next year, it will not
initially be Phase I compatible. To make it compatible, consumers
will eventually need to download software from the Internet, though
it is not entirely clear what incentive consumers will have to
download the software. The same is true of players expected from
Sanyo, Toshiba and Sharp, among others.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opponents of SDMI, which has been criticized as a
record industry initiative to maintain control of music
distribution, contend that the latest delays underscore much larger
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``SDMI is dead _ it's dead as a door nail,'' said Robert Kohn,
chairman and cofounder of emusic.com, an online music site that
sells songs in MP3 format. ``There's no document from which any of
these companies can develop specifications. They've developed a
framework, not specifications.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The music companies themselves are facing delays, partly because
of SDMI delays and partly because of technical logistics in
preparing their music for online distribution. Laurie Jakobsen, a
spokeswoman for Sony Music Entertainment, which now offers limited
downloads of music for promotional purposes, said that Sony would
be pushing back commercial distribution of music online ``because
of SDMI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do more as soon as there are players out there,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Samit, senior vice president for new media for EMI Records,
said there were also simple, practical matters to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the record companies have discovered that
they must explore how and whether each artist contract permits the
distribution of music over the Internet. ``We're going as fast we
can,'' he said. ``We are moving through mounds of paper.''

SURVEY FINDS RESISTANCE TO E-SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES  
 ON THE DIGITAL EDGE WITHOUT VIDEOS OR ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merchants with high hopes for peddling cashmere and embroidered
denim jeans on the Web this season and into the future may be in
for a shock. Nearly half the Internet users in a recent survey said
they never planned to buy clothing online, according to NPD, a
market-research company based in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, this aversion to making clothing purchases on the
Web extends not only to Internet users who have never bought
clothing online but even to those users with years of experience,
NPD said. More than 40 percent of experienced Web users in the
survey _ many of whom had bought a fashion item online and had a
good experience _ said they would avoid buying apparel on the Web
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting up a yellow flag here,'' said Mike Hand,
president of NPD apparel services. ``We thought apparel would be
$13 billion a year by 2003 on the Web, which is the equivalent of
catalog. Now I don't think it is going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is based on information collected online in
August from a sample of 2,399 people selected as representative of
the United States' Web users, found that consumers' reservations
about buying apparel online have been difficult to overcome.
Eighty-five percent of those polled for the NPD study said they
were concerned about not being able to try on the clothing before
buying it; return policies were an issue for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far the retailers that are most successful at receiving
online sales are specialty sites that focus just on clothing, like
Gap.com or LandsEnd.com, according to NPD. Sites like Comcast's
QVC.com or Federated's Macys.com, which have many product
categories, may attract more visitors. But nearly three-quarters of
consumers polled for the study said they had made their most recent
online apparel purchase at a specialty site.
</P>
<P>
   The study also supported the growing notion that the Web might
be most effective as an adjunct to _ not a replacement for _
brick-and-mortar selling. Almost half the online buyers said their
most recent purchase of clothing from the Internet was made in
addition to purchases made off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is hardly stealing apparel sales away from
traditional stores,'' Hand said. ``To the contrary, one of the main
reasons for buying clothing online, besides convenience, is because
consumers cannot find the items in regular stores.''

   A Night on the Digital Edge Without Videos or Ice Cream
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a simple enough way to spend a Saturday night in New
York: cross the new frontier in digital home delivery by ordering
two videos and a pint of ice cream from Kozmo.com, the Web site
that has reaped abundant publicity by promising to zip videos to
your doorstep in under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6:45 p.m. on Nov. 13, Kozmo's home page had a notice
saying the site would be down until 8 p.m. for an upgrade. New York
consumers rarely get what they want on the first try anyway, so it
seemed natural to try UrbanFetch.com, a new, competing digital
delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   UrbanFetch sent an e-mail whizzing right back saying that ``L.A.
Confidential,'' ``The Americanization of Emily'' and a pint of
Starbucks Coffee Vanilla Cashew Crunch would arrive between 7 and 8
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But when 8:30 passed without videos _ but with visions of soupy
ice cream _ a phone query seemed in order. The UrbanFetch
customer-service man said that Kozmo's problems meant that his
company was deluged with orders and was having trouble meeting
demand. But no need to worry: The videos had been dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   A quick check of Kozmo.com, meanwhile, found a new notice saying
that the site would be down until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   When the UrbanFetch order had not arrived by 10:30 p.m., an
attempt to cancel by telephone and e-mail got no immediate
response. The delivery man eventually materialized around 10:50
p.m., some four hours after the order had been placed. He wasn't
admitted to the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't strive to run our business this way,'' Ross
Stevens, the chief executive for UrbanFetch.com, wrote in an
unsolicited e-mail that arrived the next day. ``The reality is that
during this start-up phase, a small percentage of our orders are
handled in a less than perfect manner, and unfortunately your order
fell into that small group.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are chary about releasing specific numbers, so
the scale of the jumble is unclear. But Alison Bloom, a spokeswoman
for Kozmo.com, said that Saturday-night customers usually generated
from 1,000 to 1,500 orders and upward. Mary Maselli, a spokeswoman
for UrbanFetch, would say only that its orders doubled on Nov. 13
and that the usual standard of 99 percent of deliveries meeting the
one-hour delivery deadline had been lower that night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kozmo.com upgrade, which had begun at 3 a.m. that Saturday,
was finally completed the next day. Joseph Park, Kozmo.com's chief
executive, said the company gave $5 discount coupons to more than
10,000 customers who tried to log on from the cities it serves:
Boston, New York, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle. The
upgrade was designed to ease the flow of orders on the single Web
site that handles all five cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably a trying thing for some of our customers to go
to Blockbuster to rent a video,'' Park said. ``They really depend
on us for delivery in under an hour.''

FINAL GRADES ARE READY ON YEAR 2000 READINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government is going to get a respectable report
card, with plenty of A's, when the House subcommittee tracking Year
2000 preparations issues what it calls its final grades Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason things look so rosy is that the subcommittee has
decided not to issue grades for more than 40 vital government
programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. As the committee sees
it, many programs dependent on the states and private organizations
are not completely ready for the transition to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the kind of programs that affect everyone,'' said
Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Government Management, Information and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, who was president of California State University at Long
Beach and then a professor there before running for Congress,
instituted the grading system to draw attention to the potential
disaster facing many government agencies when he first began
investigating Year 2000 computer concerns in 1996. Many agencies
had no plan for dealing with potential problems. In fact, two
cabinet heads had never even heard of the issue, according to Horn.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a year ago, the government's overall grade was a
D. But the grades rose steadily as agency after agency reported
completion of its repair work, testing and development of
contingency plans. As the A's began to pile up, the subcommittee
shifted some of its focus to a gaping hole in its oversight effort:
the preparedness of state governments and private organizations
that the federal government relies on to provide federal money,
services and regulatory enforcement to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the subcommittee issued separate grades for the
first time to the agencies for the readiness of 43 programs
designated ``high impact'' by the Office of Management and Budget.
Suddenly, agencies sporting A and B ratings for their own work
found themselves on the defensive about state or private programs
rated D or F with only a few months left until the Year 2000
rollover. The fact that the problems were not at the federal level
was not considered an acceptable excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report will make it clear, though, that the expanded
grading proved to be more trouble than it was worth. Often, the
poor grade reflected incomplete readiness around the country where
services are delivered rather than substantial evidence of actual
Year 2000 vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the subcommittee is simply classifying
programs as ready or not, Horn said. The subcommittee report will
point out some worries that were not highlighted three months ago,
including concern about the readiness of owners of public housing
raised by a recent survey by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

HELPING WEB USERS FIND THE LOWEST ONLINE PRICES

can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-commerce companies have enough to worry about when it comes to
competitive pricing, as Internet shoppers can visit
price-comparison sites like mySimon and DealTime.com to search for
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shoppers do not even have to click away to another site to
find better prices. Several companies have developed a new breed of
so-called agents _ software tools that work with Web browser
software, offering shoppers better deals on whatever merchandise
they happen to be viewing on a Web page. For an off-line analogy,
imagine someone infiltrating the checkout line at OfficeMax and
telling people they can save money on the same products at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Agent companies like ClickTheButton, DealPilot and R U Sure have
developed software that scans various shopping sites for price and
delivery data, then sorts it (most often by price). In some cases,
the agents also gather information about product availability,
shipping costs and the length of time it takes to receive the item.
</P>
<P>
   Once a user has downloaded software from one of these agent
services, though, the software is activated any time the Web
browser is open. Someone surfing the Web with ClickTheButton, for
instance, sees a bull's-eye icon in the corner of the screen. By
clicking on this icon while viewing a Web page about a particular
product, a price comparison page appears listing competitors'
prices for the item.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while a user was on an Amazon.com page featuring the
book ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' a ClickTheButton
search yielded price information from 15 retailers. Six of them,
including Amazon, offered the book for about $9, plus $3 for
shipping. One site, 1Bookstreet.com, offered the book for $10.77,
with no charge for United Parcel Service ground shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Such results essentially mirror those of shopping comparison
sites, but there are two fundamental differences between the
browser-based services and the shopping comparison sites. First,
the browser-based agents typically monitor a shopper's habits,
thereby allowing the services to make relevant offers at the right
moment. Second, merchants do not have to pay to be included in at
least two of these services _ a significant departure from shopping
comparison sites, which generally charge merchants fees to be
listed in prime positions.
</P>
<P>
   And although one might expect merchants to mount a
counter-assault against technologies that effectively hijack their
sites, Internet retailers have reacted to them with a surprising
air of resignation. ``These things are both intriguing and a little
bit scary,'' said Michelle Rubin, director of affiliate marketing
for the music seller CDNow. ``I think they will become more
sophisticated in the future, to give consumers a fuller picture of
what's important at a store beyond prices. But right now it's a
very freewheeling, competitive environment out there, and it's just
hard to stop stuff like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, was even more sanguine. ``We're
comfortable with people making price comparisons, and qualitative
comparisons as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the current rate of consumer adoption, at least, Amazon
and its competitors may not have much to worry about.
ClickTheButton.com is among the oldest of the bunch, having rolled
out in March. It now has over 100,000 active users, Cheyenne
Ehrlich, the company's chief executive, said in an interview last
week. ``But we just started our marketing campaign this week,'' he
said, adding that the company's goal is to obtain 2 million users
by the end of next March.
</P>
<P>
   ClickTheButton scans information from 233 of the most visited
retailers in six categories: books, electronics, hardware and
software, movies, music and toys. Users download the software _ a
process that takes less than a minute on a 56-kilobit modem _ and
register with the company so it can monitor the user's shopping
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said the company made money from a few different
sources, including referral fees from some retailers that obtain
customers through ClickTheButton. Given the wealth of data the
company can collect about its users, ClickTheButton could
conceivably gorge itself at the trough of dot-com advertising, but
Ehrlich said it would abstain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take this data in aggregate and maybe tell Amazon where to
price their goods in order to get a certain percentage of people to
move from Barnes &AMP; Noble, but I don't want ads,'' he said.
``Nothing we do will let companies get back to users.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new company, Dash, has a somewhat different approach.
The company takes advantage of retailer affiliate programs, which
pay referral fees to sites that funnel sales their way. Dash
essentially serves as an intermediary: A software tool directs
shoppers to Dash's partner retailers, and Dash collects referral
fees whenever a purchase is made at one of its 100 or so partner
sites. Dash then passes those fees back to consumers with a monthly
check.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when someone is shopping for goods on the Gap.com,
a message will appear on the toolbar at the bottom of the browser
telling users that they can ``save 5 percent when you shop at
J.Crew instead.'' Users can then click directly to J.Crew's site
and shop as they would normally, knowing they eventually will get a
5 percent rebate check from Dash.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, if Gap signs up with Dash, J.Crew and other competitors
will not be permitted to display competing coupons when the user is
on Gap's site. At any time, however, users can click an icon on the
toolbar and view the savings available through competitors in the
Dash network.
</P>
<P>
   According to Daniel Kaufman, Dash's chief executive, the service
capitalizes on both the greed and the fears of merchants. ``The
greed factor is that any company loves the idea of advertising at a
competitor's checkout aisles,'' he said. ``The fear factor is that
if they don't work with us, their customers will see a competitor's
ads. In the end, fear and greed overcomes the negative effect of
paying a discount on every sale.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company earns referral fees from retailers in addition to
what it pays back to consumers, Kaufman said, and by allowing
companies to target users with specific offers. ``If I'm United
Airlines, I can target someone who flies to Orlando four times a
month, business class, on American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman hastened to add that merchants ``never know who is
getting a message,'' since Dash is the conduit. As with most of the
other browser-based shopping comparison services, Dash posts a
lengthy privacy policy on its site. (Dash hired Jason Catlett, a
well-known privacy advocate, to develop its privacy policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are mixed on the promise these technologies hold.
``Give them credit for the idea,'' said Melissa Bane, an e-commerce
analyst with Yankee Group. ``But the trick here is to get people to
download these things. That's still a real barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Orton, chief strategist for Cognitiative, a consulting firm,
was more skeptical. ``People go to a site for a reason, and to be
sold off of that in the middle of the experience is not a likely
scenario,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman of Dash is predictably optimistic that both consumers
and merchants will warm to this technology. ``This is perhaps the
best way for consumers to capture value when shopping,'' he said,
noting that the service has 20,000 users after just two weeks in
business. As for Dash's relationship with retailers, Kaufman said
partner merchants could enjoy sizable sales advantage over
competitors. ``So we're in a pretty serious love-fest right now.''

 Adobe kit the ultimate for Web page design  
 By Jack Warner   
 c.1999 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you intend to go into Web site production in a big
way, consider a new Adobe package called Web Collection, built
around the firm's redoubtable Photoshop image-control program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Photoshop 5, the collection includes Illustrator
8, for creating your own drawings and images, ImageStyler for
creating even fancier objects and GoLive, Adobe's Web page editor.
</P>
<P>
   For most folks, this package constitutes major overkill. It is
intended for professionals, and one way or another it will do
everything imaginable in terms of creating a Web page or a major
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who haven't been into computers for long, or
haven't been paying attention, Adobe Systems sprang to life within
the Macintosh world with its venerable page layout program
PageMaker and is still centered there. All these programs have been
ported to the PC system for years now, but for PC users the
dichotomy will present a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Adobe programs don't use a second mouse button,
let alone a third, is not so bothersome as the manuals, which are
exceedingly complete but intended to serve both masters. Thus, many
of the instructions are issued twice _ here's how you do it on the
PC, and here's how you do it on the Mac. This inevitably becomes
confusing and also accounts to a degree for the bulky manuals. The
problem seems somewhat more obvious in GoLive, perhaps because this
is its first appearance in the Windows world.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop, which is by far and away the most popular of
professional photograph manipulation programs, and Illustrator have
been around for a long time, as their version numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Since GoLive is new to to the PC platform and is, after all, the
program that will be used to get all the fancy pictures up and
running on the Internet, I concentrated on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a former Mac-only program called GoLive CyberStudio,
acquired by Adobe to give it an entry in the high-end Web design
field.
</P>
<P>
   The layout of a page in GoLive is much more like working in a
standard layout program than any site editor I've used. The page
construction screen uses a grid for precise layout and as an
alternative offers to set up columns and rows as the user wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Images and text can be dragged and dropped from various
palettes. It offers a dozen working JavaScript functions and a
movie editor (for Quicktime flicks) for enhancing a page with
action.
</P>
<P>
   Like its companion pieces, GoLive is an enormous and complex
program. Inevitably, complexity steepens the learning curve, and
GoLive's is steep indeed. The manual runs over 400 pages, and it
will be fairly dog-eared before a serious user is fully comfortable
with the program. In the course of it, the user can expect to
become more familiar with HTML code operations, which underly all
Web pages, than with most lower-end programs. That, of course, is
to be expected also.
</P>
<P>
   GoLive is a direct challenge to Microsoft's FrontPage, and while
it may very well do more _ I haven't looked at FrontPage's last
couple of iterations _ it is not as intuitive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, GoLive costs about $300. The powerhouse, four-program
Web Collection runs over $1,000.

 In diagnosing computer woes, start with last change made  
 By Bill Husted   
 c.1999 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If your television broke down as often as most
computers, you'd have a lot more quality time to spend with your
family.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail from across the country, half of which
asks for advice on how to fix something that has gone wrong with a
computer. I'm not a computer genius, but even if I were, I'd have a
hard time fixing these problems remotely. I'm in the same position
as an auto mechanic who gets a phone call demanding to know what's
wrong when the family car makes a chuga-woo-chercuck noise as it
goes up steep hills.
</P>
<P>
   There are some methods you can use at home that will help you
find _ and maybe even fix _ some computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know about computers is that _ unlike with
your car _ the most likely suspect is not a hardware failure.
Obviously it happens, but it's not the best assumption to start
with. Instead, start by being a detective. Think back to the last
change you made to your computer before it began to malfunction.
Anything from a new computer program, to an updated browser, to a
new modem or scanner, or even changes to an existing program can be
(and often is) the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine at work recently profited by that type of
thinking. His printer stopped working. He fussed and fooled and
fulminated with settings and controls until he walked away and
started thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered that he had just installed a new word
processor. There is no logical reason that should cause a printer
to stop working, but it was his best clue. So he removed the word
processor (using the Windows uninstall program you'll find under
the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel).
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't know why the word processor (WordPerfect)
caused the problem, but he doesn't care. Unless you are a computer
technician, you probably shouldn't care either. He just knows his
computer works OK now, and he will call Corel, the publisher of
WordPerfect, to get advice on how to reinstall the word processor
correctly. He has important information in hand. He knows what is
wrong. Without that information, it's impossible to fix a lamp, a
car or a computer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be times _ plenty of them _ when you can't find a
logical suspect for the computer's behavior. You'll swear nothing
has changed, and you'll want to blame something trendy like a
virus. Viruses are real but _ at least in my experience _ they
aren't the most likely cause of an unknown problem. But if you want
to reduce the odds that a virus is the culprit, get a good
anti-virus program and use it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've ruled out a recent change in your computer and a
virus, what do you do next?
</P>
<P>
   The smart next step is to go to the Device Manager you'll find
under the System icon to see if Windows can help. In many cases, it
will flag a conflict between two devices (when two gizmos try to
share the same computer address they make cruddy roommates). If you
find an exclamation mark like this ! beside a device, that's an
excellent clue. Windows has a help feature that will guide you
through fixing the problem it finds (although I'll have to admit
that the prose is pretty thick if you aren't a techie).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if all else fails, consider reinstalling Windows.
Sometimes things get so messed up that only a reinstall will fix
them (unless you have the time and the skill to pinpoint the
problem).
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest editing a file that Windows calls the
Registry, but I shy away from that. But since I am not always
right, my advice is to read a good book on Windows (something other
than the manual that comes with it) and make up your own mind when
it comes to editing the Registry file (which keeps track of almost
every setting in your computer).
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, do as a good physician would. Don't try
something that can make something worse. If you're stuck and in
over your head, do one thing. Call an expert and get some help.

Microsoft continues innovative streak with new real-time game 
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Microsoft _ it continues to
revolutionize gaming with its quality peripherals and great games.
So what if its latest, Age of Empires II ($50 for the PC), is yet
another in a long line of real-time strategy games? The company
gets it right, improving upon a great product and introducing
compelling campaigns, including a brilliant William Wallace
training scenario and the rise of Joan of Arc. While Age of Empires
took you through the beginnings of civilization, Age of Empires II
propels you from the fall of Rome to the Middle Ages. The game's
got better intelligence, more tactical options and better stories.
One of the truly best empire-building games around.

<P>
   _ Madden football is like Thanksgiving leftovers. No matter what
you do, you know it's coming, and you know there's nothing you'll
be able to do about it. For the past few years, PC football games
have improved dramatically in graphics and game-play, led by folks
like EA Sports. This year's Madden 2000 ($40) is graphics- and
feature-rich, but unfortunately it just can't compete with the
intuitiveness and game-play of some of its console brethren.
Multiplayer and updated stats are standard fare for Madden games,
but 2000 has a few new features, such as an arcade mode that
emulates NFL Blitz. Harder hits and tired ``edgy'' commentary,
however, don't add up to Blitz's fun. And the game is glitchy,
causing strange crashes and errors on some 3dfx graphics cards and
often inexplicably starting the game with teams different than
those you selected. The graphics are ho-hum and the game-play
hasn't advanced much from last year. With games like Sega's amazing
NFL2K blazing trails on the console side, this may not be the best
year for Madden pound cake.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know, the first Nyko Scorpion Playstation controller
($30) I was sent had a screw missing in the handle. The apologies
were profuse and I was immediately sent another one (they assured
me it was an anomaly). Workmanship aside, this is an amazing
controller. If you're like me, you've been complaining about the
size of the Playstation controller since it came out. The Sony dual
shock controller added some heft, but it was still pretty small in
the hand. Nyko has worked to eradicate that with the Scorpion. The
controller is wider (looking like a cross between a stingray and
Klingon battle cruiser) and fits in the hand better. Also, the
controller puts those hard-to-reach R2, L2 buttons within reach,
which really helps on the sports games. The controller also comes
with turbo (speeds things up) and slow (exactly what it sounds
like) modes for the cheater in you. (www.nyko.com)

Barney gets in on bongo act 
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's amazing that anything with Barney's mug on
it still exists. There was a time where the purple dinosaur
inspired rage and social backlash. Now, it's the opposite. Barney
is back in favor, in part because of cool toys such as Barney's
Song Magic Bongos ($30). The Magic Bongos play 11 songs on five
different instruments. All kids have to do is pick their song (i.e.
``Farmer in the Dell'' among others) and an instrument, ranging
from a steel drum to a hooting organ sound, and start bonging away.
Each hit yields a note and, following that principle, a bunch of
notes/hits play a song. This toy is great for those creative kids
just starting to attain their dexterity, and is also good for
celebrities who insist on dancing around their homes naked.

   Bugs Bunny has a problem. On the way to Albuquerque he finds a
time machine. That's not the bad part. The bad part is that he
tries to use it and gets lost in time. In Infogrames' Bugs Bunny:
Lost in Time ($30, for the Playstation), that wascaly wabbit must
travel through five different eras in order to get back to the
present. Along the way, he meets up with favorites such as Elmer
Fudd, Witch Hazel, Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian. If nothing
else, this game teaches the kiddies that you shouldn't play with
time machines.

<P>
   SAY 'UNCLE'
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Albert is a little touched in the head (we'll just
euphemistically call him ``eccentric''), but boy is it fun to poke
around in his stuff! In Uncle Albert's Magical Album ($30, PC and
Mac), you can look through Albert's scrapbook and piece together an
assortment of puzzles by flipping through pages and putting items
in the right places; if you find a key you can unlock the
rocketship game and go on a space journey. Find the picture of the
champ and you can play in the stadium. The game, a best-seller in
France, is handily adapted to the U.S. and runs on Windows PCs and
Macs. It features many small films, eight individual games and a
host of animal friends to play with. (www.vtechsoft.com/album.html)

   BRAINS, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember those family vacations when mom and dad would
pack up the kids and a Styrofoam cooler full of bologna sandwiches
and store-brand cola, heading off at 5 a.m. for parts unknown? Do
you fondly recall pelting your parents with countless questions en
route to your destination?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Brain Quest series ($30, PC and Mac) lets your own
kids take that trip, albeit virtually, as tagalongs with the
Perdido family in its brain-powered vacation van. Better the
Perdido's than you, eh? ``Alas,'' you think, ``my kids are getting
their question-and-answer fix somewhere else. Our trips to the
grocery store will be peaceful and question-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And the computerized queries go well beyond the classic, ``Are
we there yet?'' In fact, the engaging program quizzes kids with
thousands of puzzlers in math, science, language arts and social
studies, each grade-tailored correct answer moving the van forward
toward their reward: a postcard of the Perdidos at their vacation
destination.
</P>
<P>
   With an Internet connection, Brain Quest variations include
multiplayer game modes and help with answers via the World Book
online encyclopedia. For a fee, extra game packs with more
questions can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, beware: Each Brain Quest title includes a booklet of
bound cards with trivia questions on all 50 states, meaning the
Q-and-A can continue far away from the keyboard. Better brush up on
your U.S. trivia _ looks like those shopping trips won't be so
peaceful after all.

Putting on your PC 
By Ernest Holsendolph  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thad Starner, one of the stars in the Georgia Tech
College of Computing, is easily recognized wherever he goes _ on
the campus or around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He is, depending on his operating base that day, the cool dude
in the computer glasses, or that nerd who wears his computer and
thinks everybody should. Either way, it's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   Starner, 30, has worn his computer virtually 24/7 since Dec. 11,
1996, when he was a student in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology media lab. He has become a national, yea, even an
international guru on wearable computers.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is not the only apostle, he is dubbed the pioneer by
the Financial Times of London and by other observers far and near.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to wear it, mostly because it makes more sense than a
desk computer,'' says Starner.
</P>
<P>
   You get his point when you learn that his wearable computer with
the viewing screen just an inch from his left eye allows him to
send and receive e-mail, browse the Internet or just read _ while
at the same time doing other duties, or just lying in the grass in
a park. He used the wearable computer to write his 250-page
doctoral thesis, astonishing when you consider the complex format,
footnotes, cross-references and minutiae that accompany such a
formal text.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing screen has remarkable clarity.
</P>
<P>
   With his computer in a pocket or in a shoulder bag, and sending
messages via his Twiddler, a nine-button, one-hand keyboard that
looks like an ocarina, Starner is in touch with a bottomless pool
of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview the other day, he startled me by addressing me
as if my life were an open book: ``Congratulations on your award
announced the other day ... that's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to me, my life WAS an open book. Even though he was
looking at me, he was also perusing a file of information about me
by way of his eye-level computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea Thad Starner is at one with his apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   His mission in life, Starner said, is to see the day a billion
people may be online, connected in wireless communication as he is
with his community of cyborg friends, as well as the rest of us on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be made possible by common, inexpensive pocket
computers, sophisticated enough to combine in one device all our
familiar things _ the calendar, the watch, the computer, the cell
phone and the word processor, all with wireless communication
capability,'' Starner said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it will be so basic that it can connect to
peripherals of your choice _ music player, video cameras or
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Starner, the evangelist, talk about his wireless
wearable computer:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is already much more than a computer as we usually
understand it. For instance, I read better on this computer than I
do using books. You know how reading in bed can be difficult,
trying to wrestle your way into a comfortable position with five
pounds of pages?
</P>
<P>
   ``With my computer, I read electronic versions of books lying in
bed at night, after my wife is asleep, there quietly in the
darkness. ... I format the pages so the lines are equal to my
reading style, which helps me to read fast and comfortably. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to bend down the pages to mark a favorite
passage. You do that electronically, or copy it and file it or
share it with somebody in an e-mail, all right there in the quiet
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have academic meetings, they like to make me the
secretary. I take notes as we go, highlighting what is important,
and when the meeting is over I offer everybody a copy of the
minutes, which I download to the printer in the room. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``No, my wife does not wear a computer, but in me she has a good
executive assistant. ... When she runs across something, a passage
in a book or whatever, she asks me to `file it,' and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The family that computes together ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his wearable computer is like a member of the family,
with special needs, all of which Starner has learned to
accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us 'borgs, the battery is a main concern,'' Starner
said. ``This is my approach. When I sleep, my battery sleeps; when
I eat, my battery eats (gets a charge). And that way we are both
ready at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal wearable computer, which Starner said could be as much
as two decades away, will be a machine that understands commands in
context, probably by voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be able to say `remind me about my meeting with Jonas
Tuesday at 3:30 at the office ... and let's include Fran and
Jennifer and Mark,' and the machine will know which Tuesday and the
place and the identity of Fran and Jennifer and Mark and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example, someone may place a call via the Internet,
only to have the machine say, ``Sorry, Thad is teaching right now,
but he has been waiting to talk to you. ... Please call back at
3:30, when he should have some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today Starner says he often boards a plane to keep an
appointment in another city with no record of specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can access a file at any time, either my
calendar or an e-mail message, that tells me exactly the time and
place and who will meet me or whatever,'' Starner said.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of steps between today's equipment and the point
where computers understand us and what we want in context, Starner
said, but that system will take shape, bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   He did not add that even though he foresees 20 years in the
development, these things occur at an accelerating pace.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it ever occurred to him to wear a computer, Starner
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in ninth grade when I asked my father for an answer to
a trigonometry question. He said that, even though he used trig
every day, he had forgotten much of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, I couldn't understand how my father could have
forgotten such useful training. I learned the value of staying in
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first idea that the interface might be interesting was when
watching a science fiction movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Starner is operating personally on the edge of science
fiction, and always in touch.

FileMaker Pro database program updated for network, Web use 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're an entrepreneur who needs to track clients
or a just a collector desperate for a way to catalog your holdings,
you might take a look at the latest version of FileMaker Pro.
</P>
<P>
   This venerable database program, controlled by Apple, lets you
create everything from client and product lists to CD catalogs,
address books, calendars and invoices _ whatever you need to track.
</P>
<P>
   With version 5.0, you can also share your address book with
others on a network or post a list of products or clients on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Database programs let you store and analyze any kind of
information. With these programs you can total up, say, sales in
the Midwest or every book in your collection written by Kurt
Vonnegut.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker Pro is considered an entry-level database for small
businesses, home users and work groups within a bigger company.
It's designed to be easy-to-use and understand without any
background in programming.
</P>
<P>
   No program meets this standard, but FileMaker Pro is pretty easy
to use and learn compared with most database programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with lots of templates that you can adopt as your
own. Better yet, the Internet and local bulletin boards are full of
templates users have built into FileMaker Pro and distributed for
others to use.
</P>
<P>
   While this program has been around for years, the latest version
includes several new features. For one, FileMaker Pro has been
redesigned to look and act more like the programs in Microsoft's
Office suite of software. You'll find menu toolbars and pop-up
context menus that resemble those in Office.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this redesign is to make FileMaker Pro familiar
and useful to a larger audience. Does it work? Only in part,
according to most reviewers. They found the mix of FileMaker Pro
styles and those of Microsoft confusing in spots.
</P>
<P>
   The program also goes too far at times in simplicity, crossing
over into ``dumbed-down.'' In the name of simplicity, for example,
FileMaker Pro includes only six fonts. It's a laborious procedure
to load in more.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any built-in programming language for power users.
That limits FileMaker Pro's appeal for bigger tasks such as running
a company's human resources department, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the program is receiving high marks for many of its
easy-to-use features. It's easy, for example, to create reports and
different ways to analyze and view information. The program walks
users through these things step-by-step through ``assistants,'' a
feature much like Microsoft's Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Another big plus is that, like Microsoft products, FileMaker Pro
works on both the Mac and PC platforms. That means databases
created in one platform will work in the other.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker Pro retails for about $240, with the upgrade selling
for about $100 less.

Portable e-mail units handy 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Not everybody who wants to send and receive
e-mail wants or needs a personal computer. It's possible to have
e-mail with a device that connects to phone lines and a service
that provides e-mail access only.
</P>
<P>
   VTech Industries of Wheeling, Ill., sells several e-mail
products that it says can be used anywhere by simply plugging them
into a telephone jack. Two of the products, e-Mail PostBox and
e-Mail Express, sell for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail Express is designed to be very portable. It measures
6.3-by-3.5 inches and weighs about 7 ounces. It's compact size
limits the size of the keyboard and the LCD viewing screen,
however, so it may be somewhat uncomfortable for some people to
use.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail Express has an address book and calendar and can save
up to 500 messages. It has a ``Smart Dialer'' feature that ensures
you get a local phone rate no matter where you're calling from.
</P>
<P>
   It also has filters to block e-mail you don't want. The device
can be set to accept e-mails only from a list of known senders, so
you won't be flooded with advertisements, and parents can protect
children from receiving adult material.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail PostBox is a desktop model with a few more features
than e-Mail Express. It has a full-size keyboard, but it's still
compact at about 2.2 pounds and 12.4 by 8.2 inches. It also has a

PRINT ARTIST SUITE PACKS NEW FEATURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After writing for so many years about computer programs, I've
almost ceased to be amazed about software.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's surprising how much software publishers can cram
into a box when it comes to desktop publishing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Print Artist Grande Suite 8.0 is an example (Windows; about $60
to $70). The previous version from SierraHome was the top-selling
home-publishing program in 1998 according to PC Data. The new
version has a sophisticated Web-page design program, more than
200,000 graphics and images, and photo shop for manipulating
pictures, a wide selection of animated electronic cards for
e-mailing and an overhauled user interface.
</P>
<P>
   The program can turn out Web pages, cards, crafts, posters,
newsletters, stickers, labels, stationery, business cards,
letterhead, digital albums and Web slide shows.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 10,000 layouts designed by professionals for
the aforementioned projects. Moreover, new users get more help from
a guide that walks them through the process of using the program.
</P>
<P>
   An unlimited number of documents can be opened at one time. It's
a nice feature, but beyond having two or three documents open at
once, one that most users will never need to experience. But it's
easy to drag and drop objects between open documents _ a feature
that makes the program easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right picture to use from the program's 200,000 is
easy enough using a graphics grabber that searches for keywords.
Thumbnail pictures are also available.
</P>
<P>
   SnapShot Express is a sophisticated tool for working with
graphics and has the ability to clean up pictures (cropping,
removing red eyes and other features) and manipulate them.
</P>
<P>
   A step-by-step tutorial gives an overview of the program's ``Web
Studio Express'' for designing Web pages. It, too, contains
professionally designed templates, animations, backgrounds and
other useful tools. One of those tools is ``iCollect,'' which can
pull graphics or entire Web pages off the Internet for use later.
</P>
<P>
   If you need less power at a lower price, Print Artist Gold 8.0
and Print Artist Platinum 8.0 are also available.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call toll free (800-757-7707) or visit the
company's Web site (www.siearrahome.com).
</P>
<P>
   SUPER DUPER ARCADE
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish, SPY Fox and Putt-Putt are comic
characters from Humongous Entertainment computer games. They're all
on one CD with the collection of Humongous' Super Duper Arcade I
and II.
</P>
<P>
   Each CD has four arcade games and will run on either Windows or
Macintosh computers. Each game has hundreds of levels. Each CD
should be available for about $15 to $19.
</P>
<P>
   Super Duper Arcade I contains Putt-Putt and Pep's
Balloon-O-Rama, Pajama Sam's Sock Works, Freddi Fish and Luther's
Water Worries, and SPY Fox in Cheese Chase. Super Duper Arcade II
has Putt-Putt and Pep's Dog on a Stick, Pajama Sam's Lost and
Found, Freddi Fish and Luther's Maze Madness. All seven of those
titles are previously released. The fourth game on Arcade II is SPY
Fox in ``Hold the Mustard,'' a new release in which SPY Fox hurries
to save the world's supply of ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the games have game editors so kids can create and swap
new levels. For younger children, the ``Junior Helper'' feature
found in some of the games slows down the action to give younger
players a better chance.

CELEBRITIES CAUGHT UP IN NET PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not about trashing celebrities. It's about celebrity
trash _ as in Gary Coleman's bowling shoes and Drew Barrymore's
baby clothes, the sort of stuff that mere humans usually cart off
to the thrift shop or consign to sleep with the mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   These and other sundries are available for auction on the Web,
part of the latest ``dot com'' craze. Haunted by debts and/or
parole officers, onetime celebrities (or, in some cases, their
mothers) are flocking to the Internet to raise money or to
resurrect flagging careers. Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, fresh
from her stay in a West Coast penitentiary, is selling it on line;
this time around, though, she's peddling sportswear and autographed
photos. Monica Lewinsky has an on-line boutique, and Drew
Barrymore's mother, Jaid Barrymore, is auctioning off her estranged
daughter's clothing and other items at www.gavelnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman, whose claim to fame was his role in the '78-85
sitcom ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' is probably the only former child
star to be the centerpiece of his very own Web-a-thon, a new
concept in self-promotion. The site is the brainchild of UGO
Networks, a New York-based Web company that runs sites geared at
18- to 34-year-old males. UGO Staffers read about Coleman's
financial woes and decided to raise money for the actor on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Coleman site, at http://webathon.ugo.com, is a sort of mock
tribute to the 4-foot-8-inch actor. A timeline details his trials
and tribulations, including his lawsuit against his parents, his
recent arrest for an altercation with a fan, and his declaration of
bankruptcy in August.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who was once worth $18 million, smiles cheerfully on
the site, imploring visitors to ``Save me.'' Folks can either
donate money to help the financially strapped actor or bid on his
leather couch (current bid, $307.50), his bowling ball ($86), and
his ice scraper (a steal at $25.50). The site features ``Gary
Grooves,'' a variation on the Dancing Baby, and offers a contest in
which users can win a $1,000 shopping spree with ``Gary as your
shopping elf.'' There are also ``audition tapes'' and recordings of
Coleman allegedly practicing phone sex in an earlier career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's all scripted,'' a breathless Coleman said, during a
cell-phone conversation as he boarded a plane in New York. ``Don't
take any of that seriously. Jesus, what has happened to people's
funny bones these days?''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that turns Coleman into a virtual pet, users can feed,
punish, or heal the troubled star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the site is absolutely wonderful,'' Coleman said.
``It's going to be nice to make money, but I am also interested in
breaking into the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Robinson, chairman of UGO Networks, insists that Coleman
will receive every single penny raised on the site. ``It's not a
moneymaking venture. It's not a scam,'' Robinson said. ``Gary has
been working in a video store, and this is getting him some
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also garnering publicity for UGO Networks, Robinson admits.
``It's good for everyone,'' he said. ``It's not as if we're doing
this for Donald Trump.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's an idea: If the trend continues, it's only a matter
of time before one or more of the Donald's exes start auctioning
off his stuff on line. Barrymore's mother, after all, doesn't have
any problem selling off her daughter's stuff, including the red
cowboy hat that Drew, then 6, wore in ``E.T.'' The bidding on the
hat hit $49,500 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Why sell this stuff? ``Drew is such a special, amazing person,''
Jaid Barrymore told the Associated Press. ``I decided to put some
of her things up on the Web to allow people to be part of Drew's
life.'' How sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Web users can also be a part of the lives of other former
celebrities who have turned to the Net. In a way, Fleiss and
Lewinsky are selling the same thing _ products made under duress.
At www.heidifleiss.com, the former madam is auctioning mugs she
made in prison to calm her nerves because ``the day-to-day
lifestyle was so stressful and hectic.'' The former intern is
selling hand-knit purses and totes at www.therealmonica.com:
Learning to knit, she says on the site, was a big ``help in getting
through a time of high anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, apparently, didn't take up a craft to relieve
stress. But that hasn't stopped her from starting a Web site to
raise money for her legal defense fund. She's shamelessly
soliciting donations at www.lindatripp.com.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coleman is turning himself into an on-line poster
child. ``It's not demeaning,'' says Robinson. ``He's poking fun of
the media. Look at what he's done. He's got the whole nation
watching now, so who is winning? Who is poking fun of whom?''

ON-LINE SHOPPING GROWS, BUT CATALOGS STILL RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PAUL GRONDAHL   
 c.1999 Albany Times Union   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has got a high gee-whiz factor, the stores never close and
you can shop till your browser crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But is on-line shopping for the holidays an easier, better,
safer alternative to schlepping to a mall or ordering from that
stack of catalogs overflowing your mailbox this time of year?
</P>
<P>
   Depends on what you seek from a ``dot com'' experience. Choice
is not an issue. There are thousands of companies selling
merchandise online _ type in the name of your favorite store
followed by .com and voila! _ and the temptation to buy can be
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   American consumers are expected to spend a record $9.5 billion
by shopping on the Internet this holiday season, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Consumer Reports concluded in a 13-page ``Holiday.shop''
special report in its November issue that on-line shopping Web
sites have a downside. They can be vague when it comes to security
and shipping costs; inventory can be thin; navigating page after
page of items can be exhausting; and ordering procedures can be
Byzantine.
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to thumb through catalogs or to click your mouse on
the buy icon? Consumer Reports' staff members gave mail-order
catalog shopping the edge over cyber shopping in a head-to-head
competition from 25 companies across a variety of categories: ease
of use, content, shipping and others.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hold a piece of merchandise in your hands _ and
not just view it on a computer screen _ before you buy it, nothing
can compare with reality-based shopping in an actual store.
</P>
<P>
   Although you will pay in time and transportation costs, you will
be spared the high fees for shipping and handling of goods
purchased on line _ quite often 30 to 50 percent of the cost of the
product tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   And for conspiracy theorists or the merely moderately paranoid,
cyber shopping is fraught with privacy issues. Web merchants
routinely track a consumer's movements across a site, time spent on
each page, which photos are viewed, buying patterns and other
nuances.
</P>
<P>
   The data are analyzed, sold or swapped with other companies for
solicitation opportunities via e-mail advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies are clearly concerned about a backlash over
privacy and security. The Goliath Amazon.com, for instance, has a
three-page statement about its complex and confusing privacy
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Let the merchants beware. Consumers are keeping their critical
eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   BizRate.com rates e-business and claims to be objective (on-line
companies can't pay to be listed or featured on its Web site).
Founded in 1996, BizRate.com arrives at its ratings by asking tens
of thousands of consumers to report on their on-line shopping
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints about on-line shopping _ particularly
on-line auctions involving a third party _ have risen sharply in
the past year, according to Joe Mahoney, a spokesman for the New
York Consumer Protection Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because an entity has its own Web site does not mean it
has been checked for consumer reliability,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   And in terms of aesthetics, is the on-line shopping experience
as meaningful, as, say, fueling up first with a double latte amid
fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies before strolling the aisles of
your favorite bookstore or clothing boutique and sampling a product
in a tactile way before purchase?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, for millions of e-shoppers, for whom time and
geography are problematic, buying through the Internet is an
efficient alternative.
</P>
<P>
   On-line shopping taken to the next level involves
price-comparison services called bots (short for robots).
Essentially, they level the playing field between buyers and
sellers by offering lightning-quick price comparisons for a product
among dozens of merchants around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some bots specialize in a certain product, such as computers or
foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty is that online shopping is a growth business.
New companies, bots and ranking services are coming on line daily.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever form you choose _ digital, catalog mail-order or live
and in-person _ happy shopping.
</P>

 &HT;    Luxury inn has a special touch: It's all in the details
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 28.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Anne Landers was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   The innkeeper of the Gastonian _ one of the finest lodgings in
this gracious coastal city _ had attempted to turn on a lamp in the
parlor only to find the bulb shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No big deal,'' said a guest, sipping wine and relaxing after a
long day of shopping and sight-seeing, ``light bulbs burn out all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at four-diamond inns, they don't,'' Landers said.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, the lamp was glowing.
</P>
<P>
   Landers' attention to detail is what distinguishes this
luxurious inn on East Gaston Street, two blocks from sprawling
Forsyth Park. That, along with handsomely decorated rooms with
working fireplaces and luxurious baths, gourmet Southern breakfasts
and one of the most attractive afternoon teas anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Special touches include fresh flowers, bottled water, handmade
pralines on turned-down beds at night and exquisitely soft bed
linens.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's 17 rooms and suites, filled with mostly English
antiques, are in two Regency Italianate mansions built in 1868. A
shared landscaped courtyard connects the two. Inside, the floors
are heart pine, the walls plaster and the woodwork finely wrought.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant Waterford crystal chandelier hangs in the parlor of
the Main House. Here also is a portrait of a pretty young woman of
16 whom Landers identifies as Eileen Richardson. The Englishwoman
was in her 80s when she agreed to sell the portrait of herself to
the inn's former owners with the stipulation that it be prominently
displayed in a grand home.
</P>
<P>
   When Landers purchased the inn in 1996, she says she ``had to
promise that the portrait would always stay in a place of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests hear this story as we nibble on the tasty goodies
prepared by pastry chef Laura Steele, a Culinary Institute of
America graduate who joined the Gastonian staff three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon the dining room table held sun-dried tomato and
basil tea sandwiches, Vidalia onion bites, chocolate truffle-filled
phyllo cups, orange madeleines and strawberry meringues. The next
day, the spread included chocolate chip pecan scones, sun-dried
tomato, basil and ham scones, cucumber sandwiches, lemon tarts and
lime cornmeal cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Even as we indulge ourselves with these tempting tidbits, we
pore over menus and confer with Landers to decide where we'll have
dinner. The concierge calls for reservations, and soon everyone is
out eating again.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, we leave room for the praline.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Rates are $190-$350. Two-night minimum on
weekends. No children under 12. The inn is at 220 E. Gaston St. (at
Lincoln Street). 1-800-322-6603 and on the Web at
www.gastonian.com.

shooting fish in a barrel. Our current favorites are the trendy
bistro Sapphire Grill (110 W. Congress St., 912-443-9962); the
artsy Northern Italian Il Pasticcio (2 E. Broughton St.,
912-231-8888); the Southwestern flair of Tuscon Grill, which offers
killer margaritas and guacamole made tableside (113 E. Broughton
St., 912-233-9669); and updated coastal cuisine in the historic
setting of The Olde Pink House (23 Abercorn St., 912-232-4286).
Lunch surrounded by art and antiques at newcomer Soho South Cafe

</P>
<P>
   For afternoon tea, try the new Tea Room of Savannah (7 E.

 &HT;    A gift you owe yourself: The gracious coastal city of Savannah
dresses up in holiday finery and gets in the yuletide spirit with a
rousing roster of events
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 28.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Forget chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack
Frost nipping at your nose. And don't even think about folks
dressed up like Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
   In this historic coastal city, signs that the holidays have
arrived are a bit more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   A festive wreath hangs from the outstretched hand of the statue
of stern-faced Colonial evangelist John Wesley in Reynolds Square.
The stone swans in Forsyth Square fountain sport jolly red bows
around their slender necks. The Savannah River Queen paddle wheeler
is draped in garlands of greenery. And horse and carriage drivers
don jaunty Santa caps.
</P>
<P>
   Not icicles but Spanish moss drips from ancient live oaks, and
the city's version of the Rockefeller Center ice rink is inside. At
the Savannah Civic Center's exhibition hall, people in jeans and
T-shirts gamely lace up skates and wobble out onto the ice under a
canopy of lights and flanked by a forest of gaily decorated
Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Savannah seems a fine place to find some holiday spirit.
</P>
<P>
   We are here the weekend before Christmas last December to take
in the annual Holiday Tour of Historic Inns and Candlelantern Tours
at Civil War-era Fort Pulaski.
</P>
<P>
   It is unseasonably warm, and we swelter in our holiday sweaters
as we stroll among the 22 squares Saturday afternoon to visit
19th-century inns filled with period and antique furnishings and
lavishly adorned in seasonal finery.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant mansions _ once home to the city's rich and powerful _
and converted cotton warehouses now invite overnight guests to
experience the charms of ``The Hostess City of the South.'' Many
boast ornate fireplaces, heart pine floors and secluded courtyards
where breakfast is served when the weather is nice.
</P>
<P>
   There's a welcome chill in the air Saturday night as we drive
out U.S. 80 east to Fort Pulaski, where it's Dec. 26, 1861. The
spirits of the Confederates are high _ despite trading sporadic
fire with the Yankees at Tybee Island. The war is expected to be
over before these men get a real fight going. Food sent to the
garrison from Savannah is good and plentiful. The fiddle music is
lively, and eager young soldiers still move with spring in their
steps.
</P>
<P>
   We follow lantern-toting guides across the moat into the fort,
where a cannon blast booms through the night. Our Confederate
escort tells us he and his comrades drank eggnog the night before
and ``got tangle-footed.'' We sip mulled cider and nibble cookies
as we sing carols to fiddle and flute accompaniment. The dank rooms
of the fort are prettied up with greenery and fruits. Candles
flicker and a fire burns orange in the hearth.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, there's peace in this winter (if not wintry)
wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   Back in town Sunday morning, worshippers flock to services at
city churches, many founded in the 18th century. Our family climbs
the steps of the circa-1890, twin-spired Wesley Monumental United
Methodist Church on Abercorn Street, around the corner from the
Gastonian inn, where we are staying.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of poinsettias grace the sanctuary. Handbells ring out,
acolytes light the candles, and the choir proceeds down the aisles
singing ``Once in Royal David's City.'' Today's service is the
joyous Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, a series of Scripture
readings interspersed with Advent hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the church, we pause for a moment as brilliant noon
sunlight floods lush Calhoun Square. Another glorious day for
drinking in Savannah's many charms.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a city so beautiful that even match-happy
Gen. Sherman didn't have the heart to torch it. Instead, he
presented it to President Lincoln in 1864 as a Christmas gift.
</P>
<P>
   No finer one could be had.

MANUFACTURERS ADD SUPPLEMENTS TO MORE AND MORE FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For years, supplements have been the standard way
to get extra vitamins and minerals. The newest trend is to use
food, like orange juice, cereals, or pasta, as a way to achieve
specific health benefits, like the prevention of osteoporosis or
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods, as they are called, are among the hottest
items today on supermarket shelves, appealing to health-conscious
consumers who want to maximize the power of good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, the term is most often used to describe modified
foods or ingredients intended to provide health benefits beyond the
nutrients they contain. Today, there are any number of these food
products: soup with echinacea to ward off colds, eggs with Omega-3
to promote heart health, beverages with ginseng for energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong, growing industry,'' said Connie Diekman, a
registered dietitian in St. Louis and a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association. ``The biggest challenge for
consumers is understanding what these foods are and the roles they
play.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easier to do with some functional foods than others,
especially those that come by their health benefits naturally.
Oatmeal is one of those. Research has shown that the fiber in
oatmeal can help lower cholesterol. The science is so strong that
the Food and Drug Administration allows manufacturers to make that
claim on the label.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to soy, and the FDA at the end of October
agreed to let manufacturers say that foods containing soy protein,
in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk
of heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some dietitians argue that fruits and vegetables also fit the
definition of functional foods because they are so naturally packed
with antioxidants believed to fight off certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The tomato, for example, contains lycopene, a substance believed
to be helpful in preventing prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other functional foods do not come by their health benefits
so naturally, fueling controversy over just how these products
ought to be labeled and marketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is at what point do they stop being foods and
become drugs?'' said Anne Rogen, a nutrition professor at the Sage
Colleges, a private liberal arts school in Albany. ``The issue that
the FDA and health experts are grappling with is what can people
say on the label.''
</P>
<P>
   That debate played out last year, with the new
cholesterol-lowering margarine Benecol, which is made with stanol
ester, a natural substance extracted from pine trees. A study by
Mayo Clinic researchers showed that people can reduce their LDL (
or bad cholesterol) by up to 14 percent by eating Benecol.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer of Benecol, McNeil Consumer Products, wanted to
sell the spread as a dietary supplement in groceries alongside
regular butter and margarine. Under the laws that regulate
supplements, the company then could have made the health claim that
the product lowers cholesterol. But the FDA ruled that Benecol is a
food and limited what the company could say on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Yet consumers are likely to see more health claims on food as
functional foods continue to multiply on grocery shelves. The $15
billion annual industry is growing at about 10 percent a year,
outpacing the 2 percent growth of conventional foods.
</P>
<P>
   Dietitians caution that no single food is the answer to good
health, no matter what the label says. And Dr. Clare Hasler,
executive director of the Functional Foods for Health Program at
the University of Illinois at Urbana, reminds consumers that the
best functional foods can already be found in the produce
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's only one change that someone could make to their
diet, it should be eating six to 11 servings of fruits and
vegetables a day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, functional foods have the potential to increase
awareness about the important links between health and food.
``People need to realize they can have control over their health
outcomes and the grocery store is one of the first lines of
</P>
<P>
   defense for doing that,'' Hasler said.

FIREFIGHTERS ARE RINGING ALARM BELLS IN THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Call it fighting fire with fire. Before crew
members on the C shift at Fire Station 44 put out any blazes, they
light a few in their bellies.
</P>
<P>
   The shift starts every third afternoon with a firefighter at the
blender. In goes a can of peeled whole tomatoes, a quarter-onion,
lemon juice, cilantro and two jalapeno peppers. Out comes the hot
sauce _ a fitting food for the people who do a hot job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a tradition to make your own salsa at fire
stations,'' said Capt. Thomas Bullock, the shift supervisor at the
San Antonio station and a 30-year veteran of the fire service.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making generations of firefighters into fire-eaters, the
ritual has inspired a cookbook. A portion of the profits from the
book will benefit victims of fires through the Burned Out Survivors
fund and the University of Texas McDonald Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Sharee Willis, a St. Mary's University law student,
got the idea for ``San Antonio Firehouse Salsa'' from her
boyfriend, a firefighter who repeatedly returned from work still
raving about the daily dish and the variety available in stations
around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really at first thought there can't be that many different
salsas,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   But after visiting nearly half of the city's 47 fire stations,
she had sampled about a dozen dishes and collected more than 40
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hottest is the one prepared by firefighter Brandon
Davis at Station 17 on the city's north side. When a batch goes
into the refrigerator, it has, he said, sometimes been marked with
the warning ``liquid hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, developed with trial, error and the station's spice
rack, calls for 20 serrano peppers. Eating it, Davis said, is not
unlike playing Russian roulette. Depending on the individual
serranos, it can be harmless one time and overpowering the next _
as when it ambushed Davis while he was home watching a ballgame
with some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us could eat it,'' he said. ``We just poured it down
the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recipes create subtle variations on similar
ingredients. Improvisers who stray far from tradition are
remembered with a scornful chuckle, as when Bob West, a firefighter
in Station 1, recalled a colleague dumping sour cream into the
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a milkshake,'' West said. ``He took a lot of
ribbing for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although salsa is like humidity, a staple in this South Texas
city of 1 million, most firefighters said they first learned to
concoct the condiment in firehouse kitchens, not at home.
</P>
<P>
   They cook regularly during shifts that last 24 hours. Some
results are swapped and passed down for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   About three decades ago, when he joined the department, Bullock
knew little about the kitchen and less about the differences
between peppers. Now he talks about how subtle markings on a
jalapeno reveal its hidden heat, like notches on a thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people are from Alabama,'' he said. ``We didn't know about
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, the refrigerators at downtown Station 1
held steak sauce, mustard, ham glaze, all bearing bright brand-name
labels. Only the pulpy red salsa, left half-eaten in a bowl, was
homemade.
</P>
<P>
   Department veteran Juan Herrera explained that, more than a
meal, the salsa is a binding ingredient in the station, a
centerpiece at sit-downs that begin most of his shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a quilting club,'' he said. ``But instead we have a
salsa club.''

   ARTICLES FROM LSAT WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   CRITICS OF JACKSON AT DECATUR IGNORE ONE CENTRAL POINT.
Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., was recently catapulted
into national focus when it expelled seven black male students for
two years because of their involvement in a brawl during a
nighttime football game at the school. The Rev. Jackson deemed the
punishment too harsh and went to Decatur to seek reconsideration _
a much lighter sentence for the youths based upon the absence of
weapons, bloodshed and injury. In this commentary, columnist Vernon
Jarrett supports Jackson's appearance and ponders what might have
happened to these teens had Jackson not gotten involved. ``If
Jackson had not journeyed to Decatur, seven youths, who were never
tried with respect for due process, would have been cut from the
educational process _ maybe permanently,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   A DISGRACEFUL USE OF AN APACHE LEADER. Geronimo, the great
Chiricahua Apache warrior and leader, would spin in his grave if he
knew the U.S. Census Bureau was using his portrait in an
advertising campaign aimed at American Indians, writes columnist
Tim Giago. U.S. Census 2000 hopes to make up for the shortcomings
of the 1990 Census that missed so many people, particularly
minorities. American Indians were among the minority groups that
were miscounted. In this commentary, Giago recounts the life of
Goyathlay (One Who Yawns) _ known to the white man as Geronimo _
who was taken from his homeland in chains because he stood up as a
patriot to defend his people and who died in exile far from his
beloved mountains of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   TRANSLATING TECHNOLOGY. Since the '60s, the demand for more
sophisticated hardware and efficient software has grown faster than
one can say ``DSL,'' writes Benjamin Sun in this excerpt from A.
magazine. New millionaires emerge every day as new technology
companies are launched, bought and sold. For Asian-Americans, this
new environment provides a win-win situation. Asian-American
engineers, programmers and tech wizards alike have been stepping
out of back rooms and into the spotlight. Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang and
Hotmail creator Sabeer Bhatia revolutionized the Internet. Former
Intel vice president Vinod Dham developed the ``pentium'' which
shook technology geeks and Wall Street. Sun is the president and
CEO of CommunityConnect.com, parent company of the interactive
online community, AsianAvenue.com.

<P>
   PRO-GAY CATHOLICS &AMP; ALLIES CALL FOR JUSTICE AT HOME. When the
U.S. Catholic bishops meet this week in Washington, D.C., one topic
that probably won't be on their agenda is the outrage over the
Vatican's barring an American nun and priest from continuing their
nearly three-decade-long ministry to gay Catholics. Many outraged
Catholics do not intend to let the controversy be swept aside. A
six-page public statement _ with more than 4,000 signatures,
printed this week as a signature ad in the National Catholic
Reporter _ calls on the bishops to appeal the Vatican's decision
and reinstate the gay-affirming clergy. Columnist Chuck Colbert
comments on this historic event.
</P>
<P>
   THE TEXAS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TAKES A LEAP FORWARD. From virulent
anti-immigrants to a pioneering New York Hispanic politician,
Herman Badillo, people are pointing fingers at Mexican
schoolchildren for their failure in the American educational
system. From California to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, educators
weep how ``Hispanic'' children aren't supported by their parents,
don't do their homework, have problems with English and drop out of
school too early. So why are they excelling in Texas? Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on how Texas has reformed its
educational system and how students of Mexican origin are
benefiting from that progress. (Slugged:

   CRITICS OF JACKSON AT DECATUR IGNORE ONE CENTRAL POINT.
Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., was recently catapulted
into national focus when it expelled seven black male students for
two years because of their involvement in a brawl during a
nighttime football game at the school. The Rev. Jackson deemed the
punishment too harsh and went to Decatur to seek reconsideration _
a much lighter sentence for the youths based upon the absence of
weapons, bloodshed and injury. In this commentary, columnist Vernon
Jarrett supports Jackson's appearance and ponders what might have
happened to these teens had Jackson not gotten involved. ``If
Jackson had not journeyed to Decatur, seven youths, who were never
tried with respect for due process, would have been cut from the
educational process _ maybe permanently,'' he writes.

   A DISGRACEFUL USE OF AN APACHE LEADER. Geronimo, the great
Chiricahua Apache warrior and leader, would spin in his grave if he
knew the U.S. Census Bureau was using his portrait in an
advertising campaign aimed at American Indians, writes columnist
Tim Giago. U.S. Census 2000 hopes to make up for the shortcomings
of the 1990 Census that missed so many people, particularly
minorities. American Indians were among the minority groups that
were miscounted. In this commentary, Giago recounts the life of
Goyathlay (One Who Yawns) _ known to the white man as Geronimo _
who was taken from his homeland in chains because he stood up as a
patriot to defend his people and who died in exile far from his
beloved mountains of Arizona.

   TRANSLATING TECHNOLOGY. Since the '60s, the demand for more
sophisticated hardware and efficient software has grown faster than
one can say ``DSL,'' writes Benjamin Sun in this excerpt from A.
magazine. New millionaires emerge every day as new technology
companies are launched, bought and sold. For Asian-Americans, this
new environment provides a win-win situation. Asian-American
engineers, programmers and tech wizards alike have been stepping
out of back rooms and into the spotlight. Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang and
Hotmail creator Sabeer Bhatia revolutionized the Internet. Former
Intel vice president Vinod Dham developed the ``pentium'' which
shook technology geeks and Wall Street. Sun is the president and
CEO of CommunityConnect.com, parent company of the interactive
online community, AsianAvenue.com.

   PRO-GAY CATHOLICS &AMP; ALLIES CALL FOR JUSTICE AT HOME. When the
U.S. Catholic bishops meet this week in Washington, D.C., one topic
that probably won't be on their agenda is the outrage over the
Vatican's barring an American nun and priest from continuing their
nearly three-decade-long ministry to gay Catholics. Many outraged
Catholics do not intend to let the controversy be swept aside. A
six-page public statement _ with more than 4,000 signatures,
printed this week as a signature ad in the National Catholic
Reporter _ calls on the bishops to appeal the Vatican's decision
and reinstate the gay-affirming clergy. Columnist Chuck Colbert
comments on this historic event.

   THE TEXAS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TAKES A LEAP FORWARD. From virulent
anti-immigrants to a pioneering New York Hispanic politician,
Herman Badillo, people are pointing fingers at Mexican
schoolchildren for their failure in the American educational
system. From California to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, educators
weep how ``Hispanic'' children aren't supported by their parents,
don't do their homework, have problems with English and drop out of
school too early. So why are they excelling in Texas? Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on how Texas has reformed its
educational system and how students of Mexican origin are
benefiting from that progress. (Slugged:

HAPPY THANKSGIVING? A NATIVE-AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE

 &HT;    November is known as ``Deer Mating Month'' among my Ho-Chunk
people. My ancestors had a rare gift for defining the world with
insightful simplicity. Had they lived today they might have called
it ``Indians Are Popular Month.''
 &HT;    This month, images of American Indians are as seasonal as fallen
leaves. From grade-school teachers asking their students to draw
``The First Thanksgiving'' to college professors offering Indian
heritage lectures, educators save their lessons on Native-American
history until November.
 &HT;    It's also one of the only times that local TV anchors actually
utter the words ``Native Americans'' in stories with no connection
to casino gambling.
 &HT;    The natural flow between Thanksgiving and Native-Americans has
prompted some U.S. presidents in my lifetime _ including Bill
Clinton _ to designate November ``National American Indian Heritage
Month.'' A proclamation signed by Clinton said, ``The framers of
our Constitution incorporated Indian nations into the political and
legal framework of this country, forever joining the destiny of the
tribal nations with that of the American people.''
 &HT;    It's great to receive the recognition. But he forgot to mention
another destiny _ choosing this particular month forever links us
to Pilgrims and pumpkin pie.
 &HT;    Despite the holiday connection, Native-Americans in communities
nationwide have found ways to fashion the designated month to their
advantage. Universities and American Indian civic groups probably
are the most skillful at drawing media coverage of native issues by
hosting events and activities that celebrate Native-America.
 &HT;    On its Web site last year, PBS used Indian Heritage Month to
showcase its programming on contemporary Indian life.
Unfortunately, such forward-looking perspectives on native people
are as fleeting as autumn color.
 &HT;    Perennial media coverage of American Indians places tribes in
the context most familiar and comfortable to the average American:
the context of history. Sure, some news reporters try to update
their stories by interviewing Native Americans with a pulse. But
the result is what I call ``covering diversity through event
journalism.''
 &HT;    People of color know what I mean. The media's view of us is
cyclical. It starts with Chinese New Year and ends with Kwanzaa. My
husband has to wait until spring to see his Hispanic culture come
alive in the media. His shot at seeing his people reflected in
local TV news comes on Cinco de Mayo.
 &HT;    On these occasions our cultures are reduced to featherweight
features to which many editors assign interns _ or lackluster
reporters. Our heritage gets summed up in a few quotes and a splash
of festive color. Then when readers and viewers ask editors why
their news organization neglects their racial or ethnic community,
the response is: ``We just covered your parade and festival a while
back.''
 &HT;    But for all the flaws of event journalism, I have to admit that
I look forward to November. Anticipation builds knowing that
finally we'll get noticed in a somewhat positive light.
 &HT;    Maybe this is how some African-American elementary teachers feel
on Jan. 31, the eve of Black History Month. It's bad timing,
though, that the recognition for Native-Americans and
African-Americans comes in the months with the fewest days. A
couple more features could get squeezed in, if only the events
occurred in the months immediately preceding or following February
and November.
 &HT;    Like it or not, American Indians are forever tied to the
Thanksgiving holiday. Never mind that it is Squanto who deserves
credit for educating the Pilgrims on life skills.
 &HT;    Squanto, the lone survivor of the Patuxet Indians who were wiped
out by sickness, broke bread with his white friends after havingtheir Puritan hides from starvation. His friends from the
Wampanoag tribal village also joined in that first celebration of
thanks and eating to excess.
 &HT;    But now, even I am the beneficiary of the 17th-century Indian's
goodwill. Occasionally, around this time of year, some non-Indian
will smile at me and say something like: ``There would be no
Thanksgiving if it wasn't for your people.''
 &HT;    That's right. If tribes hadn't shown white folks the ropes, we'd
probably give thanks each day that we still had our land.
 &HT;    I know of some Native-Americans who ignore the holiday
altogether. A college professor who is Lakota told me she thinks
setting aside only one day a year for thanksgiving runs counter to
her cultural beliefs. Many _ if not all _ tribes believe human
beings should pay homage to the Creator every day and offer prayers
of thanks. The Lakota educator said she'd sooner stick to her own
traditions rather than follow someone else's.
 &HT;    Some might say that I'm nitpicking, and that Native-Americans
should seize the opportunity to educate the public on who they are
today. But this stigma of Indians as Thanksgiving characters has me
wishing for simpler times of autumns past _ when the most notable
event was listening to the sounds of deer mating.

   HAPPY THANKSGIVING? A NATIVE-AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE
</P>

   ``Like it or not, American Indians are forever tied to the
Thanksgiving holiday,'' writes Native-American Karen Lincoln
Michel. ``Occasionally, around this time of year, some non-Indian
will smile at me and say something like: `There would be no
Thanksgiving if it wasn't for your people.' That's right. If tribes
hadn't shown white folks the ropes, we'd probably give thanks each
day that we still had our land.''

   CRITICS OF JACKSON AT DECATUR IGNORE ONE CENTRAL POINT.
Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., was recently catapulted
into national focus when it expelled seven black male students for
two years because of their involvement in a brawl during a
nighttime football game at the school. The Rev. Jackson deemed the
punishment too harsh and went to Decatur to seek reconsideration _
a much lighter sentence for the youths based upon the absence of
weapons, bloodshed and injury. In this commentary, columnist Vernon
Jarrett supports Jackson's appearance and ponders what might have
happened to these teens had Jackson not gotten involved. ``If
Jackson had not journeyed to Decatur, seven youths, who were never
tried with respect for due process, would have been cut from the
educational process _ maybe permanently,'' he writes.

   A DISGRACEFUL USE OF AN APACHE LEADER. Geronimo, the great
Chiricahua Apache warrior and leader, would spin in his grave if he
knew the U.S. Census Bureau was using his portrait in an
advertising campaign aimed at American Indians, writes columnist
Tim Giago. U.S. Census 2000 hopes to make up for the shortcomings
of the 1990 Census that missed so many people, particularly
minorities. American Indians were among the minority groups that
were miscounted. In this commentary, Giago recounts the life of
Goyathlay (One Who Yawns) _ known to the white man as Geronimo _
who was taken from his homeland in chains because he stood up as a
patriot to defend his people and who died in exile far from his
beloved mountains of Arizona.

   TRANSLATING TECHNOLOGY. Since the '60s, the demand for more
sophisticated hardware and efficient software has grown faster than
one can say ``DSL,'' writes Benjamin Sun in this excerpt from A.
magazine. New millionaires emerge every day as new technology
companies are launched, bought and sold. For Asian-Americans, this
new environment provides a win-win situation. Asian-American
engineers, programmers and tech wizards alike have been stepping
out of back rooms and into the spotlight. Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang and
Hotmail creator Sabeer Bhatia revolutionized the Internet. Former
Intel vice president Vinod Dham developed the ``pentium'' which
shook technology geeks and Wall Street. Sun is the president and
CEO of CommunityConnect.com, parent company of the interactive
online community, AsianAvenue.com.

   PRO-GAY CATHOLICS &AMP; ALLIES CALL FOR JUSTICE AT HOME. When the
U.S. Catholic bishops meet this week in Washington, D.C., one topic
that probably won't be on their agenda is the outrage over the
Vatican's barring an American nun and priest from continuing their
nearly three-decade-long ministry to gay Catholics. Many outraged
Catholics do not intend to let the controversy be swept aside. A
six-page public statement _ with more than 4,000 signatures,
printed this week as a signature ad in the National Catholic
Reporter _ calls on the bishops to appeal the Vatican's decision
and reinstate the gay-affirming clergy. Columnist Chuck Colbert
comments on this historic event.

   THE TEXAS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TAKES A LEAP FORWARD. From virulent
anti-immigrants to a pioneering New York Hispanic politician,
Herman Badillo, people are pointing fingers at Mexican
schoolchildren for their failure in the American educational
system. From California to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, educators
weep how ``Hispanic'' children aren't supported by their parents,
don't do their homework, have problems with English and drop out of
school too early. So why are they excelling in Texas? Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on how Texas has reformed its
educational system and how students of Mexican origin are
benefiting from that progress. (Slugged:

<HEADLINE>
SATURDAYS NOT ALWAYS A GRAVEYARD ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC has made a very smart move by rescuing ``Freaks and Geeks''
from the exile that is Saturday night and moving the excellent but
struggling freshman drama to Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Saturday night has been the Elba where new
shows die in anonymity (remember last year's ``Cupid''?). For every
successful ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' on Saturdays, there are several
shows that toil in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Freaks ...'' moving to Mondays at 8 p.m. in January, at
least it will get a fighting chance to succeed. Earlier this month
the program ranked 97th, the lowest-rated show among the Big Four
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was once a programming jewel, the home of
``Gunsmoke'' and ``The Honeymooners,'' ``Bonanza'' and ``Perry
Mason'' (all of which were moved around the schedule), and the
powerhouse ABC tandem of ``Love Boat'' and ``Fantasy Island.'' It
was a time when families could still gather and watch the same
shows from a three-channel universe, pre-cable.
</P>
<P>
   The best night of programming ever presented by a single network
aired on a Saturday night. The year was 1973, the network CBS, and
the shows, all five of 'em, are Hall of Famers: ``All in the
Family'' at 8 p.m.; ``MASH'' at 8:30; ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show''
at 9; ``The Bob Newhart Show'' at 9:30, and ``The Carol Burnett
Show'' at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The first four finished in the Top 12 that year, and Carol
Burnett's status as a legend was already secure.
</P>
<P>
   The next season CBS moved the shows around to plant seeds of
success in other nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only one year,'' said Robert Thompson, director of the
Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University
in Syracuse, N.Y. ``Nothing comes close to that one.''
</P>
<P>
   While the No. 1 all-time lineup is set, there are certainly some
other challengers. Many come from NBC's famed Thursday night
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these lineups were pre-ordained to be hits; other times
the networks just lucked into pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you give us more credit than we deserve,'' said
Preston Beckman, the NBC executive vice president for scheduling.
``A lot of the great scheduling moves are made out of desperation.
A lot of it is luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the quality of shows top-to-bottom, here is my take
of the other best single-night prime-time lineups offered by the
networks (years denote the fall start of seasons):
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Thursdays, 1994: ``Mad About You,'' ``Friends,''
``Seinfeld,'' ``Madman of the People'' and ``ER.'' The rookie
season for ``ER'' was ground-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, Mondays, 1953: ``The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show,''
``Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts,'' ``I Love Lucy,'' ``The Red
Buttons Show'' and ``Studio One.'' Lucille Ball's show garnered a
59 rating _ which was a steep drop from the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Thursdays, 1984-86: ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Family Ties,''
``Cheers,'' ``Night Court'' and ``Hill Street Blues.'' Must-See TV
before the phrase was coined.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, Fridays, 1971-72: ``The Brady Bunch,'' ``The Partridge
Family, ``Room 222,'' ``The Odd Couple'' and ``Love: American
Style.'' Cutting-edge cultural schlock (``Odd Couple'' excluded). A
perfect time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, Sundays, 1967-68: ``Lassie,'' ``Gentle Ben'' ``Ed
Sullivan'' ``Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and ``Mission:
Impossible.'' Smooth transition that had outdoors, variety and
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Thursdays, 1993: ``Mad About You,'' ``Wings,''
``Seinfeld,'' ``Frasier'' and ``L.A. Law.'' NBC lucked into this by
slotting ``Mad About You'' in at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, Thursdays, 1979: ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley,'' ``Benson,''
``Barney Miller,'' ``Soap'' and ``20/20.'' News magazines were once
unique.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, Mondays, 1979: ``The White Shadow,'' ``MASH,'' ``WKRP in
Cincinnati'' and ``Lou Grant.'' Going against ``Monday Night
Football'' obscured this lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, Tuesdays, 1965: ``Combat,'' ``McHale's Navy,'' ``F Troop,''
``Peyton Place'' and ``The Fugitive.'' What was ``Peyton Place''
doing in this tube of testosterone?
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention: ABC, Tuesdays, 1998: ``Home Improvement,''
``The Hughleys, ``Spin City,'' ``Sports Night'' and ``NYPD Blue.''
Only ``Sports Night'' remains in its time slot, although ``NYPD
Blue'' returns in January.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no list would be complete without the three worst
network-programmed nights:
</P>
<P>
   UPN, Mondays, 1998: ``Guys Like Us,'' ``DiResta,'' ``The Secret
Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' and ``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie.'' Sure it was
recent, but it will live long in the memories of all (well, the
few) who have seen each of those shows.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Saturdays, 1987: ``Mr. President,'' ``Women in Prison''
(believe it or not, a comedy), ``The New Adventures of Beans
Baxter'' and ``Second Chance.'' To think Fox survived that first
season.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst:
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Fridays, 1983: ``Mr. Smith,'' ``Jennifer Slept Here,''
``Manimal'' and ``For Love and Honor.'' An orangutan, an actress'
ghost, a cop who could turn into animals and a soap opera about
paratroopers. This couldn't even look good on paper.

 &HT;    Much ado about Macho
 &HT;    By Brad Mayhar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tickets have just gone on sale for WCW's Dec. 27
edition of ``Monday Nitro'' at the Astrodome, and one of the
industry's all-time most popular superstars ``Macho Man'' Randy
Savage has come to town to celebrate the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a table outside of a grocery store, Savage is wearing
his trademark dark sunglasses and signing autographs for hundreds
of fans who have come to buy their tickets for WCW's last Monday
night broadcast of the millennium, appropriately titled ``New
Year's Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   To the general public, he may be known merely as the man in the
Slim Jim beef stick commercials, but to wrestling fans, Savage can
still draw a crowd and fill up seats after 26 years in the
business. This Friday afternoon crowd in the autograph line
consists of fans who've followed him throughout his career, and
school children who skipped class to come meet one of their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you go `Macho Man,' if you have any needs,'' a local
pastor says, handing Savage a business card to his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right man, thanks,'' Savage says in his distinct voice.
</P>
<P>
   Savage who turned 47 on Nov. 15 _ according to ``Pro Wrestling
Illustrated's 1999 Almanac'' _ doesn't show any signs of slowing
down. This year, he's engaged in violent matches with ``Big Sexy''
Kevin Nash and Dennis Rodman, and can still execute his signature
high-flying elbow off the top rope with the same finesse today that
he did 15 years ago - if not better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely harder,'' Savage said, comparing the
competition and the demands on his body in 1999 to 1989. ``There's
no doubt about it, but I'll never admit it (laughing). Actually I'm
in better shape than I've ever been in my whole life if you know
what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that 10 zillion people can't be wrong that the older
you get, the more you're going to feel the injuries, and I've been
through a sawmill. But I've got a real positive attitude, and I
feel like I'm still the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage's path to stardom on the mat could have potentially
veered off to a successful career on the diamond. He boasted a .500
batting average at his Chicago area high school and maintained an
above .300 batting average during his tenure as a catcher and first
baseman on minor league clubs for the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati
Reds and St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his knack for baseball, Savage wanted to follow in the
footsteps of his father, wrestling legend Angelo Poffo. Savage made
his pro wrestling debut during the 1973 off season as the ``Masked
Spider,'' and soon found himself making a living as a wrestler on a
full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fan of my dad,'' Savage said between autographs.
``I've always loved wrestling since I was a baby _ since I was a
Macho Baby!''
</P>
<P>
   Savage continued wrestling for various organizations throughout
the southern states until the mid-1980s when he joined the WWF,
where he immediately made a name for himself by winning the
Intercontinental title from Tito Santana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he made the move to WCW, where he has since become one
of five wrestlers to hold both the WWF and WCW world titles (the
others being Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Kevin Nash and most recently
Bret Hart.) Savage has enjoyed two title reigns in WWF and three
for WCW and remains a contender for another shot at the title.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Savage has managed to pursue other avenues such
as acting. He has appeared on Nickelodeon and recently duked it out
with Chuck Norris on an episode of ``Walker: Texas Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Norris is a cool guy, and he's a hero of mine now,''
Savage said. ``I've always liked Chuck Norris. When I saw what kind
of shape he was in, his work ethic and how he was nice to people
and everything, I just totally thought he was a cool guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For now it appears Savage will keep his day (and night) job. His
blonde voluptuous manager Gorgeous George, who is sitting at the
table with Savage smiles when he jokes about wrestling for ``about
122 more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although, he will not say how long he realistically plans to
continue wrestling, Savage hinted at his possible plans after his
days in the squared circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of doing something politically or doing my own
radio show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for certain, with Savage's flamboyant ways and
charismatic personality, ``Macho Madness'' in some form or fashion
will likely continue to run rampant for many years to come.

MULTIPLYING THE POLITICS OF DIVISION

Countdown commentary column)

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Early this fall, Al Gore's campaign was wilting. The vice
president was dogged by widespread Clinton fatigue and the
perception that he was taking the nomination for granted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bill Bradley was wowing the Manhattan financial crowd
_ and also reaching out to the black community, proclaiming,
``Racial unity is who I am.''
 &HT;    To secure his increasingly fragile base, Gore decided he needed
to go ``back to basics'' on the campaign trail. We are now
beginning to see what this cover-your-base strategy means _
treating the American people as a collection of Democratic Party
interest groups.
 &HT;    The Washington Post dubbed it a Gore ``constituency tour.'' I
think a more accurate description would be the ``Divide and Conquer
Tour.''
 &HT;    Gore's campaign manager, Donna Brazile, got specific after the
vice president's campaign stops in California, Tennessee and Iowa.
 &HT;    ``The four pillars of the Democratic Party are
African-Americans, labor, women and what I call other ethnic
minorities,'' she said.
 &HT;    What a cynical view! Far from saying ``bring us together,''
here's a campaign that thinks it's a winning strategy to dice the
country up by color, gender and whatever other demographic traits
the pollsters select.
 &HT;    Set aside the fact that the so-called ``gender gap'' _ Texas
Gov. George Bush actually runs evenly with Gore among women _ is
really more of a gap between married and single women: Married
women tend to vote Republican, singles tend to vote Democratic.
Never mind that most Americans could claim to be ``ethnic
minorities.''
 &HT;    Even so, the Divide and Conquer Tour reflects a poisonous view
of the American people _ group-think is in, independent thought is
out.
 &HT;    Brazile told reporters that Gore also would focus on ``emerging
constituencies.''
 &HT;    ``Great,'' I thought. ``Maybe Gore is reaching beyond arbitrary
classifications of race and gender toward groups that identify with
issues Gore cares about.''
 &HT;    But here's how Brazile defined that outreach: ``The emerging
constituencies are environmentalists, gays and lesbians and those
with physical disabilities.''
 &HT;    When I asked my gay brother whether the Gore camp could safely
count gays as part of the Democratic base, he laughed.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he said, ``and we all listen to Barbra Streisand,
too.''
 &HT;    He considered Brazile's comments ``incredibly patronizing.''
Other gay friends were also not amused _ even those who are
politically liberal warned that politicians who try to pander to
the gay ``community'' could find themselves alienating as many gays
as they rally to their cause.
 &HT;    The Gore campaign's decision to target the disabled vote made
even a high-ranking Democratic senator wince. What the party should
be chasing now, this senator told me privately, are Reagan
democrats and the ``techno-generation.''
 &HT;    And by the way, just what kind of a disability president will
you be, Mr. Gore? The Charles Krauthammer type? The Max Cleland
type? Or will you play it safe and proclaim yourself a Christopher
Reeve Democrat?
 &HT;    The notion that people with disabilities should think alike is _
let's just say it _ outrageous!
 &HT;    Unfortunately, in recent years Democrats have become addicted to
this sort of identity politics. It was Gore, let's not forget, who
first introduced Willie Horton to the American people, attacking
former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis during the 1988
Democratic primaries. Vice President George Bush was later
denounced for using this divisive symbol of black crime against
Dukakis in the general election, but Horton was a Democratic
invention.
 &HT;    Gore and his mentor, Bill Clinton, claimed to have transcended
the old politics of fragmentation when they ran as New Democrats in
1992. Clinton's famous criticism of rapper Sister Souljah, in the
presence of civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, supposedly
symbolized their break with political group-think.
 &HT;    The fact that Gore is now embracing the politics of division is
a sign of how worried he is about Bradley. He wants to scare the
core Democratic constituencies back into line before the challenger
gains any more ground.
 &HT;    I'd like to think that Gore's cynical strategy will backfire.
Already his likely Republican opponent is speaking out against this
type of divisive politics.
 &HT;    ``I don't believe in group thought _ pitting one group of people
against another. All that does is create kind of a huge political
... nightmare,'' Gov. George W. Bush said on last Sunday's ``Meet
the Press,'' explaining why he won't hold a special meeting with a
gay Republican group.
 &HT;    Even if Gore's Divide and Conquer strategy turns out to be good
primary-election politics, it's bad for the country. It will make
it harder for Gore to campaign as candidate of the people in the
general election, and harder still to govern if he wins.
 &HT;    As Gore himself says, ``a president is the only one empowered to
fight for all of the people.''
 &HT;    That's some political advice Al Gore should take.

BOSTON COLLEGE PRIMED FOR VIRGINIA TECH GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is that cute TV phrase? Oh, right. ``Appointment
Television.'' That's what the network pooh-bahs call shows such as
``ER'' and ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the Boston College Eagles will be involved
in a sporting version of ``Appointment Television.'' Anyone in
America who cares about college football will be in front of his or
her TV set at 2:30 p.m. EST when undefeated Virginia Tech takes the
field in the hopes of nailing down a berth in the Jan. 4 Sugar Bowl
against Florida State, the winner to be crowned national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot of those viewers think the game is over
already. Virginia Tech is, at last look, a 24-point favorite. The
average fan regards BC as a bug on the Hokie windshield, which, as
you might surmise, is just fine with the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people describe us as a `soft' 8-2,'' says
quarterback Tim Hasselbeck. ``But, you know what? That's the way
it's been all year. We were 10-point underdogs at Notre Dame. This
gets us motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' says defensive lineman Mike Willetts,
whose tipped extra point played a huge role in last Saturday's
31-29 victory over Notre Dame. ``I think it's kind of funny. The
underdog role has worked pretty well for us this year.'
</P>
<P>
   Second-ranked Virginia Tech will really be playing two games on
Friday. The immediate opponent is BC. The other opponent is the BCS
computer. In order to stay ahead of Nebraska in that all-important
rating, Virginia Tech must do more than merely defeat BC. It must
punish BC. In the really big scheme of things, anything under a
10-point victory (perhaps even as many as 14) is a loss.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much answers the question as to which team will be
playing under more pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's on them,'' maintains senior safety Pedro
Cirino. ``Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   According to coach Tom O'Brien, BC has been playing
pressure-free for the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said the front part of the schedule was the easy
part,'' he points out. ``So those were the difficult games, the
ones we had to win. In the past five weeks we've been able to play
with a nothing-to-lose, chip-on-the-shoulder attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Candor is a refreshing part of the O'Brien package. You've got
to like a coach who admits on the eve of the biggest game of the
season that he never thought it would come to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tremendous group of overachievers,'' he says.
``I thought 6-5 would have been a very good year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the season, O'Brien was looking at four new
assistant coaches. He had real questions about his offense. The
idea that BC could provide legitimate opposition for an undefeated
Virginia Tech team on the day after Thanksgiving was a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the case. It is, in fact, an ideal coaching
circumstance in that Tom O'Brien has a team that is as ready as it
can possibly be to play the Big Game. Playing a team as imposing as
the Hokies in Week 2, 5, 7, or 9 would have been pointless. But
playing them with the team he has now, well, he's very happy to
take his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told the team that the first 10 games are warmups for
this one,'' he says. ``We've talked all year about getting better
week by week, and we have. So are we as ready to play as I could
ever ask? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd say this is the perfect time,'' says
Hasselbeck, ``but it's pretty good. When I look back at how we
played (on Opening Day) against Baylor, it's like night and day.
The way our defense has come along, and with the big wins we've
had, it's a really good time for us to go down there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an especially satisfying moment for seniors such as
Chris Hovan and Cirino, who have lived through some bad times at BC
and who now are being rewarded by getting a national Appointment
Television showcase in the autumn of their collegiate careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered at times if we'd ever turn this thing around,''
says Cirino, the ferocious hitter from Jersey City. ``But so many
of the games we lost in past years were close. We're finally
getting the breaks, like Notre Dame not getting the extra point, so
later on they'd have to go for 2. It's our turn now. Things are
working out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more representative of BC's resolve against Notre
Dame than Cirino, whose interception stopped the final Notre Dame
drive. He was actually carrying in his pants the by-now-famous
photo of Notre Dame stopping Mike Cloud last year. Coach O'Brien
didn't have to do anything to get his team up for Notre Dame, and
he isn't going to need any Rockne speeches on Friday afternoon,
either. With leaders such as Cirino and Hovan, the psych-up thing
is already taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the No. 2 team in the country is enough inspiration,''
says Hovan, the superb nose guard. ``It's the only game on TV.
Everybody will be watching. Don't worry; I refueled my tank on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can ever ask for in life is an opportunity to pursue
one's dreams and one's goals. Fate and a fascinating convergence of
circumstance have placed Tom O'Brien, his staff and his team in a
situation that will have the entire college football community
watching them play a highly important game on Friday in Blacksburg,
Va. That's as good as it gets, and BC is not about to apologize for
being there.

BATES'S TIME WAS WELL-SPENT

   NASHVILLE _ He has been told countless times by the coaching
staff that when he gets his ice time, he should make the most of
it.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, when that opportunity is only a few minutes a
game, it becomes a chicken-and-egg scenario. If you log only a
small amount of time, it's difficult to produce, and if you don't
produce, you won't be given an increase in ice time.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Carolina Hurricanes Monday, Shawn Bates was pressed
into duty by the center-poor Bruins with Joe Thornton sidelined by
a knee injury. Bates had to play a lot _ 16 minutes and 31 seconds
over 25 shifts _ on a line with Dave Andreychuk and Steve Heinze.
He finished with a team-high four shots on net, was a plus-1, won
more faceoffs than he lost, and assisted on a goal by Andreychuk in
Boston's 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played really well,'' said coach Pat Burns, not one to
praise players lightly. ``Andreychuk kept on talking to him the
whole game, which helped us for sure. There was a little bit more
confidence in him. He's got to have that, be first on the puck to
make things happen. That's how Andreychuk scored his goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who is in his third year of pro hockey after a standout
career under Jack Parker at Boston University, said he couldn't
swear it was the most ice he'd ever had in his young NHL career,
but it seemed so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty tired,'' said Bates. ``I know I had a lot more fun
out there. I want to show (Burns) that I can play in this league.
Playing 17 minutes with guys like that, that's going to help me
out.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that he was teamed with a sniper in Andreychuk
and an up-and-down wing in Heinze. Heinze, who has been on the
downswing recently, played significantly better and generated a
couple of excellent scoring chances, including doing the dirty work
that led to Andreychuk's score that tied the game, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with two experienced guys and that made my job
easier,'' said Bates. ``Once you get out there a little bit more,
you get a little bit more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity is there with Joe being out and me being a
centerman. I played a lot of minutes and I think I did a pretty
good job. I almost had a couple of goals out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates wasn't shy about playing student to Andreychuk's teacher.
Part of Andreychuk's credibility comes from his patience, his
class, and his experience. The rest comes from his credentials as a
goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been around for so long,'' said Bates. ``I go to him
first for advice, like where I am supposed to be in terms of
position. I ask him if I'm out of position and what can I do to
help us out. He talked to me through the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a lecture; a word here, a phrase there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like if I'm out of position on the trap or
forechecking,'' said Bates. ``If I'm funneling the wrong way, like
I should be forcing them up the boards instead of behind the net.
Things like that, things that might go over my head that he
notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a whole bunch of things. I just want to know if I did
something wrong after every shift. He comes up and tells me. It's
no big thing but he's trying to help me out and make me a better
player. He knows the game as well as anyone in the league. I'll
take advice from him any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk said it's helpful for everyone on the line if there
is better communication, and he found Bates to be a willing pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's one of those guys who is willing to learn,'' said
Andreychuk. ``He wants to be better and that's going to help him.
You could see as the game went on, he got better. We were able to
create more chances. He was using his speed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Bates has to rely on himself _ on his
instincts, his speed, his determination to make it difficult for
the coaches to keep him off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around long enough to know that when the opportunity
comes around, you've got to produce,'' he said, ``and that's what
I'm trying to do.''

PATRIOTS IN NEED OF A COUNTERATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After the Dolphins lost in Buffalo two weeks
ago, their preparation for the subsequent Patriots game was
described by one player as ``hell on Earth.'' When the Jets lost in
Oakland in the last moments earlier this season, Bill Parcells's
next practice was so tough that one player vomited several times.
</P>
<P>
   After two lackluster performances against key divisional rivals,
the Patriots will trudge back to the practice field Wednesday. If
ever there was a time the Patriots needed a little misery on the
practice field, it's now.
</P>
<P>
   Will they get it?
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, Sunday's game in Buffalo may go like the last
two. The Jets came up with a defensive scheme that was designed to
bully Drew Bledsoe. Miami mimicked that, but added more force. The
Bills likely will continue the trend.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't counter what the Bills throw at them, Pete
Carroll may indict himself forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the talent here to run the table,'' said Shawn
Jefferson, whose 68-yard touchown reception proved to be the New
England highlight of a 27-17 loss to the Dolphins. ``But we have to
straighten some things out in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as frustrating to us as it is to everybody else because
we know we're better than this. We've got to find a way to pull it
together and play football like one of the best teams in the
league. It's not too late for anything. We still have a chance to
achieve all of our goals, and that's the attitude everybody _ the
coaches, players, front office people _ have to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus surely will be on offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese,
who started the season looking like a genius but recently has led
many to scratch their heads over the play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   This is not new for Zampese and quarterbacks coach Jack Reilly;
three years ago, the same charges were brought against them in
Dallas: The offense was too predictable and very unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese and Reilly were dismissed from Dallas when head coach
Barry Switzer was fired by owner Jerry Jones. The more
offensive-minded Chan Gailey was brought in to run the show.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese quickly found a home in New England after the Patriots
fired Larry Kennan, making him the scapegoat of the 1997 season.
Offensive line coach Paul Boudreau was scapegoated last season,
even though Robert Edwards ran for almost 1,200 yards as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are unlikely to have a 1,000-yard rusher this
season, which is part of the problem with the offense. At times the
Patriots haven't been able to run. But even when they've shown
signs that they can run _ such as Sunday vs. Miami, against a tough
defense _ they have elected not to. It is this inconsistency that
has put the offense in a critical state.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, again in the line of fire of fans and media, said last
week that he would not take a greater role in the offense. Carroll
is primarily a defensive coach. But he is the head coach, and what
he says must be adhered to. The powerful coaches eventually take
control when there are problems areas on a team, but so far Carroll
has stopped short of that with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern for Carroll at the moment is getting Bledsoe
out of his funk.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots talk about getting him back into a rhythm, but
there are concerns that perhaps the timing offense isn't right for
him. One player said this week that he feels Bledsoe is at his best
when he can take a seven-step drop, survey the field, then
distribute the ball _ as he did in the Parcells system.
</P>
<P>
   The Zampese system was supposed to be designed to protect the
quarterback more from hits, yet Bledsoe has been hit more than
anyone in the league. His interception rate is also alarming.
</P>
<P>
   In their six wins, the Patriots have turned the ball over five
times; in the four losses, they've committed 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The defense shouldn't get off the hook, either. The Patriots are
the only team in the AFC East to have allowed more than 200 points
(201).
</P>
<P>
   They should receive an emotional boost this week when Ted
Johnson begins practicing in pads. He is not expected to do 100
percent of the reps, but the Patriots are hoping to gradually build
him up and are still eyeing a very optimistic Dec. 5 return. But
just Johnson's presence in a uniform could be enough to spark the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A strange aspect of the season is that, other than Johnson, the
Patriots have not had major problems with injuries. Their key
players _ Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, Troy Brown, Ben Coates, Jefferson,
Willie McGinest, Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy, Chris Slade _ all remain on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Health was supposed to be the key factor in the Patriots'
hanging in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we have our players in good health and I think if
we can get back on the winning trail, that has to be an issue the
rest of the season,'' said Jefferson. ``There are a lot of good
players here and they have pride. They don't want to go out there
and get beaten like that. This isn't on any of the coaches. This is
on us. If we're as good as we say we are, we have to go out and
prove it this week.''

THOSE OTHER EARLY SETTLERS: MORTON AND HIS MERRY BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Mass. _ Down the coast at Plymouth, in the image so
deeply etched in the national memory, the Pilgrims would be seated
at a long harvest-laden table, faces solemn and heads bowed in a
prayer of thanksgiving, with a few equally grave Indians among
them.
</P>
<P>
   But here, on a hillock now called Merrymount, a rival group of
colonizers could be found reveling around a maypole, perhaps arm in
arm with their Indian trade partners (and sometimes bed partners).
</P>
<P>
   It was the Pilgrims who triumphed in the New World, as is
abundantly clear this Thanksgiving week. Rival leader Thomas Morton
and his Merrymount revelers are as forgotten as the Pilgrims are
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Dempsey, who has produced a new edition of Morton's
account of the land and its native people, `New English Canaan,''
believes that Merrymount is as much a part of the American
experience as Plymouth is.
</P>
<P>
   And by dealing with the Indians as economic _ and social _
partners, Dempsey suggests, Morton may be even more relevant to an
increasingly multicultural world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nub of the problem,'' says Dempsey, is that Europeans who
visited New England periodically in the years before the Pilgrims
settled in Plymouth in 1620 ``were trading with the Native
Americans in the way they wanted.'' They gave them guns in trade
for furs _ and they intermarried. ``When Morton comes to town'' in
1624 and sets up a trading post _ with a maypole decorated with
stag's antlers as a kind of billboard _ ``he's willing to give the
locals whatever they want for their furs and he gets what he
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton realized ``that if you gave the Indians what they wanted,
they'd take you upcountry where the furs were,'' Dempsey says.
Thus, Morton became ``an economic threat to Plymouth _ not a
cultural one, even with his maypole _ and had to be suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, 44, has been studying Morton for 15 years. Morton had
been a lawyer back in England and was an associate of Ben Jonson
and other English Renaissance poets. In 1624, he came to New
England and took over a failed settlement _ known as Wollaston for
its original settler _ naming it Ma-re Mount in a play on the Latin
word for ``ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey sees Morton as both pragmatist and visionary, dealing
with the Indians on mutually beneficial terms and writing of their
common intertwined existence in a new biblical land of milk and
honey. At Ma-re Mount, Dempsey writes, Morton was ``surrounded by
extremes of hardship and free-wheeling atmosphere, by a crowd of
many different cultures, working together in secular
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey talks of Morton and his followers ``feasting on venison
steaks while rival colonists in Boston and Weymouth were
starving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey says that Morton would have seen maypoles attracting
crowds to market fairs in England and cleverly adopted one as
``literal staging'' for his New England business operations.
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth Colony, its essence founded on conservative religious
teachings, sent Myles Standish, its military leader, to arrest
Morton four years after Ma-Re Mount's settling. A few months later,
Governor John Endicott of the new Massachusetts Bay Colony moved on
Ma-re Mount to disband the trading post and chop down the maypole _
an incident that became the basis for a short story by Nathaniel
Hawthorne and later for Robert Lowell's verse play, ``Endicott and
the Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton was marooned on the Isles of Shoals off New Hampshire and
eventually made his way back to England. He returned to Ma-re Mount
a year later, but was again arrested and exiled to England. There
he wrote the ``New English Canaan,'' originally as a legal brief
but interspersed with poems in its final form. In 1643, close to
70, Morton returned again to New England, only to be jailed as a
suspected ``royalist agitator.'' Freed in 1645, after the royalists
were defeated in the English Civil War, he made his way to what is
now York, Maine, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey who teaches composition at Wheaton College, views
Morton's poetry as a manifesto for what the trader saw as an
essential cultural condition for successful colonizing _ evident in
the posting of a poem on the Ma-re Mount maypole.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey's edition of ``New English Canaan,'' which includes a
biography of Morton, is the first since one edited by Charles
Francis Adams Jr. for the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1893.
It is published locally by DSI, a digital scanning company in
Scituate.

`END OF DAYS' FILLED WITH ENDLESS DRIVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
END OF DAYS 
Directed by: Peter Hyams 
Screenplay by: Andrew W. Marlowe 
Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Robin
Tunney, CCH Pounder, Rod Steiger, Derrick O'Connor, Miriam
Margolyes 
Running time: 122 minutes 
Rated: R (intense violence and gore, a strong sex scene and
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add to the list of Y2K nuisances the new Arnold Schwarzenegger
movie ``End of Days.'' It seems endless. It's also unusually crude
and stupid, even for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Having
presumably exhausted the list of possible earthly adversaries, it
sends him up against the devil, who, as played by Gabriel Byrne,
seems to have all the fun here. Coyly called The Man (a bid to
avoid offending devil-worshipers?), he coolly strolls through
Manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker, wreaking,
as they say, havoc. The way it works is he smirks and something
explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not all fun and games for the devil. Before the
stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a
certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as
spelled out in the Book of Revelations. Only Schwarzenegger's cop
attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him. First, though,
there's the question of whether the cop is going to stop himself as
he sits in his seedy bedroom with a pistol in his hand,
contemplating suicide because he feels guilty about having left his
murdered wife and child unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the suicidal feeling passes, and the cop gets down to
business. But because he's supposed to be depressed, he keeps the
unshaven bummed-out look. He gets to Robin Tunney's unlucky
designated mother one step ahead of the devil, but it takes him an
inordinately long time and many shootings later to realize that
bullets don't do it when it comes to taking out the devil. Not that
the devil even does much of his own dirty work. It doesn't take
much for him to bend this or that human to his will. There is one
fringe benefit. His henchmen are endowed with super strength and
the ability to come back from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   This plot twist peaks when roly-poly Miriam Margolyes, as one of
the unholy acolytes, wipes the floor with Schwarzenegger's cop. Not
that everybody is against him. Kevin Pollak, his police partner,
provides comic relief. And Rod Steiger turns up as a priest who
knows the score and just might be trustworthy. But as the body
count and decibel level climb, one's involvement plummets. The film
is so preoccupied with technical logistics, so busy administering
sensory jolts, that it leaves no room for anything like character
or even impulse, let alone feeling. Think of ``End of Days'' as
Hollywood's own Y2K bug, at a multiplex near you. As for
Schwarzenegger, he'll be back.

PATRIOTS TIMING IS ALL THROWN OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last 10 days, the Patriots have discovered something that
many others have found about life.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, when he was assembling one of the finest
football machines in the history of the game, Bill Walsh brought a
word to the gridiron vernacular that our ears were unaccustomed to
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sync.'' As in, ``We were completely out of sync today,'' a
phrase Walsh would use on those rare occasions when his Joe
Montana-led San Francisco 49ers lost a game.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was the father of the West Coast offense, which is built
on timing. The majority of teams in the National Football League
use some variety of the West Coast offense, but all have the basic
premise that the ball must be thrown ``on time'' and the intended
receiver must catch it ``on time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the season, the Patriots offense ran like
the Swiss Railroad. They were getting to the right stops on
schedule. They were 6-2. The comments before and after games from
opposing head coaches and defensive coordinators reflected that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is coming out of Bledsoe's hand perfectly. They have
a great rhythm going,'' was the chorus of praise.
</P>
<P>
   But something has gone wrong since the Jets came here last week
and started pulling all the right switches to derail Bledsoe &AMP; Co.
They decided to ``press'' the Patriot wide receivers, which had
been considered a crazy thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, you would not play a receiving corps with the speed of
Terry Glenn, Shawn Jefferson, Tony Simmons, and Troy Brown hand to
hand right from the line of scrimmage. Teams backed off to pay due
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Remember in Cleveland, when the Browns defensive backs had one
foot in Ohio and the other in Michigan, and Terry Glenn caught a
dozen passes right in front of them?
</P>
<P>
   How about when Indianapolis backed off in the second half, with
a 24-7 lead, only to watch Bledsoe put up 24 unanswered points for
a comeback win?
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the Jets did, and the Dolphins copied, as those
teams collected eight interceptions off Bledsoe, who had thrown a
total of four in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast is a precise offense. The quarterback, after
taking the snap, takes a predetermined number of steps. In the
Patriots' case, it's usually five. A five-step drop, straight back.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers run a certain amount of steps, in ``sync''
(there's that word again) with the steps of the passer. When
Bledsoe stops and looks, the receivers are supposed to be at
specific destinations, on time, so that Bledsoe can deliver the
ball before harm arrives in the form of the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   What the Jets and Dolphins did is destroy that timing. From the
snap, the defensive backs have moved close enough to make contact _
pushing, shoving, bumping, disrupting the rhythm of play.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe takes his five steps, looks, and no one is open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, offensive linemen play with a clock in their heads.
They know through hundreds of repetitions in practice exactly when
to expect the ball to be out of Bledsoe's hands. They've got to
hold on, for 3.5-4.0 seconds, before all hell is going to break
loose.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Bledsoe has to hold the ball waiting for someone to
get open, the more difficult it gets for them to hold on. This is
especially true when the opposition rushes more defenders than
usual, trying to force Bledsoe to throw the ball prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first eight games, the Patriots did a fine job of
converting on third down, the critical down in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have had 24 third-down situations in the last two
games. They converted 3 of 12 against the Jets and 2 of 12 against
Miami. That is a pathetic 5 of 24, or a little more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New England defense seems to have an early case
of the Y2K bug. Everything is out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Playing against two young men who were practice-squad players a
couple of years ago, Ray Lucas and Damon Huard, the Patriots have
been humbled on third down. The Jets and Dolphins converted 20 of
37 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   After the Miami loss, some Patriot defensive players were
complaining about staying on the field too long. But it's obvious
that when they get taken apart by two inexperienced quarterbacks,
the problem is with their defense as much as their offense.
</P>
<P>
   You convert less than 20 percent of the time. You let the other
team convert more than 50 percent of the time. On both sides, you
are not in sync. So, collectively, you stink.
</P>
<P>
   And the smell will get worse in Buffalo unless some fine-tuning
is done. There is no tougher place to play on offense for a
visiting team. The Bills' defense at home is the best. They have
solid players, a good scheme, a fanatical noisy crowd, and,
usually, windy, cold weather going for them. In their last home
game, against Miami, the Bills gave up 101 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bills get the opposition in third and long, they bring
in Marcellus Wiley to team up with Bruce Smith, Phil Hansen, and
Ted Washington _ the most formidable four-man rush group in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   If his receivers are covered as they have been the last two
games, Bledsoe had better just throw the ball away and hope for
better luck on the next down.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Bledsoe had great success getting rid of the ball
quickly to Ben Coates when pressured. That is not a viable option
anymore. In spite of his protests, Coates does not have the speed
or quickness he possessed a year ago. He does not get off the line
and on top of a safety or linebacker as fast as he used to. He has
not been getting any separation between himself and the man
covering him. Fans have been complaining about Bledsoe trying to
throw deep all the time. But that is the best option opposing
defenses have left him, and the farther you throw the ball
downfield, the lower the percentage of a completion.
</P>
<P>
   To beat Buffalo a couple of times in the next month, and the
Colts in Indianapolis in three weeks, the Patriots must do a better
job of playing a ``complementary'' game, meaning the time of
possession cannot be lopsided, except in their favor. Even if they
have to run the ball three times into the line and get nothing,
they have to do it to give their defense a rest, because even
against mediocre offenses, the Patriots defense hasn't been able to
get itself off the field.
</P>
<P>
   And I suggest that Pete Carroll do a better job of watching
opposing defenses. Glenn says he is being double-covered all the
time. Coates says the same thing. Ditto for Brown. So the
opposition must be playing more than 11 men on defense. How else
could all these people be double-covered on every play?
</P>

 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Predicting the fate of the Earth has long been a
gloomy business, a profession where bad things only seem to get
worse over time. From books like The Population Bomb to The End of
Nature, ecological pundits of the past 40 years have forecast a
dark future of pollution, extinction, and growing health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the 20th century comes to a close, some leading
researchers and policymakers see evidence that the world's
environmental tide may be about to turn. Already, the ``population
explosion'' is slowing down, as is the growth rate of gases that
cause global warming and the hole in the ozone layer. In western
nations, air, water, and land are getting cleaner, and even China
is showing new interest in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Though the problems can't be minimized _ more than 5,000 plant
and animal species worldwide are threatened with extinction _
environmental thinkers gathered for a major conference on the
planet's future at Columbia University last week said the emerging
successes offer hope for nature in the 21st century, like blades of
grass growing through cracks in the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all sorts of evidence . . . that things are working a
little bit better with a little less pounding on the environment,''
said William Clark, an authority on environmental issues at Harvard
University and a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ``genius
grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark predicted that, by the late 21st century, the global
population may finally level off, ending 200 years of dramatic
growth that has fuelled a vast increase in environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For your children, each passing year will add fewer people
than it did the year before. That is a statement that could not
have been made from this podium any other time in the last 1,000
years,'' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Equally striking was the optimism of James Hansen, director of
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the man who, perhaps
more than anyone else, popularized the issue of global warming with
alarming Congressional testimony in 1988 that emissions from cars
and power plants are causing the planet to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hansen predicted that the next 10 years will be the
hottest in US history, he was encouraged that releases of so-called
``greenhouse gases'' are growing much more slowly than 20 years
ago. Already, he said, the slower growth has delayed by 50 years
the date at which greenhouse gases in the air will double their
pre-industrial levels. ``I would prefer to think we have turned the
corner, and we have the potential to make greenhouse gas growth
rates decrease even further in the future,'' Hansen declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, assessing the health of an entire planet is a
complicated task confounded by conflicting information, and
optimism was by no means universal among the historians and
scientists at Columbia. However, Mikhail Gorbachev, the former
leader of the Soviet Union, seemed to capture the mood when he
suggested that humans can solve even the worst problems _ if they
choose to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has to face a difficult challenge but, as
recent history has proved, walls of difficulty, like the Berlin
Wall, can fall,'' said Gorbachev, who sent his remarks to be read
at the conference after he was unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The thread of optimism at the State of the Planet conference,
held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory, is ironic, coming as it does at the end of a
century that, by many measures, did unprecedented harm to the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The world population grew almost fourfold in the 20th century,
to 6 billion, creating sprawling cities that erased the natural
landscape and sucked up natural resources on an astonishing scale.
Humans dammed up so much water that geophysicists say it has
perceptibly altered the way the planet rotates.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of oil and the modern chemical industry gave humans the
power to send pollution to the far corners of the globe. The
burning of oil and other fossil fuels increased the atmospheric
concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide by 30 percent,
while industry introduced 70,000 synthetic chemicals to the
environment, some of them deadly toxins such as dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   But, even as environmental problems intensified, promising
changes, especially in the industrialized west, foreshadowed a
recovery, said Jesse Ausubel, director of the Program for the Human
Environment at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   For example, food production exploded in the 20th century,
allowing a single hectare of US farmland to feed 80 people where it
had fed only three before. Tens of thousands of acres of less
productive farmland were abandoned, bringing forests back in places
such as Massachusetts, which had been nearly treeless in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, US water withdrawals have been dropping since
the 1970s, said Ausubel, often due to simple plumbing changes. In
Boston, for example, an aggressive program of pipe repair has
reduced the city's water use to its lowest level since the 1950s,
eliminating the need to divert water from the Connecticut River to
Boston's reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as the US moved away from smokestack industries toward
a technology-based economy, industrial pollution has dropped
steadily, spurred on by increasingly strict environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   These improvements haven't come to the world's developing
nations, from Central America to China, where political leaders
often seek to emulate western-style industrial development, with
all its attendant pollution from coal dust in the air to oil in
drinking water supplies. Developing countries are now the fastest
growing source of greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   But, even in developing nations, the 20th century saw some
material improvements as infant mortality rates dropped, literacy
rose, and real incomes tripled. To be sure, 800 million people
still don't have enough to eat, but Maurice Strong, secretary
general of the landmark 1992 UN Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio De Janeiro, said he sees signs that developing
nation leaders understand that economic growth shouldn't come at
the expense of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see an immense surge in new interest in the environment and
sustainable development movement'' in China, said Strong, who
recently discussed the environmental crisis there with Premier Zhu
Rongji. ``Not because they have particularly listened to our
rhetoric, but because they have experienced (environmental
degradation) firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the buoyance at Columbia hinged on faith in
technology to produce environmental solutions that don't derail the
booming global economy. Speakers called for new technologies that
provide cheap, clean power, such as fuel cells, as well as
cost-effective ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest threat to prosperity is the rejection of
science,'' warned Rockefeller's Ausubel.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that the planet was never in as serious shape as
some have contended, because they always underestimated human
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purveyors of doom have discovered how to profit from
creating an endless series of false alarms,'' said William O'Keefe,
president of the 400-member American Petroleum Institute, noting
that the world is nowhere near running out of oil despite repeated
predictions to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark of Harvard argued that much of the environmental
progress in the west might not have happened without the public
outrage generated by authors such as Carson and Ehlrich, even if
they over-stated their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our Jeremiahs,'' said Clark, referring to the gloomy
Biblical prophet. ``They are why anyone listens to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a senior environmental official at BP Amoco, one of the
biggest oil companies, conceded that public pressure is a major
reason that his industry, one of the biggest polluters of the
century, is trying to become ``greener.'' London-based BP has
voluntarily committed to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases
by 10 percent, and the company is investing heavily in cleaner
energy sources such as solar power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reinventing the company. There's a lot of new thinking
going on,'' said Paul Rutter, BP's environmental technology leader.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent environmentalist, Lester Brown, president of the
Worldwatch Institute, sees the changing attitudes in the oil
industry as evidence that the world is on the edge of an
environmental revolution where corporate executives ``sound like
spokespeople for Greenpeace,'' and the world finally addresses
fundamental environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there are now some clear signs that the world
is in the early stages of a major shift in environmental
consciousness,'' wrote Brown in a much-discussed essay earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Brown is right, however, the world has its work cut out
for it. Though greenhouse gases aren't building up as fast as they
did 20 years ago, they could still raise the Earth's average
temperature by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, something that
Columbia University climate researcher Wallace Broecker calls
``poking the angry beast with a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more and more people are placing themselves in harm's
way if global warming produces higher sea levels and more violent
coastal storms as many predict. Already, growing populations along
rivers and the sea has helped increase the worldwide damage in
floods and other natural disasters from $2 billion to $92 billion
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The question, said one speaker after another, is whether
humanity is ready to do what's necessary to preserve the
environment. The issue, they said, is less scientific than it is a
question of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hass, the US poet laureate from 1995 to 1997, seemed to
sense both the promise and the peril of the situation in the poem
he wrote for the conference, ``State of the Planet:''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The earth and its heated atmosphere, its cargo
</P>
<P>
   of everything alive, is swimming in a sea we hardly understand
</P>
<P>
   Our own primitive astronomical maps of. The young know this
story
</P>
<P>
   From the disaster films they flock to see. Because we're humans,
there's always a love story in it somewhere,
</P>
<P>
   Even as the ship goes down. In fact, we are capable
</P>
<P>
   Of sending the ship down to intensify the story. . .
</P>
<P>
   Blessings on the ship. Terror for the ship, and pity for it
</P>
<P>
   And its hapless crew. For her, standing at the prow,
</P>
<P>
   Our lucky charm, and hope, and heiroglyph,
</P>
<P>
   The riddle we have to interpret, the future we have to answer
to.''

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distance a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ There is an eerie silence here among the
cubicles at ESupportNow, as 35 men and women, mostly in their
mid-20s, chat with customers, answering routine questions about
products and services.
</P>
<P>
   But this chat is different. Instead of talking on the telephone,
most are tapping out responses on a computer keyboard to help
Priceline.com customers with hotel reservations and respond to
floral-arrangement concerns and delivery issues sent from customers
at the Web site of KaBloom Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   These workers are ``nowreps,'' such as Jason Taglieri, whose
flying fingers allow him to reply to as many as five e-mail
messages in a matter of minutes. Nearby, Frank Figueroa and Deisy
Nobles respond in Spanish or English to messages from users of
Espanol.com who are buying Latin music CDs and Spanish-speaking
Sesame Street videos, as well as jewelry, spiritual items,
fragrances, and sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   With Forrester Research forecasting $4 billion to be spent on
line between Thanksgiving and Christmas _ double last year's volume
_ customer support services will play a big role in completing
sales transactions and retaining customers into next year.
</P>
<P>
   And while some e-commerce companies have their own in-house
support staffs to handle buyer concerns, many others, including
Priceline.com, which receives more than 4,000 e-mail messages per
day, want to outsource part or all of their customer support.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two independent companies have sprung up to address this
growing need. ESupportNow and PeopleSupport of Los Angeles both
devote themselves exclusively to providing e-commerce companies
with the Web equivalent of a call center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten questions asking if I have any suggestions for
buying a gift for a grandmother, and we respond by asking about the
recipient's interests and how much the buyer wants to spend, and
direct them to the gift center on the Web site,'' said Amy O'Neil,
a nowrep for ESupportNow who handles some of the 100 daily chats
for Shopnow.com, a Seattle-based on-line retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike going to a shopping mall and seeking help from a sales
clerk, or calling a bank's telemarketing representative about a
credit card bill, logging on for instant advice presents a bigger
challenge for ``dot-com'' companies to keep customers satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   There is a natural tendency to pick up the phone to get answers
to a problem rather than going back to the Web site, clicking on
customer support, and bantering by e-mail hoping to get answers
relatively quickly. And with so many places to shop on the Web,
small e-commerce companies don't have the back-office support to
handle many queries, leaving customers frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ESupportNow and PeopleSupport were each launched barely a year
ago, and are a tiny fraction of the overall telephone-based
customer support market. They compete with telephone call centers
that are now scrambling to offer on-line support. ESupportNow
charges its client companies $2.50 to $7.50 per call, depending on
the volume _ far less than the $8 to $10 it costs for telephone
support offered by independent call centers, said Renan Levy, the
Israeli-born founder and chief executive of ESupportNow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes young people who not only know the Internet but can
also think and learn fast to juggle a lot of incoming messages _
skills that are different from telephone call center personnel,''
said Levy, who previously ran a 1,500-person telephone call center
for Cross Country Group Inc. in Medford, which also financed his
year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   His secret for bringing telephone etiquette to the keyboard?
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our staff to smile when they chat and to Spellcheck
before they send anything,'' said Levy, who claims finding nowreps,
who are paid $10 to $14 an hour, has not been a problem, as most
new hires are employee referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, business is brisk. The company added 10 more workers
just last week to reach 110 employees, mostly nowreps, up from five
in January. It now has 26 clients, up from just one in January.
Revenues have climbed from $2,000 at the beginning of the year to
$100,000 in July, and are expected to surpass $400,000 this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping on the Web will get its real test between now and the
end of the year, as customers decide which companies they will
continue to buy from based on their customer service,'' said Cormac
Foster, an analyst at Jupiter Communications Inc., a New York
Internet market research firm. ``Many of the e-commerce firms that
don't respond quickly to buyer concerns _ which we saw last
Christmas _ may not be around next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ESupportNow and PeopleSupport say they are prepared for the
big holiday rush, each estimating that between 5 and 10 percent of
customers who buy on the Web will seek on-line help. Each
guarantees to respond to e-mail in less than three hours. Both also
offer ``chat,'' which enables the customers to send and receive
messages with an immediacy that helps complete a sale _ a key
selling point. Forrester Reseach says that at more than two-thirds
of all Web retail sites, only two visitors per 100 buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-line companies are looking to close sales, and they're
spending 5 to 7 percent of their revenues on customer support,''
said Lance Rosenzweig, founder and chief executive of
PeopleSupport, whose clients include Reel.com, which sells videos;
clothing site Armani Exchange; and Carparts.com.
</P>
<P>
   For customers who after chatting still have questions only an
on-line company official can answer, ESupportNow can link the
customer to the appropriate person along with a transcript of the
dialog. This saves everyone time: The customer does not have to
start all over explaining the problem, and the manager can scan
what's been said and respond more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ESupportNow's nowreps can help on-line customers
locate a particular page on a client's Web site _ for example, one
containing specific financial policies _ without the customer using
the keyboard. They can also assist shoppers over the phone and the
Web at the same time, provided the caller has two lines.
</P>
<P>
   And for Web surfers who linger at a particular client's site but
do not buy anything _ akin to circling the same racks at Macy's for
20 minutes before a sales clerk offers to help _ ESupportNow can
jump in and provide assistance. However, on the Web, that strategy
is used sparingly, Levy and his staff acknowledge, because it can
be jolting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can't believe there is a live person out there on
the Web,'' said Susan Macri, ESupportNow's vice president of client
services, adding that the company's nowreps routinely work for
several clients at once, answering a question or two about flowers,
then helping a customer of a relocation marketing firm.

</P>
<P>
   ``CRYING: THE NATURAL &AMP; CULTURAL HISTORY OF TEARS'' &QL; 
By Tom Lutz (Norton, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only humans sob. Weeping is a peculiarity of man _ no other
animals are known to do it. And yet we know surprisingly little
about it, other than the obvious (children cry more than adults do)
and the physiological (reflex tears _ those you produce when you
peel an onion _ have a different chemical composition from
emotional tears). Crying is an escape, a physical act that
distracts us from the trauma that has made us cry. It is also, Lutz
tells us, a kind of language, ``expressing not just our distress
but our demands, not just our desire to be understood but our
desire to evade detection. Our crocodile tears can be used to
ensnare, to confuse, to extort, to deceive. Even those tears we cry
when we are alone have an imagined audience. Even in our deepest
moments of grief, we can be well aware of the effect our tears are
having on those around us.'' This vastly researched,
interdisciplinary study of tears is a delight, in the tradition of
Diane Ackerman's ``A Natural History of the Senses.'' Lutz looks at
how philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists
have interpreted tears over the years. He looks at crying in art
and literature, film and advertisement. He explores the physical
process of crying and its psychological benefits, as well as gender
issues that it raises (powerful women such as Hillary Rodham
Clinton do not cry in public because it could be read as weakness).
He discusses our changing attitudes toward tears, illustrated by
the fact that Edmund Muskie was run out of the 1972 presidential
primary race for crying in front of reporters, whereas Bob Dole,
who remained dry-eyed for the first 40 years of his public life,
cried many times over the past decade without consequence. Finally,
Lutz poses another puzzle: Even if we think we know why we cry, can
we explain why we stop? ``Tears,'' he writes, ``are the most
substantial and yet the most fleeting, the most obvious and yet the
most enigmatic proof of our emotional lives.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LADIES AUXILIARY'' &QL; 
By Tova Mirvis (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This compassionate first novel is the story of the women of an
Orthodox Jewish community in Memphis, Tenn., and their relationship
with a free-spirited woman _ a convert to Judaism _ who comes to
live among them. Batsheva is the widow of Benjamin Jacobs, who has
been killed in a car crash in New York. Hoping to ease her
loneliness and preserve her ties to him, Batsheva brings their
5-year-old daughter to the Memphis community in which Benjamin grew
up. From the start, it's obvious to the other women that Batsheva
does not fit in _ she does not cook or clean, nor does she pay
suitable attention to the modesty of her clothing or to the
dictates of Jewish tradition. But she does bring an understated
self-confidence, a passion for delving into the questions that
religious faith inspires, and a sympathy for the community's young
people, who crave freedom from the obligations to which they were
born. Mirvis tells her story in the collective voice of the Jewish
ladies, a ``we'' that reflects the depth of their traditions, the
vulnerability of those traditions in the modern world and the
oppressive standards that have grown up around them. Mirvis never
loses her compassion for these characters, nor does she ignore the
value of their moral and religious commitments. They are gossipy
and judgmental, yet oddly innocent. And in coming to terms with
their feelings about Batsheva, the women begin to question
themselves. This is a gentle story _ no sex, violence or overt
drama _ written with a deft hand and a sympathetic heart. Mirvis,
who grew up in the Memphis community on which her novel is based,
says her novel is ``emotionally autobiographical.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MISS MANNERS' GUIDE TO DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY''By Judith Martin
(Crown, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The formidable arbiter of taste and tactics turns her eyes to
the home front, where civility often meets the fate of a dead
goldfish. She begins, of course, with the ticklish affairs of the
people of the home front, known as ``The Family.'' This chapter is
so complex, given today's divorce and remarriage statistics, that
New &AMP; Notable had to take notes just to keep up. But Miss Manners
has everything under control. Other headings include ``The Help,''
``The Visitors'' and ``Entertaining the Relatives.'' Our favorite
parts are not Miss Manners' essays on these matters, but the
questions she receives from her gentle readers and the answers she
gives, in which she shows herself capable of gutting a cloddish
correspondent without even a trace of discourtesy. We love Miss
Manners, yes we do. We would suggest, however, that she has written
many books (12); that the overlap is conspicuous; that being
content with one's already considerable fortune is a gracious thing
indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LIKELY STORY'' &QL; 
By Rosemary Mahoney (Anchor, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Miss Manners would wring her hands over Rosemary Mahoney.
There is no civility in this memoir (now new in paperback) of the
summer of 1978, when the 17-year-old Mahoney worked as a domestic
for the woman she thought was her idol, Lillian Hellman. Hellman
was irascible, insulting, bossy, cheap and pathetic. Mahoney was a
teenager, and so not much more pleasant than her employer. The
difference is that Hellman is dead and Mahoney is alive to tell the
tale. Neither woman looks good, although it is Hellman who suffers
the indignity of having her 73-year-old body described through the
eyes of an angry young girl. This is what Miss Manners would
whisper in Rosemary Mahoney's ear: Someday, you will be old. &QL;

PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 --
The following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on
key bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Nov. 19 approved, 74 to 24, a final catch-all
spending bill that provides more funds for education and health
programs, restores $12 billion of previously cut funds to Medicare
and provides funds for the U.S. to repay debts to the United
Nations. The consolidated spending bill also gives $435.8 million
to the District of Columbia, and includes a plan to allow satellite
companies to provide local broadcast service to customers.
Supporters said the $385 billion bill gives more money to key
programs without dipping into the Social Security surplus.
Opponents said the bill represented bad budgeting practices by
including too many last-minute provisions. They were also concerned
that most members did not have time to read the 2000-page document
before voting. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

SOME FEAR INVESTORS ARE IGNORING DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the stock market shot higher last week after the Federal
Reserve hiked interest rates, David Wyss was baffled.
</P>
<P>
   The chief economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI couldn't figure
out why investors were so excited. A week later _ with stock prices
even higher _ he still can't. ``It doesn't make any sense,'' says
Wyss, who is not the only one around scratching his head.
</P>
<P>
   A number of forecasters and money managers insist that investors
either didn't read what the Fed had to say or that they were
wearing rose-colored reading glasses at the time. A careful look at
the Fed's words suggests that the central bank may not be finished
hiking interest rates and that the next increase could come as
early as March.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the laws of economics have been repealed, higher interest
rates are still bad for stocks. Says Mark Zandi, chief economist at
RFA Dismal Sciences, ``The market is at risk and the higher it
rises, the more at risk it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there were some soothing words in the statement the
Fed released last Tuesday to explain its 1/4 percent hike in rates.
The central bank said inflation is ``contained,'' and productivity
is ``accelerating.'' The Fed went on to say that as a result of its
three rate hikes since June, the risk of inflation going forward is
diminished markedly.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in another paragraph, the message was not so encouraging.
According to the statement, ``The expansion of activity continues
in excess of the economy's growth potential. As a consequence the
pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down
further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained
if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic
expansion continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In English, the Fed is saying this: We think the economy is
growing too fast and the unemployment rate is too low. We want to
see the economy slow down and the jobless rate stabilize, at the
very least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed would like to orchestrate a soft landing,'' says Fred
Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there is precious little evidence the economy is doing
anything but soaring. When the government reports on growth this
morning, the numbers are expected to show the gross domestic
product expanded at a 5 percent annual clip in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect another robust performance in the fourth
quarter. At 4.1 percent, the jobless rate is near a 30-year low and
every survey of employers shows that workers are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's strength is contributing to the problem, says
Zandi. The higher stock prices rise, the more confident consumers
will be and the more they will spend. If that trend continues,
warns Zandi, ``the Fed will have no choice but to raise rates
further.''
</P>
<P>
   So why are investors ignoring the danger?
</P>
<P>
   There are a few possible explanations. Investors may believe
that the economy will slow down on its own over the next few
months. Interest rates are higher than they were, and with a bit of
lag time, they may begin to act as a brake on growth.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate explanation concerns the new economy. The market
may believe that today's premier companies _ Cisco Systems, EMC,
Dell Computer _ are going to grow like gangbusters in any kind of
economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles such as higher interest rates and higher oil prices
might slow these companies down some, but not enough to make a real
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the stock market may be convinced things are going to
work out perfectly, just as they have for the past four years. Over
that time, economists and other assorted pessimists have warned
repeatedly that the economy could not keep growing at a breakneck
pace without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? The economists have consistently been wrong. The
United States has been growing at a 4 percent clip since 1996 and
prices have barely moved in response. Maybe it's technology. Maybe
it's just good luck. Whatever the reason, the market's faith in the
future has been justified time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Why assume the traditional gloom and doomers are right now?
</P>
<P>
   The next few months will see whose view of the world prevails.
It is generally agreed that the Fed won't do anything about rates
in December and February because the central bank wants to wait for
more information before acting. By March, however, the Fed may be
ready to move, says Wyss, who thinks the chances for another rate
hike are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is running too hot and the Fed is going to want to
put on some more ice cubes to cool it off,'' he says. And why does
the stock market reject that view? Says Wyss, ``The stock market
doesn't want to pay any attention to bad news.''

CANADIAN OIL COMPANY FINDS OPPOSITION IN THE PIPELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Oil companies routinely work in dodgy places. So when
Talisman Energy Inc., Canada's largest independent oil company,
first considered joining a mammoth oil field and pipeline project
in the African nation of Sudan, executives routinely weighed the
risks of operating in a realm of brutal heat, malarial swamps, and
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the swaggering tradition of the oil business, Talisman was
undaunted by the dangers _ at least when stacked against potential
profits. And so last year the company charged into a chaotic
country where most Western companies have long feared to tread.
</P>
<P>
   But what no one at headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, reckoned on
was that Talisman would soon be taking the worst heat not from the
African sun but from outraged human rights activists, church
organizations, and government critics in Canada and the United
States. Talisman, which prizes its record as a good corporate
citizen, is these days accused of subsidizing a brutal religious
conflict in one of the world's most wretchedly impoverished
nations.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the 1,000-mile pipeline comes on line, and the
profits start to flow, the company has become the target of one of
the most aggressive international divestment campaigns since the
days of South African apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors (in Talisman) should be aware that they have been
made inadvertent partners to slavery and slaughter in Sudan,'' said
Charles Jacobs, president of the Boston-based American Anti-Slavery
Group, one of the most visible crusaders against the slave traffic
revived during the country's long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Even Madeleine K. Albright has taken a swipe. During a
diplomatic tour of Africa last month, the US secretary of state
accused the company of putting profits into the pockets of a regime
that has given sanctuary to international terrorists and used human
slavery as a tactic of war.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst shot against the company may have come last week
with a quietly released report by the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights, which accuses Sudan of using ``bombers, helicopter
gunships, and artillery'' against unarmed civilians in
scorched-earth attacks around the oil fields near the town of
Heglig. Khartoum apparently fears the black Christians and
followers of traditional African animist faiths might be
sympathetic to rebels attacking oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, weighed in
with his own blasts against an oil company often hailed as one of
Canada's most entrepreneurial and successful. He pledged Ottawa
will take stern measures, including imposition of economic
sanctions against Talisman, ``if it becomes evident that oil
extraction is exacerbating the conflict in Sudan or resulting in
violations of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Canada can make good on the threat is an open question.
But oil industry analysts have been stunned by the ferocity and
suddeness of the campaign against the company, which has driven
down the stock price 17 percent in two months, to $27.90 a share,
and wiped out $538 million of the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been knee-capped,'' said Ian Doig, publisher of a
newsletter covering the Canadian oil industry. ``Talisman never
made a secret of what they were doing, or where. But now the
Canadian government is acting all shocked and surprised just to
ward off criticisms from the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, far from secretly investing in Sudan, the company was
boastful of its participation in the ambitious crash project to get
a the immense underground pipeline up and running across some of
the most inhospitable terrain on earth, from the fever-ridden
swamps of south-central Sudan across blistering deserts to Port
Sudan, on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In just a year, in an extraordinary $1.2 billion engineering
feat, Talisman, together with the state-run oil companies of China
and Malaysia, completed a project dismissed as a pipe dream for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The crude oil is now flowing north at a rate of 155,000 barrels
a day, and millions in profits are suddenly pouring into the
coffers of the Islamic military junta that grabbed power in a 1989
coup. This marks Sudan's entry into the circle of oil-producing
states; at the same time, Western relief agencies are spending $250
million a year to feed and provide medical care for victims of its
interminable war.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan claims the money will be used to build irrigation systems,
roads, hospitals, and schools.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers are convinced the money will just go to buy
more battle tanks, rocket launchers, and other military gear for
the longest-running and bloodiest civil war in modern African
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil pumping from our land might as well be blood,'' said
Bona Malwal, an exiled southern Sudanese politician now teaching
international relations at Oxford University. ``The Muslim regime
in Khartoum is absolutely dedicated to wiping out our African
culture in the south.''
</P>
<P>
   The war pitting the Islamic north against the Christian and
animist tribes of Africa's largest country has sputtered on and off
since Sudan achieved independence from Britain in 1956. But the
most recent 16 years of fighting and famine have been spectacularly
horrific _ with 2 million dead and more than 5 million people
displaced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most ghastly of all, the conflict has resurrected the ancient
south-to-north slave trade, with thousands of southern
tribespeople, mostly women and children, abducted by Muslim
militias to serve as house servants, manual laborers, and
concubines in the north. The slavery has been documented by relief
agencies, the United Nations, human-rights researchers, and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, critics argue, Talisman's investment in
Sudan is unconscionable. The American Anti-Slavery Group is at the
front of the human-rights watchdogs urging mutual fund companies,
civil-service pension plans, and other investors to divest Talisman
stock on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Teachers Retirement Fund on Nov. 1 became the first
major entity to cut its investment in Talisman Energy on moral
grounds, selling 100,000 shares. Meanwhile, New York City's
comptroller, Alan Hevesi, has said that city may shed its $4
million stake, accusing the company of being ``cavalier about its
moral and social responsibilities,'' according to published
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been stunned by the groundswell of indignation,
but so far is staunchly defending its operations in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay there. We do not see our involvement in
Sudan as a bad thing,'' said David Mann, manager of investor
relations for Talisman, noting that the company subsidizes a 60-bed
hospital for Sudanese civilians living in the vicinity of the oil
fields, an orphanage in Khartoum and vaccination projects.
``There's lot of misinformation out there on Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Talisman owns a 25 percent share in the project, with the
remaining stakes in the oil fields near Heglig and Bentiu in
south-central Sudan held by Malaysia, China, and Sudan's own
government oil company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presence there ensures a Western eye, and brings the
West's attention to the issue,'' said Talisman chief executive
officer James Buckee, who has dismissed as overblown charges that
the regime in Khartoum encourages slavery. ``There is a
long-standing practice of hostage-taking which we wouldn't
characterize as slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the argument long made by Sudan's government _ that
southern blacks taken by Muslim raiders are simply victims of
tribal feuds.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-slave activists, human rights groups, aid agencies and
journalistic accounts indicate that a genuine slave trade has been
revived in Sudan, for centuries a major African center for the
dread commerce until the British stamped it out in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sudan last week accused the Canadian government of
caving into pressure from the United States in its recent
criticisms of Talisman. The United States lists Sudan as a nation
sponsoring terrorism and imposed an economic embargo in 1997, a
year before American cruise missiles hit suspected terrorist
targets in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that Sudan is the model for human rights,''
said Sudan's foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, in an
interview from Khartoum. ``(But) if Talisman withdraws . . . there
is more than one company ready to replace it.''

HANK AZARIA'S RED-LETTER `TUESDAYS' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Hank Azaria
with Jack Lemmon in a scene from ``Tuesdays With Morrie'' and by
himself in a scene from ``Cradle Will Rock.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Fans of ``The Simpsons'' know him by his voices.
 &HT;    Think Moe the Bartender, Police Chief Wiggum, Apu, the boss of
Qwik-E-Mart, Professor Frink and an assortment of others, including
Lou, Dr. Nick, Riviera, Carl Smith and Jail Bird.
 &HT;    For those who aren't fans of ``The Simpsons'' _ and I suppose
there are such people _ the man behind the voices is 35-year-old
Hank Azaria, also known as dogwalker Nat in the recently ended
sitcom ``Mad About You.'' Or perhaps he's best known as the
husband, since last July, of ``Mad About You'' star and
Oscar-winning actress Helen Hunt.
 &HT;    The master of many voices _ ``I watched a lot of TV as a kid,''
he explains, ``and found I could imitate everyone from Bugs Bunny
to Robert De Niro'' _ is no stranger to the movies, either. That
was him in a wig and French maid's outfit as the Guatemalan house
boy in Mike Nichols' ``The Birdcage'' (1996). He also played a
television producer in Robert Redford's ``Quiz Show'' (l994) and
was Gwyneth Paltrow's straitlaced fiance in ``Great Expectations''
(l997).
 &HT;    More recently, he's used his real voice and face as the
cameraman in ``Godzilla'' (l998), and in David E. Kelley's hockey
saga ``Mystery, Alaska'' (1999) as a sportswriter who helps arrange
a hockey match between the New York Rangers and a small Alaskan
town's local team.
 &HT;    In December, Azaria will appear in two very different roles, in
the process considerably upping the profile of this most underrated
performer.
 &HT;    The first is ``Tuesdays With Morrie,'' airing Dec. 5 on ABC,
which the actor calls ``the best work I've done'' _ which, given
his extensive credits, is saying a lot.
 &HT;    Based on Mitch Albom's book of the same name, which has been a
fixture on best-seller lists for almost two years, the telefilm _
an entry in the ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series _ casts Jack
Lemmon as Morrie Schwartz, a retired Brandeis University sociology
professor, with Azaria as Detroit sportswriter Albom, one of
Schwartz's former students.
 &HT;    After seeing his old mentor talking with Ted Koppel on
``Nightline'' about his imminent death from ALS, better known as
Lou Gehrig's Disease, the cell-phone-addicted, overprogrammed Albom
flies to Boston for his first meeting in 16 years with his old
friend and teacher.
 &HT;    It is a visit which changes his life, as his professor sets up a
regular Tuesday meeting. It's an extension of their university
tutorials, but this time the subject is life and how to live it.
 &HT;    Albom is a stressed mess, too caught up in his career to be in
touch with his own emotions, too busy to make time for a
relationship, too scared to commit to the woman he loves ... until
he starts listening to Schwartz.
 &HT;    ``Work, money, ambition _ we bury ourselves in these things,''
his terminally ill teacher tells him.
 &HT;    Schwartz instructs Albom to listen to the bird on his shoulder
and ask himself daily, ``Is today the day that I die? Am I ready?
Am I living the life I want to live? Am I being the person I want
to be?''
 &HT;    The moving story, directed by Mick Jackson _ best known for
``The Bodyguard'' (l992) _ has ``Emmy nominations'' written all
over it for both actors. Azaria is every bit as impressive as
Lemmon, for the first time letting the public see the limitless
potential that so many of his co-workers have spoken of for years.
 &HT;    Azaria appears to climb into the skin of Mitch Albom
effortlessly, even though he admits that he isn't at all like
Albom.
 &HT;    ``I'm interested in philosophical and spiritual things,'' he
says, ``while Mitch is not a particularly spiritual guy and did not
willingly go to this kind of place.
 &HT;    ``But Morrie's gift was making this stuff very practical,''
Azaria adds. ``It wasn't like, `Maybe this would be good' or `Try
that.' It was `I'm dying. Here's what's important in life.'
 &HT;    ``Let me tell you, it's very stark and very real, and I think
that's why it moved so many people.''
 &HT;    The film is a duet, and the veteran Lemmon, whom Azaria hugs,
kisses and physically carries around for much of the film, dragged
more out of him than he's ever given, the actor says.
 &HT;    In fact, it sounds as if Lemmon was to Azaria much as Schwartz
was to Albom.
 &HT;    ``I've never been more intimate with another actor,'' Azaria
says. ``I spent the whole time six inches from his face. He's
incredible _ I learned a lot about acting just watching him. And
what he shared with me is all about giving up more and being more
open to what's going to happen to the other actor that day _ taking
a risk.
 &HT;    ``The whole thing was amazing,'' he says. ``It was an incredible
life experience for me.''
 &HT;    Azaria will show up again on Dec. 15 in Tim Robbins' new film,
``Cradle Will Rock,'' as composer Marc Blitzstein, who in 1937
defied government censorship and a court order to perform his
controversial musical, ``The Cradle Will Rock.'' The play was
directed by a 22-year-old wunderkind named Orson Welles (Angus
Macfadyen)
 &HT;    Azaria admits that, when he first read the ``Cradle'' script he
thought it was fiction. Despite an education at New York's American
Academy of Dramatic Arts and at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.,
he'd never heard the story of ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' which went
on to become a Broadway hit.
 &HT;    ``I thought Tim made it up,'' he says. ``I had studied the
history of theater, and this period is not taught _ I never heard
about it. Maybe in New York theater circles it was handed down.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, it's ``Tuesdays With Morrie'' that is most
important to him right now _ not only as a plum role or a chance to
work with the legendary Lemmon, but for the story it tells.
 &HT;    ``It's hard for me to articulate what's so special about this
book,'' Azaria says. ``But I can say that everyone showed up on the
set really wanting to do it justice.''

BELFAST WALLS REINFORCE A BITTER DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Geraldine McIlwaine chuckled
ruefully when she watched televised scenes of Germans gathering at
the Brandenburg Gate this month to celebrate the 10th anniversary
of the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Belfast,'' she said, standing in her doorway, stroking her
8-year-old daughter Katie's hair, ``we want our wall higher.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Irish Republican Army has been willing to discuss
turning in its weapons, no one who lives on Geraldine McIlwaine's
street in West Belfast wants the IRA to give up its guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the IRA decommissions,'' she said, ``we'll be all alone
again.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the progress made on the political front last week,
barriers real and imagined remain in Northern Ireland, especially
on the meanest streets of this old Victorian city.
</P>
<P>
   The most imposing of these barriers are the walls separating
Catholic nationalist and Protestant loyalist neighborhoods, walls
known here euphemistically as peace lines. There are 15 of them
throughout the city, all but one in North and West Belfast, two
neighborhoods where more than one-third of the approximately 3,500
victims of the Troubles have died over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the main paramilitary groups observing cease-fires for most
of the last five years, bloodshed has been dramatically reduced.
Since August 1998, when 29 people were killed by a bomb in Omagh,
the worst single atrocity of the Troubles, only a dozen people have
died in violence linked to the political situation.
</P>
<P>
   But those in poor neighborhoods like the Falls, a Catholic
enclave, and the neighboring Shankill, home to working-class
Protestants, continue to live segregated from each other, their
interaction in many cases limited to the projectiles and verbal
abuse hurled over the walls that separate them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cease-fires of 1994, not only have none of the peace
lines been torn down, several new ones have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   After the cease-fires were announced, the European Union offered
about $350 million to tear the peace lines down. There were no
takers. If EU leaders in Brussels see the walls as anathema to the
ideal of a Europe without borders, those who live in the toughest
neighborhoods in Belfast see them as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The peace lines are immune to the peace process. To bigots and
drunken teenagers, they are like a red flag. In what has become a
childhood ritual in parts of Belfast, youths routinely gather at
the walls to hurl stones and epithets at unseen enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the older peace lines, like those separating parts of
the Falls from the Shankill in West Belfast, are graffiti-stained
concrete walls topped with army-green corrugated steel. More
recently, the British government has tried to make some peace lines
more aesthetically pleasing. A 10-foot-high wall of brick and
wrought iron built on Duncairn Gardens last year looks nice, but
has done nothing to lessen animosities between the Protestant
loyalists in Tigers Bay and Catholic nationalists in New Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the celebrations in Berlin nor the conciliatory
statements by longstanding enemies in Belfast inspire much hope
here that walls long thought to be permanent could someday come
down. Instead, those who live in the shadows of the peace lines say
life here has not changed much for the better, despite the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Along Bombay Street, a Catholic enclave that was burned down by
loyalist mobs in 1969, residents are demanding that local
authorities raise the fencing that tops the wall, which runs as
high as 30 feet in some areas. Hardly a week goes by that the wall
isn't breached by stones, golf balls, and paint bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never sleep in peace here,'' said Patsy Canavan, 43, who
vividly remembers the night her father and mother led her and her
five brothers and sisters to safety down the burning street 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Canavans moved back a year later, when residents rebuilt
their homes, and have refused to be driven out again. They and
their neighbors endure regular showers of rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, go on the Protestant side and they'll tell you the same
thing. They don't want the wall down any more than we do,'' Canavan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The children grow up knowing, and living, the history.
Eight-year-old Katie McIlwaine was an infant when a stone came
crashing through the window, showering her bassinet with glass. Her
next-door playmate, Gerard Mullan, fell and seriously damaged his
eye while fleeing golf balls that rained down on his street two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The walls here are daubed with murals that recall the burning of
Bombay Street, along with exhortations that the IRA never disarm.
Catholics on Bombay Street, and Protestants on the opposite side of
the wall, are convinced that they would be overrun and burned out
if the wall came down.
</P>
<P>
   Canavan says her experience has hardened her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never live with them,'' she said of Protestants. ``I
still have friends who are Protestant, but I would never trust
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Murphy, a Catholic, raised 11 children in a house that
sits hard by the wall. Her backyard is covered by a mesh wire
barrier. Rocks and other objects hurled over the wall are snagged
by the barrier, like nuggets in a prospector's pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear people go on about the peace process, I say, `What
peace process?' There's no peace for us,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Canavan, the 75-year-old matriarch of the Canavan family,
said the wall will never come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know why?'' she asks. ``Because there's bigots on the
other side of that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also victims on the other side of the wall, like Lily
McCurry. She has lived her whole life on the Protestant side of the
peace line, which could not save her father, Alec Andrews, who was
killed in 1971 when an IRA snuck across and put a bomb in his
local, The Four Steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just having a wee drink with his friends,'' McCurry
recalled, pausing as she swept her driveway in a new housing
development in the Shankill. ``My father was just one of the many
innocents. He survived the battle of Dunkirk, only to die in a pub
up the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Lily McCurry is 60 now. She raised four children on Battenberg
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them got in trouble, please God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the walls come down, but doesn't expect to live to see
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked in Mackeys, the factory, with a Catholic girl. She
lived on one side of the peace line, and I was on the other. We got
on well, but at night after work she'd go home to her side and I'd
go home to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She says that while the drop in paramilitary violence is an
improvement, the segregation that helps breed prejudice on both
sides remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that the new generation would see to it that
these walls come down, but the young people have a lot of hatred in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry looked at the wall and sighed wistfully, recalling the
early 1960s when she was young and there were no walls and she
thought Belfast was the best wee place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what those walls are,'' she said, sweeping again, this
time harder. ``Monuments to hate.''

FIRMS STRIKE BACK AT WORKERS WHO POST DISCONTENT ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To programmer Bill Silverstein, the Internet was the most
practical place to publicize the lawsuit he'd filed against his
former employers in 1998. But Microsystems Software Inc. and its
parent, Cambridge, Mass.-based Learning Co., saw things
differently: They filed a counterclaim in Middlesex Superior Court
last year alleging libel.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the legal skirmish _ which the companies had paid
Silverstein $140,000 earlier this year to settle _ took an unusual
turn. Silverstein, now of Austin, Texas, filed a complaint with the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging that
Mattel Inc., now parent of the Learning Co., was violating his
right to free speech by attempting to use the state's libel law to
bully him into shutting down his Web site, www.sorehands.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an abuse of the court system,'' said Boston attorney
Philip Olenick, who represents Silverstein. ``You can't use libel
law to crush free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Internet has given current and former
employees more power to air their concerns than employers ever
dreamed. Thousands of workers are logging on to sites that now
serve as Web-based newsletters for the discontented. These sites
range from the impudent walmartsucks.com, which was designed two
years ago by an irate consumer who expanded it to include an
employee comment page, to the more benign pension club sites
created by Bell Atlantic and IBM employees. One Web site,
bitterwaitress.com, was established by a disgruntled New York
waiter who believed food-service employees needed a place to vent
their anger over stingy customers and demanding bosses.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing concern about the impact these Internet gripe
sessions are having on public image and company revenues has caused
some employers to fight back by using the law to crack down on
message boards and Web sites _ a move free-speech advocates
denounce. They maintain reliance on the courts to curb
employee-Internet kvetches could result in precedents that could
threaten free speech on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass. acquired
subpoenas that forced California-based Yahoo Inc., operator of an
Internet message board, to reveal the identities behind the code
names of two Raytheon employees who had criticized the defense
giant on line.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, American Online turned over
</P>
<P>
   the name of a disgruntled newspaper employee to the Orange
County Register in Santa Ana, Calif. The now-defunct Internet site,
under the direction of an AOL customer called Slave40CR, had served
as a forum for company employees. It contained everything from
rumors and gossip to statements critical of the newspaper's
management.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Learning Co.'s counterclaim against Silverstein,
one of the first cases in which an employer has sued an ex-worker
for using a Web site to publicize the details of a lawsuit. The
original lawsuit alleged the company illegally fired the
37-year-old computer programmer after he developed carpal tunnel
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Boston lawyer Michael Rosen, who represents Mattel, last week
declined comment on the countersuit. He said the big toy maker has
a policy of not discussing pending litigation with the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases are clearly a reaction to the unprecedented voice
the Internet has given individuals who had no voice in the past,''
said David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies were used to a world where they could control the
message. Now, the Internet is changing that dynamic,'' he said.
``So they are attempting to stifle that criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, such cases have raised a slew of questions about
libel and free speech on the Internet. Should Internet service
providers be shielded from liability for information they did not
post? Should new standards in privacy and copyright law be
developed for cyberspace? And where do courts draw the line between
free speech and slander on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have always resorted to the courts to attempt to
rein in wayward employees or ex-employees,'' said Paul Stanzler,
chairman of the employment law group at Burns &AMP; Levinson LLP in
Boston. ``The classic case is the employee who gives away trade
secrets. Now, there is a new twist: the worker who leaves and then
disparages the company via a free medium, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanzler, who represents corporations, believes free speech
advocates' concerns may be overblown. He maintains that when
rumors, or privileged information, is posted on the Web, companies
have a right to protect themselves against those postings that
could damage their reputations or their competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the Internet is a tool employees and
unions can use to get their views across. Still, a lot depends on
the content of the statements posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employees are expressing personal opinions or publishing
truthful statements, they are beyond the reach of a defamation
suit,'' Stanzler said. ``But false statements that paint a party in
a bad light are defamatory and can be the basis for a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   When America Online agreed to provide the Orange County Register
with the name of the employee whose Web site had lampooned the
newspaper, free-speech advocates cried foul. They noted that
although rumors and inaccurate information could result in a viable
legal challenge, parody is allowed under libel law. And they
criticized the newspaper's parent, Freedom Communications Inc. of
Irvine, Calif., for using a lawsuit to force AOL into revealing the
identity of the employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies use the discovery process to strip Internet
communications of anonymity, people will not use the Internet. Free
speech will be chilled,'' said Ethan Preston, legal researcher at
the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, AOL and other providers have argued that they were
not liable for the postings of a subscriber. In this case, the
company had noted in its service policy that names could be
revealed only in the event of a legal command such as subpoena or
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   In another suit filed by a Massachusetts firm, Stone &AMP; Webster
last spring sought damages against 20 people who, it alleged, had
made false statements about the company or disclosed privileged
information on line. One of the postings described a confidential
memo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, a company spokesman said Stone &AMP; Webster was
not actively pursuing the case, but noted that it was still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Olenick, Silverstein's lawyer, maintains more and more companies
are taking these aggressive actions to scare employees and critics
from posting critical statements on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to scare employees,'' he said, ``is to sue them.''
</P>
<P>
   California attorney Cindy Cohn, whose practice includes Internet
cases, believes the growth of Internet use is challenging the law
``to operate in new contexts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is going to be new laws about certain
behaviors (in cyberspace), but we do face the challenge of applying
our current laws to people who are doing the same things in
slightly different ways over the Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who believe that having a Web site is more
intrusive than a picket line,'' Cohn added. ``But I believe the
only difference is that you can reach a lot more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein's original lawsuit against Microsystems Software
Inc. of Framingham alleged he was given demeaning jobs,
scrutinized, and eventually fired for reporting that he was
experiencing pains in his hands, and for taking a medical leave for
acupuncture treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein claims that after the settlement agreement this
year, Mattel said it would drop the counterclaim under one
condition: That Silverstein shut down his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has declined to discuss the case, but Silverstein had a
lot to say about the counterclaim, which he maintains is a form of
malicious prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not publishing information that is untrue or
defamatory,'' he said. ``Some of it is public information. Some of
it is advice to people who suffer from carpal tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The site includes information about the medical condition and
the complaints filed in the original court case, which are now
public record.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein also claims Mattel informed him that, as a condition
of shutting the Web site, he must promise not to talk about the
case, or risk a charge of $50,000 each time he blabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening here is very clear to me,'' he said. ``They
are trying to shut me up.''

DUBBYA CAN RUN, BUT HE CAN'T HIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The George W. Bush rolled out for a friendly sparring round on
``Meet the Press'' Sunday was prepped, barbered, and wound up.
</P>
<P>
   This was a home game in Austin for ``Dubbaya,'' with
interlocutor Tim Russert playing jocular guest to His Young
Majesty's gracious host. It was very palsy-walsy. You don't play
tough-guy with the front-runner unless you're Andy Hiller, whose
next one-on-one with any member of the Bush dynasty will not come
before the year 2044.
</P>
<P>
   With what we are coming to recognize as Boy George's permanently
furrowed brow, his jut-jawed assertiveness, and slightly
off-putting habit of repeating words and whole phrases as he
searches the 53-year-old old memory bank, Young George laid out his
vision of the world and how that fits in with what he calls ``my
job as future president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rest of us might prefer an election before the
coronation. But Dubbaya is forcing the calendar. ``I intend to be
the president,'' he confided. And just in case Russert entertained
any Hiller-esque inclinations, Bush was ready for any potential
stumpers: ``I realize people will replay my statements on shows
like this three years into my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not only past the inauguration of 2001, he's already into
2004, when he'll be running for reelection! Here's a guy who's
ready for the history books. How do I know? Just listen: ``I'm a
history major at Yale. I learned a lot of good history there.'' A
real intellectual on top of everything else. But the Boy George of
the Bubble Boy campaign, sequestered so long by his Austin mafia,
is now hip-deep in voters in New Hampshire, trying to stem the
erosion caused by the John McCain rip tide. Bush's big early lead
in New Hampshire proved to be Kennedy-esque. As used to be said of
Ted Kennedy in the year he ran for president, he peaked the day he
announced.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh AP poll of New Hampshire puts Bush at 44 percent, McCain
at 36, and no one else in double digits. Al Gore is at 43 among
Democrats, with Bill Bradley at 42 in the same survey. But the
momentum shifts suggest that McCain is coming on as Bradley's
previous lead erodes under steady Gore campaigning. Dollar Bill's
reversion to Ye Olde Attack Mode, slamming Gore for being a venal
campaign contribution collector, bespeaks the first hint of anxiety
from Camp Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's mother lode of campaign contributions and GOP
endorsements makes him favored to win the nomination even if McCain
clobbers him in New Hampshire. But Bush's handlers have rationed
his exposure to debate and confrontation, presumably so they can
bring him up to speed on the complexities of issues. Bush has
already ducked three appearances with his rivals, two in New
Hampshire, but he's run out of excuses and is down for Dec. 2 in
the Granite State. He'll get a faceful of pepper spray from the
others, natch.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions
except in the case of incest, rape, or to save the mother's life.
But ``the country is not ready for a constitutional amendment,''
even though he is. How that will play depends on someone making an
issue out of it.
</P>
<P>
   He was noncommittal on NBC about whether he'd continue to
support Boris Yeltsin as the Clinton administration has. He's not
the only presidential hopeful who takes a pass on toughies. There
is a curious disconnect between his sober-sided
speech-and-interview routine, intended to buff up his meager
credentials on foreign policy, and one TV ad he's running in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In an obvious attempt to blunt the onrushing McCain's appeal to
male voters impressed with the senator's gutsy war record, Bush is
running a tough-guy, saber-rattling ad. We need more ``iron'' in
our defense policies, more missiles, more aggressive defense of our
borders, says George the Second.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scary ad, juxtaposing a vulnerable little girl against
violent video of the Gulf War attack on Baghdad launched by his
father. But the problem with pitching to male aggressiveness is
that you risk losing voters among females of more pacific values.
Bush had held a significant edge among women in New Hampshire,
drawn by his ``compassionate conservatism'' schtick and his
let's-change-the-subject approach to abortion. But now he's tossing
around missiles, ack-ack, and ``iron.'' We'll see how that survives
passage through Gender Gap. In the Nov. 12 Concord Monitor,
reporter Alec MacGillis examined the chasm of Gender Gap. Gore led
Bradley in an AP-Dartmouth survey by 48-41 overall, but men favored
Bradley 54-38, while Gore got the gals 53-35.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led McCain 44-31 overall, but they were dead even among
men; Bush's lead was totally female, because he led then by 47-26
among women. MacGillis quoted Dartmouth professor Lynn Vavoreck,
who expects the gender gap to endure, theorizing that women are
more likely to forgive Bill Clinton's indiscretions than men, a
phenomenon noted elsewhere. Tipper Gore's popularity on the stump
also helps Al over the is-he-a-stiff-or-what? hump.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes some more warm-and-cuddly ads featuring his wife and
kids will hold the women while he tosses his lariat over those
stray males. But as this thing tightens and he has to get more
aggressive on the stump to take on McCain, Bush will have to move
deftly or risk driving off women.

SAN FRANCISCO MAYORALTY RACE IS TAKING ON THE LOOK OF `ROCKY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- When a candidate persuades 48,000 voters to
write in his name, spending only $20,000 against richer rivals, he
evokes the chap who slew a Philistine giant in the Old Testament's
Book of Samuel. But in this city, far from the Bible Belt, the tale
of David and Goliath is a less apt metaphor for the Dec. 14 mayoral
election between Tom Ammiano and Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger parallel in drama and ideology is ``Rocky,'' a
low-budget film from 1976 in which Sylvester Stallone played the
title role, a boxer offered a fluke chance to battle the
heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky was from Philadelphia. Ammiano is from New Jersey. In the
movie and in this city, Rocky's foe is a citizen of the world, at
ease among bright lights, high fashion, and self-confidence. Mayor
Brown resembles the character played by Carl Weathers, Apollo
Creed, an accomplished, elegant and genial braggart who laughingly
condescends to his opponent until a handler hears that Rocky is a
southpaw.
</P>
<P>
   Hey champ, we don't want you fightin' no lefty, says the worried
trainer, echoing current concerns in the Brown entourage. Ammiano,
58, is chairman of the board of supervisors, the equivalent of city
council president. He champions a living wage of $11 per hour and
has in the past urged a tax on stock transfers, plus an income tax
on salaries of more than $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city Republican committee has endorsed Brown, 65, stunning
many California Republicans, bedeviled by Brown in his 15 years as
Assembly speaker and unable to imagine any room to the left of
their nemesis. Brown had expected a rematch against Frank Jordan, a
former mayor and police chief, considered a conservative. But in
the Nov. 2 preliminary election, Ammiano's write-in campaign won 25
percent, ahead of Jordan's 17 and behind Brown's 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the first black elected mayor here. If elected, Ammiano
would be the first gay mayor. But race and sexual orientation
matter less than ideology, which defines and envelopes San
Francisco more powerfully than any metropolis west of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco voters favor socialist politics and capitalist
aesthetics. Residents of this urbane city react to change like
skittish suburbanites. They may growl at or weep for the homeless,
but build a shelter for panhandlers? Not in my neighborhood. Rents
are rising rapidly, so how about building more housing? Not in my
neighborhood. In the annals of NIMBYism, the liberal lamb is as
ferocious as the conservative lion in defending the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, Brown filed a gay rights bill every year from
1969 until it became law in 1975. But in this city, the question
politicians hear is ``What have you done for me lately?''
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans value humility and insist on it. Although the
charter limits mayors to two terms, the voters rejected the last
two incumbents after one term. At a Monday night debate, Brown
conceded mistakes ``of style rather than substance.'' Ammiano
accused Brown of ``sweetheart deals'' and ``letting developers into
the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenger scored points by saying, ``I take the Muni every
day,'' referring to the city's burdened transit system. The mayor,
who rides in limousines, said he was ``responsive and accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 2 preliminary election, Brown was first in 19 of the
city's 25 neighborhoods and second in six. Ammiano was first in
six, but third or fourth in 11 other areas. Ammiano ran poorly in
the western part of the city among the Chinese-, Irish-, and
Italian-Americans who voted against Brown in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   John V. Lindsay, elected mayor of New York as a conservative in
1965, returned to office as a liberal in 1969. Winning reelection
with a new constituency is a heroic feat, but Brown is confident,
while wary of Ammiano. The mayor, a major movie buff, remembers
that in 1977 ``Rocky'' won the Oscar for best picture.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Friday, Nov. 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's working for Arizona Sen. John McCain. Why not
for New Jersey former Sen. Bill Bradley? Why not, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about campaign finance reform. For openers, it's
an issue voters have never cared a lot about. And it's been around
so long that it is encumbered by a monster sense of futility. All
words and no action.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has actually been trying in the Senate to do something
about it, not only sponsoring a sensible bipartisan bill but
fighting hard for several years to get it past the opposition of
the Republican congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The sincerity of his crusade is taken so seriously it has put
him on the national map as the only viable alternative to Texas
Gov. George W. Bush for the GOP presidential nomination. Prospects
for a successful McCain candidacy, in fact, are brighter than the
prospects for passage of his cherished campaign finance changes,
which have repeatedly been blocked in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has no similar credentials as a leader of campaign
finance reform. When he attacked Vice President Al Gore the other
day as a symbol of a corrupt, money-driven political system, he
raised a subject that he has never given a high priority to. In
July, he spelled out proposals to change the money chase, including
endorsing the politically unrealistic notion of public funding for
congressional races. Since then, however, he has mostly talked
about other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has returned to campaign finance reform now because he
seems to be losing the early momentum that had made him an
unexpectedly strong contender for the Democratic presidential
nomination. He is trying to draw a contrast between his own
supposedly superior status as a Washington outsider and Gore's
well-known history of dogged fund-raising among the rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put an end to big money in politics,'' Bradley said
piously. ``Politicians believe you don't really care about this
issue. They don't respect you enough to even hide their actions or
pretend.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign, Bradley had raised more than $19
million for his presidential bid by Sept. 30, and he flies around
on corporate planes, for which he makes no public financial
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   By raising the issue, he hopes to remind voters of the
Democratic scandals of the last presidential campaign, which were
exploited by Republican congressional probes that focused on White
House fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's extensive dialing for dollars was widely criticized, but
unproved GOP charges of illegal activity were rebuffed by Attorney
General Janet Reno, who refused to name a special counsel to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore may not be as vulnerable in this area as Bradley
thinks. Voters in New Hampshire, the first primary state, are
notoriously reform-minded, which accounts in part for McCain's
strong showing in polls there. But the rest of the country is
ambivalent. Campaign finance abuses do not rank high on the
national scale of voter concerns. The public attitude is: Everybody
does it; so what?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gore and the Clinton administration are solidly on
record as supporting McCain's bill, which would limit legal
contributions in ``soft money'' technically given to a political
party rather than an individual candidate, and several other
campaign finance changes. They have not, however, spent much time
doing anything about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, opposes McCain's crusade and essentially
favors the status quo, which has served him well. He had raised
more than $58 million for his campaign as of his Sept.30 filing
with the Federal Election Commission, more than twice as much as
Gore's $27 million. Bush is awash in so much money he is refusing
to take federal matching funds, which would mean limiting the
amount he could legally spend in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans benefit the most from the open-ended ``soft money''
contribution system and have been at the core of resistance to
reform, although they have had some Democratic help. As president,
Bush's father vetoed campaign reform in 1992,and congressional
Republicans have blocked it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, it is easy for McCain to draw the contrast
between himself and Bush.They are both incumbent office-holders,
but McCain wants to shake things up and Bush wants to stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley cannot make a similar contrast between himself and Gore,
beyond the obvious fact that Gore still holds elective office and
he does not. When Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996, he
complained that the system was ``broken'' but he did not stay
around to try to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats are for reform, although Bradley's support for
public financing of congressional elections goes where most
politicians dare not tread. Asking taxpayers to subsidize the
campaigns of a bunch of people they don't think much of anyway has
never been a popular idea. It won't do much for Bradley either.

COMIC TRANSFORMS THE MAYOR'S RACE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The primary election results surprised everyone,
especially the last-minute, write-in candidate and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mood in the cabaret-turned-campaign headquarters is
ebullient if unpolished. Volunteers walk in off the street and slap
on homemade ``I AM A TOMBOY'' pins. The worker behind the reception
desk signed on four hours ago. Cardboard boxes double as filing
cabinets, and messages are scrawled on sheets of paper taped to the
wall. The hand-drawn thermometer with the number of registered
voters represented in red is lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   But the underground feel isn't fooling anyone this time around.
Tom Ammiano _ gay stand-up comedian, anti-establishment activist
and president of the Board of Supervisors _ could best Mayor Willie
Brown in the Dec. 14 runoff. Although polls still show Brown in the
lead, a large portion of the electorate remains undecided, with
less than a month to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``All bets are off,'' said Richard DeLeon, chairman of the
political science department at San Francisco State University.
``Mayor Brown still has the edge, but we've already been
flabbergasted once. The passion pouring into the Ammiano campaign
can offset a lot of advantages that come with being the incumbent.
He could pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has turned a city known for its left-of-center
political traditions topsy turvy. While San Francisco has come to
define liberalism in the national psyche, the term has become
relative in a race that pits an established big-city black mayor
against a candidate who prides himself on radical rhetoric. With
numerous overlapping constituencies, the matchup is forcing
longtime friends, as well as enemies, to choose sides.
</P>
<P>
   As Ken Garcia, a columnist with the San Francisco Chronicle, put
it: ``The politics in this city have gone off the axis. Which side
is up is the question. The town is nuts now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fault lines are most evident in the gay and lesbian
community, although they are also noticeable in minority
communities. Jesse Jackson went so far as to urge Ammiano not to
run against Brown. While many of the city's gay power brokers have
stuck with Brown, recent polls show Ammiano leading among
homosexual voters. It's a discrepancy that some view as a setback;
others as a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano supporters say he has rallied gays and lesbians, an
established political force in San Francisco, to turn their
attention to the same issues that concern everyone else, such as
crime and getting the buses to run on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporting gays is just one part of being mayor of San
Francisco,'' said John Burket, a florist who is volunteering for
Ammiano. ``It's political suicide for any politician not to do
that. But there are other things that matter, like making this a
city people can live in again and caring about people who have
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Brown, a longtime advocate of gay rights, counter
that coalitions cannot be built if friends are so easily abandoned.
Beyond appreciating what he has done for the city, they say they
owe him for what he has done for them over the years, from
repealing anti-sodomy laws as a state legislator to pushing for
domestic partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't send the right message to other communities, that
you can support us and then we'll run a candidate against you,''
said Robert Barnes, a local political consultant and gay activist
who backs Brown. ``You don't reward someone who has been on your
side by defeating them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some unexpected groups have sided with Brown.
Against Ammiano, he suddenly finds himself the conservatives'
candidate. The county Republican Central Commission recently
gritted its teeth and endorsed the longtime advocate of organized
labor and affirmative action. The Chinese-American community is
with him. Not surprisingly, given Ammiano's desire to tax high
incomes and stock transactions, business groups are also mobilizing
behind Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say businesses are going to leave town if
Ammiano wins, but some businesses might rethink their investments
in the city,'' said Mark Mosher, executive director of the
Committee on Jobs, an organization of 35 San Francisco-based
employers. ``His record is astoundingly antibusiness. Mayor Brown
believes in social spending, but he believes the way to pay for it
is economic growth.''ill, as political observers noted, Ammiano has undeniably
invigorated younger voters, as well the middle and lower classes
who increasingly find themselves unable to afford San Francisco's
overheated housing market. His campaign is intent on registering as
many homeless people to vote as possible. Tenants-rights
organizations are pitching in.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Brown has brought fiscal health to San
Francisco since he was swept into office in 1996. During his first
term, the booming economy helped quell many of the political
rivalries now surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   Then Amminano's write-in campaign, launched just three weeks
before the Nov. 4 primary and costing less than $25,000, tapped
into an unsuspected level of discontent with city services and
discord over the city's vision of itself. In a four-way race, he
took 25 percent of the vote. His base of support also helped pass
ballot measures to provide greater access to public meetings and
ban fees banks charge noncustomers for using their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we got in the race, it just really took off,'' said
Ammianno, a former schoolteacher who hopes to raise $250,000 for
the race, against Brown's millions. ``It's clear we really hit a
nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, the candidates will engage in a series of
debates to differentiate their styles of leadership and outline
their plans for redistributing the prosperity. For now, though, the
candidates appear to be busy one-upping each other's liberal
credentials, even as Brown paints himself as the more moderate,
practical one in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to co-opt one of Ammiano's centerpiece campaign issues,
Brown recently indicated that he would support a more extensive
living-wage law, even as he stressed the importance of job growth.
Campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston, however, said Brown does not care
who he is running against, because the message remains the same.
``The person who champions domestic partnerships, same-sex
marriages, and a living wage but is also fiscally responsible so we
can pay for everything we do is the candidate for the city,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, whose last-minute campaign enabled him to avoid
significant public scrutiny or debates, attacked the mayor as a
backroom wheeler and dealer who has raised millions of dollars and
has little interest in campaign-finance reform or the plight of the
minimum-wage worker. One of Ammiano's goals is to weaken the
mayor's office, perhaps in part because Brown helped prevent
passage of most of the legislation Ammiano has championed as a
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My San Francisco is about a shift in the balance of power,
from city hall back to the neighborhoods,'' he said. ``It's about
not being so cavalier about granting carte blanche to the chain
stores, about retarding gentrification, about stopping the erosion
of neighborhood characters. Hopefully we won't be such a cash cow
for the big bucks lobbyist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano insists that his administration would not be
antibusiness, that both corporate needs and the needs of the less
fortunate can be met simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of San Francisco, the divisions are expected
to widen in the coming weeks. Few feel comfortable making
predictions anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Ammiano came in, he rode a tidal wave,'' said veteran
pollster David Binder. ``It became a cause, the in thing, to go
write in his name. The odds are against him now, but he could win.
It's about how political figures who have been viewed as liberal
their whole life make others think about them.''

TIME MAY ERODE LARGER GAPS SEEN IN NATIONAL POLLS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In New Hampshire, both the Democratic and
Republican presidential races seem too close to call. But
nationally, the race at this point seems like a blowout, with Vice
President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush of Texas easily
leading their respective contests.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Campaign 2000 is a race that needs two scorecards. But
which one is right?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that both are accurate in their own way, which is
why the Democratic and Republican front-runners _ while smoothly
sailing on national waters _ are pouring huge resources into New
Hampshire and the first-caucus state of Iowa to prevent a possible
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it is so close in New Hampshire is not that New
Hampshire voters are so different, but that they have been exposed
to the candidates more,'' said Tami Buhr, who has worked on a New
Hampshire poll for Dartmouth College and a national survey
associated with Harvard University. ``If (all) voters are given
that opportunity, we might see something similar nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the polls make it seem that Bush and Gore are
far ahead nationally, an unusual new survey has found that the vast
majority of people are undecided. The Vanishing Voter Project at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government recently asked voters to
name their favorite candidate, but, unlike typical surveys, the
poll did not supply any names.
</P>
<P>
   The result: 64 percent said they did not support any candidate,
16 percent named Bush, 6 percent said Gore, 5 percent said Bill
Bradley, and 2 percent said John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most preelection polls give a false impression that voters are
strongly supporting a candidate by reading a long list of names and
encouraging respondents to make a choice that they often have not
made,'' Buhr said.
</P>
<P>
   With such a large undecided base of voters, the underdogs are
counting on a strong showing in Iowa and New Hampshire in hope that
national support will follow. If the national front-runners slip up
in New Hampshire, the complexion of the campaign could change
overnight across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Republican race as it looks under the usual polling
method, in which candidates' names are supplied. Nationally, Bush
leads with 59 percent, followed by McCain with 13 percent and Steve
Forbes with 5 percent, according to a recent Los Angeles Times
poll. But in New Hampshire, a variety of polls show a close contest
between Bush and McCain, prompting a huge dose of media attention
to McCain, the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   A similar scene is unfolding between Gore and Bradley. Gore
leads Bradley by 20 points in national polls, but the two are even
in most New Hampshire surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows well the importance of New Hampshire. In 1988, he
paid little attention to New Hampshire during his first
presidential campaign, thinking he could make up for a defeat by
sweeping the South. But after Gore lost in New Hampshire, winner
Michael Dukakis capitalized on his victory by winning the large
electoral states of Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gore said in a recent interview, he is taking nothing
for granted in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write this down,'' Gore said. ``I'm running in New Hampshire.
I'm not picking out some contingency path. I'm giving everything
I've got in New Hampshire. I'm competing with everything I possibly
can in New Hampshire. I'm spending more time there than anywhere
else, devoting more people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former New Jersey senator
is doing well in New Hampshire but trails in the national polls
because ``this is where we have campaigned and are getting better
known.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is better known (nationally), and he has
been vice president for seven years,'' Hauser said. But as
Bradley's national campaigning increases, his national poll numbers
will pick up, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   The first-caucus state of Iowa is also the focus of intense
campaigning, but so far the races there are not as competitive,
especially with McCain not actively participating on the GOP side.
</P>
<P>
   For years, New Hampshire has had a reputation of being out of
synch with the country because it is a mostly white, conservative
state. While the once-rural state is still overwhelmingly white,
its diversified economy and bugeoning suburbs have made it more
like the rest of the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters do have more contact with candidates than
people elsewhere. Six percent of people nationwide have some direct
contact with a candidate, compared to 20 percent in New Hampshire,
according to Dartmouth government professor Dean Spiliotes. But he
said the importance of personal exposure to the candidates has been
exaggerated, because most New Hampshirites, like most voters
elsewhere, get their information through the media.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshirites are exposed to far more political advertising
and news coverage than people in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Bush emerged as the front-runner, not because
he was ahead in a particular state, but because he became the top
choice of Republican Party leaders. That, in turn, led to massive
news coverage of him, which helped boost his fund-raising and his
standing as the front-runner. That, in turn, prompted several
candidates _ such as Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle and Elizabeth Dole
_ to drop out before a single vote was cast.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire voters, who are accustomed to scrutinizing the
candidates, essentially said: Not so fast. In response, Bush
recently has stepped up his appearances in the state and has agreed
to participate in his first debate, a Dec. 2 forum in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Bush well remembers that his father was weakened nationally in
the 1992 contest when conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan
came in a surprisingly strong second in New Hampshire. Similarly,
Bob Dole in 1996 was wounded politically when Buchanan won the New
Hampshire primary. While Bush and Dole both went on to win the GOP
nomination, their difficulties in New Hampshire played a role in
their eventual defeats in the general election.

   Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, are you going to
be: a) stalled in traffic and waiting in lines at a mall, or b)
liberated as you shop on line at home in your pajamas? This holiday
season, 24 percent of Internet users plan to buy clothing on line,

MR. FUSSY   HIDES FROM THE TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving, Mr. Fussy mused. Is that the one with the turkey,
or the one with the goose?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he knew it was one of The Big Three, along with
Christmas and New Year's Eve. These events loom at the end of the
calendar like Everest, K-2, and Annapurna, insuperable obstacles
separating mankind from the Promised Land of normal life. You're
living normally when you don't have to act thankful to be eating
dry turkey and frozen peas, or pretend that anyone could possibly
want those horrid, sticky gloves that Dan Marino models on TV, or
blubber hopelessly about auld lang syne.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three aren't regular, pleasant holidays, like Columbus
Day or Labor Day, when you can switch off the answering machine and
watch television for 72 hours. Mr. Fussy once spent an entire Labor
Day weekend at home, drinking beer and watching videos of Krzysztof
Kieslowski's indecipherable movie trilogy ``Red,'' ``White,'' and
``Blue'' over and over. When people asked, he said he had spent the
weekend sailing. It was bliss.
</P>
<P>
   That couldn't happen now. There are no ``optional'' activities
on the Thanksgiving-New Year's Trail of Tears. Christmas concerts,
office parties, relatives phoning across time zones to wake you up
with unwanted cheer. For years, Mr. Fussy dreamed of hiding at a
homeless shelter during Thanksgiving, doling out food to the less
fortunate as a family-avoidance stratagem. Then he read a newspaper
article saying the shelters would prefer that people not come on
Thanksgiving or Christmas, but some other day of the year. Yeton
the other days of the year, there's no reason to hide . . .
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving was like a kidney stone; it would pass. But then
comes Christmas. Mr. Fussy once tried to sell a book called ``Is
Christmas Necessary?'' There were no takers, which should have
showed him just how out of step he was with modern civilization.
Christmas, of course, is necessary, even if its only apparent
reason for being is to drive Mr. Fussy bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The great David Owen _ not the British diplomat who looks like
Dirk Bogarde, the New Yorker writer _ once floated the idea of a
``golfastery,'' a quiet place to which fanatics could repair and
golf all day long. Mr. Fussy wondered: How about a
``Christmastery''? It could be located in a large self-storage
facility outside of Lowell, where all the interstates meet. Or if
more space is needed, just take a large, uninhabited part of the
country, such as Death Valley, and hand it over to the revelers. A
special church-government council would surround the area with
those awful year-round Christmas shops, liberating the rest of the
country from their yoke.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, gifts. It's true that men and women in Mr. Fussy's
demographic wanted less and less _ they had acquired pretty much
everything there was to acquire during the decade-long stock market
binge _ so there was more pressure than ever to find just the right
gift. Mrs. Fussy would probably settle for something small, like a
Faberge Easter egg. The older Fussy children would be easy; they
told Santa they wanted Cisco Systems Class A warrants redeemable in
case of a ``special event.'' The youngest Fussy presented no
problem. A $10,000 gift certificate to buy Pokemon would suffice.
Whatever happened to fire trucks?
</P>
<P>
   And for himself? A few weeks ago, Mr. Fussy made a list: pants
clips for bicycling, those lovely brass book darts that cling to
the side of the page and mark a passage, opera glasses for his
failing eyesight, silk undersocks _ an absolute necessity for the
winter. More dental floss, of course. But then Mr. Fussy realized
that this list made him seem like a bit of a fuddy-duddy. So when
he finds a necktie, or the latest Grisham under the tree, he will
manage a smile and a half-sincere thank you.
</P>
<P>
   What does Mr. Fussy really want? Mr. Fussy really just wants it
all to be over.
</P>
<P>
   (With gratitude and apologies to the late Roger Hargreaves,
creator of the wonderful children's book character Mr. Fussy.)

 &HT;    MOST MAJOR RIVERS SAID TO BE SERIOUSLY DEGRADED
 &HT;    Eds: Material for a graphic is at the bottom of this story
 &HT;    EMBARGOED BY SOURCE for PMs of Monday, Nov. 29

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than half of the world's major rivers are
seriously depleted and polluted, contributing substantially to the
world's rising population of ``environmental refugees,'' an
international commission reports Monday (Nov. 29).
</P>
<P>
   From China's huge Yellow River, so overused that it ran dry for
226 days in 1997, to America's Colorado, major rivers are being
drained and polluted to an unprecedented degree, says the World
Commission on Water for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will issue a full report in March. It is funded
by the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World
Bank, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the Organization
of American States.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary news is good for only four major rivers,
according to the commission. Classified as ``healthy'' are the
Amazon in South America, the Congo in Africa, the St. Lawrence in
North America and the Mekong in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Unless ``drip irrigation'' and other more efficient ways of
using water are employed and pollution reduced, the world will have
trouble meeting the needs of farming, economic development and
drinking water needs when 2 billion people are added to the current
population of 6 billion, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has to significantly increase water productivity
while at the same time restoring the world's damaged rivers if we
are to have any hope of meeting the water needs of 8 billion
people, while protecting the environment,'' said Ismail Serageldin,
a World Bank vice president who serves as chairman of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Other river systems singled out in the preliminary report
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Amu Darya and Syr Darya in Russia and Kazakhstan. Overused
for irrigation and polluted by fertilizer runoff, the two rivers'
flow into the Aral Sea has been reduced by three-fourths. This led
to a catastrophic, 53-foot drop in the sea's level between 1962 and
1994 and can be directly related to the increase in infant
mortality, now the highest of all regions of the former Soviet
Union. The two rivers were judged ``very unhealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The small but historic Jordan River. Crucial to desert
economies of the Middle East, the river can no longer meet the
needs of people and environment. Just one-third of its natural flow
now reaches the Dead Sea, which is slowly disappearing. It is an
unhealthy river, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   - The Nile. More than 90 percent of the Nile's natural flow is
used by irrigation or lost due to evaporation in reservoirs. What
reaches the Mediterranean Sea is heavily polluted by irrigation
drainage and industrial and municipal waste. It is deemed
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   - The St. Lawrence. Cooperation by the United States and Canada
have done much to restore the river, but problems remain. Airborne
pollutants and accumulated toxic substances mean that when beluga
whales die and wash ashore, their poisonous carcasses must be
disposed of in hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   - The Murray-Darling River in Australia. Heavy irrigation and
pollution by agricultural runoff led in the 1970s to severe
pollution problems that threatened domestic water supplies for much
of southern Australia. A national commission was established to
manage the river and work for its restoration. Although still
classified as an unhealthy waterway, the Murray-Darling is coming
back.

AHAB'S WIFE 
By Sena Jeter Naslund 
Morrow, 668 pp., illustrated, $28 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let the precedent fool you: Like ``Moby-Dick,'' Sena Jeter
Naslund's ``Ahab's Wife'' is a whale of a book, 668 pages of grand
sea-centered adventure. Like ``Moby-Dick,'' it plays on the mores
of the period and questions the nature of God, love, and justice.
But unlike Melville's 1851 classic, Naslund's first novel is a
grand romance, designed more for wintry firesides than for
literature classes.
</P>
<P>
   The romance of ``Ahab's Wife'' is not only of the simplistic
modern definition, though in Naslund's hands the mad captain of the
title is merely intense, at first, and dashing in a tall, scarred,
and handsome way. But the men in this book _ and the title
character, Una Spenser, ends up with three husbands by the time
this involving adventure winds to a close _ are secondary. This is
Una's story, and in her the author has created a distinctly
Romantic heroine, a character for whom emotion and humanism reign
over scriptural morality. ``Moby-Dick'' set Captain Ahab against a
white whale, a creature of overwhelming strength and seeming
malevolence, in a struggle that, in most interpretations, pitted
the captain against divine will. Una's conflicts are more varied,
her enemies usually some manifestation of social custom, but her
battles are often as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   That the two books run along parallel courses highlights their
differences: Where Ahab's hubris was punished, Una's is celebrated.
Ahab's 19th-century Nantucket still teeters on the edge of
Puritanism; his ``savage'' Native American and South Pacific
sailors alert readers that their captain puts himself outside
society's code. In Una's world it is the young white men who come
to replace a lighthouse lens (and the young woman who accompanies
them to sea) who turn cannibal.
</P>
<P>
   On land, Una's world often seems too good to be true. Like some
seaside Lake Wobegon, her Nantucket is populated by supremely
intelligent and liberal individuals, literate free-thinkers who
embrace all forms of tolerance. Una may only have a passing
interaction with ``Mr. Hawthorne'' and ``Mr. Emerson,'' but she
lives in the world of literature and philosophy, and corresponds
regularly with the feminist writer Margaret Fuller. If all her
neighbors are not so well-read, they are at least pragmatically
liberated: When Ahab goes to sea, a nearby widow casually offers
her ``an array of porcelain devices'' to relieve sexual tension.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these people (and these devices) existed, but Naslund
brings them together in a feminist utopia that doesn't always ring
true. What discrimination there is, such as the brutal intolerance
of Una's father, is long over when the story opens. Or it is once
removed _ in the slavery that the runaway Susan describes and which
Una's cousin fights as an abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   Such forced enlightenment is a bit off-putting, and on land
Naslund's rich, descriptive prose can become overripe, as when her
benevolent uncle attempts to teach her about seashells: ``As I
touched their whorls and knobs and spines and admired their spots
and shadings of brown, pink, purple, he described to me what oceans
the shells had lived in, distant places, and what the people wore
and ate.''
</P>
<P>
   But civilization and its contentments fade away _ much as they
do in Melville's original _ whenever Una leaves home. Una's desire
for adventure brings her through some tough times. As the book
opens, for example, she is about to give birth alone in a freezing
cabin in the woods. And when she runs away to sea, she discovers
nothing is unthinkable. Rapes occur between friends; the civilized
turn cannibal. Even the business of the ship _ hunting whales _
takes on a decidedly contemporary but believable tone of horror
when the boat kills a mother whale and Una sees its orphaned calf
slip away, lost and scared. For Una, whaling conjures up a vision
of hell: ``Oil poured in fountains and . . . dripped all over the
deck. . . . We were all so covered in grease and blood and dirt
that I recognized men only by their voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed from the prim proprieties of land, however, Naslund's lush
language blossoms. In short passages, interspersed with various
character's monologues, the religious echoes of Melville's book
come back loud and clear. Simple humanity becomes a sacrament, as
one character tries for justice in the face of starvation. ``This
is the last biscuit,'' he says to the hungry inhabitants of a
lifeboat. ``I divide it equally among us, regardless of our size or
condition.'' Horror becomes poetry: ``My lips are at the veins. Not
his, her, your, their veins. Just the veins.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, freed from even the most supportive society,
Una's spirit is tried. Unlike her colleagues, or her noteworthy
predecessor, she survives. `` `I will never give up my arrogance,'
I said. `I want to live.' '' The moral may be contemporary, perhaps
even inappropriate for the setting, but the spirit is timeless _
and a great companion for the reader.

TALE OF A SIREN SONG; A LOOK AT ANDY KAUFMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vanity Fair for December offers a juicy story begging to be
turned into a movie. Called ``The Miranda Obsession,'' it
investigates the tale of the phone phony that has been in the
Hollywood rumor mill for years. Apparently, in the 1980s, a
Louisiana woman named Whitney Walton used only the telephone, her
most seductive voice, and the name Miranda Grosvenor to ingratiate
herself to a host of male entertainment hotshots, including Billy
Joel, Buck Henry, Art Garfunkel, Paul Schrader, Quincy Jones,
Richard Perry, Eric Clapton, Sting, and Robert De Niro. Indeed, a
number of these men became quite smitten with the mysterious lady,
without ever seeing her in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda had the numbers of these famous men, both literally and
psychologically. Saying she was a gorgeous blond model and the
daughter of a wealthy New Yorker, she would hook them into
conversation with ego-massaging comments and insider information
that she had learned from her other dupes. They weren't sex calls,
exactly, just flirtatious chats in which she offered support, safe
companionship, and gossip. Billy Joel, who tells VF, ``A lot of
nights she was my only friend,'' would try out new songs on her
answering machine. Generally, when one of the men insisted on
meeting Miranda in person, she would put on the dodge, making dates
and then not showing up.
</P>
<P>
   In VF, record producer Richard Perry talks at length about his
obsession with her, after she reached him at home in 1982. For
Perry, she called herself Ariana, and after a while they began
talking three and four times a day. He would schedule his life
around her calls, and in the evening he would eat dinner with her
on the speakerphone. She made excuses about meeting him in person,
but she sent him a magazine photo and claimed she was the pretty
model in it. Meanwhile, Perry shared his story with a few friends,
one of whom, Buck Henry, had already had a phone relationship with
her and had found out she was a fraud. A shaken Perry confronted
her with Henry's information, but when she finally admitted her
game, he only fell further in love with her. Or at least, until he
finally met her at the Park Lane hotel in New York. A short, frumpy
woman about 30 pounds overweight, Walton told him she loved him,
and Perry recoiled. He felt angry that she had lied so thoroughly
about her appearance, saying to her, ``I can't really trust you
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair reporter Bryan Burrough tracks Walton down in Baton
Rouge, but the social worker quickly denies any knowledge of
Miranda Grosvenor. Her former co-workers, however, do recall
Walton's heady ride as caller to the stars, and they remember
Walton playing them phone messages from Peter Wolf, Henry,
Garfunkel, and others. What Burrough doesn't get into is the nature
of the mindset of these men, who were able to project their
fantasies all over this lone, mysterious voice. Also, what kind of
fame-aholism or neediness drove Miranda to pursue them so
wholeheartedly? Surely it won't be long before Miranda is the
subject of an ``E! True Hollywood Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in VF, the 1999 Hall of Fame pictures include a
classic Annie Leibovitz foldout shot of the cast of ``The
Sopranos'' having the last supper. This one's a keeper.

   If you've never quite understood why the late comedian Andy
Kaufman has been hailed as a comic genius, you might want to check
out Rolling Stone for Dec. 9. The story, by Bill Zehme, gives a
good sense of why Kaufman has become so legendary, as well as the
subject of Jim Carrey's forthcoming ``Man on the Moon,'' which is
named after R.E.M.'s tribute song. In an uncommonly committed,
gonzo fashion, Kaufman took an un-standup approach and believed
fully in the separateness of the characters he created, including
Latka on ``Taxi'' and Tony Clifton, the slimy lounge singer. Zehme
talks to ``Taxi'' cast members, some of whom resented Kaufman for
his theater-of-life tricks, which included an afternoon watching
studio cops remove a deranged Clifton from the set. (It didn't help
that he was always late for rehearsals.) Kaufman, of course, has
already been the subject of an ``E! True Hollywood Story.''

ANOTHER AUSTEN WINNER IN `MANSFIELD PARK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MANSFIELD PARK 
Written and directed by: Patricia Rozema (based on Jane Austen's
novel) 
Starring: Embeth Davidtz, Jonny Lee Miller, Alessandro Nivola,
Frances O'Connor, Harold Pinter, Lindsay Duncan, Sheila Gish, James
Purefoy, Hugh Bonneville, Justine Waddell, Victoria Hamilton,
Sophia Myles, Hannah Taylor Gordon 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (brief violent images, sexual content and drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Rozema's ``Mansfield Park'' continues Jane Austen's
winning streak on film, although in slightly different fashion than
any of the previous entries. What makes Austen's novels so resonant
today is their quite modern fix on love and money, and their
heroines' way, when the chips are down, of betting on love.
Rozema's reworking of Austen's third novel stems, I think, from the
fact that its heroine, Fanny Price, is so unfailingly virtuous that
her apparent lack of faceting poses a challenge. In the end, of
course, we are left with Austen's intended irony that the poor
relation, Fanny, living in a rich house, treated as little better
than a servant, should be the grave repository of the integrity
that keeps the place together as the various weaknesses of its sons
and daughters surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although its stature is the equal of any Austen novel, it hasn't
the sparkle of, say, ``Pride and Prejudice.'' It is, in short, a
bit of a problem novel, and Rozema's tweakings smartly, although
not always successfully, address this. To liberate Fanny from mousy
rectitude, Rozema has made her a writer, as the novel does not. In
other words, a Jane Austen surrogate. It turns her silence and her
imposed meekness into an alert, keen-eyed gathering of impressions
for, presumably, novels to come. And Rozema throws into high relief
the underpinnings of the tranquility of Mansfield Park _ slave
labor on a plantation in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   It also supplies a possible source for the brooding demeanor of
Fanny's real soulmate at Mansfield Park _ not the sensitive but
wishy-washy second son, Edmund, but the patriarch of Mansfield Park
himself, Sir Thomas Bertram, played, in an inspired piece of
casting, by Harold Pinter, who certainly knows how to suggest
darkness lapping around the edges of anything. Here his gravity is
plausibly fed by a troubled conscience over the fact that he and
his family are living off slaves. Just as Fanny is made more
attractive by exhibiting a sprightly sentience and curiosity it's
easy to attribute to this more Austenized version of her, so it's
easier to like Sir Thomas if we can feel that his forbidding
glumness stems from the depressing contemplation of children who
are turning out to be lightweights and a wife befogged in her
addiction to laudanum.
</P>
<P>
   In short, while it's easy to understand the controversy aroused
by Rozema's rewrite, the question must be asked: To what end? The
ends here are, on the whole, dramatically, psychologically, and
philosophically sound. Either way, ``Mansfield Park'' must be
centered dramatically by its moral anchor, Fanny, and Australian
actress Frances O'Connor is superb as Lady Bertram's poor niece,
tenuously attached to a moneyed family that can offer her not only
stability but a serenity unavailable to her in her crude, dirty,
chaotic family digs in Portsmouth. Like ``Persuasion'' _ my
favorite among the recent Austen-derived films _ ``Mansfield Park''
spends no small amount of time in Portsmouth, to which Fanny is
exiled for refusing to obey Sir Thomas and marry a charming
newcomer, Alessandro Nivola's Henry Crawford, whose essential
shallowness she correctly discerns.
</P>
<P>
   The byplay in ``Mansfield Park'' is stylish and arrives at a
satisfying cumulative weight, even if it isn't Austen pure. Rozema
says she knew she was taking a chance extrapolating from Austen's
letters and other material in departing from a straight transfer.
But it's intelligent chance-taking that pays off in terms of
shoring up the context while leaving Austen's brilliant dialogue
virtually intact. It took me a while to warm to Rozema's structural
gambles, and I didn't warm to all of them _ especially some
un-Austen-like overt sexuality, including Embeth Davidtz's silken
adventuress Mary Crawford's lesbian flirting with Fanny. And at
first, I found myself frowning at what was initially an episodic
vignette style. But as we get to know the characters, Rozema's
takes on them grow longer and our involvement grows deeper, aided
by a raw and slightly seedy look to the world of the film that make
it seem less a period theme park and more rife with existential
immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is juicy, too. Austen's usual sisterly triumvirate
has a complicated twist here in that Fanny has sisters at home, but
also occupies the position of ideal sister to the disappointing
biological daughters of Sir Thomas. Justine Waddell and Victoria
Hamilton are allowed to remain sympathetic while being foolish.
Even the horrid Aunt Norris (played by Lindsay Duncan, who doubles
as Fanny's mother), is mitigated by our awareness of how she, too,
is a poor relation whose insecurity forces her to scramble for
position and status. Sensitive Edmund could easily have been a
washout, but Jonny Lee Miller keeps him sympathetic, too. But
``Mansfield Park'' rides the twin gravities of Pinter's troubled
patriarch and O'Connor's bright, graceful, steadfast Fanny. Against
the stony gloom of the stately home, her emotional and moral
integrity glows like Liberty's torch.

   ``Toy Story 2'' is everything you could want in a sequel. It
satisfyingly regenerates the characters and qualities that made the
first film so popular. And then it moves them forward into newer,
fresher, more elaborate, more involving territory. Trailblazing
though ``Toy Story'' may haveMovie Review
</P>
<P>
   been in 1995, its creators can simply do a lot more at their
keyboards today. Four years is a geologic era in computer capacity,
and the Pixar wizards build on what they learned making the first
``Toy Story'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' Some of their new capacities
are quite subtle, such as the ability to do more with the corners
of characters' mouths and eyes. This doesn't sound like a lot, but
it makes available a far greater range of expression, which means
more close-ups are possible, which means the new film achieves a
much richer emotional dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Toy Story 2'' is about to depart from its central
relationship, the friendship between old-style Woody the Cowboy and
souped-up new plastic Buzz Lightyear, the space hero. But John
Lasseter and his Pixar crew deepen and broaden the canvas by almost
immediately moving the story out of Andy's room. When Andy goes off
to summer camp, Woody winds up in a yard sale, and is stolen by the
greedy collector and owner of Al's Toy Barn. It has hundreds of
Buzz figures for sale, but Woody, who dates from pre-Sputnik TV, is
a collectible, worth big bucks or, rather, big yen, since the
thief's plan is to unite Woody with the other puppets on the old
``Woody's Roundup'' show and sell them to a Japanese museum. Woody
had no idea he was a collectible, or even what a collectible is,
but old stirrings surface when he's reunited with the adorably
rambunctious Cowgirl Jessie; his faithful horse, Bullseye; and a
sneaky prospector, Stinky Pete.
</P>
<P>
   For a toy, Woody is given some pretty heavy thinking to do. Not
only must he confront his mortality as a discarded doll with an arm
that needs to be sewn back on; he's also torn by conflicting
loyalties to his old TV puppet pals and his family of toys from
Andy's room. The latter, of course, form a search party under
Buzz's leadership to track down and rescue Woody. This takes them
into a much more elaborate version of the outside world than the
suburban street in ``Toy Story.'' They cover many busy city blocks,
the vast shelf-lined Toy Barn, Al's art deco penthouse, and a
mazelike roller-coaster world of airport baggage ramps. Not only
are the animators up to the task; they seem to revel in doing
things they couldn't do the first time, including the inclusion of
foliage and a windblown leafy tree they learned to do in ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the writing, the characterizations, and the dynamic
story line that drive ``Toy Story 2'' as much as the unique look
and enhancement of its animation. The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim
Allen instantly plunge us back into the world of the toys who speak
and come to life when humans are out of sight. ``Toy Story 2'' is
packed with new humor as well as new characters. And without going
off on tangents, even the vignettes add to the fun, sometimes with
in-jokes. This time we see the evil Emperor Zurg, Buzz's mortal
enemy, who not surprisingly turns out to bear a more than passing
resemblance to Darth Vader. Barbie turns up this time, too, after
having rejected a cameo in the original. And Pixar aficionados will
smile at the presence of the old man from the Oscar-winning short
``Geri's Game,'' who plays a toy restorer here. While most sequels
are pale carbon copies of the original, ``Toy Story 2'' is more
than a match for ``Toy Story.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman. A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine.
Both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short
list come Academy Awards time for breathing fresh air into an
all-too-familiar mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy,
indomitable mom, brings her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood
to become a star. The plot is negligible, but the performances are
the point. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who loses
his girl, Anne (Renee Zellweger), then finds he'll inherit $100
million if he marries within 24 hours. A clumsy remake of Buster
Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,'' it retains the
original's surreal image of thousands of potential brides chasing
the groom-to-be. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs,
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Meshell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth'' Unrated but contains violence,
</P>
<P>
   bloodshed and a discreet sex scene.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nandita Das,
</P>
<P>
   Aamir Khan and Rahul Khanna.
</P>
<P>
   A sorrowful look at the ways politics and religion can turn
friends into foes. ``Fire'' director Deepa Mehta continues her
elemental exploration of India with this sobering drama set during
the brutal days of the country's redivision following independence
from British rule. (In Hindi and English, with subtitles.) (SM) 1
hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' R (violence and gore, a strong sex scene,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest he-man Arnold
Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano with a
beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this explosion-happy
thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography and bloated with
bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie full of punches but
no spark. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual situations,
</P>
<P>
   implied violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bob Hoskins.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hoskins will creep you out in this unsettling little movie
about a lonely eccentric with serious mommy issues. Elaine Cassidy,
a forlorn, unwed, pregnant Irish teen, comes under his
``protection.'' The film is elliptical, intellectual and
emotionally distant. But Cassidy is very good _ she's a natural
survivor. And Hoskins is amazing. He gives his performance a
twisted delicacy worthy of Peter Lorre in ``M.'' (ERG) 1 hour, 54
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawless'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro
</P>
<P>
   and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a guilty pleasure _ if they'd made it 30 years ago.
You could slip it into the VCR and giggle at its dated,
consciousness-raising plot and its by-the-numbers tale of a
homophobic security guard (Robert De Niro) who learns to respect
the brassy/soulful drag queen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) next door.
Unfortunately, the flick is a new release full of weary cliches and
flat comic bits. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``House on Haunted Hill'' R (violence, gore, sexual images,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen and Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   A redo of the 1958 Vincent Price spookfest, it's a loud assault
on the senses and a (literal) bloody mess. But as a
meat-and-potatoes (or guts-and-eyeballs) scare machine, it has its
moments. Geoffrey Rush invites five strangers to spend the night in
a haunted house to win $1 million each. Then the gore begins. (SM)
1 hour, 55 minutes C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   More smoke than fire in this reality-based film about what
happened when former tobacco consultant Jeffrey Wigand (Russell
Crowe) agreed to tell his story on ``60 Minutes'' at the behest of
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Bergman gets the star
treatment (one senses a certain pandering to Pacino), but Wigand's
predicament is more riveting, with Crowe in an Oscar-worthy
performance. (ERG) 2 hours, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of 1900'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Tornatore's first English-language movie is an epic
poetic fable. Tim Roth stars as a piano prodigy born on an ocean
liner at the turn of the century who lives his entire life without
ever setting foot on land. The movie offers images so stunning that
they more than make up for the narrative excesses. This is a
picture for all of us at sea, seeking the courage and faith to make
that first step off the boat. (ERG)2 hours. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Light It Up'' R (violent content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Usher Raymond,
</P>
<P>
   Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and Vanessa L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They should have burned the script. Atlanta's Usher Raymond
leads students from a horribly overcrowded high school in taking a
cop hostage and demanding a good education. Every moment of painful
injustice is rendered in slo-mo. Every cry of anguish
ever-so-slowly erupts from some kid's wrenched guts. It's about as
soapy a movie as you're likely to see. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 43
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger: The Story
</P>
<P>
   of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles, a rape, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Milla Jovovich
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
sword play slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep
</P>
<P>
   and Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The Meryl Streep Show _ and what a show it is. Streep and
director Wes Craven (``Scream,'') have delivered a rarity: an
inspirational movie that is actually inspirational. The film
follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant kids,
confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in her
battle to teach violin to inner-city kids. It's a glorified TV
movie, but it's got Streep and that's all it needs. (ERG) 2 hours,
3 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and Redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 29 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. Essentially,
it's a ``once upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature
and civilization. Boldly innovative (often savagely so) yet eerily
innocent, it's the sort of thing you simply have to see for
yourself. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women or children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking in Strings'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   Mercurial, complicated and problem-ridden, concert violinist
Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, fights her way back from injury,
depression and attempted suicide. The story is compelling enough,
and the camera loves Salerno-Sonnenberg. But director Paola di
Florio spends much too long on preliminary material before getting
to the meat of why this film was made. (Judith Green) 1 hour, 13
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his 1966 John Deere riding mower more than
300 miles to reconcile with his estranged brother (Harry Dean
Stanton). The movie is a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. A perfect
Thanksgiving movie. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite.
As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher,
Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear Shannon loves this character, but
she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness, whether
talking baby talk to her breasts, or fantasizing that a tree is her
lover. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality and
innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierces Brosnan,
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th James Bond movie is more of the same old same old.
Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence.
It's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but
they were thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours,
8 minutes. C-

SCHUMACHER AND DE NIRO DELIVER NEAR-PERFECT `FLAWLESS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FLAWLESS 
Written and directed by: Joel Schumacher 
Starring: Robert De Niro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Miller,
Chris Bauer, Skipp Sudduth, Wanda De Jesus, Daphne Rubin-Vega,
Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Nashom Benjamin, Scott Allen Cooper, Rory
Cochrane 
Running time: 111 minutes 
Rated: R (pervasive language and strong violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joel Schumacher's ``Flawless'' is a smartly crafted throwback to
the gritty Manhattan crime melodramas of the '40s _ with one big
difference. Given a freedom unavailable to those old genre
pictures, this update is driven by the enforced closeness between
Robert De Niro's brave, proud bank guard who has suffered a stroke
and Philip Seymour Hoffman's transvestite club emcee living in the
same seedy residential hotel, to whom De Niro turns for singing
lessons as therapy. The enormous gulf between them is narrowed, but
never easily, and never is it closed entirely, which makes the film
a lot easier to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The question is to what degree each can inhabit the other's
world, even provisionally, when each regards the other's world as
anathema. The big plus, as the film works its way toward an answer,
is the way each maintains a certain dignity and toughness and never
yields to easy sentimentality to move things along. The closest De
Niro's Walt and Hoffman's Rusty come to a matchmaker is a homicidal
drug dealer who drives them closer than they otherwise would get,
when Rusty is suspected of having stolen some money the dealer had
killed to get and would kill for again. If this sounds a bit
contrived, it is, but it plays better than it sounds, for three big
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, of course, are De Niro and Hoffman. It is to be
expected that De Niro, whose painstaking preparation for roles is
legendary, would be convincing as the recovering stroke victim.
Master actor that he is, De Niro manages to seem simultaneously
imploded and intense. He makes us feel what his character is
feeling, but isn't saying, and since his character is as stubborn
as he is proud, we feel him feeling a lot beneath his largely
frozen exterior. Schumacher the screenwriter gives him much more
than a string of Archie Bunker numbers to reel off. He and De Niro
make us feel Walt's integrity. Walt's capacity for emotion is
conveyed in his relations with two women at a tango palace he
frequented before his stroke: Wanda De Jesus's exploitative beauty
and Daphne Rubin-Vega's sympathetic one.
</P>

   Philip Seymour Hoffman is the surprise here, but only to those
who haven't seen his extraordinary performances as the schleppy
porn movie gofer in ``Boogie Nights'' or clammy obscene phoner in
``Happiness.'' Resourcefully and movingly, he, too, avoids
caricature as the character called Busty Rusty, even when doing a
Sophie Tucker nightclub parody. Hoffman's Rusty is a creature of
strong feelings, unafraid to express them, wanting to please, yet
tough as cement and street smart. Rusty, in short, is a vivid
survivor, convincing when bonding with fellow drag queens, but
touchingly vulnerable in the decidedly emotional clinches when he's
at the piano, working with his reluctant but determined new client.
</P>
<P>
   The third, but no less important, element in the film's success
is its street feel and the degree of conviction brought to this
project by Schumacher. He's from New York, and although he hasn't
lived there for a couple of decades, he remembers its sights and
textures from the days when he himself led a marginal existence. In
short, this is a New Yorker's New York, not a Los Angelino's, and
it makes a difference. And Schumacher surprises us by making Rusty
the hard-boiled one and Walt the one who's afraid to acknowledge _
and deal with _ his own sensitive side. ``Flawless'' rides an
understated gutsiness and tenacity which is the stuff of life if
you're going to have a life in New York. Atmosphere, perfectly
inflected supporting performances from Rusty's and Walt's very
different social circles, and those sizzling characterizations from
De Niro and Hoffman make ``Flawless'' a down-and-dirty winner.

</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Nov. 19 approved, 74 to 24, a final catch-all
spending bill that provides more funds for education and health
programs, restores $12 billion of previously cut funds to Medicare
and provides funds for the U.S. to repay debts to the United
Nations. The consolidated spending bill also gives $435.8 million
to the District of Columbia, and includes a plan to allow satellite
companies to provide local broadcast service to customers.
Supporters said the $385 billion bill gives more money to key
programs without dipping into the Social Security surplus.
Opponents said the bill represented bad budgeting practices by
including too many last-minute provisions. They were also concerned
that most members did not have time to read the 2000-page document
before voting. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

Indie actor hits the big time with 3 new films  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Friday, Nov. 26) 
By Bob Strauss 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You really wonder how weird the guy's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice surprise then _ actually, more of a relief _ when
Philip Seymour Hoffman shows up happy, full of good humor and
apparently well-adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   A rising sensation in the indie film world for the past several
years, the sandy-haired 32-year-old actor made memorable
appearances as insidious or deeply damaged characters in Paul
Thomas Anderson's ``Hard Eight'' and ``Boogie Nights,' the Coen
Brothers' `Big Lebowski'' and, most alarmingly, Todd Solondz's
controversial ``Happiness,'' in which his alienated young loner
could barely muster a face-to-face conversation but was a real
raconteur when making obscene phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   There have been more conventional roles, such as ``Twister's''
goofy guy in the back of the truck and the skeptical roommate who
came around to recognizing the silly saintliness of ``Patch
Adams.'' But it's Hoffman's willingness to go to behavioral
extremes with uncommon sensitivity that is really defining his
increasingly remarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You explore, but you're also paying homage to a type of human
being,'' says Hoffman, wearing thick, black-rimmed glasses, a dark
blue suit and black shirt. ``If you respect that you're playing a
certain kind of person that is on the Earth _ and any well-written
part usually is that _ then you must, with care, be accurate and
honest and beautiful. If you're not, then ... give up, because
acting's too tough, and that's just the way it should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, three wildly different roles in equally disparate year-end
feature films showcase a versatility that confirms Hoffman as one
of the most gifted young actors in movies today.
</P>
<P>
   In the just-released ``Flawless,'' he plays a flamboyant New
York drag queen who unexpectedly bonds with his homophobic
neighbor, a conservative security guard played by Robert De Niro,
when the latter suffers a stroke and comes to him for
singing-lesson speech therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's multicharacter ``Magnolia,'' which opens Dec. 17,
presents Hoffman as a visiting nurse whose remarkable day with a
dying television producer played by Jason Robards forces him to
plumb reserves of compassion and quiet heroism he did not know he
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   And in the big-budget period thriller ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley,'' Hoffman plays a wealthy young American having a high old
time in 1950s Italy opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon and Jude
Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawless'' was the brainchild of Joel Schumacher, the director
of such big-budget extravaganzas as the last two Batman movies and
the John Grisham adaptations ``A Time to Kill'' and ``The Client.''
Schumacher wanted to make a smaller scale, more character-based
drama for a change, and ``Flawless'' was inspired by a friend whose
stroke recovery involved extensive singing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman doesn't know where the drag portion of the scenario came
from. He just knows Schumacher chose him over a number of
professional transvestites to play tough-but-tender Rusty _ and
that playing a man who prefers being a girl was an awful lot of
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched videos and documentaries _ and went to drag clubs to
see what my character would do at work,'' Hoffman explains. ``I
discovered that these guys are very affected fellows, especially if
they're living in the drag-queen world, which is quite a flamboyant
and colorful society.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had to decide where I wanted to place Rusty in all of
this. Practicing behaviorally and vocally took about an hour and a
half every day for three months, just preparing myself so that when
I got to the production it would be kind of second nature. He
pretty much lives his life like a woman, and the biggest challenge
was to do all of this stuff that I prepared to do with this guy and
make it as if it was just me. It was tough to have the left side of
the brain going while the right side was churning, keeping all of
that stuff you practiced alive while doing all of the stuff from
moment to moment that's supposed to be very spontaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a general sense of intimidation that comes from
working opposite the greatest actor in American film, and it's no
wonder that Hoffman was in quite a state while making ``Flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a basket case,'' he admits. ``A lot of the movie was
just me and Bob, and I can't imagine what I would have done if
somebody who was a jerk played that part. I'd never had a lead in a
movie, and here I had one in that part? I was out of my tree,
going, `Man, I'm going down in flames!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bob and Joel both, I could tell that they were like, `God
bless him. This is not easy for this kid, just give him all the
support he needs to let him do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reassuring. But Paul Thomas Anderson arguably gave Hoffman an
even greater gift when he wrote a ``Magnolia'' role specifically
for one of his favorite actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's character's name is Phil in the movie, and you can
decipher that as I wrote Phil,'' says Anderson. ``He's been getting
all these parts where he plays characters, drag queens and
whatever, and he's so great at it. But I was kind of sick of seeing
him do that and thought, what if Phil had to play himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``So I wrote Phil, who is that compassionate and that wonderful
and that clear. I didn't let him have any tricks in this movie: no
accent, no props, no weird schtick. So that's Phil Hoffman.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely. Hoffman says the giving, empathetic side of
Phil's nature is probably there in him _ but then, who wouldn't cop
to such flattering traits? But where it comes to Phil's complete
dedication to his job at the expense, apparently, of his personal
life, Hoffman says the guy may as well be from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy doesn't go out, does he?'' Hoffman says. ``He's weird;
he's, like, 28 years old, and he's `I don't want to go out, I want
to take care of dying people and cry about it and stuff.' I mean,
how many 28-year-old men do you know like that? He's as odd a
character as I've played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there are people who are devoting their lives to
this work, and it's really honorable stuff. But this guy I play
doesn't even have a girlfriend (I know Paul loved every moment of
writing that part). I think about sex 24-7, I've got a definite
scope on what that's about in my life, and this guy's putting it on
hold because he knows that there's something more important. That's
a very odd person to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is one of Hoffman's more accessible roles. While
admitting that he's been without a serious girlfriend for a few
years, the actor bristles at the suggestion that he's becoming
typecast as the movies' signature lonely guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really reachin', don't you think?'' he says. ``No, I
don't think it's like that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is the way it is,'' he does concede, ``and what're
you going to do? Me and Brad Pitt in the movie, who gets the girl?
But I'm not saying that to be self-effacing; in fact, I just made a
David Mamet movie (`State and Main,' opening next year) in which
I'm the romantic lead and get the girl at the end. I'm glad I did
it, and that's really good, but that's not going to be my career,
and I don't want it to be my career. Most guys don't end up with
the girl, they have problems with relationships. I want to be in
the movies that deal with the real things.''
</P>
<P>
   But a little fantasy doesn't hurt now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy I play in `Ripley,' he's having a great time,''
Hoffman says of the year-end thriller, which is set among young
jet-setters in the 1950s. ``He's rich, drunk and with a girl every
night!''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman grew up in the Rochester, N.Y., suburb of Fairport. A
sports enthusiast for most of his youth, he got into acting after a
wrestling injury, and attended a summer program in nearby Saratoga
Springs sponsored by the famous Circle Repertory Company. He moved
on to study acting at New York University (his brother, Gordy
Hoffman, became a playwright) and, soon after, established an
impressive stage career.
</P>
<P>
   A good background for the movies, yes. But it is Hoffman's
singular ability to invest the most peculiar individuals with
sympathetic understanding that has enabled him to transcend the
category of character actor and, at least so far, come up with
something unique and original each time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have good empathy for people, and it does help my
acting,'' Hoffman says. ``It's just fascinating to me to understand
people's struggles.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.24 - The Texas Adoption Resource Exchange
received a national award Wednesday for increasing adoptions
through public awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was one of six ``Adoption 2002'' awards given annually
by the Department of Health and Human Services to honor individuals
and organizations for giving abandoned, neglected or abused
children ``a loving family and a safe and nurturing home.''
</P>
<P>
   TARE, part of a string of nation-wide adoption agencies, was the
first organization of its kind to use the Internet and produce
video interviews with parents looking to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``TARE has been instrumental in increasing adoptions in Texas
since 1996 through its public awareness and recruitment campaign,''
said a Health and Human Services press release.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptions in Texas have more than doubled in the last two years,
from 746 to 1,648, according to HHS.

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What connection, if any, did presidential candidate George W.
Bush have to the failed savings and loan institution and subsequent
bailout by the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've answered this question before, but since there seems to
be continuing interest, let's give it another shot in hopes it will
put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush had no connection to the case you're asking
about. It was Neil Bush, one of George W.'s brothers, who was a
figure in the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Colorado. Silverado failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an estimated
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Neil Bush never was charged with criminal wrongdoing,
he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil lawsuit lodged
two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles about British Home Secretary Jack Straw raise
a question I've always wondered about. What does Britain's Home
Office do? What is the equivalent in the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Home Office is the department of the British government
responsible for internal affairs in England and Wales. As its
Internet site states, the office's principal goal is ``to build a
safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and
responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are
properly balanced and the protection and security of the public are
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the Home Office says its aims are the
reduction of crime and the fear of crime; the maintenance of public
safety; the delivery of justice through effective and efficient
investigation, prosecution, trial and sentencing, and through
support for victims of crime; the prevention of terrorism and
protection against threats to national security; the regulation of
the entry of non-citizens into the United Kingdom; and the
maintenance of the safety of the public through civil protection.
</P>
<P>
   There's no exact equivalent in this country. Gillian Cooper of
the British Consulate in Atlanta said that what the Home Office
does is ``a bit of a mixture of the duties and responsibilities of
several agencies at both the federal and state levels'' in the
United States. Think of the FBI, State Department, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and state-level secretaries of state,
and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a Seabee museum that is
being built somewhere in the East? My uncle was a Seabee in World
War II and I inherited many souvenir objects from him. Perhaps a
museum would be interested in the memorabilia. Who can I contact?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Navy Seabee Veterans of America is in the beginning
stages of creating its new museum in Rhode Island. Ed Turner,
former Seabee who is coordinating the project, said it will be part
of the U.S. Navy Seabees Memorial Park, on a 6-acre site at what
used to be the Seabee Center at Davisville, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the veterans' group, ranging in age ``up to
85-plus,'' is very enthusiastic about the museum, and indeed does
welcome donations of memorabilia as well as money. Some items
already donated include uniforms and medals as well as a large
Quonset hut to house the museum.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the park will have several more Quonset huts and
other buildings, Turner said, including the restored Chapel in the
Pines. Construction is expected to take several more years. ``We're
moving along a little at a time,'' he added. ``Most of us are from
World War II and Korea, so we're along in age. Things don't move as
fast as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   For information about donating items, call Turner at
401-732-4565. Checks can be made out to Seabee Memorial Park Fund
and mailed to: Seabee Memorial Park, P.O. Box 646, North Kingstown
02852. Information online can be viewed at www.nsva.org and click
on Davisville Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify Adolf Hitler's last name for me? I thought he
was born with the surname Schicklgruber. If that's the case, why
did he change it to Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   A: Adolf Hitler was the Nazi dictator's birth name. He never
used any other. Born on April 20, 1889, he was the fourth child of
the third marriage of Alois Hitler, a customs official, and Klara
Polzl Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It was Alois Hitler's mother whose surname was Schicklgruber
(first names: Maria Anna). She was unmarried when Alois was born,
but about five years later she married Johann Georg Hiedler, a
wandering miller. Some sources say Hiedler may have been Alois
Hitler's father.
</P>
<P>
   Hiedler died in 1856, when Alois was 20, never having officially
recognized Alois as his child. In 1877, Hiedler's brother arranged
for Alois to be registered as the legitimate son of Johann Georg
and Maria Hiedler. World Book Encyclopedia theorizes that the
priest who made the official entry misspelled the name as
``Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, before he came to power, some of Adolf Hitler's
political opponents in Germany and Austria called him
Schicklgruber, intending it as an insult. That may be the source of
your confusion over his birth name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the recent earthquakes all over the world, can
you give us any tips on what we should do if we're inside a
building when an earthquake strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Emergency Management Agency advises taking cover
under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall. It
warns that the most dangerous thing to do during the shaking is
attempting to leave the building, because objects can fall on you.
So stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross gives similar pointers, adding that you
should stay away from windows and, in a high-rise building, be
prepared for the fire alarms and sprinklers to go off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle a bet? A friend swears that Leonardo DiCaprio
got his start on a TV program when he was a teenager. I think his
show business career is based entirely on his movies. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chalk this one up for your friend. As a teen, DiCaprio landed
a successful, regular role as Luke Brower, a homeless youngster in
ABC's teen sitcom, ``Growing Pains.'' It was a small part that
lasted only for the program's 1991 season, but Leo-watchers say his
performance proved that he had great potential, outshining the rest
of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he had done some minor TV work in commercials and
educational programs such as ``How to Deal With a Parent Who Takes
Drugs'' and ``Mickey's Safety Club.'' He appeared in more than 30
commercials and made guest appearances on such TV shows as
``Lassie,'' ``The Outsiders,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break on the silver screen was his leading role as Toby
in ``This Boy's Life.'' But he'll always be known worldwide for his
role as Jack Dawson in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Ted Turner once managed the Atlanta Braves
for one game. What was that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in May 1977. The Braves were in the midst of a 16-game
losing streak, and the Pittsburgh Pirates were on an 11-game
winning streak. In one of the most hilarious chapters in Braves
history, Turner decided to take over the duties of then-manager
Dave Bristol, giving Bristol a short sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   Turner sensed trouble looming with the National League offices
and even attempted _ and failed _ to reach Chub Feeney, the league
president, for clearance before the game. After Cito Gaston showed
him how to put on his socks, Turner called the staff together and
realigned their responsibilities. The upshot was that the Braves
lost again, 2-1. The next day, Feeney banished Turner from the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is ``racketeering'' defined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simple definition is ``the practice of conducting or
engaging in a racket, such as extortion or bootlegging.'' Black's
Law Dictionary explains further that racketeering is an organized
conspiracy to commit the crimes of extortion and coercion. From the
standpoint of extortion, the dictionary continues, it's the
obtaining of money or property from another, without his consent,
induced by the wrongful use of force or fears. The fear which
constitutes the legally necessary element in extortion is induced
by verbal or written threats of bodily or property harm, it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Racketeering activity, according to the U.S. Code, is organized
criminal activity to commit certain offenses, which include credit
card fraud, loan sharking, money laundering, police corruption and
interstate prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Medal of Honor recipient who was protesting the School of
the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., was quoted as saying he
``renounced the special privileges the medal brought: a lifetime
job with the Veterans Administration and a $600-a-month pension.''
Is that correct? I was under the impression that Medal of Honor
winners received a $200-a-month pension, and that was all.
</P>
<P>
   A: Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to a $600-a-month
stipend from the Department of Veterans Affairs, said VA spokesman
Tom Thomas, ``and that's it,'' unless there's some additional VA
compensation they would be entitled to for disability. Thomas added
that he isn't aware of any kind of federal employment benefits to
which Medal of Honor recipients are entitled through VA programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Charlton Heston, a leading proponent of the right to bear
arms for the purpose of having a ready militia, ever serve in the
military? Or is he strictly a ``silver screen'' veteran?
</P>
<P>
   A: During World War II, Heston served with the 11th Army Air
Force in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. He was an aircraft radio gunner
there for most of his three-year tour, according to Current
Biography Yearbook. He was discharged in early 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As you say, Heston, president of the National Rifle Association,
is outspoken about his belief in the right of citizens to own guns.
He was in the news earlier this month when he spoke before the
House Government Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug
policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that in order for a department store's huge Christmas
tree to stay healthy, it needed 300 gallons of water and 200
aspirin tablets. What would the aspirin have been for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aspirin helps suppress bacteria and micro-organisms that
might clog the cells that transport the water to the top of the
tree. The leaves (or needles) are still pulling water from the base
of the tree, and if micro-organisms plug those cells the tree can't
get any water and will dry out.
</P>
<P>
   The same theory holds true for cut flowers, so if someone gives
you a dozen roses, pop an aspirin or two into their water and trim
their stems to make them last longer.

<P>
   Q: The fight and subsequent expulsion from school of several
black students in Decatur, Ill., has received extensive news
coverage. But I don't remember seeing any reports at the time it
happened in September. What was the background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Described variously as a riot, a grandstand-clearing brawl or
a simple fistfight, the incident occurred Sept. 17 at a football
game between the Eisenhower High School Panthers and the MacArthur
High School Generals. It appears to have been preceded by a fight
that same day between students at the two schools.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chicago Sun-Times reported, the football teams at both
schools were having a dismal season, so city bragging rights were
at stake. The Panthers, who had lost every game before this one,
were leading at the half. At the start of the third quarter,
screams were heard erupting from the stands when the fighting broke
out. It isn't known who started it, but the scene was partially
captured by a spectator's video camera, so some of those involved
could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Four youths were charged with mob action, a felony. One also was
charged with felony aggravated battery and resisting a police
officer, a misdemeanor. Ed Boehm, the MacArthur principal, said his
school received seven injury reports after the fight, mostly for
bruises and abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is leading an effort in support of
the expelled students, pointed out that no bullets were fired and
no bones broken. ``We see more violence than this at a hockey
match,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Dahlonega, Ga., made me wonder about the
discovery of gold in Charlotte, N.C., many years earlier. Can you
refresh my memory about the time lines of gold in both places?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be thinking of the Reed gold mind, now a North
Carolina state historic site, about 30 miles east of Charlotte. It
was the site in 1799 of one of the earliest discoveries of gold in
America. Charlotte's gold discovery came in 1825 when Samuel McComb
found gold at Irwin Creek. The ``rush'' to Charlotte's mines
followed, circa 1830. The Charlotte branch of the U.S. Mint opened
in 1838 and closed in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlonega historians say that in 1828, Benjamin Parks was deer
hunting when he overturned a rock and discovered it to be laced
with gold. In 1838, the Dahlonega branch of the U.S. Mint opened;
it closed, never to reopen, in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849, the California gold rush drew most miners west, with
promises of far more gold than could be found in North Carolina or
Georgia. By 1906, the last large Dahlonega mining company,
Consolidated Mining, closed its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the EgyptAir crash occur in international waters? Why
don't we hear much about Egypt's involvement in the investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The site of the Oct. 31 crash _ which occurred in the
Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Mass. _ is
indeed international waters. Under the International Civil Aviation
Organization treaty, the investigation of a plane crash in
international waters is under the jurisdiction of the country of
registry of the aircraft. However, the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board said the Egyptian government requested that it take
the lead in this investigation, which it initially did. The FBI
took over the investigation later when there was an indication of a
criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian representatives have helped review cockpit
voice recordings. Other agencies and organizations involved in the
early stages included the Federal Aviation Administration, Defense
Department, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Boeing Co., EgyptAir and Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Soon after the crash of EgyptAir flight 990, I heard that
after the plane took off from Los Angeles, it landed at Edwards Air
Force Base in California before continuing to New York. I haven't
seen or heard anything more about that. What can you tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board records show no such
thing, said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. Flight 990 left Los
Angeles at 4:30 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. EDT) Oct. 30. It landed
at Kennedy Airport in New York just over five hours later, at 12:48
a.m. EDT Oct. 31. There was no stop anywhere in between, Holloway
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early reports after the crash of EgyptAir 990 stated that one
body had been recovered. Was that person ever identified?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway
in Washington said the NTSB ``heard that initial report'' about a
body being recovered, but it was false. ``We never stated that we
found a body,'' he addded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The language difficulties encountered with the crash of
EgyptAir flight 990 prompt my question: How do pilots of foreign
airlines communicate with English-speaking people in control
towers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Even those pilots whose first language isn't English are
required to communicate in English with traffic controllers. In
other words, English is the universal language in this situation. A
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said, however,
that the language spoken in the cockpit among pilots and crew is
totally up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of all the known meteors in space, are there any that
actually could break the Earth apart in the event of a collision?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most of the objects we see as meteors are about the size
of a grain of sand. J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy at the
University of Georgia, explains that larger objects, such as small
asteroids _ ranging in diameter from hundreds of feet up to a few
miles _ have hit the Earth over its 4.5-billion-year history and
have been very devastating, forming craters many miles in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, the only object that even came close to
splitting the Earth apart was the collision with an object about
the size of Mars soon after the Earth formed. This collision
produced the debris that formed the moon. ``We know where all the
Mars-sized objects are in the solar system,'' Shaw said. ``They are
the planets, and they're not going to collide with the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A museum exhibit of Norman Rockwell's paintings includes many
years' worth of Saturday Evening Post covers using his artwork.
They appear to have been collected by someone from Burlington,
Iowa, whose name is on the address labels. Do you know anything
about that person, and how he happened to collect them all?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has no
information about the person, or couple, who subscribed to the
Saturday Evening Post and saved all the issues whose covers are on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Rawson of the Rockwell Museum said all that is known is
that the collection was donated in memory of G. Robert Rapp by his
family after his death. It appears that Rapp had purchased the
covers from the original collector, but other than that, she had no
details about the original collector or about Rapp himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockwell Museum, incidentally, says its reference center
welcomes donations to its collections relating to Rockwell's life
and work. The collection presently includes first uses of
Rockwell's artwork, such as magazine covers, and correspondence,
photographs, negatives, slides, films, recordings and original
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available online at www.nrm.org or from the
Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, P.O. Box 308/Route 183,
Stockbridge, MA 01262 (413-298-4100).
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Baby Sitter with Screaming Infant,'' one of Norman
Rockwell's paintings, has an actual diaper pin embedded through the
canvas. Who put it there, and why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rockwell himself gets the credit. ``He was a very funny man
who often included that kind of playful, funny gesture in his
art,'' said Ann Knutson, curator of the Rockwell exhibit at
Atlanta's High Museum of Art. He also did it to add texture and
three dimensions. Rockwell thought that if he simply painted the
pin, and then it was photographed for a Saturday Evening Post
cover, it might not reproduce well. Hence, the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of Norman Rockwell's paintings depicts Rosie the Riveter
of World War II fame. Someone told me there was a real Rosie, but I
never heard that before. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rose Will Monroe, a United Auto Workers riveter in an
aircraft plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., is the real-life person behind
the famous poster character. Her image was created to celebrate the
dedication and resourcefulness of millions of American women who
worked in factories to produce armaments for the United States and
the Allies during the war. The National World War II Memorial
Campaign, which is raising money for a memorial in Washington,
formed the Rose Monroe Society in her name to honor the sacrifice
and effort of those pioneering women. Information: 1-800-639-4992.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to have veterans' names inscribed on the
proposed World War II memorial in Washington by making a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean having names carved into the memorial, no, that's
not part of the design plan. But Betsy Glick of the National World
War II Memorial Campaign says a Registry of Remembrances will be
part of the memorial. She described it as an electronic site on the
order of an Internet site. ``People can honor a family member, a
friend, or a loved one who either served in uniform or who made a
contribution from the home front, such as working in a factory,
growing a Victory Garden, or selling war bonds,'' Glick told Q&AMP;A.
To request a registry form, call 1-800-639-4992. A donation isn't
required to enter a name.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's Donor Book of Remembrances is separate. The book,
with personal listings, will be circulated after the memorial is
dedicated. Donors at various amount levels, starting at $20, will
receive certain items. Those who contribute $1,000 or more will
receive, among other things, prints of the memorial and Norman
Rockwell's ``The Homecoming,'' as well as a listing in the Book of
Remembrances.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions are tax-exempt. Information can be obtained from
the same toll-free number, or online at www.wwiimemorial.com

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What connection, if any, did presidential candidate George W.
Bush have to the failed savings and loan institution and subsequent
bailout by the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've answered this question before, but since there seems to
be continuing interest, let's give it another shot in hopes it will
put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush had no connection to the case you're asking
about. It was Neil Bush, one of George W.'s brothers, who was a
figure in the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Colorado. Silverado failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an estimated
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Neil Bush never was charged with criminal wrongdoing,
he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil lawsuit lodged
two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles about British Home Secretary Jack Straw raise
a question I've always wondered about. What does Britain's Home
Office do? What is the equivalent in the U.S. government?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Home Office is the department of the British government
responsible for internal affairs in England and Wales. As its
Internet site states, the office's principal goal is ``to build a
safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and
responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are
properly balanced and the protection and security of the public are
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the Home Office says its aims are the
reduction of crime and the fear of crime; the maintenance of public
safety; the delivery of justice through effective and efficient
investigation, prosecution, trial and sentencing, and through
support for victims of crime; the prevention of terrorism and
protection against threats to national security; the regulation of
the entry of non-citizens into the United Kingdom; and the
maintenance of the safety of the public through civil protection.
</P>
<P>
   There's no exact equivalent in this country. Gillian Cooper of
the British Consulate in Atlanta said that what the Home Office
does is ``a bit of a mixture of the duties and responsibilities of
several agencies at both the federal and state levels'' in the
United States. Think of the FBI, State Department, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and state-level secretaries of state,
and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a Seabee museum that is
being built somewhere in the East? My uncle was a Seabee in World
War II and I inherited many souvenir objects from him. Perhaps a
museum would be interested in the memorabilia. Who can I contact?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Navy Seabee Veterans of America is in the beginning
stages of creating its new museum in Rhode Island. Ed Turner,
former Seabee who is coordinating the project, said it will be part
of the U.S. Navy Seabees Memorial Park, on a 6-acre site at what
used to be the Seabee Center at Davisville, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the veterans' group, ranging in age ``up to
85-plus,'' is very enthusiastic about the museum, and indeed does
welcome donations of memorabilia as well as money. Some items
already donated include uniforms and medals as well as a large
Quonset hut to house the museum.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the park will have several more Quonset huts and
other buildings, Turner said, including the restored Chapel in the
Pines. Construction is expected to take several more years. ``We're
moving along a little at a time,'' he added. ``Most of us are from
World War II and Korea, so we're along in age. Things don't move as
fast as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   For information about donating items, call Turner at
401-732-4565. Checks can be made out to Seabee Memorial Park Fund
and mailed to: Seabee Memorial Park, P.O. Box 646, North Kingstown
02852. Information online can be viewed at www.nsva.org and click
on Davisville Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify Adolf Hitler's last name for me? I thought he
was born with the surname Schicklgruber. If that's the case, why
did he change it to Hitler?
</P>
<P>
   A: Adolf Hitler was the Nazi dictator's birth name. He never
used any other. Born on April 20, 1889, he was the fourth child of
the third marriage of Alois Hitler, a customs official, and Klara
Polzl Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It was Alois Hitler's mother whose surname was Schicklgruber
(first names: Maria Anna). She was unmarried when Alois was born,
but about five years later she married Johann Georg Hiedler, a
wandering miller. Some sources say Hiedler may have been Alois
Hitler's father.
</P>
<P>
   Hiedler died in 1856, when Alois was 20, never having officially
recognized Alois as his child. In 1877, Hiedler's brother arranged
for Alois to be registered as the legitimate son of Johann Georg
and Maria Hiedler. World Book Encyclopedia theorizes that the
priest who made the official entry misspelled the name as
``Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, before he came to power, some of Adolf Hitler's
political opponents in Germany and Austria called him
Schicklgruber, intending it as an insult. That may be the source of
your confusion over his birth name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the recent earthquakes all over the world, can
you give us any tips on what we should do if we're inside a
building when an earthquake strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Emergency Management Agency advises taking cover
under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall. It
warns that the most dangerous thing to do during the shaking is
attempting to leave the building, because objects can fall on you.
So stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross gives similar pointers, adding that you
should stay away from windows and, in a high-rise building, be
prepared for the fire alarms and sprinklers to go off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle a bet? A friend swears that Leonardo DiCaprio
got his start on a TV program when he was a teenager. I think his
show business career is based entirely on his movies. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chalk this one up for your friend. As a teen, DiCaprio landed
a successful, regular role as Luke Brower, a homeless youngster in
ABC's teen sitcom, ``Growing Pains.'' It was a small part that
lasted only for the program's 1991 season, but Leo-watchers say his
performance proved that he had great potential, outshining the rest
of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he had done some minor TV work in commercials and
educational programs such as ``How to Deal With a Parent Who Takes
Drugs'' and ``Mickey's Safety Club.'' He appeared in more than 30
commercials and made guest appearances on such TV shows as
``Lassie,'' ``The Outsiders,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break on the silver screen was his leading role as Toby
in ``This Boy's Life.'' But he'll always be known worldwide for his
role as Jack Dawson in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Ted Turner once managed the Atlanta Braves
for one game. What was that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in May 1977. The Braves were in the midst of a 16-game
losing streak, and the Pittsburgh Pirates were on an 11-game
winning streak. In one of the most hilarious chapters in Braves
history, Turner decided to take over the duties of then-manager
Dave Bristol, giving Bristol a short sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   Turner sensed trouble looming with the National League offices
and even attempted _ and failed _ to reach Chub Feeney, the league
president, for clearance before the game. After Cito Gaston showed
him how to put on his socks, Turner called the staff together and
realigned their responsibilities. The upshot was that the Braves
lost again, 2-1. The next day, Feeney banished Turner from the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is ``racketeering'' defined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simple definition is ``the practice of conducting or
engaging in a racket, such as extortion or bootlegging.'' Black's
Law Dictionary explains further that racketeering is an organized
conspiracy to commit the crimes of extortion and coercion. From the
standpoint of extortion, the dictionary continues, it's the
obtaining of money or property from another, without his consent,
induced by the wrongful use of force or fears. The fear which
constitutes the legally necessary element in extortion is induced
by verbal or written threats of bodily or property harm, it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Racketeering activity, according to the U.S. Code, is organized
criminal activity to commit certain offenses, which include credit
card fraud, loan sharking, money laundering, police corruption and
interstate prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Medal of Honor recipient who was protesting the School of
the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga., was quoted as saying he
``renounced the special privileges the medal brought: a lifetime
job with the Veterans Administration and a $600-a-month pension.''
Is that correct? I was under the impression that Medal of Honor
winners received a $200-a-month pension, and that was all.
</P>
<P>
   A: Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to a $600-a-month
stipend from the Department of Veterans Affairs, said VA spokesman
Tom Thomas, ``and that's it,'' unless there's some additional VA
compensation they would be entitled to for disability. Thomas added
that he isn't aware of any kind of federal employment benefits to
which Medal of Honor recipients are entitled through VA programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Charlton Heston, a leading proponent of the right to bear
arms for the purpose of having a ready militia, ever serve in the
military? Or is he strictly a ``silver screen'' veteran?
</P>
<P>
   A: During World War II, Heston served with the 11th Army Air
Force in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. He was an aircraft radio gunner
there for most of his three-year tour, according to Current
Biography Yearbook. He was discharged in early 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As you say, Heston, president of the National Rifle Association,
is outspoken about his belief in the right of citizens to own guns.
He was in the news earlier this month when he spoke before the
House Government Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug
policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that in order for a department store's huge Christmas
tree to stay healthy, it needed 300 gallons of water and 200
aspirin tablets. What would the aspirin have been for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aspirin helps suppress bacteria and micro-organisms that
might clog the cells that transport the water to the top of the
tree. The leaves (or needles) are still pulling water from the base
of the tree, and if micro-organisms plug those cells the tree can't
get any water and will dry out.
</P>
<P>
   The same theory holds true for cut flowers, so if someone gives
you a dozen roses, pop an aspirin or two into their water and trim
their stems to make them last longer.

school received seven injury reports after the fight, mostly for
bruises and abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is leading an effort in support of
the expelled students, pointed out that no bullets were fired and
no bones broken. ``We see more violence than this at a hockey

</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Dahlonega, Ga., made me wonder about the
discovery of gold in Charlotte, N.C., many years earlier. Can you
refresh my memory about the time lines of gold in both places?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be thinking of the Reed gold mind, now a North
Carolina state historic site, about 30 miles east of Charlotte. It
was the site in 1799 of one of the earliest discoveries of gold in
America. Charlotte's gold discovery came in 1825 when Samuel McComb
found gold at Irwin Creek. The ``rush'' to Charlotte's mines

with gold. In 1838, the Dahlonega branch of the U.S. Mint opened;
it closed, never to reopen, in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849, the California gold rush drew most miners west, with
promises of far more gold than could be found in North Carolina or
Georgia. By 1906, the last large Dahlonega mining company,
Consolidated Mining, closed its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the EgyptAir crash occur in international waters? Why
don't we hear much about Egypt's involvement in the investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The site of the Oct. 31 crash _ which occurred in the
Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Mass. _ is
indeed international waters. Under the International Civil Aviation
Organization treaty, the investigation of a plane crash in
international waters is under the jurisdiction of the country of
registry of the aircraft. However, the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board said the Egyptian government requested that it take
the lead in this investigation, which it initially did. The FBI
took over the investigation later when there was an indication of a
criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian representatives have helped review cockpit
voice recordings. Other agencies and organizations involved in the
early stages included the Federal Aviation Administration, Defense
Department, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Boeing Co., EgyptAir and Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Soon after the crash of EgyptAir flight 990, I heard that
after the plane took off from Los Angeles, it landed at Edwards Air
Force Base in California before continuing to New York. I haven't
seen or heard anything more about that. What can you tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board records show no such
thing, said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. Flight 990 left Los
Angeles at 4:30 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. EDT) Oct. 30. It landed
at Kennedy Airport in New York just over five hours later, at 12:48
a.m. EDT Oct. 31. There was no stop anywhere in between, Holloway
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early reports after the crash of EgyptAir 990 stated that one
body had been recovered. Was that person ever identified?
</P>
<P>
   A: National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway
in Washington said the NTSB ``heard that initial report'' about a
body being recovered, but it was false. ``We never stated that we
found a body,'' he addded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The language difficulties encountered with the crash of
EgyptAir flight 990 prompt my question: How do pilots of foreign
airlines communicate with English-speaking people in control
towers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Even those pilots whose first language isn't English are
required to communicate in English with traffic controllers. In
other words, English is the universal language in this situation. A
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said, however,
that the language spoken in the cockpit among pilots and crew is
totally up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of all the known meteors in space, are there any that
actually could break the Earth apart in the event of a collision?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Most of the objects we see as meteors are about the size
of a grain of sand. J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy at the
University of Georgia, explains that larger objects, such as small
asteroids _ ranging in diameter from hundreds of feet up to a few
miles _ have hit the Earth over its 4.5-billion-year history and
have been very devastating, forming craters many miles in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, the only object that even came close to
splitting the Earth apart was the collision with an object about
the size of Mars soon after the Earth formed. This collision
produced the debris that formed the moon. ``We know where all the
Mars-sized objects are in the solar system,'' Shaw said. ``They are
the planets, and they're not going to collide with the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A museum exhibit of Norman Rockwell's paintings includes many
years' worth of Saturday Evening Post covers using his artwork.
They appear to have been collected by someone from Burlington,
Iowa, whose name is on the address labels. Do you know anything
about that person, and how he happened to collect them all?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has no
information about the person, or couple, who subscribed to the
Saturday Evening Post and saved all the issues whose covers are on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Rawson of the Rockwell Museum said all that is known is
that the collection was donated in memory of G. Robert Rapp by his
family after his death. It appears that Rapp had purchased the
covers from the original collector, but other than that, she had no
details about the original collector or about Rapp himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockwell Museum, incidentally, says its reference center
welcomes donations to its collections relating to Rockwell's life
and work. The collection presently includes first uses of
Rockwell's artwork, such as magazine covers, and correspondence,
photographs, negatives, slides, films, recordings and original
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available online at www.nrm.org or from the
Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, P.O. Box 308/Route 183,
Stockbridge, MA 01262 (413-298-4100).
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Baby Sitter with Screaming Infant,'' one of Norman
Rockwell's paintings, has an actual diaper pin embedded through the
canvas. Who put it there, and why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rockwell himself gets the credit. ``He was a very funny man
who often included that kind of playful, funny gesture in his
art,'' said Ann Knutson, curator of the Rockwell exhibit at
Atlanta's High Museum of Art. He also did it to add texture and
three dimensions. Rockwell thought that if he simply painted the
pin, and then it was photographed for a Saturday Evening Post
cover, it might not reproduce well. Hence, the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of Norman Rockwell's paintings depicts Rosie the Riveter
of World War II fame. Someone told me there was a real Rosie, but I
never heard that before. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rose Will Monroe, a United Auto Workers riveter in an
aircraft plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., is the real-life person behind
the famous poster character. Her image was created to celebrate the
dedication and resourcefulness of millions of American women who
worked in factories to produce armaments for the United States and
the Allies during the war. The National World War II Memorial
Campaign, which is raising money for a memorial in Washington,
formed the Rose Monroe Society in her name to honor the sacrifice
and effort of those pioneering women. Information: 1-800-639-4992.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to have veterans' names inscribed on the
proposed World War II memorial in Washington by making a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean having names carved into the memorial, no, that's
not part of the design plan. But Betsy Glick of the National World
War II Memorial Campaign says a Registry of Remembrances will be
part of the memorial. She described it as an electronic site on the
order of an Internet site. ``People can honor a family member, a
friend, or a loved one who either served in uniform or who made a
contribution from the home front, such as working in a factory,
growing a Victory Garden, or selling war bonds,'' Glick told Q&AMP;A.
To request a registry form, call 1-800-639-4992. A donation isn't
required to enter a name.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's Donor Book of Remembrances is separate. The book,
with personal listings, will be circulated after the memorial is
dedicated. Donors at various amount levels, starting at $20, will
receive certain items. Those who contribute $1,000 or more will
receive, among other things, prints of the memorial and Norman
Rockwell's ``The Homecoming,'' as well as a listing in the Book of
Remembrances.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions are tax-exempt. Information can be obtained from
the same toll-free number, or online at www.wwiimemorial.com

   BONFIRE _ Eric Etheridge climbed off the towering wooden
structure, looked up and noticed a slight tilt. From his perch on
the fourth stack, Derek Woodley's swing dipped suddenly. Both heard
an ear-splintering crack and nightmarish chaos ensued as they and
dozens of their Texas A&AMP;M University classmates tumbled to the
ground along with hundreds of tree trunks. No one can say for sure
what caused the Aggie Bonfire to collapse a week ago, killing 12
students and injuring 27. University President Robert Bowen's
special task force is only now beginning the arduous and
months-long task of interviewing witnesses like Etheridge and
Woodley, and sifting through the rumors, photographs, and piles of
lumber in search of answers. However, interviews with a dozen
students working on the bonfire that night suggest a number of
consistencies. (Copelin/Spencer, Austin American-Statesman). 40.

laws. Thousands of digital, CD-quality music files are floating
across the World Wide Web. Some are offered by their creators, who
hope to spur interest in their work by giving away a sample. But
many are copied and traded illegally, depriving musicians and
record companies of money that, in all likelihood, is exponentially
greater than the $1 million a day lost from bootleg tapes and CDs,

On strength of star and script, `Rosetta' commands attention  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  3 stars  
(Eds: Not for use before Friday, Nov. 26) 
By Bob Strauss 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rosetta'' won the best picture prize at the Cannes Film
Festival, and its amateur star, 18-year-old Emilie Dequenne, copped
the fest's best actress award. This uncompromising Belgian drama
certainly earned its accolades _ it's raw and exquisitely
controlled at the same time, and Dequenne's fierce, focused energy
is a relentless marvel.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this means that the film is anything akin to a
pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   With a frenzied, tightly framed hand-held camera that quickly
achieves that delightful ``Blair Witch'' nausea effect, directors
Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne plunge us into the desperate world of
Dequenne's Rosetta. A rough-edged adolescent who lives in a grimy
trailer with her near-catatonically alcoholic mom (Anne Yernaux),
Rosetta longs for the consistency that a job _ any job _ would
bring to her life.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, no matter how hard she works, she can't keep one. We
initially see her charging frantically through a factory, running
from the supervisor who wants to lay her off. She hides and fights
him tooth and nail, as if he were trying to steal her soul (which,
by her reckoning, he is).
</P>
<P>
   Wandering the streets of a grubby industrial town, she gets
brief work from a waffle stand entrepreneur who then has to replace
her with his no-account son. One of the guy's clerks, Riquet
(Fabrizio Rongione), takes a shine to Rosetta, but she's more
interested in appropriating his job than responding to his
affection. In one remarkable scene, Riquet falls into a muddy
canal, and she seriously contemplates letting him drown for the
outside hope of a minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rosetta herself had been flung into the same slippery
muck by a mother who didn't wish to visit a rehab facility.
Flopping about and crying ``I can't get out'' as the older woman
disappears in search of her next bottle, the moment pretty much
sums up the girl's life in one vivid, resonant symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Furious as Dequenne's performance often is, it is also marked by
steadying (yet heartbreaking) periods of self-made busywork.
Rosetta trolls for fish she throws back, obsesses over boots she
hides in wooded dugouts and tries to do anything else that can seem
like work, or can at least momentarily distract her from the
awfulness she otherwise breathes. It's an impressively complete and
modulated performance, one of the few marked by emotional outbursts
that is actually enriched by quieter moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Dardenne brothers, whose last film was the impressive ``La
Promesse,'' continue their startlingly moral, uncondescending
fascination with contemporary capitalism's born rejects here. They
never ask us to cry for Rosetta _ she's too obnoxious for that _
yet there's narry a second when she doesn't earn our sympathy. You
wish that she could earn a decent living with similar efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   And many will wish that they'd never been exposed to such a
convincingly dire life. There is a flurry of
irresponsible-mom/practical-daughter movies out at the moment.
``Anywhere But Here'' is pure Hollywood fakery, and
``Tumbleweeds,'' though more honest, lets actresses indulge wayward
theatricality far too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosetta'' is far and away the most truthful, unflinching and
creative of the three _ the idea that Rosetta's overdeveloped sense
of responsibility is a form of pathology is, in and of itself, a
brilliant notion. The film deserves nothing but praise for these
qualities. Sitting through it, of course, is another matter
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: Emilie Dequenne, Fabrizio Rongione, Anne Yernaux,
Olivier Gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes: Written and directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre
Dardenne. Produced by the Dardennes and Michele and Laurent Petin.

   OPERATION-SMILE-II (Beijing) _ In recent months, Operation Smile
has been the recipient of coveted awards for assisting poor
children, as well as the target of increasingly loud criticism
about its shoddy medical practices. Last August, at the Plastic
Surgery Hospital on the outskirts of Beijing, the organization
clearly showed its potential to temper its good work with bad. A
Special Report, the second of two parts, by Elisabeth Rosenthal and
Reed Abelson.

<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-MISSILES (Beijing) _ China's chief of arms control
issued a new warning today that American plans for a national
missile defense system, even if intended to stop attacks from rogue
states like North Korea and Iraq, would set off a global arms race
and cause more countries to develop nuclear weapons. By Erik

<P>
   COLO-RITALIN-SCHOOLS (Denver) _ The Colorado Board of Education
has become the first in the nation to adopt a policy against

as we gather together. By Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THANKSGIVING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GIVING-THANKS-I (New York) _ A factory worker walked by a
homeless man near the Port Authority for years; once, he tossed a
couple of quarters his way. Thus is set in motion a remarkable
story of charity, kinship, coincidence and reunion. The worker
befriended the homeless man, cleaned him up, discovered he was from
same part of Virginia and vowed to take him home to his mother,
whose church had been praying for him for three years. Now back
home, the homeless man, Raymond, is playing the organ for the
church choir. By Randy Kennedy.

</P>
<P>
   GIVING-THANKS-III (New York) _ Ten Thanksgivings ago, Iris
Sanchez, on strike from a low-paying job, made 30 turkey sandwiches
and gave them to the homeless in her Brooklyn neighborhood. Now she
feeds 1,000 hungry, often homeless people each week, and organizes
language classes and health exams for them. For her it's about
gratitude: on successive Thanksgivings, years earlier, her
ex-husband almost succeeded in murdering her. By Jan Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   THANKSGIVING-BAND (New York) _ The Athens, Texas, high school
band is marching in the Thanksgiving Day Parade. We see how they
like New York. Athens is the hometown of Nicole Barrett, the woman
who is hospitalized in New York after being attacked last week on
the street by a man with a paving stone. By Winnie Hu.

</P>
<P>
   TOYS (Undated) _ The toy craze of the holiday shopping season?
It must be Pokemon. As many as 1 in 5 of the toys, games and books
given to children this season will have a Pokemon theme, said Chris
Byrne, the editor of The Toy Report, a weekly newsletter. ``Kids
can't seem to get enough of it,'' said a spokeswoman for Toys ``R''
Us, But they may not get exactly what they want. Some of the the
most popular Pokemon items, like trading cards and cuddly Pikachu
dolls that also say their name, are in short supply. Stung by last
year's disappointing holiday season, toy manufacturers expect sales
to rebound this year. The other big sellers are expected to include
some familiar names in new incarnations: Rock and Roll Elmo and
Rock and Roll Ernie from ``Sesame Street` and Flight Control Buzz
Lightyear and Strumming' Singing' Woody from ``Toy Story 2.'' By
Terry Pristin.
</P>
<P>
   MANNESMANN-VODAFONE (Hong Kong) _ As Mannesmann and Vodafone
AirTouch roll out the heavy artillery for their bitter takeover
battle, there is already one undisputed victor: Li Ka-shing, the
billionaire developer and chairman of Hutchison Whampoa. No matter
who wins, he stands to make a multi-billion dollar profit. By Mark
Landler.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-FRANCE (Undated) _ The French government, for a second
time, blocks the $733 million sale of Orangina to Coca-Cola on
antitrust grounds, another setback in Coke's efforts to build up
its European business. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Economic growth was substantially
stronger in the third quarter than previously thought, powered by
rising inventories, vigorous consumption and an improved trade
performance, the Commerce Department says in revising an earlier
estimate. The gross domestic product rose at a steep 5.5 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, higher than the 4.8 percent
originally reported, and above Wall Street economists' expectations
for an annual rate of growth of 5 to 5.2 percent. By Robert D.
Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-AIRLINE (Mexico City) _ The Mexican airline Taesa,
accused of shoddy maintenance practices by its former flight
attendants, has been grounded by Mexican authorities two weeks
after the crash of one of its DC-9's killed 18 people. By Sam
Dillon.

 &HT;    LACKING AGREEMENT ON EXIT, ISRAEL MIGHT LIMIT CHRISTIANS ACCESS
TO CHURCH
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Worried about a millennium year disaster, an Israeli
official Wednesday said police may limit access in peak times at
one of Christianity's holiest sites, the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous stone church, believed by Roman Catholic and
Orthodox Christians to be the site of Christ's crucifixion, expects
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims next year to mark the 2000 years
since Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   The church only has one exit from its main chambers. Already, as
the swell of millennial tourists begins, the church is hosting
10,000 visitors on some days. They pack shoulder-to-shoulder crowds
in some of the passages between its shrines and chapels.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have tried for more than a year to win
approval from church leaders to install an emergency exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not open an emergency gate, then maybe the police
will have to limit the number of people who can enter,'' said
Israel's Christian Communities Department Director Uri Mor.
</P>
<P>
   Mor singled out for special concern the Holy Saturday services
of Greek Orthodox worshippers. A day before Easter, the ceremony
usually packs the church with more than 15,000 people holding lit
candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be much choice but to limit the number,'' Mor
said. ``It is a very, very, very, dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said police may also have to set quotas on other days, which
would be the first time Israel has done that.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders could not be reached after Mor's remarks
Wednesday, but they have been reticent to make any changes to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``With deep faith, we believe that God will protect all these
pilgrims. All the pilgrims believe that,'' Metropolitan Timothy, a
leading local bishop with the Greek Orthodox Church, said earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israeli officials fear a repeat of a 19th century fire that
killed several hundred worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Mor said he is about to enter another round of negotiations with
church leaders, but he was not optimistic about the emergency exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it coming close to reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments Wednesday came amid several incidents of religious
acrimony in the approach to the year 2000, when the Jewish state is
to host millions of pilgrims at Christian sites.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in memory and possibly centuries, the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher and other shrines closed their doors to
visitors for two days earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders were protesting Israel's permitting the
construction of a mosque near the Basilica of the Annunciation in
Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders wanted to use the space for a visitors plaza.
They accused the Israeli government of creating bitterness between
Christians and Muslims by encouraging militant Muslims who wanted
the mosque. A visitors plaza will still be constructed on
two-thirds of the area.
</P>
<P>
   But, dissatisfied with the compromise proposals, a
representative of the Vatican criticized Israel saying it was
``instigating division'' between religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy lashed back at the statement
Wednesday, calling it ``the opposite of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, Israeli police arrested a Jewish man and
accused him of trying set fire to a Russian Orthodox Church in the
city of Tiberias.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Holy Sepulcher, in Jerusalem's Old City, is
governed mainly by Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian
churches. Syrian Orthodox, Coptic and Ethiopian churches also pray
there.
</P>
<P>
   For 147 years, the church has been governed by a ``status quo''
agreement that dictates exactly which areas the different churches
control. Battles have broken out over who would clean a single
step, since caring for an area is taken to signify ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church is the rocky alter where Christ is believed to
have been crucified, the stone slab on which his body was prepared
for entombment, and the tomb from which he is believed to have
risen.
</P>
<P>
   Mor said church leaders have agreed in concept to the emergency
door, but not agreed on where it should be placed. They also have
disputed who should control the keys to the door. Some want only
the denomination that owns the space where the door is placed to
hold the key, while others want all denominations to have keys.

 &HT;    Welcome to Walt's world - the real one
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disneyphiles of all ages are going to want ``Remembering Walt''
(Hyperion, $29.95), an enchanting oral history of Walt Disney as
remembered by everyone from such trusted animators as Frank Thomas
and Ollie Johnston to actors like Kurt Russell to the pilot of his
private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Howard Green and Amy Boothe Green made wise use of
material from the Disney archives, so we get to hear Walt's late
wife Lillian, as well as others who have gone to the big
Cinderella's Castle in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The book is full of previously unpublished art. I particularly
enjoyed the family snapshots _ the Disneys at their wedding
anniversary, their kids' birthdays, etc., which were found in
Disney's desk after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo for the holidays
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine a more meaningful book for the holiday season
than ``Michelangelo: The Pietas'' (Abbeville) a slipcased volume
that covers, in exhausting detail, the three sculptures in which
the soul of his age struggled with the idea of the Madonna and her
dead child.
</P>
<P>
   Most people prefer the Pieta in the Vatican, but I like the
unfinished one in Florence (The third, in Milan, was the piece he
was working on when he died; I've never seen it.) I have no idea
how he made the one in the Vatican, but the unfinished state of the
Florentine Pieta, the leg he struck off in a fit of rage, the
chisel marks still on most of the marble, give us a vision of the
artist's struggles that make the perfection he achieved elsewhere
even more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley . . .

<P>
   Although Daphne du Maurier was one of the most popular authors
of her time, the reality of this ever-speeding-up culture is that
no one is more than two generations from obscurity. Other than the

 &HT;    MOVIE REVIEW: End of Days
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five weeks and counting until the new millennium, when doomsday
thrillers such as ``End of Days'' will thankfully be things of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schwarzenegger's first film since 1997's frostily
received ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' preys on premillennial fears by staging
the biblical book of Revelation as an abhorrently violent action
flick, in which Satan assumes human form to take a bride in the
hour before midnight on New Year's Eve 1999. To vanquish his foe,
Arnie must put his faith in God, not a grenade launcher, but he
blows up a lot of stuff before coming to that realization.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' recalls the recent and similarly awful religious
thriller, ``The Omega Code,'' albeit with a much bigger budget and
considerably more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Peter Hyams (''The Relic''), the film is a seriously
disturbing orgy of carnage and computer-generated effects. Though
we expect a fair amount of mayhem from Schwarzenegger movies, ``End
of Days'' is awash in gratuitous violence, pointless explosions and
more gore than most folks probably can stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The story is as subtle as a sledgehammer, pitting
Schwarzenegger's gritty lost soul, Jericho Cane, against the Prince
of Darkness (Gabriel Byrne) to protect the latter's chosen bride,
Christine York (Robin Tunney), and prevent the end of the world.
Cane is a hard-drinking ex-cop who lost his faith after his family
was brutally murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' holds some initial intrigue as Cane and his
comic-relief sidekick, Chicago (Kevin Pollack), are caught unaware
between a rogue sect of Vatican assassins and a ``Rosemary's
Baby''-like cabal of Satanists. However, the film quickly dissolves
into a dull, gruesome game of cat-and-mouse that just gets worse as
it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Satan first rises up from the New York City sewers in
transparent form, looking much like Schwarzenegger's adversary in
``Predator.'' Setting the ridiculous tone of the film, he randomly
takes the form of a darkly handsome Wall Street banker (Byrne), who
returns to his restaurant table and forcibly gropes his companion's
wife. He then exits the restaurant, which promptly explodes for no
apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Plot holes abound, such as why Satan hires Cane and Chicago as
his bodyguards, when his bullet wounds heal themselves. The bigger
question is why aren't religious groups protesting the film, as
they did with Kevin Smith's smart apocalyptic comedy, ``Dogma?''
</P>
<P>
   Hyams' mind-numbing horror show features scenes of a priest
being gored through his skull with a crucifix and Cane being
crucified above the entrance of a Catholic church, to name but two
offensive images. Revolting close-ups of a mutilated corpse and
countless shots of mangled living flesh make the film tougher to
watch than ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' is Schwarzenegger's first film since his two
life-threatening open-heart operations in April 1997 to fix a
congenitally defective heart valve. The action star looks as strong
as ever and performs a number of impressive but ludicrous stunts,
such as chasing a hit man across a roof top while suspended on a
rope ladder from a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger keeps the quips to a bare minimum, but he mauls
much of his dialogue, especially when he snaps at Satan: ``You're a
choir boy compared to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack (A Few Good Men) gets in a few good lines before his
character is killed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' features some stylish visuals, but like the evil
spirit in ``The Haunting,'' Satan ultimately proves to be a big,
disappointing special effect.
</P>
<P>
   The end of this short-lived genre can't come soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Director: PETER HYAMS; Starring: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, GABRIEL
BYRNE, ROBIN TUNNEY, KEVIN POLLACK; 118 minutes; Intense violence
and gore, a strong sex scene and profanity

 &HT;    Mountain mystery: The Mallory and Irvine story told in ``Ghosts
of Everest''
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Mallory was last seen alive on June 8, 1924. He and
Andrew Irvine were at 27,000 feet and moving over a ridge, about
three hours from their goal, the summit of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 75 years, that has been the sum total of knowledge
about Mallory's last day. He and Irvine never returned, and whether
they made it to the top before dying (a full 29 years before Sir
Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay conclusively conquered Everest)
has been the subject of many books and much speculation in the
climbing subculture.
</P>
<P>
   George Leigh Mallory was one of those strange, obsessive,
severely handsome Englishmen _ T.E. Lawrence was another
contemporaneous example _ capable of capturing the world's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lawrence, nothing in Mallory's life prepared him for what
he was determined to be. He had been an indifferent schoolmaster, a
lecturer, and at the time of his last expedition was the assistant
secretary of the Board of Extra-Mural Studies at Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But all who knew him agreed that he was an extraordinary
climber, with a strange, unorthodox style that enabled him to give
the impression of gliding up a mountain. If anybody could have
climbed Everest, given the primitive equipment and clothing of the
time, it was Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an expedition formed solely to search for the
bodies of Mallory and Irvine achieved half their goal by finding
Mallory. A bare five months later, the first of what will be many
books on the subject has appeared.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't a lot of clues to enable them in their search. For
their reference point, the expedition decided to use the camp of a
Chinese expedition of some 30 years ago that had reported finding
``English dead'' very nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It was, for the most part, guesswork; the expedition's
braintrust, one Jochen Hemmler, was a young amateur climbing
historian who was himself only a nominal climber. He studied photos
of the Chinese expedition and found reference points on the
mountain that told the expedition where to look for the
long-abandoned Chinese camp, hence the ``English dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot was on the North Ridge, and as the expedition began
fanning out from the site of the Chinese camp, they stumbled across
a virtual graveyard of abandoned bodies (it's a practical
impossibility to bring a dead body down from Everest, so people are
left where they drop).
</P>
<P>
   The tangled bodies disabused the expedition about the cause of
death of most Everest casualties _ not exhaustion and exposure, but
a misstep and a drop of thousands of feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest'' spends too much time on the makeup and
details of Mallory's ascent, and too little about the men who found
his body. We learn that there were great tensions between the
sponsors and the team; that the BBC, which was financing part of
the expedition in return for video rights, was untrustworthy at
best and dishonest at worst.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, the authors keep their eye on the ball
and don't let the narrative bog down in accounts of internecine
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Mallory's body was found without too much
trouble, and, despite his paltry clothing _ George Bernard Shaw
said that men like Mallory dressed as if they were going to a
picnic in the Connemaras _ in amazingly good condition because of
the permafrost.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory had fallen and broken a leg and, probably, some ribs,
and had suffered a bad wound to the forehead that was probably the
immediate cause of death. Irvine presumably met the same fate at
the same time _ the two men had been tethered together _ but the
whereabouts of his body remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition was hoping for a conclusive answer to the
ultimate question, but it didn't get it. Mallory had been carrying
a collapsible Kodak camera so he could memorialize a successful
ascent, but it wasn't found on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing the expedition found invalidates the possibility that
Mallory and Irvine made it to the top, but nothing proves it,
either. One teasing thing: Mallory always said that if he made it,
he was going to put a picture of his beloved wife at the top of the
mountain. There was no picture of Ruth Mallory found on his body.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not lose our heads. Mallory might have made it, but
someone killed by Everest can hardly be said to have conquered the
mountain. What is clear is that they were coming down after dark _
Mallory wasn't wearing his sungoggles _ and that the two men had
climbed higher than anybody else ever had.
</P>
<P>
   After examining Mallory's body, and removing the contents of his
pockets, the expedition gave him the best burial they could,
covering him with a cairn of rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments will continue, of course, but ``Ghosts of
Everest'' adds a great deal of knowledge that helps add some facts
to a romantic historical legend, as well as serving as a spur for a
continued search for the body of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The book features a touching introduction by Mallory's daughter
and the best definition of why men climb mountains I've ever read.
</P>
<P>
   It comes from Jochen Hemmler, who says that ``during a couple of
hours of climbing, you can experience more than you would in a week
elsewhere. Your senses are completely alert when you're climbing _
hearing, breathing, smelling, everything _ and you begin to get a
glimpse of how deep the feeling of being alive can really become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think climbers climb to risk death; I think they climb
to prove to themselves that they are not already dead.''

 &HT;    'Hitler's Niece' makes you want to cry 'uncle'
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Mel Brooks' classic movie ``The Producers,'' Zero Mostel
deliberately produces a musical called ``Springtime for Hitler,''
thinking it will be a huge flop on Broadway and he can make off
with the investors' money. Ron Hansen, I'm afraid, has written
``Springtime for Hitler'' by accident.
</P>
<P>
   That's not his intention, and, indeed, Hitler commits murder at
the end of his novel. But for the long trudge to the end, Hansen
has to describe the domestic life of a Fuhrer. Hitler is a doting
uncle. He picnics in the Alps. He plays with his doggy. He attends
the opera. He nibbles sweets.
</P>
<P>
   His half-sister, Angela, and her daughter, Geli, come from
not-so-genteel poverty in Austria to do his cooking and cleaning.
But the work is done in half a day, and then it's time for play.
Uncle Adolf lavishes gifts on his niece, has his chauffeur take her
motoring and praises her limited accomplishments. It's gemutlich.
</P>
<P>
   As time goes on, a) Hitler becomes sexually obsessed with his
niece, and b) she finds out about his mistress, Eva Braun. Besides
Eva and consanguinity, there are other problems with his love for
Geli. For one thing, he has odd ways of performing sex. For
another, he is 34, she is 15 when they meet. She's 23 when his
jealous possessiveness drives him to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is more or less documented. When Geli Raubal's death
was ruled a suicide after a less-than-zealous investigation,
anti-Nazi newspapers doubted it. Hitler's alleged preference for
sex as a non-contact sport found its way into a psychological
profile of him written for the Office of Strategic Services during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosenbaum, in his recent ``Explaining Hitler,'' traced the
sex tales to Hitler's enemies, who didn't have firsthand
information (who before Ken Starr ever did?). Rosenbaum doubted
this version of the Geli saga, but the folklore is out there to be
exploited by a novelist.
</P>
<P>
   But is it worth exploiting?
</P>
<P>
   Start with the title character. About all we know about her
personality is that many Nazis found her charming. How expert about
charm were Nazis? Hansen makes her a liberated woman with a sharp
eye for phoniness and a healthy (considering her associates)
cynicism whose put-downs exude irony.
</P>
<P>
   I find her irony unlikely, given the era and her small-town
background.
</P>
<P>
   Other personalities in the story come straight from standard
reference works: ``She did not meet Hermann Goering until May 1928,
but she'd heard a great deal about him, for, next to her uncle, he
was the most famous Nazi in Germany. She was told by Putzi
Hanfstaengl _ whose job as foreign press officer obligated him to
know _ that Goering's father, the first governor of West Africa and
a former consul general in Haiti, had been 64 years old when
Hermann was born in 1893, and had named his son after a friend who
was . . .'' etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? As Hansen portrays her, Geli wouldn't have
paid attention to a single word Hanfstaengl said on the subject.
And she's the viewpoint character. If she wouldn't care, why should
we?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's history as fiction, and the reason for caring about
the history is that Uncle Adolf launched the mother of all European
bloodbaths and went on to have Jews murdered because they were
Jews, Russians murdered because they were communists, homosexuals
murdered because they reminded him of the mentally retarded whom he
was also having murdered, and Poles murdered because he just didn't
like Poles.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing all that, to picture him murdering his niece doesn't
really take the skills of such a highly regarded novelist as Ron
Hansen. Hitler doesn't wave a gun until Page 179. Until then, the
most important thing about that character has been simply omitted,
and anybody's bachelor uncle could be substituted for him.

 &HT;    A shiny new `TOY': Sequel is season's must-have ticket
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like G.I. Joe with lifelike hair or bendable Barbie, ``Toy Story
2'' is a rare sequel that's better than the original.
</P>
<P>
   The wildly imaginative follow-up to the 1995 computer-animated
blockbuster improves with more realistic animation and a
surprisingly deep and poignant storyline. The delightful
comedy-adventure also introduces a marvelous array of new
characters, including Woody's Roundup Gang and Buzz Lightyear's
arch nemesis, Emperor Zurg.
</P>
<P>
   The film's humor, which includes hilarious riffs on ``Star
Wars,'' ``James Bond'' and ``Lassie,'' works on multiple levels and
will have viewers of all ages roaring with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The action-packed plot, which sends Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen)
to the rescue when Woody (Tom Hanks) is stolen by an obsessive toy
collector, is fraught with edge-of-your-seat peril.
</P>
<P>
   The thrilling climax, which pays homage to Hollywood westerns,
is as exciting as an Indiana Jones movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' picks up with Andy heading off to Cowboy Camp.
His favorite toy, Woody, is left behind because of a torn arm and
inadvertently winds up as part of a yard sale. There he is snatched
away by Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight), owner of Al's Toy Barn.
</P>
<P>
   At Al's apartment, Woody learns he is a highly valued
collectible from a Howdy Doody-style 1950s television show called
``Woody's Roundup.'' The show was a pop-culture phenomenon, but was
canceled because of the sudden demand for spaceman toys following
the launch of Sputnik _ echoing the Woody-Buzz rivalry of the first
film.
</P>
<P>
   Woody completes a prized collection that also includes cowgirl
Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the
Prospector (Kelsey Grammer), which Al plans to sell for big bucks
to a Japanese toy museum.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz mobilizes Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim
Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) for a
daring crosstown rescue mission. But Woody is torn between his old
friends and new, who will wind up back in a dark storage box
without him, and he must decide if he wants to be a child's
plaything or a museum piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' is more emotionally involving than the first
film, centering on what happens when children outgrow their toys.
It's also more consistently funny, thanks to tons of great gags
involving such new recruits as Barbie and the Rock'em Sock'em
Robots.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Lasseter uses the technological advancements
developed for ``A Bug's Life'' and Pixar's 1997 Oscar-winning
short, ``Geri's Game,'' to enhance the look of the film. The
outdoor settings appear much more realistic than in the original
``Toy Story,'' thanks to the grass-and-tree software from ``A Bug's
Life.'' The humans are less synthetic-looking, with ``Geri'' making
a cameo appearance as The Cleaner (Jonathan Harris).
</P>
<P>
   The use of live-action-style camera angles and updated lighting
and depth-of-field techniques makes the world of Andy's toys come
alive, so that you forget you're watching an animated film.
Remarkable attention is paid to detail, from dust bunnies on a
shelf to the toys' reflections in the polished hardwood floor of
Andy's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack whoops it up as Jessie, who is resentful of Woody, while
Grammer lends his resonant tones to the sage Prospector, who has
never been out of his box.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks provides a wealth of emotion. Allen gets big laughs in the
dual role of the old and new-and-improved Buzz dolls.
</P>
<P>
   To spell it out like A-B-C blocks, ``Toy Story 2'' is one of the
year's best films.
</P>
<P>
   GRADE: A
</P>

   Toy Story 2

   WASHINGTON _ The Reagan family, never the most shining example
of domestic values, is reportedly being torn apart over the care
and treatment of 90-year-old former president Ronald Reagan as he
descends into the twilight world of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer says Reagan's wife, Nancy, cares for him
almost alone in their home near Los Angeles, with three of the four
grown-up children quarreling about his fast-diminishing money.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page article described Mrs. Reagan, 78, as
``distraught'' at the children's behavior. It accused Ron, Jr.,
Patti and Michael, a talk-show host, of exploiting their name while
abandoning their father. The only child to escape criticism is
Maureen, described as the only one to give ``real support'' to Mrs.
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The highly sympathetic article contains so much intimate
domestic detail there are suggestions that Mrs. Reagan authorized
it.
</P>
<P>
   The central criticism is that the children stopped visiting him
regularly when Mrs. Reagan halted their monthly allowances because
the money was needed for medical expenses. Michael and Patti say
they see him regularly.
</P>
<P>
   While ``supermarket tabloids'' such as the Enquirer are scorned
by America's chattering classes, they cover stories judged by
mainstream media as too hot to handle, whether on grounds of taste,
privacy or because the subject has the untouchability of a national
icon. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has abandoned efforts to attract
international leaders to next week's World Trade Organization
summit in Seattle, a decision that leaves one of the biggest
international gatherings of recent years at its planned ministerial
level.
</P>
<P>
   However, this failure also deprives President Bill Clinton of an
opportunity to appear in the role of world leader at one of the
last big set piece events of his presidency on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   While the diplomatic significance of this setback is small _ the
WTO meeting was always planned as a ministerial meeting and the
White House began only late in the day to try to make it something
more _ it underlines the diminishing power of a U.S. president as
his second term draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of President Clinton, the seeping away of his power
is compounded by the growing distance between himself and his two
closest lieutenants: his wife and his vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact of presidential life that senior members of the
administration, however loyal, start to depart in pursuit of their
own interests as their president's time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, however, Clinton has had to stand back as
first his vice-president and this week his wife stated publicly
that they were putting their own careers above their official
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Vice-President Al Gore has now given two newspaper interviews in
which he has not only distanced himself from the president, but
effectively downgraded his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for President of this country,'' he told the
Washington Post last weekend, ``is far more important than being
the best vice-president I can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose close association with Clinton is widely _ though
perhaps wrongly _ seen as the chief obstacle to his winning the
presidency in a year's time, has increasingly tried to distance
himself from the president.
</P>
<P>
   He told the same Washington Post correspondent that he had
``zero involvement'' with Clinton's controversial decision to grant
clemency to a group of Puerto Rican nationalists, and is now rarely
seen in public side by side with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gore will accept campaign help from Clinton, however, is
still moot. Having said three months ago that he did not want
Clinton to campaign for him, he then retreated to the point of
suggesting that this was not his position.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to escape the impression that he wanted the money
that Clinton, still the Democratic Party's most effective
fund-raiser, could raise for him, but not the ethical baggage that
inevitably accompanies the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Clinton's announcement on Tuesday that she was
``scaling back'' her official duties as first lady in order to
campaign full time for a U.S. Senate seat, Clinton was given formal
notice that he had lost _ at least temporarily _ his most trusted
adviser, and consort, as well.
</P>
<P>
   She will move to the couple's new house at Chappaqua, north of
New York City, as soon as it has been adapted for security, and
launch her official campaign from there.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time for 80 years that a president has
lived at the White House without a full-time first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons insist that they will see each other at weekends _
presenting the arrangement as a ``commuter'' marriage, no different
from that of thousands of American couples separated by their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's office also moved quickly to quash any new
speculation about the state of the marriage. Her spokeswoman,
Marsha Berry, also denied categorically that the Clintons'
daughter, Chelsea, had any plans to interrupt her studies at
Stanford University to stand in for her mother as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a full-time student and will remain one,'' she said
when the question was put.
</P>
<P>
   It remains, however, that President Clinton and his wife have
spent very little time together in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On their latest foreign travels, they flew out and back
separately, linking up only for a few days in Turkey, Greece and
the weekend meeting in Florence where Mrs. Clinton was a speaker.
Mrs. Clinton returned two days earlier than her husband, in part it
seemed, to stem speculation about her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, still the abjectly contrite spouse, uses
every opportunity to stress his support for his wife's Senate bid,
and is expected to campaign on her behalf. Given the surge in her
popularity when she emerged as a wronged wife any reminder of that
period will probably help rather than hinder her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife and vice-president increasingly absent, though,
Clinton has started to cut a lonely and somewhat sad figure.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, he was reported to have spent an
afternoon playing golf by himself, in the rain. Earlier this week,
there were poignant photographs of him, with Chelsea, in Athens,
visiting an otherwise deserted Parthenon.
</P>
<P>
   At home, not even his dog, Buddy, has been much in evidence of
late.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the questions are being asked: is the presidency a
job that can be done alone? And how will a man who so clearly
thrives on company adjust to his new isolation?
</P>
<P>
   Both he, and America, are about to find out. &QL;

On strength of star and script, `Rosetta' commands attention  
(For use by  LANG Group)  
Our rating:  3 stars  
(Eds: Not for use before Friday, Nov. 26) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By Bob Strauss, Film Critic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rosetta'' won the best picture prize at the Cannes Film
Festival, and its amateur star, 18-year-old Emilie Dequenne, copped
the fest's best actress award. This uncompromising Belgian drama
certainly earned its accolades _ it's raw and exquisitely
controlled at the same time, and Dequenne's fierce, focused energy
is a relentless marvel.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this means that the film is anything akin to a
pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   With a frenzied, tightly framed hand-held camera that quickly
achieves that delightful ``Blair Witch'' nausea effect, directors
Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne plunge us into the desperate world of
Dequenne's Rosetta. A rough-edged adolescent who lives in a grimy
trailer with her near-catatonically alcoholic mom (Anne Yernaux),
Rosetta longs for the consistency that a job _ any job _ would
bring to her life.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, no matter how hard she works, she can't keep one. We
initially see her charging frantically through a factory, running
from the supervisor who wants to lay her off. She hides and fights
him tooth and nail, as if he were trying to steal her soul (which,
by her reckoning, he is).
</P>
<P>
   Wandering the streets of a grubby industrial town, she gets
brief work from a waffle stand entrepreneur who then has to replace
her with his no-account son. One of the guy's clerks, Riquet
(Fabrizio Rongione), takes a shine to Rosetta, but she's more
interested in appropriating his job than responding to his
affection. In one remarkable scene, Riquet falls into a muddy
canal, and she seriously contemplates letting him drown for the
outside hope of a minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rosetta herself had been flung into the same slippery
muck by a mother who didn't wish to visit a rehab facility.
Flopping about and crying ``I can't get out'' as the older woman
disappears in search of her next bottle, the moment pretty much
sums up the girl's life in one vivid, resonant symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Furious as Dequenne's performance often is, it is also marked by
steadying (yet heartbreaking) periods of self-made busywork.
Rosetta trolls for fish she throws back, obsesses over boots she
hides in wooded dugouts and tries to do anything else that can seem
like work, or can at least momentarily distract her from the
awfulness she otherwise breathes. It's an impressively complete and
modulated performance, one of the few marked by emotional outbursts
that is actually enriched by quieter moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Dardenne brothers, whose last film was the impressive ``La
Promesse,'' continue their startlingly moral, uncondescending
fascination with contemporary capitalism's born rejects here. They
never ask us to cry for Rosetta _ she's too obnoxious for that _
yet there's narry a second when she doesn't earn our sympathy. You
wish that she could earn a decent living with similar efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   And many will wish that they'd never been exposed to such a
convincingly dire life. There is a flurry of
irresponsible-mom/practical-daughter movies out at the moment.
``Anywhere But Here'' is pure Hollywood fakery, and
``Tumbleweeds,'' though more honest, lets actresses indulge wayward
theatricality far too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosetta'' is far and away the most truthful, unflinching and
creative of the three _ the idea that Rosetta's overdeveloped sense
of responsibility is a form of pathology is, in and of itself, a
brilliant notion. The film deserves nothing but praise for these
qualities. Sitting through it, of course, is another matter
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: Emilie Dequenne, Fabrizio Rongione, Anne Yernaux,
Olivier Gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes: Written and directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre
Dardenne. Produced by the Dardennes and Michele and Laurent Petin.
Released by USA Films.
</P>
<P>
   Running time: One hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Playing: Nuart, West L.A.
</P>

   Our rating:3 stars

   GIVING-THANKS-I (New York) _ A factory worker walked by a
homeless man near the Port Authority for years; once, he tossed a
couple of quarters his way. Thus is set in motion a remarkable
story of charity, kinship, coincidence and reunion. The worker
befriended the homeless man, cleaned him up, discovered he was from
same part of Virginia and vowed to take him home to his mother,
whose church had been praying for him for three years. Now back
home, the homeless man, Raymond, is playing the organ for the
church choir. By Randy Kennedy.

   GIVING-THANKS-III (New York) _ Ten Thanksgivings ago, Iris
Sanchez, on strike from a low-paying job, made 30 turkey sandwiches
and gave them to the homeless in her Brooklyn neighborhood. Now she
feeds 1,000 hungry, often homeless people each week, and organizes
language classes and health exams for them. For her it's about
gratitude: on successive Thanksgivings, years earlier, her
ex-husband almost succeeded in murdering her. By Jan Hoffman.

the street by a man with a paving stone. By Winnie Hu.

   TOYS (Undated) _ The toy craze of the holiday shopping season?
It must be Pokemon. As many as 1 in 5 of the toys, games and books
given to children this season will have a Pokemon theme, said Chris
Byrne, the editor of The Toy Report, a weekly newsletter. ``Kids
can't seem to get enough of it,'' said a spokeswoman for Toys ``R''
Us, But they may not get exactly what they want. Some of the the
most popular Pokemon items, like trading cards and cuddly Pikachu
dolls that also say their name, are in short supply. Stung by last
year's disappointing holiday season, toy manufacturers expect sales
to rebound this year. The other big sellers are expected to include
some familiar names in new incarnations: Rock and Roll Elmo and
Rock and Roll Ernie from ``Sesame Street` and Flight Control Buzz
Lightyear and Strumming' Singing' Woody from ``Toy Story 2.'' By

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Economic growth was substantially
stronger in the third quarter than previously thought, powered by
rising inventories, vigorous consumption and an improved trade
performance, the Commerce Department says in revising an earlier

annual rate in the third quarter, higher than the 4.8 percent
originally reported, and above Wall Street economists' expectations
for an annual rate of growth of 5 to 5.2 percent. By Robert D.

IN MEXICO

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With his six-feet, four-inch frame, basso profundo
voice and gleaming black cowboy boots, Vicente Fox could be the
star of a Mexican western.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic politician is, in fact, playing a lead role in
this country's transition to greater democracy. A farmer and a
former executive for Coca-Cola Co. in Mexico, Fox wants desperately
to smash 70 years of one-party presidency in Mexico. He campaigns
daily with relish, visiting poor and rich, eagerly trying to
convince Mexicans to make him the first president since 1929 to not
belong to Mexico's omnipresent Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corrupt,'' ``deceitful'' and ``dictatorial'' are a few choice
words Fox employs to trash the PRI in interviews or before
delighted campaign crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're terrified of an honest person will get to the
presidency here,'' Fox says in an interview, lambasting the PRI and
sliding easily between Spanish and English. ``All the jails in
Mexico, the United States and Europe wouldn't be enough to hold all
the criminals here.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico gears up for its July 2, 2000, presidential election,
Fox is said to be the opposition politician with the best chance
ever to wrestle the presidency away from the PRI. For more than two
years, while he was governor of Mexico's Guanajuato state, Fox
campaigned openly for the presidency on his own. He refused to
succumb to the dictates of old-fashioned politics here and quietly
wait to be anointed by his party _ the National Action Party, or
PAN _ as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where half the population lives in poverty, the
pro-business PAN suffers from a reputation for being controlled by
wealthy, socially conservative Catholics. Selected by convention in
September as the party's candidate, Fox is portraying himself as
more of a man of the people. Building on his image as an able
governor who has stood up to the PRI and corruption, Fox is
enhancing his profile with frequent appearances on television talk
shows and near-daily briefings with the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm a businessman,'' he says, talking about his party's
stuffy image. ``I was in Coca-Cola and in my family business. But
I'm also a human being filled with a clear feeling and commitment .
. . to creating equal opportunities for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's talk about ``opportunities'' and his relentless
self-promotion as a distinguished governor who boosted jobs and
investment in Guanajuato touches a nerve in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not for any party, but of the top candidates Fox is the
one I like the best. He works hard and talks about what really
bothers Mexicans,'' said Brenda de la O, 27, a Mexico City nursing
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI still controls millions of voters, Fox admits, but polls
and a number of state election results show that 60 percent of
Mexican voters tend to reject the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Fox is the country's opposition is fragmented
into left- and right-wing camps and other splinter movements. To
win, Fox has to tap into the non-PAN vote and capture at least 20
million voters _ 51 percent of the expected electorate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He's had some setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's opposition parties failed to unite this year in an
alliance that would have presented a ``guaranteed way into the
presidency,'' Fox said. The two main parties, the PAN and the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party managed to overcome their
ideological differences and create a platform.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations fizzled when Fox and the PAN rejected a
proposal to hold a primary election to pick a single candidate. Fox
feared that the PRD might rig the election to impose their own
candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox _ largely because of his own paranoia, critics say _
must compete against the PRI's candidate, former interior secretary
Francisco Labastida, as well as against Cardenas and three other
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Minimizing the damage, Fox says polls give him hope. A Nov. 3
poll in El Universal newspaper showed Labastida with a 42 percent
preference rate compared to Fox with 41 percent. Cardenas was way
behind at 13 percent. A Green Party candidate was preferred by 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate is mature and doesn't want to waste its vote,''
Fox said, predicting that by election day in 2000, voters will
flock to him because he will represent the only hope of defeating
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now our strategy is to be very universal,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like a social democrat than a conservative, Fox
told a group of foreign reporters: ``In Mexico it's more important
to distribute income than to create wealth. And our philosophy in
that area is we need to make sure we distribute opportunities.
We'll have precise, specific, detailed government actions to make
sure we distribute income.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox also connects with business crowds by sharing the
travails of his family business and his experiences at
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Fox has also appealed to the PAN's ranks by suggesting
that ``moral'' or religious education should be allowed in public
schools, a sensitive topic in Mexico, where civil war was fought
over the power of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems contradictory and diffuse much of the time,'' said
University of Guanajuato political analyst Luis Miguel Rionda, who
has followed Fox's career. ``But that's what has worked for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox left the governorship earlier this year relatively popular.
Unemployment seems to have declined and investment in the state is
up. It's still too early to measure the impact of Fox's attempts to
boost education in the state from very low levels, according to
Rionda. And Fox's programs to increase farm credit, Rionda added,
appear to have benefited the state's booming export farmers more
than poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Rionda said, Fox as governor was adept at wooing
support from all quarters, including local PRI leaders and PRD
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to count on his personal charm and charisma'' to
repeat that in 2000, Rionda said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the presidential campaign next year will be
publicly financed, raising additional private money to augment
campaign coffers is an Achilles' heel for Fox, said Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser, an independent senator and sometimes Fox advisor.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the expensive media campaign he plans, Fox has to
compete for donations from business people who are often
intimidated by the PRI, Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has consulted with American campaign strategist Dick Morris,
Aguilar added, but after running Coca-Cola Fox is himself ``an
expert at marketing. That's the big difference between him and all
the other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox admits that he lost at least four or five percentage points
recently in public opinion because of the PRI's first-ever primary
election on Nov. 7. Fox credited the PRI with ``perverse
intelligence'' for holding the primary, which received ample
publicity even though it was self-supervised and riddled with
allegations that the party elite engineered a victory for Labastida
over three other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of the PRI's primary, Fox said, are that the ruling
party's political machine is still effective at organizing votes,
whether they are bought with gifts of food or other supplies,
coerced or delivered out of habit. Fox joined Labastida's opponents
in accusing the party of allowing government-controlled union
leaders and party functionaries to steer minions into voting for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the primary, the PAN aired a Fox-inspired television
spot appealing to Mexicans' widespread skepticism of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   After alluding to repeated failed promises of PRI presidents, a
voice asks, ``Do they think that we have no memory? That we could
swallow . . .the same medicine that has hurt us so much? . . . No,
because the majority of Mexicans has woken up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his aim is to reach Mexico's poor and poorly educated
voters, to convince them to shed their fear of voting for change.
His message, he said, is ``it's better to have a future for them
and their kids . . . than to have a ``torta'' (a sandwich) or a
``dispensa'' (a food package) for their vote in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, always the pragmatist, noted that in the PRI's primary
about one-third of the nearly 10 million who the party claims voted
cast ballots for Roberto Madrazo, who campaigned for change. Fox
immediately visited Madrazo's home state of Tabasco after the
election, seeking support from those disgruntled voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to line up the popular vote in a massive way,''
Aguilar said. But what's still missing, Aguilar added, is strong
support from the 2 million to 3 million highly educated Mexicans
who shape public opinion and tend to be liberal opposition voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks with a language these people consider frivolous and
unpresidential,'' Aguilar said. ``He is remarkably isolated from
those people.''

   DUGDALE-FARM (Undated) _ ``We grow accustomed to the Dark/When
Light is put away,'' wrote Emily Dickinson, one of John Dugdale's
favorite poets, in 1862. Dugdale sat, seemingly entranced by the
glow from a fire lapping in the grate. Alas, he could not witness
the auburn leaves scampering past a window of the austerely
beautiful blue parlor at Lockwood Farm, his 18th century Ulster
County retreat in New York State. Dugdale, 39, a fine art
photographer, tragically lost nearly all his sight after an
AIDS-related stroke six years ago. Yet he has much to celebrate
this Thanksgiving. Last Friday evening in Manhattan, he attended
the packed opening of an exhibition of his recent still lives,
nudes and portraits. And on Thanksgiving Day, Dugdale will have the
pleasure of welcoming his family, who have stood by him during his
courageous odyssey of suffering and recovery, to their first
Thanksgiving at Lockwood Farm. By Christopher Mason.

   MAINE-AIDS-ACTIVIST (Portland, Maine) _ Frances Wilson Peabody
is 96, a Mayflower descendant and a lifelong Republican _ almost.
She had to stop, she says, because ``I can't very well be a
Republican with all the homosexuals in our family.'' These include
a gay son, two gay nieces and a gay grandson who died of AIDS in
1984. It was his death that turned Mrs. Peabody into an activist
who started the first AIDS information hot line in Maine, which
grew into the AIDS Project, a network of social services. In 1994,
amid some opposition, she opened the state's first (and only) AIDS
hospice, Peabody House, in the Western Promenade section here. By

   HALLOWELL-CONNECTING (Cambridge, Mass.) _ On a Saturday morning
here, there is only one possible place to be, at least for parents
with children under 10. Dr. Edward M. Hallowell is at a soccer
game. His son Jack, 7, is playing for the Maroon team; his wife,
Sue Hallowell, is team manager. And because this is Cambridge,
ground zero for self-conscious parenting, every soccer team has
been taught to chant, ``One, two, three, four _ We don't care about
the score!'' Dr. Hallowell, 49, a psychiatrist, is the author of
``Connect,'' a book that argues the necessity of human
connectedness in the interest of health and happiness. So how does
he square connecting and competing? Even 8-and-under soccer, he
would argue, is more than little boys in shorts and shin guards
running themselves breathless on a bright fall morning; it, too, is
a form of connection. By Perri Klass.

   HOUSES-SUNLIGHT (Accokeek, Md.) _ Some houses are built around a

the buildings that channel sunlight are usually religious
structures that materialize light, as though the finger of God were
making a divine point by marking space at a designated time. At
Josephine Withers's house outside Washington, the star of the show,
for the six months starting in September and ending in March, is
the sun, which peers in through the long, high clerestory window of
her two-story living room and strikes coated glass and mirrored

leftist Democratic Revolution Party managed to overcome their
ideological differences and create a platform.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations fizzled when Fox and the PAN rejected a
proposal to hold a primary election to pick a single candidate. Fox
feared that the PRD might rig the election to impose their own
candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox _ largely because of his own paranoia, critics say _
must compete against the PRI's candidate, former interior secretary
Francisco Labastida, as well as against Cardenas and three other
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Minimizing the damage, Fox says polls give him hope. A Nov. 3
poll in El Universal newspaper showed Labastida with a 42 percent
preference rate compared to Fox with 41 percent. Cardenas was way
behind at 13 percent. A Green Party candidate was preferred by 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate is mature and doesn't want to waste its vote,''
Fox said, predicting that by election day in 2000, voters will
flock to him because he will represent the only hope of defeating
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now our strategy is to be very universal,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like a social democrat than a conservative, Fox
told a group of foreign reporters: ``In Mexico it's more important
to distribute income than to create wealth. And our philosophy in
that area is we need to make sure we distribute opportunities.
We'll have precise, specific, detailed government actions to make
sure we distribute income.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox also connects with business crowds by sharing the
travails of his family business and his experiences at
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Fox has also appealed to the PAN's ranks by suggesting
that ``moral'' or religious education should be allowed in public
schools, a sensitive topic in Mexico, where civil war was fought
over the power of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems contradictory and diffuse much of the time,'' said
University of Guanajuato political analyst Luis Miguel Rionda, who
has followed Fox's career. ``But that's what has worked for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox left the governorship earlier this year relatively popular.
Unemployment seems to have declined and investment in the state is
up. It's still too early to measure the impact of Fox's attempts to
boost education in the state from very low levels, according to
Rionda. And Fox's programs to increase farm credit, Rionda added,
appear to have benefited the state's booming export farmers more
than poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Rionda said, Fox as governor was adept at wooing
support from all quarters, including local PRI leaders and PRD
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to count on his personal charm and charisma'' to
repeat that in 2000, Rionda said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the presidential campaign next year will be
publicly financed, raising additional private money to augment
campaign coffers is an Achilles' heel for Fox, said Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser, an independent senator and sometimes Fox advisor.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the expensive media campaign he plans, Fox has to
compete for donations from business people who are often
intimidated by the PRI, Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has consulted with American campaign strategist Dick Morris,
Aguilar added, but after running Coca-Cola Fox is himself ``an
expert at marketing. That's the big difference between him and all
the other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox admits that he lost at least four or five percentage points
recently in public opinion because of the PRI's first-ever primary
election on Nov. 7. Fox credited the PRI with ``perverse
intelligence'' for holding the primary, which received ample
publicity even though it was self-supervised and riddled with
allegations that the party elite engineered a victory for Labastida
over three other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of the PRI's primary, Fox said, are that the ruling
party's political machine is still effective at organizing votes,
whether they are bought with gifts of food or other supplies,
coerced or delivered out of habit. Fox joined Labastida's opponents
in accusing the party of allowing government-controlled union
leaders and party functionaries to steer minions into voting for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the primary, the PAN aired a Fox-inspired television
spot appealing to Mexicans' widespread skepticism of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   After alluding to repeated failed promises of PRI presidents, a
voice asks, ``Do they think that we have no memory? That we could
swallow . . .the same medicine that has hurt us so much? . . . No,
because the majority of Mexicans has woken up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his aim is to reach Mexico's poor and poorly educated
voters, to convince them to shed their fear of voting for change.
His message, he said, is ``it's better to have a future for them
and their kids . . . than to have a ``torta'' (a sandwich) or a
``dispensa'' (a food package) for their vote in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, always the pragmatist, noted that in the PRI's primary
about one-third of the nearly 10 million who the party claims voted
cast ballots for Roberto Madrazo, who campaigned for change. Fox
immediately visited Madrazo's home state of Tabasco after the
election, seeking support from those disgruntled voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to line up the popular vote in a massive way,''
Aguilar said. But what's still missing, Aguilar added, is strong
support from the 2 million to 3 million highly educated Mexicans
who shape public opinion and tend to be liberal opposition voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks with a language these people consider frivolous and
unpresidential,'' Aguilar said. ``He is remarkably isolated from
those people.''

MEXICAN TRUCKS STILL NOT FREE TO TRAVEL U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENALIA MORENO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ By Jan. 1 Mexican cargo trucks carrying auto parts
were supposed to be traveling as easily between Puebla, Mexico, and
Pontiac, Mich., as U.S. trucks moving plastic pellets from Houston
to Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   But by all indications, such free trade will remain a dream of
NAFTA's framers.
</P>
<P>
   The seamless international border touted during NAFTA
negotiations seems nothing more than rhetoric now as that deadline
opening the border looms just more than a month away and another
deadline has passed us by.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years after the North American Free Trade Agreement
took effect, international trucking remains the most contentious
promise made by the deal to lower trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   North of the international border with Mexico, Teamsters and
politicians accuse Mexican trucks and their drivers of being
unsafe. Some say they have witnessed Mexican trucks illegally
barreling across U.S. highways as far away as Florida.
</P>
<P>
   South of the border, Mexican truck drivers and politicians
accuse the United States of reneging on its end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   International trucking, as proposed by NAFTA drafters, was to
happen in two stages.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, Mexican trucks would have been able to travel
within the four border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
California. Then in 2000, they were to be allowed to bring a
shipment of goods from a point in Mexico to a destination in the
United States, where they would pick up cargo and return to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Teamsters and citing safety concerns,
President Clinton refused to give Mexican trucking companies
permission to travel within the border states in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to political pressure from Teamsters and other unions,
Clinton likely will not follow through with the second deadline,
continuing to cite safety as a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blatant violation of NAFTA,'' said Ken Hoffman, an
Austin, Texas-based attorney who represents transportation clients
on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico agreed. Politicians there reacted by not allowing
truckers from the United States to travel through its six border
states. Fed up with the lack of response by the United States,
Mexico filed a complaint with a NAFTA dispute resolution panel two
years ago but the panelists have yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, international shipments move like this: American
companies deliver their cargo to a warehouse in a U.S. border
community.
</P>
<P>
   Another truck, commonly called a drayage truck, hauls that cargo
to a warehouse on the Mexican side of the border. Then a Mexican
truck hauls those goods south. The drayage truck typically returns
to the United States empty. In Laredo alone, 1.3 million trucks
make that trek annually.
</P>
<P>
   The routine is the same for cargo moving north from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole industry has been built on interchanging loads at the
border,'' said Bill Webb, president of the Texas Motor
Transportation, which represents 1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Such inefficient movement of goods creates traffic snarls in
border communities such as Laredo, ground zero for the
international border logjam.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA framers hoped to alleviate this traffic tie-up, speed up
the movement of cargo and save shippers millions of dollars a year
in drayage costs by loosening some of the trucking rules.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the issue has pitted one government against another
and U.S. unions against trucking associations on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters officials, who did not respond to calls, have cited
recent reports by the U.S. Department of Transportation that
Mexican trucks are unsafe as reasons for their opposition to
opening the border.
</P>
<P>
   The agency reported that more than 250 trucks were found
illegally traveling throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by the few carriers that they found,'' said
Martin Rojas, director of cross border operations for the
Washington-based American Trucking Association, which represents
3,000 members. ``I would expect that there would be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies conducted by the Transportation Department found
that a shortage of inspectors meant too few Mexican trucks were
inspected and that more than one-third of the trucks that were
inspected at the border were taken out of service due to safety
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of opening the border said these studies look at
drayage trucks, the dreg vehicles of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   If the border were to open, Mexican carriers would send their
best trucks to the United States, said Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the industry wants to be the one to have a problem
because it's going to get a lot of attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican trucking companies, anticipating the opening of the
border, made significant investments in their fleet but still need
to invest millions of dollars more to bring their trucks up to U.S.
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican trucking officials admit that their fleet of trucks is
inferior to that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of a Mexican truck is 15 years compared to 5
years for a U.S. truck, said Antonio Vazquez, spokesman for the
Mexican trucking association known by its acronym CANACAR.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ``knew that before they signed NAFTA,'' said
Vazquez. ``They knew the conditions of the Mexican trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the two sides debate the issue, it's tough to find
someone who said they will take advantage of an open border. Even
CANACAR opposes opening the border because Mexican truck drivers
simply cannot compete with the U.S. industry, which has better
equipment and earns a lower profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers in the United States are also divided on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half of my members would like for (the border) to open
and the other half would like a 60-foot wall to be built around
it,'' said Webb of the Austin-based trucking group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trucking companies don't want to send their equipment
farther south than the industrial city of Monterrey because of the
poor road conditions in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``One trip to the lower part of Mexico and back would probably
shake your truck apart,'' said Charlie Alexander, general manager
of International Trucking Co. in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of truck drivers in the United States also makes
companies wary of sending their workers down to Mexico for even a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the border opens tomorrow, nothing is changing tomorrow,''
said James Giermanski, regents professor for Texas A&AMP;M
International University in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Giermanski predicts that ongoing negotiations between the two
countries will eventually result in an open border, but he said it
may take years before that will make a significant difference in
the movement of goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will eventually change because there's no excuse for delay
at the border,'' he said.

`TOY STORY 2' IS A MUST-SEE FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a cynic would say that ``Toy Story 2'' is a mere marketing
tool, an excuse for all the Woodys and Buzzes already rubbing
elbows in toy-store holiday displays across the land. Only a cynic
would question the wisdom of making a sequel to the Pixar company's
ebullient, computer-animated blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Only a cynic would complain that there's nothing too original in
the sequel, that the characters are familiar, that Randy Newman
didn't write much new music or that the film borrows openly from
``Star Wars'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``Watership Down.''
Only a cynic would get all cranky over the lack of a really foul
villain, or the dearth of True Dramatic Tension.
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, shuddup already. Let's trash the cynicism, shall we? This
isn't the Brooklyn Museum we're talking about. It's a movie about
playthings _ as Woody says to Buzz in the first film and Buzz says
to Woody in the second, ``You ... are ... a ... TOY!''
</P>
<P>
   He is. They are. And for 83 minutes of ticklish diversion, it's
fun to imagine that a motley roomful of games and dolls could be as
intrepid, and as charming, as this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' proves itself as that rare beast of a movie, a
sequel that defies all naysayers. Delightful, funny, warm, less
scary than the original and stuffed with genuinely moving
heart-tuggers, it's simply too sweet a confection to resist.
Grown-ups, take the kids. Kids, take the grown-ups. Grown-ups, take
the grown-ups, or the cockatoo, or something. See it.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the stars of the show are Woody the cowboy (Hanks) and
Buzz Lightyear, the stentorian-voiced space explorer (Tim Allen).
As usual, they while away their days in Andy's bedroom alongside
Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn),
Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and Hamm the
loquacious piggy bank (John Ratzenberger).
</P>
<P>
   And, as usual, a malevolent outside force intervenes to separate
the clan, requiring much swashbuckling and plucky innovation before
order is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Last time around the malevolent outside force was Sid, the kid
with the mutant toys. This time it's a nerdish toy collector, a
squishy round man (voiced by Wayne Knight) with a crisp Van Dyke
who snatches Woody and imprisons him behind a Plexiglas display
case in an anonymous urban high-rise. Here Woody learns the truth
about himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's not just a toy but a (gasp) collector's item, a remnant of
a giant Woody craze that swept America in the 1950s. What kitsch
accompanied his rise to fame: the radio! the collector's plates!
the mechanical bank! the yo-yo!
</P>
<P>
   Agog with his own importance, Woody meets his fellow tchotchkes
_ Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector
(Kelsey Grammer), Bullseye the Horse _ and bones up on videotapes
of his old Saturday morning television show. But before long he
discovers the dark side to fame, and it takes some heavy
soul-searching before he's back to his usual chipper self.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes some gymnastic bluster on the part of Buzz, who
leads a fivesome of plucky toys on an obstacle-fraught urban rescue
mission. Some of this involves elevators; some of it involves
jaywalking; some of it involves motoring down the aisles of a
massive toy store, where grooving Barbies party to surf rock and
Buzz encounters shelf after shelf of doppelgangers (``Am I really
that fat?'' he asks).
</P>
<P>
   Not to spoil any of this, but the climax is a winner _ exciting
without resorting to the let's-explode-Planet-Earth cliches of
rampant overproduction. Despite the detailed computer animation,
``Toy Story 2,'' like ``Toy Story'' and Pixar's interim feature,
``A Bug's Life,'' is more dependent on story and character than on
filmic gimmickry. (The film credits numerous writers and directors,
including John Lasseter, who directed the original.)
</P>
<P>
   It works because it is, ultimately, a film about the perils and
joys of friendship. As Stinky Pete says, ``It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.''

RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE SHAKEN BY GIANT MARTINI AT NEW YEAR SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As thousands of worshipers gather on New Year's
Eve in Union Square to sing songs, recite poetry and welcome the
new millennium with piety and reflection, a seven-story martini
glass will tower above them, ready to drop an enormous olive at the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Although this pairing of the secular and the spiritual has some
leaders of the interfaith worship shaken and stirred, organizers of
each event are unwilling to change their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we wouldn't have that type of a distraction,''
the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial Church said of the
martini glass. ``It is not consistent with what we're trying to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, contend that the two events are a perfect
example of San Francisco's eccentricities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time San Francisco got some positive attention for our
lifestyle, which is diversity, and if that includes martinis, so be
it,'' said Marsha Monro, director of marketing and communications
for the Westin St. Francis Hotel, where the martini glass will be
installed. ``This is an `only in San Francisco' thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union Square spiritual celebration is one of two
city-organized New Year's Eve events.
</P>
<P>
   The martini glass will sit atop the 13th floor of the St.
Francis, which fronts the west side of Union Square. The glass will
be an inflatable light blue structure constructed around one of the
hotel flagpoles.
</P>
<P>
   Protruding out of the glass will be a swizzle stick with a
10-foot olive, which will slide down at midnight. The drop of the
olive will be accompanied by a pyrotechnic and fireworks. Monro
said the $250,000 display will be San Francisco's answer to New
York's Times Square celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our entire intent is to promote the West Coast'' Monro said.
``If New York can be known as the Big Apple, why can't we be called
the Big Olive?''
</P>
<P>
   The martini drink, according to legend, was created in Martinez
about 150 years ago during the California Gold Rush. But some
insist it was San Francisco that popularized the aperitif. For
years, the 98-year-old St. Francis has been home to the city's
largest martini, and the hotel plans to serve a 48-ounce millennium
martini.
</P>
<P>
   The interfaith peace service is being produced by the mayor's
office, members of religious groups and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The event will begin at 10 p.m. with drummers and includes
poetry readings, moments of prayer, words from clergy and a
performance by 110-voice musical ensemble of the Glide Memorial
Church, a United Methodist congregation. Williams is scheduled to
lead the crowd in ``Auld Lang Syne'' at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Semel, executive vice chairwoman of San Francisco's
Interfaith Council, said that if she had her way, the martini glass
would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is more of a looking forward to next year in a
more spiritual and thoughtful way,'' Semel said. ``I don't think
the martini glass will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders have questioned what kind of reception
the martini glass will receive.
</P>
<P>
   The peace service will require tickets, which are free and will
be distributed through churches and stores. Williams expects that
most of the people on the square will be there to worship, not
party. He said he would urge people to focus their attention and
not be distracted by the olive.
</P>
<P>
   Monro admits that not all those on the square will turn their
gaze to the hotel rooftop. But she said the olive drop and
fireworks will be there for anyone who chooses to look up and will
be designed to not overpower the proceedings below.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are downplaying potential conflicts, saying the
two events are in keeping with San Francisco's eclectic reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a very diverse community,'' said Martha
Cohen, special assistant to Mayor Willie Brown Cohen. ``We can work
with whatever happens in Union Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The martini glass will be erected during the two weeks leading
up to New Year's Eve. Hotel officials say they expect to make the
martini glass a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the West Coast deserves some notoriety,'' Monro said.

 &HT;    Abundance vs. need is next big moral issue
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a benchmark for the unfolding presidential race, the most
interesting speech delivered during this Thanksgiving season was
not by any of the candidates but a utility executive, J. Wayne
Leonard, CEO of New Orleans-based Entergy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   His company, which provides electricity to parts of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas, has been ``insensitive, if not
harsh'' in its bill collecting and shut-off policies, Leonard said
Friday at a ``Low Income Summit'' organized by the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are now past, he declared. This Christmas, if
customers can't buy their children presents and pay their electric
bill, they can just call in and the company will work things out
after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The poor are more numerous than the government admits, he said,
and worse off than they were 20 years ago. And a mean-spirited
society is ``demonizing the poor in the most shameless way
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting a war we claim to be on the undeserving, the
lazy, the immoral. But, fact is, it's largely a war fought against
children and the disabled,'' said Leonard, who announced a list of
company initiatives to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard became more interested in the plight of his poorer
customers after accompanying President Clinton on his New Market
Initiatives tour of the Delta region last July, according to
company spokeswoman Carol Clawson.
</P>
<P>
   There's a man-bites-dog quality to a utility executive telling
people not to worry overmuch about their bills, but there may also
be some business logic at play as well.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Arkansas have already passed legislation opening
electric utilities to competition, and some of the areas served by
Entergy are among the poorest in the country. In the company's
service area, residential customers who struggle to pay their bills
may be a more enduring base than industries that move away.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not Leonard's motives that are important here, but the
way his remarks frame the political debate that begins in earnest
after the cranberry sauce is put away.
</P>
<P>
   This presidential campaign is about the politics of abundance _
both our impatience to share in it and our nervousness about what
it masks.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard would have no basis for his comments if the plight of
low-income citizens weren't a lot worse than portrayed this year on
the presidential campaign trail _ and in his service area, it is.
But it's also likely he wouldn't be able to cut his customers such
slack were it not for the era of falling costs and rising profits
American business has been enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates attempt in one way or another to address
how to use the current largess to rectify our shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time, when the sun is shining, to fix our roof, not
to wait until a rainy day,'' former Sen. Bill Bradley told voters
last week at the United Jewish Federations conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about divvying up the budget surplus,
Republican Gary Bauer said Tuesday, ``I'm not sure that's getting
at what most people are worried about. They want to know why so
many terrible things seem to be happening in a country that has so
much wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later the poor have to pay their electric bills, but
they don't have to vote. None of the candidates would address the
country's problems in the stark terms Leonard did. But the
conditions that make such a remarkable speech possible set the
terms for the race ahead.

 &HT;    Thanksgiving a mixed blessing in flood-ravaged North Carolina.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ Hip deep in Hurricane Floyd's flood waters
surging through her living room, Rosa Dickens got scared when she
saw a pallet of hay floating down the street. Next came metal gas
tanks, refrigerators and hot water heaters bobbing along in the
stinky black swell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been floating, too,'' said Dickens, 59. ``I thank
God for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the state's worst natural disaster killed 51
people, including seven here in Pinetops, Thanksgiving comes as a
mixed blessing across flood-ravaged eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Thankful to be alive, tens of thousands who were displaced from
their homes are still grappling with the tedious, heart-wrenching
rebuilding of lives, forever changed by Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The rising waters washed away homes, cars and keepsakes passed
from generation to generation. The recovery is testing the resolve
and patience of people who had expected, as they always had, to
gather with kinfolk around the table for Thanksgiving meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking one day at a time,'' Dickens told nearly 400
people who gathered Tuesday night in a Pinetops schoolhouse for a
Thanksgiving service. Preachers reading from Lamentations and
Romans spoke of hope amid the misery. Testimonials from victims
offered thanks for donations and volunteer work crews who've helped
in several neighborhoods washed over by Town Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it takes a crisis to bring us together,'' said the
Rev. Robert Williams, 49, pastor of two local Baptist churches, St.
Luke and Washington Branch Missionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I lost everything_my cars, my house_I did not lose
my life,'' he told the crowd offering ``amens'' in approval. ``I
did not lose my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stress brought by Floyd's deluge in mid-September is
hard for many to shake.
</P>
<P>
   Across this hardscrabble region where farming communities have
struggled for years, people are trying to recover from devastation
few ever imagined. Despite the flood of government, church and
charitable aid, expected to top $6 billion, people are missing the
familiar rhythms of the holidays, something money can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   In community after community, from Conetoe to Comfort to
Chinquapin, residents are months from returning to homes they built
decades ago. The few who've had the energy to strip their houses
down to the bare wooden studs can't yet rebuild because of
lingering moisture and mold.
</P>
<P>
   In Princeville, a town founded by freed slaves after the Civil
War, a flood-ruined mobile home collapsed recently as it was being
hauled away on a tractor trailer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a symbolic mishap for North Carolina's tattered eastern
half, where the receding waters left behind debris hanging on limbs
and fences. Uprooted trees point in the direction of the deadly
currents of the Tar, Neuse and Cape Fear rivers and their hundreds
of tributaries, which turned the swampy coastal plain into a lake.
</P>
<P>
   A muddy residue clings to the walls of abandoned houses and
buildings, marking the seemingly unfathomable levels to which the
water rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still living in holy hell,'' said Marie Randolph, 54,
of Pinetops, a two-stoplight town of 1,500 people 60 miles east of
Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims are living temporarily with relatives and friends,
in apartments and motels, and in camper trailers where today's
Thanksgiving meals of cooked turkey and canned cranberry sauce will
be delivered in cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   People are wearing clothes they didn't own just weeks ago,
hand-me-downs or new garments among the tons of donations from
across America. The generosity is wearing thin, though, among
people frustrated by the slow pace of government loans and grants,
money that will provide only part of what they need to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a whole lot of turn-downs and a whole lot of nos
and a whole lot of false hopes,'' said Maryanne Staton, 36, an
evacuee from flood-ruined Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe it,'' said Staton, now living in Rocky Mount,
in a government camper park dubbed Camp Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Princeville Tuesday to pick up a free turkey
from a truck stop parking lot where Princeville officials are
distributing canned food and toiletries and baby food from under
two green military tents.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a free turkey, William Henry Bridges drove down from
nearby Oak City. But because he doesn't live in Princeville, he
wasn't eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As old as I am and as hard as I worked, it's a pity I can't
even get a turkey,'' said the 84-year-old farmer, sorting through
clothing piled in the truck stop's muddy parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina suffered its own setback this week. Congress
adjourned for the year Monday, after approving less than half the
$1.9 billion in federal aid sought by Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The new appropriation is on top of $500 million the government
has already sent to North Carolina, aid that Hunt called a ``real
step forward,'' but not enough to rebuild the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on Congress,'' North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Graham said. ``The monies they seem to be offering are a
Band-Aid, when we need transplant surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in Pinetops, a fellowship of black and white ministers
has taken on the task of providing relief. It organized Tuesday
night's religious service, part of efforts to provide spiritual
help to victims along with the canned goods, clothing and shoes
dispensed from the old F&AMP;T hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Owens, who pastors three Presbyterian church with his wife,
Peggy, travels frequently back into the flooded neighborhoods of
Dodge City and Bynum Park. Ghost towns, the subdivisions are slowly
coming back to life as residents rip out water-soaked cabinets and
carpet and pile it on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, 43, listens more than he talks in visits with victims.
They need help contacting federal agencies, buying used cars,
arranging for volunteers to help rip out their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being there with words of compassion and expressions of
sympathy,'' Owens said. ``These people need the strength to move
on.''

 &HT;    `Green' allies aim to topple walls between humans, environment
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The names might not be household words.
</P>
<P>
   But the leadership of Green Cross International and its American
affiliate, Global Green USA, seems determined that the
organizations will be real players in enhancing the world's
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The most important of those leaders is the founder, Mikhail
Gorbachev, the 68-year-old former leader of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we mutually interdependent with others _ no one
nation alone can tackle pollution in the seas or warming of the
atmosphere _ but future generations are dependent on how we use the
planet today,'' Gorbachev said in a recent interview, posted on the
GCI Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of desertification taking over vital farmlands, a
looming fresh water crisis, air pollution threatening the health of
billions in megacities, among other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``To meet that challenge, we need to change our mentality just
as we did to end the Cold War,'' Gorbachev said. ``We need to take
down the wall that separates the future from the present.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev probably will reiterate those themes when he speaks
Dec. 3 at the University of Georgia. He is sure to stress them when
he speaks at Global Green USA's annual Legacy Forum at Georgia
State University the following day.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet president's commitment to the environment is
the principal inspiration behind the founding of GCI. And,
according to Matt Petersen, executive director of Global Green,
Gorbachev is ``absolutely'' sincere on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen first met Gorbachev in 1994 and ``was immediately blown
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Gorbachev was that this man's soul comes
through his eyes,'' Petersen said. ``I think that's what makes him
such a forceful presence.''
</P>
<P>
   However, inspired leadership is one thing. Practical building of
programs is another. Petersen said the progress of the organization
on that score has been incremental.
</P>
<P>
   GCI was founded in 1993 to build on goals established at the
1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Its mission broadly is
to ``help create a sustainable future by cultivating harmonious
relationships between humans and the environment'' and to ``promote
a significant change in human values leading to greater respect and
care for Earth's community of life in all its diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of ways the group is trying to accomplish that mission
include:
</P>
<P>
   Helping draft an Earth Charter, intended to serve as a universal
code of conduct on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the environmental legacy of wars and advocating
solutions to lingering problems, including clean-up of former
military bases and environmentally responsible destruction of
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting informed decision making on water management.
</P>
<P>
   Disseminating information about ways to design energy-efficient
housing and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Developing educational materials on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding, the Swiss-based organization has developed
country affiliates in 21 nations, including Global Green in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Global Green's programs parallel the international
organization's and focus on cleaning up the environmental damage of
the Cold War, fostering the design of energy-efficient housing and
advocating alternative energy development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't litigate and we don't protest. Those are important
things that environmental organizations do,'' Petersen said. But
Global Green's mission is more of being a ``mediator and
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring people together,'' the executive director explained.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has deliberately taken its programs ``outside
the Beltway'' of Washington by establishing its headquarters in
Santa Monica, Calif., and sponsoring events in such cities as
Atlanta and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda for the forum at GSU, on the theme ``Sustainability
in the Southeast,'' reflects the group's aims. Guests from the
military, business and government agencies as well as environmental
activists will come together to discuss such topics as renewable
energy, ``smart growth'' and the destruction of chemical weapons in
the United States and Russia. Georgia State's J. Mack Robinson
School of Business is the official host for the event, and the U.S.
Army's Environmental Policy Institute is a co-organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen expects 150 to 250 people to attend the two-day
conference, which also will feature Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, but the crowd could more than double when Gorbachev
speaks to an afternoon session Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Others will come to hear the man whose efforts led to a new era
of freedom for people behind the Iron Curtain later that evening
when he speaks at Global Green's Founder's Award dinner at the Ritz
Carlton Buckhead. Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes is to introduce
Gorbachev, and Sen. Max Cleland also is expected to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The event will pay tribute to Pat Mitchell, president of CNN
Productions/Time Inc. Television.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's presence in Atlanta is the most important reason
Gorbachev is making both the Athens and Atlanta appearances. She is
a University of Georgia graduate and won a Peabody award for an
acclaimed television series on the Cold War. She also is president
of Global Green and has overseen production of nearly 200 hours of
environmental programming for the Turner networks.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said Gorbachev and Mitchell have worked closely
together, and that the former Soviet leader was especially touched
when Mitchell came to the funeral of his wife, Raisa, in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really meant a lot to him that she came,'' he said.

 &HT;    India cyclone ravaged memories as well as land
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had been to Orissa before, lured by its ancient Hindu temples
and pristine beaches.
</P>
<P>
   This time, I was not a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   I was there to witness a tragedy of enormous proportions. A
``super cyclone'' had visited the state just days before my trip.
And it had changed the face of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   The plane ride from Calcutta to Bhubaneswar, Orissa's capital,
took 50 minutes. The flight from Calcutta steadied itself after a
steep climb into a clear November sky. We were more than halfway
there when the captain announced, ``We are flying over Paradwip.
It's to our left.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, the cyclone, having churned across the Bay of
Bengal, came ashore at Paradwip. Wind and sea had spared little. I
had read newspaper accounts about the devastation, and so had
everyone else on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The very mention of Paradwip had nearly all the passengers on
the right side of the cabin up from their seats. We craned our
necks to peer out the windows and see firsthand what we already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   From 15,000 feet, the landscape resembled a blueprint for
destruction. A vast sheet of silver-blue iridescence cut into the
green mosaic of rice paddies and farmlands. Helicopters skimmed
over the flooded land. Perhaps they were making air drops of food.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the plane was filled with comments, sighs and
emotions. Curiosity. Uncertainty. Fear.
</P>
<P>
   As the aircraft descended, I saw the massive steel bridge over
the Mahanadi River that I had crossed by train only months before
on my way to the beach at Gopalpur. Then Orissa had seemed so lush,
so serene, so idyllic. Now it was a series of mangled fields and
broken trees, bare of bark and branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic arrival hall at Bhubaneswar's small airport,
people held up placards to connect with arriving relief workers,
government officials and medical teams. Boxes of bottled drinking
water rotated on the luggage carousel. People had come prepared to
face the shortages. I wondered whether our six bottles of water
would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the hoards of white taxis that normally await arriving
tourists were in short supply. Instead, a line of four-wheel drive
vehicles crowded the curb. Several bore the Red Cross symbol.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a long ride to the Hotel Shishmo, which had recently
undergone renovation. I remembered it as being shoddier on my last
trip to Bhubaneshwar, four years ago. It was the only thing I saw
this time that looked better.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene, my colleague and guide, and I wanted to grab a quick
lunch before venturing into the city. At the hotel restaurant, we
were told that the only thing available was a limited buffet, since
many of the kitchen staff had returned to their villages to check
on their families. The meal cost twice what it would have in
Calcutta, but there wasn't another restaurant open for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bhubaneswar, which was a relatively new but disheveled town
before the storm, looked utterly dismal. Its dirty roads were even
dirtier. Many of its tall palms stood no more. A confusion of
electric lines dangled overhead as our taxi negotiated pools of mud
around the city's shantytowns.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who live in these slums, life had already been
unimaginably difficult. Now it was plain unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the urban shantytowns were better off than the thousands
of small hamlets and villages that fell prey to the cyclone. Tens
of thousands of people died; no one knows exactly how many.
Millions more were left with nothing to their names but the wet
dirt on which they were standing.
</P>
<P>
   These were India's poorest, most vulnerable people, and they had
been left in their mud huts to ride out one of the fiercest storms
in the subcontinent's history. A man in a nearby hospital had held
onto the trunk of a palm tree through 36 hours of rain and wind. He
survived but he had no flesh left on either arm.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Kendrapara the next day, we stopped for breakfast
at the Indian equivalent of a truck stop. We were told there would
be no more food available beyond that point. We sat in a dark,
dingy dining hall _ there was no electricity _ and filled our
stomachs with sand-laden rice cakes and vegetable curry. We planned
to never eat there again.
</P>
<P>
   But we did _ out of necessity. And 10 exhausting hours later,
the same rice cakes and curry seemed gourmet fare.
</P>
<P>
   We thought about the villagers with whom we had spoken, and of
how they had mobbed relief trucks for food and were surviving on
one scanty meal a day. One man showed us his stash of rice
carefully wrapped in a towel. He had gathered the grains from the
road when a bag of supplies had burst.
</P>
<P>
   In Paradwip and Ersama, names now synonymous with death, we had
watched a young woman wash herself in a pool of water while a few
yards away, another woman's body, bloated and rotting, floated
along the bank. We saw the charred remains of human beings at mass
funeral pyres, and we inhaled death. We looked into the eyes of a
child who will grow up without his parents _ and without hope.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing all that, conversation in our taxi stopped for a
long time. I found myself clutching my bottle of water and not
wanting to look anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But the images burned in my mind. I left Orissa two weeks ago;
soon I will return home to Atlanta, leaving India far behind. And
this time, a very different Orissa will smolder in my memory.

   Q: Who put up the monument erected for victims of Pan Am Flight
103, which crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland? _ J.F.G., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: A memorial cairn honoring the 270 victims of the Flight 103
bombing was placed at Arlington National Cemetery by order of
Congress.
</P>

U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: For release over the Thanksgiving weekend.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt. Col.
Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Because computer scientists warn that Y2K problems might take
several weeks to materialize, the Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian
cooperation will extend through mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russia last year began discussions to set up the
Y2K center but temporarily broke off talks after NATO bombed
Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict in Kosovo. To guard
against any future computer glitches or potentially deadly mistakes
like the 1995 incident, the two countries are planning to open a
permanent joint missile warning center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,'' it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human intervention.''

   Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military, arrayed on key
weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and rocket launchers. In
fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of computer systems in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.

<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

 &HT;    Ex-Soviet diplomat idolizes Gorbachev
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Igor Khripunov has great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is coming to Athens
next week, and Khripunov looks forward to hearing a man he respects
deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience for the Dec. 3 speech at the University of
Georgia will be hearing Gorbachev for the first time. Not
Khripunov. The associate director of the university's Center for
International Trade and Security is a Moscow native. He's also a
former Soviet diplomat. And he vividly remembers the occasions when
his work brought him into close contact with the leader who did
more than anyone to end totalitarianism in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gorbachev was quite a different breed of person,'' the UGA
political scientist said. ``His biggest contribution was to say no
to the Cold War and to open up the country to democratic reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Khripunov worked as an interpreter at the United
Nations in New York, a taste of America that introduced him to a
more open society. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1976 to earn
a doctorate in a topic some of his friends still find puzzling,
Canadian foreign policy. But Khripunov, now 53, soon found a niche
he thought might be more useful. He sold all his books on Canada
and began transforming himself into an expert on a new topic: arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   He was working on arms issues for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign
Affairs when he first met Gorbachev, then the second ranking person
in the Communist Party. The year was 1984. And the rising young
diplomat had been picked to accompany Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa, on a trip to Maggie Thatcher's London.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him, that was a couple of days before this
delegation left for London,'' recalled Khripunov.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the meeting vividly: ``Gorbachev was technically in
charge of agriculture, but when we arrived at his office, in the
headquarters of the Communist Party, for the briefing before
departure, he talked without any notes for an hour about his vision
of Soviet foreign policy relationships and the world situation. I
was amazed by his intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, Gorbachev was armed with written comments, even
for the toasts he was to make, but he didn't use them, impressing
not only the young diplomat accompanying him but also his British
hosts with his spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Khripunov met Gorbachev on other occasions over the years, but
the most memorable came in 1987, when the Gorbachevs made a
historic visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Khripunov was working at the Soviet Union's U.S.
Embassy and had gained even deeper respect for Gorbachev as a
leader who was committed to the idea of a world free of nuclear
weapons. On that visit, Gorbachev again demonstrated that he was a
new kind of Soviet leader, stopping his car and getting out to
shake hands with Americans on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip was not just about style. There was also substance,
as Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan signed a treaty
eliminating intermediate range nuclear missiles from Europe.
Khripunov had been involved in negotiating the agreement, and he
was later assigned to help implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, of course, went on to implement something else, major
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Khripunov applauded those reforms. That's not to
say the transition has been easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Embassy where Khripunov worked evolved into a Russian
Embassy, and the diplomats there felt rudderless as the old empire
disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking, losing a country to which you are supposed
to be loyal and which you served throughout all your career is
destabilizing,'' Khripunov admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But he also recalled the great hopes of the era: ``There was a
lot of enthusiasm that democracy and the end of communism may
really spell new prosperity and a new future.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for Russians, the prosperity has not
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   As an arms control expert, Khripunov frets about the weapons and
other dangerous materials still found in the old Soviet empire. He
came to the University of Georgia largely because its Center for
International Trade and Security was working on nonproliferation
issues. And he has been involved in the center's programs including
one recently started to train managers of nuclear facilities in the
old Soviet Union to protect and control potentially dangerous
materials. But the struggle to ensure that the proper procedures
are used is thorny. Corruption in Russia and the disastrous
economic situation are major complicating factors.
</P>
<P>
   Had the West lived up to Gorbachev's expectations as communism
was collapsing, the situation might be better.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev had ``expected deep in his mind a kind of second
Marshall Plan for Russia,'' Khripunov explained.
</P>
<P>
   The West has poured a lot of money into the Soviet republics but
has not put in place the hands-on programs that might have been
more help

glow from a fire lapping in the grate. Alas, he could not witness
the auburn leaves scampering past a window of the austerely
beautiful blue parlor at Lockwood Farm, his 18th century Ulster
County retreat in New York State. Dugdale, 39, a fine art
photographer, tragically lost nearly all his sight after an
AIDS-related stroke six years ago. Yet he has much to celebrate
this Thanksgiving. Last Friday evening in Manhattan, he attended
the packed opening of an exhibition of his recent still lives,
nudes and portraits. And on Thanksgiving Day, Dugdale will have the

courageous odyssey of suffering and recovery, to their first

a gay son, two gay nieces and a gay grandson who died of AIDS in
1984. It was his death that turned Mrs. Peabody into an activist
who started the first AIDS information hot line in Maine, which
grew into the AIDS Project, a network of social services. In 1994,
amid some opposition, she opened the state's first (and only) AIDS
hospice, Peabody House, in the Western Promenade section here. By

   HALLOWELL-CONNECTING (Cambridge, Mass.) _ On a Saturday morning
here, there is only one possible place to be, at least for parents
with children under 10. Dr. Edward M. Hallowell is at a soccer
game. His son Jack, 7, is playing for the Maroon team; his wife,
Sue Hallowell, is team manager. And because this is Cambridge,
ground zero for self-conscious parenting, every soccer team has
been taught to chant, ``One, two, three, four _ We don't care about
the score!'' Dr. Hallowell, 49, a psychiatrist, is the author of
``Connect,'' a book that argues the necessity of human
connectedness in the interest of health and happiness. So how does
he square connecting and competing? Even 8-and-under soccer, he
would argue, is more than little boys in shorts and shin guards
running themselves breathless on a bright fall morning; it, too, is
a form of connection. By Perri Klass.

Josephine Withers's house outside Washington, the star of the show,
for the six months starting in September and ending in March, is
the sun, which peers in through the long, high clerestory window of
her two-story living room and strikes coated glass and mirrored

   PORTLAND, Maine _ Frances Wilson Peabody is 96, a Mayflower
descendant and a lifelong Republican _ almost. She had to stop, she
says, because ``I can't very well be a Republican with all the
homosexuals in our family.''
</P>
<P>
   These include a gay son, two gay nieces and a gay grandson who
died of AIDS in 1984. It was his death that turned Mrs. Peabody
into an activist who started the first AIDS information hot line in
Maine, which grew into the AIDS Project, a network of social
services. In 1994, amid some opposition, she opened the state's
first (and only) AIDS hospice, Peabody House, in the Western
Promenade section here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe being gay runs in families, and that's why it's so
cruel when parents are blind and don't want to acknowledge it,''
she says, sitting in the parlor of the restored 1865 house that has
been her home for 25 years. ``If a child gets married, that doesn't
fix it; it just makes more problems later.'' She rolls her eyes.
``It's pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Haffenreffer, 62, the chairman of the board of Peabody
House, whose financial support made the hospice possible, says,
``When we first bought the house, everyone thought we would have
gays, drug addicts and needles in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Peabody interjects: ``We didn't blame them. Until they're
educated, they don't know what's important and what's not. They had
homes they loved. And now Peabody House has the prettiest garden on
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that Mrs. Peabody _ whom everyone, regardless
of age, calls Frannie _ is not the brand of revolutionary that
Larry Kramer and company had in mind when they started the Gay
Men's Health Crisis. This one wears a cranberry suit and a string
of pearls, and her pretty, crocheted slip peeks out above her knees
as she climbs up and down the three flights of stairs at Peabody
House, now home to six people with AIDS. She expects 22 family
members (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren) for
Christmas this year, and she will celebrate her 75th reunion at
Smith College next June. When she went out in the rain to vote
recently, three different people tracked her down in case she
needed help getting home. Maria Santana, 43, a resident of Peabody
House, speaks for many when she says, ``Frannie is the best thing
to have happened to the city of Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Peabody attends birthday dinners and other events at
Peabody House, she lives with a helper in her own three-story house
a few blocks away. She became something of an expert on historic
preservation during the 15 years she ran Tate House, the town's
oldest museum, which dates to 1755. Even on this day, she has a
workman in her bathroom restoring the trompe l'oeil ceiling detail
hidden under layers of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her front parlor, drinking coffee, Mrs. Peabody talks
about her own life and the events that prepared her for the
unlikely work she now does. When Peabody House first opened, she
says, it served predominantly as a place for gay men to die. Since
the advent of protease inhibitors and other medicines, however, its
residents are mostly women who were intravenous drug users, some
with mental illness, many of whom were homeless for most of their
adult lives.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Peabody speaks, her china-blue eyes never waver, and
even after the phone interrupts her, she picks up exactly where she
left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Washington, D.C., in 1903,'' she begins. ``When
I was about 7 years old, my parents went to the territory of New
Mexico. My father was sent there by Teddy Roosevelt to help clean
up some dirty politics. We lived in Santa Fe, where my father had
his law office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were broad-minded about everything. My brother and
I just didn't know what it meant to be prejudiced. When I look
back, I realize that many of the artists and writers in Santa Fe
were gay, but my parents just didn't seem to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   She majored in government at Smith, and after graduating moved
to New York City and worked at Macy's. She met her future husband
there _ Millard Peabody, whose family owned a shoe manufacturing
factory near Boston. The couple eventually settled in Falmouth,
Maine, and had five children. One son died of crib death in 1931,
and their surviving son and two of their daughters contracted
polio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so careful with everything,'' Mrs. Peabody says.
``Nobody knows where they got it. My oldest daughter, Charlotte,
was in bed for two years. I taught her at home, with help from the
teacher once a week. I had a baby five months old when that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   How did she manage? ``I gave up all my volunteer work, and I had
a wonderful nurse for the children,'' she says. ``I'm not
religious, so in a difficult situation it kind of throws you back
on your own strength.'' She sniffs. ``So many religious people are
so narrow-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Peabody died of a heart attack in 1962, at 58. ``He just didn't
wake up one morning.'' She never remarried. ``I wanted to make my
own decisions about my children,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The social stigma attached to polio, a highly contagious
disease, primed Mrs. Peabody for the fight she encountered when her
grandson Peter learned he had AIDS in 1983, a time when real
knowledge about the disease and how it was contracted was scarce
and hysteria was rampant. ``When Peter came down with AIDS, he was
living in New York City,'' she says. ``He was gay. We knew that. It
didn't make a difference to any of us. He was a very early victim
of AIDS, and it's very hard today to understand how people felt
then.''
</P>
<P>
   After Peter died, she says, ``I heard there was a group of young
gay men at the Unitarian Church here who were meeting about AIDS,
so I asked the minister if they would mind if I joined them.'' She
continued: ``We agreed the best thing to do would be to have a hot
line because there was so little information. We were all
volunteers, trained by the volunteers from the suicide hot lines.
We didn't have any money, you know, that was our trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Peabody also wrote a brochure for the mothers of people
with AIDS who knew nothing about the disease. A friend at the Maine
Medical Center distributed it. ``The doctors would call and say,
`Frannie, I've got a mother up in the hospital who needs you,'''
she says. ``That's how we had to do it. Some of those poor kids
died not knowing who it was taking care of them. We all had masks
and gowns and gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Project also sponsored a support group for people with
AIDS and their families and friends. ``We met every Tuesday, still
do,'' Mrs. Peabody says. ``It was safe to talk freely there. And we
realized we needed a hospice. I knew it would take money, and I
knew Peter Haffenreffer would be able to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   She leans forward in her chair. ``I get ideas, but I don't do
that hard everyday work that holds an organization together,'' she
says urgently. ``I don't know what we would have done without
Peter. He's very quiet and gets no accolades at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Haffenreffer, whose family owned the eponymously named beer
company, looks suitably embarrassed. He directs the attention back
to Mrs. Peabody, showing off her key to the city of Portland and a
framed letter of commendation from President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Peabody smiles. ``When they called to tell me I was one of
the thousand points of lights, they said, `This is the White
House,' and I said: `I'll bet it is. Goodbye.' I thought somebody
was teasing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Peabody makes an annual appearance in the Portland Gay
Pride Parade, swathed in a feather boa, perched on the back of
Haffenreffer's yellow convertible. ``Along the way you can see
people looking down their noses,'' she says. ``They don't know
whether to wave back to me or not.''
</P>
<P>
   What does she think of them? She laughs. ``I think they're very
stupid people,'' she says. ``They miss an awful lot by not knowing
people who are gay. They're much more fun than straight people,
much more imaginative.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   At Peabody House, Mrs. Peabody is embraced by Mary Lake, its
executive director, who leads her into the kitchen, where meals are
prepared daily by volunteers. The house was also renovated and
redecorated by volunteers, including Haffenreffer's wife, Mallory
Marshall, a local interior designer, and her partner, James Light.
They combed through garage sales, flea markets and discount
warehouses for furniture (and beautiful fabrics for slipcovers) for
residents' rooms as well as a guest room for visiting family
members. Residents can cuddle up in an easy chair in the library,
or lie on the couch to watch television in the smoking room. And
there are pictures of everyone posted on the refrigerator door,
just like home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Peabody heads down the hall, past her portrait, which hangs
on the wall across from a bowl of colored condoms, and climbs two
flights to the office, looking for Christmas ornaments. ``We're
working on it, Frannie,'' Ms. Lake says nervously, watching her
charge the closets.
</P>
<P>
   Two more staff members spot Mrs. Peabody and kiss her. While
they do, Ms. Lake talks business. ``Maine has had 897 AIDS cases
since 1984 and 472 fatalities,'' she says. ``Our annual operating
budget is about $600,000, most of which is spent on direct care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has been incredibly generous,'' she continues.
``Half our funding comes from individual support.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough for Mrs. Peabody. ``The government is
still blind to AIDS,'' she says, clearly frustrated. ``They don't
pour money into research as they should, and I don't know how to
convince them. If you have had one case of AIDS in your family,
that family changes forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Her gaze is unflinching. ``When this first started, I couldn't
understand why people couldn't understand,'' she says. ``I still
can't. So much ignorance makes you wonder.''

   What an unenviable task for President Clinton and his policy
planners _ to assess the West's options for responding to Russia's
relentless military campaign in Chechnya. It is as if all the
contradictions and inconsistencies of Western and particularly U.S.
post-Cold War policies have merged into one big international
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Northern
Caucasus, the loss of life and destruction, is similar to if not
worse than what happened in Bosnia and, more recently, in Kosovo.
Yet the West's outrage is muted and its morality-driven willingness
to act, so evident in Kosovo, is now absent.
</P>
<P>
   The military option, which the United States and NATO used so
willingly against Yugoslavia, is simply out of the question when
dealing with Russia, a nuclear power. Thus, ``the Clinton doctrine
of humanitarian intervention,'' tentatively proclaimed during the
Kosovo crisis, has been shown to be at best selective _ a policy
that can be modified opportunistically depending on other
priorities and on U.S. military capabilities vis-a-vis the current
transgressor.
</P>
<P>
   Economic or financial penalties do not fare much better.
Although Russia would like to get some money from the International
Monetary Fund _ whose lending decisions take account of political,
military and economic travails _ the West is reluctant even to call
for the IMF to withhold the next tranche of its Russian loan.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the loan is meant to repay previous IMF handouts.
What is more, failure to provide it could upset the entire
structure of delicate debt rescheduling compromises between Russia
and Western public and private financial institutions _ something
the West clearly does not want.
</P>
<P>
   Given the anti-Western sentiment now prevailing in Russian
politics and, increasingly, among the people, economic sanctions
would be counterproductive. With its oil and gas prices to foreign
clients at their highest level in years, Russia could for a while
do without the IMF money, and many Russians would just say good
riddance.
</P>
<P>
   And as for longer-term consequences, people don't think about
them in the heat of recriminations that are, more and more,
beginning to resemble the time of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's offensive in Chechnya was just beginning, there
was talk in the West of using the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, held last week in Istanbul, to
call Russia to account and make it change its behavior. But both
before and during the summit, it became increasingly clear that
little could be achieved there.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin's sharp rebuttal of any attempt to ``interfere in
Russia's internal affairs'' was to be expected. Perhaps Bill
Clinton had hoped that praising the Russian president, for the
umpteenth time, for ``standing on that tank'' and thus thwarting
the hard-line coup in August 1991 would sway him in the right
direction. But this is a situation where a compliment is as
ineffective as a threat would be. To some, it looked awkward; to
others, pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the OSCE is a weak organization and thus not the
best vehicle for meaningful policy initiatives. Even if better
avenues were available for the West's pressure tactics, though, the
result would likely be the same. For Russia can only be influenced
by countries it sees as friendly and that it feels treat it with
respect. And that is where the problem lies.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing how quickly the reservoir of good will and
apparent mutual respect that Russia and the United States shared in
the early '90s disappeared during the past few years. It takes two
to tango, and it takes at least two to break up the dance _ so, of
course, Moscow should take part of the blame for the relationship
turning sour. But try to look at it from Russia's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus there is that for years America was rather
cynically using Russia for its own political purposes. A recent
indiscretion _ remarks by a ``senior administration official''
reported by Jane Perlez in The New York Times _ illustrates just
the sort of attitude Russians dread _ and why that may be more than
just paranoia. As regards NATO expansion and Kosovo, the U.S.
official rather arrogantly staid, ``we knew what the Russians ought
to do and, by the way, they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they ``did it'' _ Russia had to put up both with NATO's
enlargement and the bombing of Yugoslavia, but only a very naive
person could think that such humiliation would leave no scars. For
the Russians, the bottom line is that they ``got no respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians generals and politicians keep pointing out that what
the United States and NATO did in a foreign country, Russia has a
right to do in its own Chechen territory. They invoke the pretext
of fighting international terrorism, reminding the world of U.S.
cruise-missile attacks on Osama bin Laden's ``terrorist camps'' in
Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   There is much self-serving hypocrisy in these arguments but it
cannot be denied that Clinton's administration has been much more
willing than some of its predecessors to use force abroad under
very flimsy pretexts and without much regard for international law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration should therefore not be surprised that it has
lost credibility in Moscow and that many people there and elsewhere
see much of its foreign policy as based on a cynical double
standard. In fact, both Russia, a former superpower, and the United
States, the sole remaining superpower, are arguably guilty of what
that famous Communist icon Karl Marx called ``the greatest of human
vices, hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a good basis on which to build a new world order _ or even a
good bilateral partnership.

that famous Communist icon Karl Marx called ``the greatest of human
vices, hypocrisy.''

TAKING CARE (USE PLASTIC) OF FOREIGN SITES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Here are a few things I know about the raw-milk camembert cheese
that a French company called Fromages.com sells online. First, milk
is ladled carefully into vats. Then it matures into creamy yellow
rounds that get coddled, like newborns in a hospital nursery, until
at the age of 21 days they reach the peak of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Now we get to one important thing I do not know: how that peak
tastes. That is because raw-milk cheeses that mature in less than
60 days may harbor dangerous bacteria; they are illegal in the
United States. So American shoppers who arrive at www.fromages.com
are steered instead to a truncated list of federally approved
cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   As for the list, the Roquefort, the Saint-Marcellin and the
Reblochon sounded fine _ like the camemberts, they are stored in a
temperature-controlled cellar until ready to eat, then shipped
overnight to customers around the world. But the site's soulful
descriptions of 116 cheeses convinced me that I wanted nothing less
than the distinctively runny camembert, ripened ``to the very
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So I phoned Marc Refabert, the director of Fromages.com. But he
said, quite simply: ``I am very sad that I cannot send it. To my
point of view, for the person who does not have the chance to have
this cheese, it's a pity.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had not rubbed it in like that, my initial response might
have been more graceful. In any case, I would like the record to
show that any subsequent comments I might have made along the lines
of ``Listen, Refabert, who would it hurt if you just shipped me one
little bite?'' were entirely in jest.
</P>
<P>
   I changed my mind anyway, after I phoned the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, where a spokesman told me that the listeria
bacteria in contaminated raw-milk products kills 425 people a year
in the United States. Resigned to a healthy fate, I returned to
Fromages.com to instead order a (legal) camembert made from
pasteurized milk.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for my cheese, I had time to reflect on the fact that
this is just one of the many compromises that American shoppers are
going to have to make as a growing number of overseas merchants go
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of countries are rushing to catch up to where the United
States is in e-commerce, and that means that shoppers are going to
run into this more and more,'' said Bob Laity, an Andersen
Consulting managing partner who advises overseas Web sites. ``If
you saw a nice ivory bracelet on a French Web site, would you know
that it is illegal to import? What about a product that is
classified as food in one country, but as drugs in another?''
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer is that if you question a product's
legality, don't buy it. While government officials acknowledged in
interviews last week that they simply cannot inspect every single
parcel, the last thing you want is to be the unlucky shopper whose
shipment of fresh meat or endangered species of plants or Cuban
cigars is seized on the docks. I cannot even begin to contemplate
the headache involved with trying to get a refund for that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you need any sort of customer service _ if you want
to return a damaged item, if you have questions about shipping or
import tariffs _ you can expect problems, Laity said. ``The United
States as a country is way ahead on customer service, so if you are
buying overseas, anticipate difficulties if everything is not all
right with the purchase. How do you straighten it out, when the
dot-coms in Europe don't come from an environment where customer
service is as widely considered important?''
</P>
<P>
   One way to protect yourself is to pay by credit card; you can
always dispute the charge. Even better, some overseas Web sites
will calculate your credit card payment in United States dollars.
For instance, at www.chinesejade.com (a jeweler headquartered in
Hong Kong), www.aviapress.com (a Russian seller of aviation-related
books) and www.indiagiftcenter.com (in India), buyers make credit
card payments through CCNow of Delaware, which processes credit
card transactions for about 7,000 merchants, 30 percent of whom are
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   That method worked well for me when I recently bought a poster
from a Hong Kong art dealer who happened to be a CCNow client. The
seller calculated a final price (including shipping costs) in
dollars and informed me that no duty was owed. (A U.S. Customs
spokesman told me that duty is assessed on purchases over $100
unless they fall into such duty-free categories as books, antiques
or paintings.) As soon as CCNow processed the $15 transaction, the
seller mailed me the poster.
</P>
<P>
   I still do not know how much my cheese will cost me, however.
Fromages.com estimated that the total, 455 francs, would be about
$63. However, when I phoned American Express two days later to find
out how much my account actually was charged (currency exchange
rates can fluctuate several times in the course of a single day), I
learned the transaction had not been posted _ and might not be for
up to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the cheese itself arrived much sooner, lovingly wrapped
in protective silver foil and nestled in a bed of torn paper
strips. The camembert was delicious.

   Chicago (5-6) vs. Detroit (6-4) (12 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Chicago leads the NFC in passing offense,
averaging 263.9 yards per game? The Bears use multiple
wide-receiver sets but most frequently gets the ball into the hands
of Bobby Engram, who has caught 56 passes. Quarterback Jim Miller
owns an 82.3 passer rating for the season and in his last two games
a 107.7 rating, both overtime affairs that the Bears split. Charlie
Batch returns at quarterback for Detroit and expect him to shine.
Look for receiver Germane Crowell (16.8 average yards gained per
catch) to make big plays. And the Detroit defense, allowing an
average of only 87.7 rushing yards per game, will control the
Bears. Detroit has lost two straight but rights itself for a sprint
toward the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 26-10.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (8-2) vs. Dallas (5-5) (4 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Here comes Jimmy Johnson back to Texas Stadium for the first
time in six years. He left in a huff, wound up in Miami and now
faces many of the players he drafted and coached. Dallas expects an
intense fight from Johnson and his new players. And the Cowboys
will be prepared. Watch Emmitt Smith. He needs 125 rushing yards to
join Barry Sanders as the only players in league history to rush
for nine consecutive 1,000-yard seasons (Sanders had 10 seasons).
Miami enters with the better defense, Dallas with the better
offense. Dan Marino hopes to play, Troy Aikman will. It will be a
festive game full of big hits and big plays but Dallas will make
more of them.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 19-17.

 &HT;    Dr. Dre's latest a welcome return but no landmark
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The much-reported story goes something like this: Prolific rap
producer Dr. Dre was sitting around the manse one day when his wife
just got tired of seeing him sit there. Get up and do something,
she insisted, and make sure it's not some record you're dancing in
tuxedos to, like in that corny ``Been There, Done That'' video.
</P>
<P>
   So being the obedient husband that he is, the architect of some
of the most offensive music made, obliged. The result is his
anticipated follow-up to the best gangster rap album ever, 1992's
``The Chronic.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chronic 2001'' soundly repositions Dr. Dre as one of the
music's most inventive producers with a keyboard. Profanities and
graphic depictions of sex (``(Expletive) You'') and violence (``The
Car Bomb'') are, once again, made as innocuous and melodic as a
jingle for a cereal commercial. And the starched khakis and tennis
shoes are back on one of the best offerings here, ``Still D.R.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Rap fans, however, may not be pacified. Unlike ``The Chronic''_
a project on which Dr. Dre created tracks for then-newcomers such
as Snoop Doggy Dogg _ on this album Dre takes the microphone a lot
more. And while he's a better writer offering a believable
perspective of life as an aging ``gangster,'' he's only
occasionally compelling. ``Chronic 2001'' isn't the singular,
cohesive pronouncement of gangster rap's merit that ``The Chronic''
was. It's just a welcome comeback with some good singles.

 &HT;    Superb weirdness from a pop savant
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must be beautiful and frightening inside Beck Hansen's head.
What sort of twisted psyche drives this 29-year-old pop savant, who
alchemizes seemingly incompatible musical references into groove
collages that are at once hilarious, seductive and deeply weird?
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Sexx Laws,'' the first track on the ``official''
follow-up to his groundbreaking 1996 release ``Odelay.'' (Last
year's slight, stripped-down ``Mutations'' was deemed a career
sidestep.) The song hits the ground swinging to a horn-driven,
``Austin Powers'' beat, only to be rudely interrupted by a banjo
solo.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Deliverance'' interlude is just the first of myriad
funhouse surprises. More down-and-dirty than ``Odelay,'' both in
subject matter and groove execution, ``Midnite Vultures'' gives
props to a host of funk and pop icons in its scattershot search for
the perfect sex beat. ``Nicotine &AMP; Gravy'' evokes Sly Stone by way
of Parliament. ``Get Real Paid'' pits Prince against Kraftwerk in a
bloodless death match.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the lyrics are a white-water ride through the
subconscious. ``People look so snooty/Take pills make them
moody/Automatic bzooty/Zero to tutti frutti,'' Beck raps on
``Hollywood Freaks,'' conjuring, in his patented wacked-out way,
the vivid surreality of La-La Land.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, ``Midnite Vultures'' temporarily abandons its
transcendental funk-party vibe, retreating into the
modified-Beatles musings heard on ``Mutations.'' But Beck dons the
velvet soul-man suit one more time on the final track. ``Debra'' is
a dead-on, between-the-sheets '70s R&AMP;B number that finds the singer
crooning _ in perfect falsetto _ to a would-be lover: ``I want to
get with you/and your sister/I think her name's Debra.'' Like all
of Beck's best work, it's so good it's scary.

ONBOARD MODEMS WILL LET FANS TRACK RACE ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By CATBHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armchair sailors will be able to follow the America's Cup
yachting race from both their TV sets and their computers, thanks
to a new system that receives data from wireless modems aboard the
yachts.
</P>
<P>
   The system, developed by the Electronic Co. of New Zealand and
Telecom New Zealand, is in place now and broadcasting the Louis
Vuitton Cup, in which 11 teams participate in a series of round
robin races for the chance to compete against Team New Zealand, the
Cup defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Each yacht in the race carries a global positioning satellite
device, which constantly monitors its position in terms of latitude
and longitude. A Sierra Wireless MP200 cellular modem, built to
withstand heavy vibration, is also mounted on each yacht. Similar
modems are zipped into inflatable pouches on marker buoys along the
18.5 nautical mile course.
</P>
<P>
   As the yachts move through the course, the modems transmit
multiple streams of information _ GPS location data as well as data
on wind speed and direction _ to Animation Research, a New Zealand
graphics company. The transmissions will occur two times each
second during the qualifying races, and five times each second
during the America's Cup. The information is then translated into
an animated simulation of the yachts at sea on a TV or computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The animation program, which will be featured on ESPN, was
originally developed to give TV viewers a better perception of the
yachts' progress, said Tony Thomas, chief executive of the
America's Cup. For $70, America's Cup fans who visit
www.americascup.org can purchase the Virtual Spectator animation CD
package, and use it to translate race updates as they are
transmitted over the Internet. They can also download and watch
races that already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often difficult to tell which yacht is ahead by watching
video footage,'' he said. ``We wanted to educate the viewers as to
exactly where the yacht is in relation to the finish mark.'' Dotted
lines and flowing arrows on the screen also indicate the distances
between two yachts, their trails, which direction they are moving
in relation to the finish mark, the distance to the finish mark,
and the wind direction.
</P>
<P>
   When the Young America yacht split in half on Nov. 9th while
racing Nippon of Japan, for example, a dot flashed in place while
the dot representing Nippon moved up the screen. Running commentary
in the lower right hand corner describes wind and current
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   There was some initial concern among race participants when the
modems were installed that another team could use some of the
transmitted information. If one yacht were able to learn of another
yacht's speed during its trajectory into and away from the wind
toward the final mark, (which is known as optimum velocity made
good), it could develop its own course based on that information.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want another yacht to know what speed you're
going for,'' said Dawn Riley, captain of America True, the coed
team representing the San Francisco Yacht Club. ``It's kind of like
stealing a playbook.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, slight distortions are created in the information
that's relayed from the yachts. If the GPS data, for example,
relays a yacht traversing an ocean swell, the program might depict
it moving across a flat surface. The effect is an accurate enough
simulation for racing fans, but the graphics are not technical
enough to reveal anything significant to a competing team.
</P>
<P>
   But even with distortions, some of the teams view and rehash the
recorded races after they are over. ``We use it to analyze our
tactics,'' Ms. Riley said. ``It gives us an idea of when we were
doing well against the other yachts, and when we weren't.''

   Frequently voted the Spice Girl most likely to succeed as a solo
artist, Melanie C. (the artist formerly known as Sporty Spice)
takes her shot with this sometimes ambitious, sometimes
underwhelming collection of rock, pop and dance-oriented tunes. Her
voice isn't bad, and her sun-bleached image makeover makes as much
as possible of her muscular body tone and tattooed midriff. But,
musically, ``Northern Star'' is only consistent in its
inconsistency. Working with producers William Orbit (''Ray of
Light'') and Rick Rubin (Red Hot Chili Peppers), she samples grunge
and techno-inspired approaches but is never fully convincing as a
surrogate Bjork or Breeder. She's most effective when she sticks to
acoustic-tinted ballads that give her vocals the most room to
breathe. Look out, Jewel!

   Oooh, the heavy-osity! The soundtrack to the most blockbusterish
of current end-of-the-world movies is as bruisingly hard-core as
you'd expect, given it's the backdrop for Arnold Schwarzenegger's
doomsday battle with the devil. Of course, it's hard to know if
these bands _ a ``parental advisory'' hit parade that includes
Korn, Limp Bizkit, Eminem and comeback kid Axl Rose, with his first
new tune in seven years _ are truly down with the Terminator or
merely pawns of Satan. What's obvious, however, is that most of
these tracks sound like reruns. Prodigy and Rob Zombie provide the
usual mindless fun, though, and Sonic Youth's vintage ``Sugar
Kane'' offers some historical context for how real noise edged its
way into the rock mainstream. As for Guns N' Roses, the histrionic
``Oh My God'' suggests Rose is trying too hard to make a point
that's already irrelevant. But with a new album due soon, he's got
plenty more opportunities.

   `The Iron Giant' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame to see kids swamping theaters playing that
buy-the-collectibles extravaganza ``Pokemon: The First Movie,''
while Warner Bros. couldn't get an audience for this smart and
sweet animated feature. It's one of the summer's overlooked gems.
</P>
<P>
   Based on British poet Ted Hughes' book, but transferred to Cold
War America of the 1950s, it's the tale of a young boy who
befriends the titular man-machine. The big guy has fallen from the
sky but doesn't seem to know his mission. Is he as gentle as he
seems, or programmed for a darker purpose?
</P>
<P>
   The movie mixes comedy, action and an animation style that's
definitely not Disney, but has a jazzy style all its own. Speaking
of Disney, you don't get songs and adorable sidekicks, but a
bittersweet tale of friendship that gives adults in the room as
much to enjoy as their kids. Priced to buy: $22.95 VHS, $24.98 DVD.

you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's probably the most

   &QR;  ``The Haunting'' (PG-13) _ Scary in all the worst ways. ``The
Haunting'' is a Hollywood debacle, an overpriced mess with only one
scare in it. That scare is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It
has nothing to do with the over-the-top computer effects that make
this less a remake of the 1963 classic than a theme park in search
of a script. The unlucky actors include Liam Neeson, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Limbo'' (R) _ Independent filmmaker John Sayles is at his
most independent-minded in this intriguing and inherently honorable
movie whose parts don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's as if he
set out to make one film _ a tender, middle-aged romance told
against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska _ and then
got interested in something totally different: an unsettling
metaphysical survival tale. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Love Letter'' (PG-13) _ Not lovable, but generally
likable. An anonymous love letter circulates among the residents of
a small New England town setting off enough rendezvous, revelations
and romantic misunderstandings to fill a Shakespeare comedy. The
film has two problems: It flirts with a serious case of the cutes,
and Kate Capshaw, while sexually appealing and adorably flustered,
never quite takes over her own star vehicle. Still, it generates
enough low-key charm to keep you interested. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Autumn Tale'' (unrated) _ Magali (Beatrice Romand), a
long-widowed Frenchwoman in her mid-40s, becomes the object of some
strenuous matchmaking by her longtime best friend (Marie Riviere)
and by the young woman (Alexia Portal) who's dating Magali's son.
The film is overflowing with generosity, humor and insight. By
being both sympathetic to and ironic about the simple fact that the
prospect of seeking out romance reduces us all to cringing
adolescents, master director Eric Rohmer, now almost 80, imparts
wisdom that's aged to perfection. Subtitles. Grade: A-

   NEW DELHI _ Experts now agree that the first sunrise of the new
millennium will not be out in the Pacific somewhere, but over a
small tropical island in the far south of the Bay of Bengal, by the
name of Katchal.
</P>
<P>
   This news seems to have come as something of a shock to the
Indian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The new minister of tourism, Uma Bharti, said on Monday that
``elaborate plans were being made to attract people to Katchal
island...which Greenwich Observatory has recognized as being the
first place in the world where the sunrise of the new millennium
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading Delhi travel agents, however, looked blank at mention of
the island's name. ``Where?'' asked one, who had not heard of the
place. ``You might be able to get there,'' said another. ``But I
don't think it's been marketed enough _ and it's too late to market
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts from Greenwich confirm that, if the new millennium
starts at zero hours GMT, the first sunrise of the new millennium
must be where the sun is rising at that precise moment.
</P>
<P>
   This encompasses half of a great circle running from Eastern
Russia through China, across the Bay of Bengal and on towards the
Antarctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   On the passage through the Bay of Bengal it alights, at
precisely the right time, on the island of Katchal, in the Nicobar
chain.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly intrepid, then, Katchal, though entering late in
the race, would seem to be the destination of choice. Travellers
can get most of the way there without much fuss: the round-trip
from Delhi to Port Blair, capital of the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands, with an overnight stop in Calcutta, costs about $800.
</P>
<P>
   From Port Blair to Katchal is some 230 nautical miles, and
although the travel trade disclaims much knowledge of it, India's
director-general of tourism, Ashok Pradha, says ``We have made
arrangements for at least seven ships to sail to Katchal to bring
visitors to have a look at the first sunrise of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The ships are important because, although visitors will be able
to see Katchal and the sun's rays falling on it, they will not, it
appears, be allowed to disembark.
</P>
<P>
   Katchal is not the classic desert island of cartoons _ it is
more than 20 kilometers (13 miles) in circumference and contains
rubber plantations _ but foreigners are banned from setting foot on
all the Nicobar Islands, for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Catchy name aside, Port Blair, from where the ``seven ships''
will sail, would itself make a distinctively different place to
celebrate the new Millennium _ or at least to wish good riddance to
the one just finished.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal residents of the chain have been decimated by the
usual western menaces of Christianity, syphilis and deforestation.
The eponymous Lt. Blair sailed here in 1777, instructed to set up a
penal colony, but was defeated by disease and lack of food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   On the third attempt, in 1858, the penal colony was established,
and Port Blair's only historical monument is the grim ``Cellular
Jail,'' a classic circular ``panopticon'' (completed in 1905) where
prisoners could be kept under constant surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Indian freedom fighters suffered in its hideous
conditions, and many died. When the Japanese invaded during World
War II they carried on the good work.
</P>
<P>
   Andaman's many tribal peoples offer another diversion, including
the Andamanese, exceptional in that they never discovered
fire-making; and the Jarawa, who sing and dance at each full moon,
and ``in apparent friendliness,'' as a recent guide book puts it,
``fart in the face of the visitors.'' &QL;

   Childhood has become expendable in the remote jungles and coca
tracts of Colombia after four decades of civil war. The army
routinely calls up underage soldiers for active duty, and they
account for nearly 22 percent of the force.
</P>
<P>
   This year an estimated 15,000 teenage troops serve in Colombia's
army, national security units and police force, and most of them
are between the ages of 15 and 17. Many of the enemies they stalk
are children, too.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing paramilitaries call their young fighters ``little
bells'' because, deployed out in front, they tend to draw fire and
warn of guerrilla traps.
</P>
<P>
   Children as young as eight years old have been seen on patrol
with these paras. They witness random torture, farmers being
butchered alive, corpses being mutilated, and families being driven
from their land at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   With at least a million people displaced by the warfare, many
Colombian families rupture.
</P>
<P>
   Marxist rebels term their swarming juveniles ``little bees''
since they can sting before the enemy is even aware of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of some guerrilla units consist of boys and
girls, and if captured, the army often forces them to find and
deactivate the mines they make and deploy for the rebel fighters,
or to act as informants or guides.
</P>
<P>
   Runaways are considered deserters and often are executed on the
spot by the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) or the
ELN (National Liberation Army).
</P>
<P>
   Militia, which train future guerrillas and are targetted by
paramilitary groups, can have as many as 80 percent children. A
high proportion of these youngsters are kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, after an army offensive that killed hundreds of
rebels, officials invited reporters to the battle zone before all
the corpses were whisked away. Among dozens of dead guerrillas on
display were several pubescent boys and a pregnant teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Although peace talks now are underway, FARC rebels refuse to
observe a truce and attacked thirteen villages across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Six policemen were killed last week when young guerrillas
strapped a grenade to a dog and shooed it into a police station in
central Tolima state. Such tactics are like childish pranks with
deadly consequences and retaliation is swift.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of international legislation and a burgeoning peace
movement, there's no sign of curbing Colombia's child soldiers. &QL;

   JOHANNESBURG _ Even before it faces issues like nutrition,
education and unemployment, a newly-born South African child's
greatest challenge is to reach school age without becoming infected
or being directly affected by HIV.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the fastest growing rates of HIV in the world
and, consequently, the most alarming prognosis for the next
generation. Already 20 percent of the work force is estimated to be
infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In six years' time there are expected to be one million AIDS
orphans in the country _ children left homeless because they are
HIV positive or parentless because both their mother and father
have died from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are villages outside Durban where you find grannies with
20 or 30 children in their care,'' says Heather Reynolds. When the
granny dies, we have to find another adult to care for children,''
says Mrs. Reynolds who runs an orphanage for 35 children near the
port city of Durban in Kwa Zulu-Natal, the area of South Africa
worst affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is referred to as a national emergency. It is already a
national catastrophe'' she says. ``One in five children in this
country is born HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deadly effect of AIDS is capable of obliterating the
benefits of the end of apartheid and replacing them with something
much more ruthless.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS remains taboo-ridden in southern Africa, and is exacerbated
by ignorance. One commonly-held view is that an HIV-positive man
can cure himself by sleeping with a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it can be treated with a range of herbs, roots
and vegetables, sold for exorbitant prices by traditional healers
and generally only good for alleviating symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government claims that it would take a quarter
of the country's annual health budget to treat HIV-positive people,
including pregnant mothers, with life-prolonging drugs such as AZT.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have shown that pregnant women, given a
three-month course of AZT can be prevented from passing the virus
on to their child.
</P>
<P>
   But the cash-strapped South African government, to save money,
has decided not to treat anyone at all, pregnant or not. It claims
that the reason is that AZT is not safe.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about child rates of HIV and the number of orphans
are scarce but the trend is sufficiently alarming for British Prime
Minister Tony and Cherie Blair to have ``adopted'' a 7-year-old
orphan, known as ``Mary'' when they were in Cape Town in January.
The child lives in the Nazareth House orphanage, funded by a
religious order in West London. &QL;

HEALTH INSURANCE IS NOT ALWAYS A CURE-ALL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kate and Brian Stenz were devastated in 1996 to
learn their newborn son Zachary had hemophilia, which robs the body
of its blood-clotting function.
</P>
<P>
   They were confident that Brian's health insurance would cover at
least the first 10 years of the expensive medical treatment he
would need. But this June, with insurance picking up as much as
$35,000 a month for medication, the Stenzes learned they had
``capped out'' on the policy's $1 million lifetime limit.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent $8,000 out of pocket and facing medical bills of
$100,000 a year in a best-case scenario, the young Columbus, Ohio,
couple found themselves staring into a financial abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the cap was going to be increased, but that didn't
happen, and the bills continued to mount,'' said Brian, a salesman
of industrial products.
</P>
<P>
   Although they found alternative insurance coverage, the Stenzes
live under the shadow of abruptly losing it. ``It's a ticking time
bomb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stenzes are among an estimated 31 million people who are
underinsured, people who risk spending more than 10 percent of
their own annual income in the event of a catastrophic illness,
according to Consumers Union, the non-profit organization that
publishes Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have a false sense of security about their
insurance,'' said Gail Shearer, the organization's director of
health policy analysis. ``A financial crisis situation can sneak up
on people unexpectedly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 Consumers Union report, the number of
underinsured had risen 40 percent in the previous 15 years. The 31
million people in that category comprise close to 16 percent of the
195 million Americans under age 65 with health insurance.
Approximately 44 million under 65 have no health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the largest concentration of the underinsured are
those with the greatest need for health care and the least ability
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care has gotten so expensive relative to what people
make that neither employer nor consumer can afford to buy insurance
that covers everything,'' said Pam Farley Short, who heads
Pennsylvania State University's Center for Health Policy Research
and who has studied the underinsured for 15 years. Many people, she
added, ``could wake up and find they weren't as insured as they
thought they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Short said that to be safe, people should have insurance with a
lifetime cap of $10 million or more for catastrophic illness. The
typical $1 million cap, which dates to the 1970s, may not be
sufficient in an era where the cost of new treatments is
skyrocketing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   People also should have a cap on maximum out-of-pocket
expenditures of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family,
Short added. Without a cap of some kind, a person with serious
cancer whose plan pays, say, 90 percent of the treatment costs, can
be out $20,000 if the treatment bills hit $200,000, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Policies should cover outpatient prescription drugs and at least
30 days of inpatient mental health services and 30 outpatient
visits, Short suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and John D. (Jay)
Rockefeller, D-W.Va. have fought for legislation that would phase
in a $5 million catastrophic illness cap, with a $10 million cap
following that. The bill has gone nowhere, but Jeffords plans to
reintroduce it when Congress reconvenes next year, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Christopher Reeve, paralyzed from the neck down after a
horse-riding accident in 1995, has lobbied for passage of the
legislation. At the time the cost of Reeve's medical treatment was
estimated at $400,000 a year. Reeve has reached the $1.2 million
cap on one insurance policy and is close to the limit on a second
policy, according to a spokesperson for the actor.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesperson declined to disclose details on the second
policy or on a third policy that Reeve carries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the presidential candidates, only former Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., has focused on the underinsured. In his health
care proposal, Bradley said that ``no American should have to worry
about being one serious illness or injury away from financial
ruin.'' Bradley also called for a special insurance fund to help
those with major health needs.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that increasingly people in managed care plans
who have trouble getting approval for certain treatments find
themselves in the same fix as the underinsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, your plan may look like a great plan,'' said Gail
Jensen, an economist who studies health care at Wayne State
University in Detroit. ``But when you need it the most, you may
find you have less than you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen knows the pitfalls from first-hand experience. Two years
ago, her 13-year-old daughter attempted suicide. Jensen battled her
managed care plan to get continuous treatment for the girl at a
mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen's plan refused to cover more than a week at the hospital
at a time. Her daughter was released still threatening to kill
herself and was readmitted twice after two more failed attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frightening,'' Jensen said. Her daughter is now
doing better even though she is still on medication, Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you don't discover about you plan until it
is too late,'' Jensen said. ``You may conclude, as I did, that you
don't have enough insurance.''

SKILLED WORKERS LEAVING SOUTH TEXAS DESPITE BOOM

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys' spring training camp, a
citrus-lined water park and a tire plant all share a kindred
purpose in the lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   They are economic development ventures launched by various
Valley cities to lure jobs and improve the image of a rapidly
developing corridor on the Texas-Mexico border, an area enjoying
new opportunities but hobbled by old problems.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Valley has occupied the dead-last position on
most state economic charts. So it is not surprising that city
leaders, faced with chronically high rates of unemployment in a
region where 45 percent of residents live below the poverty level
and educational attainment is low, are desperate to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And, in recent months, there are indications of a ``brain
drain'' as skilled workers take their talents to Houston, Dallas,
San Antonio and Fort Worth, where higher-paying jobs abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see people going to other areas of the state, they are
people with skills,'' laments Perry Vaughn, director of the
Associated General Contractors in Harlingen, who is working with
other groups to expand skilled training in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But some community leaders have begun to question the wisdom of
recruiting corporations with publicly funded incentives _ including
large tax abatements, free land and free training for new employees
_ if the jobs created only pay minimum wage or slightly better.
</P>
<P>
   They are referred to as poverty wages, paying $7.50 an hour or
less, putting a family of four with one wage-earner below the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the kind of economic development that is going to
bring the Valley into the 21st century,'' insists Sister Judy
Donovan, an organizer with Valley Interfaith, a community
betterment group drawing membership from Catholic parishes. ``It's
going to put the Valley in first place on a race to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to change the culture of poverty wages, the
thinking that any job is a good job, especially when it comes to
utilizing public dollars (to attract them),'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   City officials in McAllen spend half a million dollars annually
in sales tax revenues to operate the McAllen Economic Development
Corp. Over the last dozen years the corporation's staff has
recruited 152 companies to McAllen and 189 to Reynosa, McAllen's
Mexican sister city across the Rio Grande. In all, the companies
have created 9,893 jobs on the U.S. side and 46,988 in Mexico,
according to a recent tally by the city agency.
</P>
<P>
   But development officials say they are only now completing an
analysis of how much these jobs pay local residents.
</P>
<P>
   However, one clue can be found in the 4,107 new jobs created by
10 companies that recently moved to McAllen, according to a Nov. 8
status report prepared for the McAllen City Commission. Only 127
jobs of those jobs pay $10 per hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   And while the 10 companies are projected to provide a yearly
payroll of $93.6 million and spend $53 million on capital
expenditures, about 1,500 jobs will pay $7.50 per hour or lower _
including 300 part-time telemarketing jobs paying $6.50 per hour
without benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Allen, the director of McAllen's development agency, said
low-paying employers are not given incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we don't recruit companies that pay only $6.50 (per
hour) or something like that,'' he said. ``We're going after
companies that will pay better wages than that _ $7.50 is our
bottom. But if they come, they come, but we don't provide them any
financial incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   Some elected officials are concerned that the new jobs are not
always as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating the largest population of uninsured people in
the history of the Valley, whether we realize it or not,'' warns
Paul Cowan, the chief aide to St. Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville.
``It's because we're moving people from welfare to work, and work
doesn't have full medical benefits. Some of these polices have high
deductible and co-payments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least on welfare, they have it (medical coverage). But
you're not insured if you have to make a $1,000 co-payment,'' Cowan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, negotiations have advanced to bring the Dallas
Cowboys' spring training camp to a new sports complex under
construction in Mission, part of a sprawling industrial and
residential development being built by Dallas developer Ray Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The cities of Mission and McAllen and the Hidalgo County
government have agreed to pay the Cowboys $1 million over three
years to move their training to the Valley from Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got chambers of commerce and development corporations
all over the Valley who are spending literally hundreds of
thousands of dollars advertising the Valley as place to do
business, a place to take vacations, a place to live,'' notes Randy
Whittington, a Harlingen attorney who chairs the Rio Grande Valley
Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about free advertising that is worth many
multiples of that. It literally puts the Valley on the map, on
national TV, any number of times a day while they are in training
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittington said a university analysis estimated the Cowboys
training camp generated $6 million in direct revenue to Wichita
Falls, after hotel, meal and other expenses were computed for the
football team, a pack of 400 to 500 journalists from around the
world and thousands of fans who attended the daily practice
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy owner Jerry Jones has said he would make a decision on
the camp in December. ``The champagne is chilled, but we haven't
popped the cork yet,'' Whittington said.
</P>
<P>
   In Edinburg, city leaders loaned $600,000 from a city garbage
collection fund to cover budget shortfalls at a 35-acre water park
financed by $21.3 million in revenue bonds sold by the Edinburg
Industrial Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   SuperSplash! Adventure Waterpark, which was supposed to turn a
profit, instead has lost nearly $900,000 since opening in July
1998. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The water park is part of a family entertainment complex that
city officials are developing, which includes a public golf course,
a city park and a $10 million movie complex. Officials still say
the expect the development to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, local officials expressed confidence that a huge
tire plant will eventually live up to earlier expectations. The
Titan Tire Corp. plant moved to$ 9kkW-[e

BOOK TELLS HOW TO REPAIR THE IRREPLACABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETSY FRIAUF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your mom has good taste, so over the years she's acquired some
beautiful things in addition to her children. A number of those
things have gotten broken. The favorite vase (cracked), the
heirloom string of pearls (unstrung) have been pushed to the back
of the cabinet and the jewelry box.
</P>
<P>
   So this Christmas, why not fix something Mom loves?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at ``Care and Repair of Everyday Treasures'' by
Judith Miller (Reader's Digest, $29.95 hardcover), a step-by-step
for fixing all of those favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   If this klutz can do it _ and I once Superglued fingers on
different hands together _ you can, too. And if you become
proficient, think of all the broken garage-sale treasures you can
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some repairs I attempted, and the results:
</P>
<P>
   The vintage champagne glasses _ chipped
</P>
<P>
   Not the currently fashionable flutes, these resembled delicate,
etched custard dishes on 6-inch stems. They were a set of four, all
dangerously nicked around the rim.
</P>
<P>
   As directed in ``Care and Repair,'' I started with a wooden
dowel and wrapped it in a strip of fine-grit silicon-carbide paper.
This is also known as wet-dry paper, as I would have known had I
read the resource directory at the back of the book.
</P>
<P>
   I filled a bowl, larger than the glass, half-full of water, so I
could use one hand to rewet the rim repeatedly while holding a
grit-wrapped dowel in the other hand. After a moderate application
of elbow grease, it was gratifying to see the nicks disappear.
Results: Excellent
</P>
<P>
   Cost: I found the tapered dowel in the garage, so the whole
operation cost the price of grit paper: 79 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The cracked and stained teapot
</P>
<P>
   This small Blue Willow-ish pot, an anniversary gift, had a long,
deep and aged crack, and the surrounding area was badly stained.
The borax-followed-by-bleach treatment recommended in ``Care and
Repair'' brightened the piece considerably. (I remembered to clean
the lid so it would match the pot.) But hours of soaking didn't
touch the stain that had seeped in via the crack. Time to get
messy.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered the whitening agent titanium dioxide from an
old-fashioned pharmacy. ``Care and Repair'' vows that it prevents
glue from yellowing. I mixed the powder (about $1 an ounce, and a
teeny bit goes a very long way) into Superglue, between sneezing
fits. Handling titanium dioxide, a gritty powder, calls for a
respirator mask; the label cautions that it is an irritant. Also
advisable are thin latex gloves, because all adhesives are hard on
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   I spread my concoction over the crack with a tiny wooden
spatula, then nestled the teapot in a basket lined with dish towels
to keep the repaired side up. I let it dry a couple of days, then
sanded away the excess with wet-dry grit paper.
</P>
<P>
   Along the repair line, the pattern was obscured. I used a 3/0
liner paintbrush, $2 at a craft store, and dabs of blue, black and
white acrylic paint from my children's art supplies, to fill in the
pattern. I started over a couple of times, but I just don't have
the skill to paint a subtle pattern whose color varies several
shades along 5 inches. ``Brave'' was my kind co-worker's
description of my efforts. I'll be easy on myself and call it folk
art.
</P>
<P>
   Results: Disappointing
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $5
</P>
<P>
   The broken bracelet
</P>
<P>
   Grandma's mother-of-pearl bracelet had cracked, predictably on
the link that once had the closure. I'd always imagined a young man
risking loss of a digit to scoop it from the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   My attempts at repair were less romantic. The broken-off
filigree piece was about 1/16 by 1/2 inch. I chose clear glass
adhesive (about $3). Suffice it to say that impatience was the
major obstacle. Minute repairs such as this are best attacked with
plenty of time, a mounted magnifying glass in excellent light and
the finest, tiniest tweezers you can find.
</P>
<P>
   I found it was helpful to mount the bracelet on a small ball of
modeling clay to hold it steady during repair and curing. I got in
a hurry the first go-round and broke the bond. The second time was
the charm. I finished the project with a 99-cent clasp and links
cadged from other broken jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Results: Excellent
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $4
</P>
<P>
   The favorite mug with broken handle
</P>
<P>
   Dad's best mug had lost its handle.
</P>
<P>
   The titanium dioxide-epoxy mixture cemented it perfectly, and as
``Care and Repair'' recommends, I used a long strip of masking tape
to secure it, then set it, handle-up, to cure overnight in a basket
lined with crumpled paper towels. The little gaps were filled with
epoxy putty, allowed to dry, sanded and lightly lacquered. Dad's
back in business, although the epoxy didn't quite fill the chinks.
</P>
<P>
   Results: Serviceable though short of excellent
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $2
</P>
<P>
   A different approach
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the home of someone you care about, there's a piece
of art or memorabilia that deserves to be seen. And before it can
be seen, and subjected to sunlight, dust, rampaging kids and New
Year's Eve beverages held aloft, it needs proper framing.
</P>
<P>
   Among my family's Christmas decorations is a spirit-of-Christmas
editorial my father wrote more than 25 years ago. My aunt had it
framed with red and green matting, and we've treasured it ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   William Campbell, who has kept a gallery in Fort Worth for a
quarter-century, says the important thing in framing archival
material is protection from sunlight and avoidance of acidic mats
and frames. ``Take care of all the safeguards if it's really worth
something to you,'' he said. Allow two weeks. Expect to pay about
$60-$200.
</P>
<P>
   Or be cheap, like me. I found a big box of filthy, banged-up
5-by-7-inch picture frames at a garage sale in southwest Fort
Worth. Nice molding, with an elegant bead. Some had glass, too.
They were 10 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   A friend says they're maple, circa 1935. I sanded off the grime,
Windexed the glass. On a shelf in my garage, I found little dabs of
leftover paint: sky blue, ivory, metallic gold. Bought a $3 can of
varnish and slapped it on. All this made the frame look too new, so
I cut up an emery board and sanded off itsy bits of the ivory paint
and blended the blue into it. Dug up a family photo from 1901. Oh,
what luck; it fit. With 25 cents' worth of picture wire, it'll be
ready to wrap and put under the tree. Except I don't want to part
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Results: Excellent
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $3.25
</P>
<P>
   What you can fix
</P>
<P>
   ``Care and Repair of Everyday Treasures'' walks the reader
through projects covering everything in your mom's house, plus your
great-aunt's attic. Each section details cleaning, plus more
elaborate work. Examples:
</P>
<P>
   Furniture: From removal of water rings to structural repairs. Go
ahead, reassemble a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Canework: Strengthen worn examples of this elegant use of
rattan. Or, if you're a weaver, recane an entire seat.
</P>
<P>
   Upholstery: Stitch up a small tear, reupholster a button-back
chair or anything in between. It helps if you're a seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   Leather: Patch a tear. Replace a desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles: Dry-clean an antique doily. Fix moth-eaten
needlepoint.
</P>
<P>
   Rugs and carpets: Repair small tears, or reweave. .MDUL/.MDNM/

DON'T CALL 911 FOR `ER' _ ITS VITAL SIGNS ARE GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All this talk of ``ER'' having lost a step or two is nonsense.
Knee-jerk reaction, I'd say, to a sleek and sly series that no
longer tries to keep up its former frenetic pace yet still manages
to remain remarkably consistent, despite this season's risky
personnel changes and big-star drive-bys.
</P>
<P>
   How good is ``ER,'' still? Unlike a drama such as ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' where because of its
half-cop-chase/half-courtroom-showdown formula the characters are a
distant second to story, ``ER'' continues to reinvent itself _ to
go under its own knife in an attempt to look fresher, leaner,
meaner.
</P>
<P>
   When people say that ``ER'' isn't what it used to be _ well,
they're absolutely right. But what is? What should be? And in a
season that is, night for night, show for show, the best I've
witnessed in some time, could it also be that once you take in
something as uniquely appealing as, say, ``Now &AMP; Again,'' wouldn't
a 6-year-old drama pale a bit when examined under the same
lighting?
</P>
<P>
   But why take my word? A new episode is offered up tonight, on
Thanksgiving, at 9 p.m., the time at which you'll be fat and happy
and barely moving from the couch. Watch it, digest it, give another
shot to a series that has taken great pains to maintain its
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Thank sweeps and gumption for the new episodes. Usually on this
holiday, the networks pull out reruns or call it a night by pulling
out blockbuster theatrical films. (Fox is going with ``Home Alone
2,'' while ABC counters with ``Forrest Gump.'') Although the
feeling in Hollywood is that people don't sit in front of the tube
on Thanksgiving, my thinking has always been: Where else can they
wobble off to? To play a board game?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``ER'' is part of a strong, all-new episode night that
I highly recommend as a package deal. It includes regulars like
``Friends'' (Chandler meets Monica's parents) and ``Frasier''
(Lilith's back) but with ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace''
(the series that should have been on this day anyhow, not ``Stark
Raving Mad,'' although my neighbor would feverishly disagree; Neil
Patrick Harris seems to crack him up) creeping over from its
Tuesday night perch.
</P>
<P>
   As for tonight's ``ER,'' surely you've seen the promos where
Nurse Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) goes into labor on the subway.
Because I've been sworn to secrecy as to the outcome, let's move on
to the story line involving the return of John Cullum as Dr.
Greene's (Anthony Edwards) ill-natured father. Along with Greene's
daughter, (Yvonne Zima) who thinks quite lowly of his new love, Dr.
Elizabeth Corday (British actress Alex Kingston), Cullum comes with
both barrels firing. The relationship between Cullum's character
and Dr. Greene is, with the exception of the hot-cold entanglement
of Annie Potts and Lorraine Toussaint on Lifetime's ``Any Day
Now,'' the most prickly and strained and realistic pairing in prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, though, Dr. Greene is called away from their uneasy
Thanksgiving dinner to assist with Hathaway's difficult delivery
(did I say difficult?) leaving Dr. Corday to deal with a couple of
medical surprises. Funny how ``ER's'' most promoted episodes (and
usually its best efforts) are those that take place outside the
hospital, from Dr. Peter Benton's (Eriq LaSalle) trip to the Deep
South to George Clooney's renegade life-saving maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably because without knowing it, we, too, need a
break from the dizzying number of medical cases; to turn away, at
least for a while, from the blood and gore and medical jargon
flying over our heads _ though there's a lot of all that sprouting
about tonight. And for all its emergency-room razzle-dazzle,
stories about where these people go and what they do after leaving
the hospital makes for intoxicating drama.
</P>
<P>
   The terrific thing about the new season is that it's not only
Dr. Greene's personal life that has become complicated and messy
and therefore enjoyable. Thankfully Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes)
has returned to cranky form; for a minute there, the writers were
sucking the life out of her character by softening her edges, by
making her care.
</P>
<P>
   Benton is still reeling from the possibility of losing his son
to out-of-the-country relocation by the boy's mother and new hubby,
and who knows what will happen with Hathaway, last seen tonight
with a look of terror painted on her face. (Did I say terror?)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Romano (Paul McCrane) made quite an impression over
the past few seasons in a recurring role as a malicious schemer who
matches Dr. Weaver in back-stabbing, political maneuvering and
withering deadpan cracks. (His too-brief comments last week
concerning Dr. Carter's presence in an administrative services
meeting were priceless.) Why he hasn't gotten more screen time as
of late is something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Michael Michele, one of the new cast
members who has been seen mostly swooping in to interject her
medical passions on others, mostly to Lucy (Kellie Martin) and
exercising _ running, doing push-ups, sit-ups. Tonight she's
jumping rope in the snow, prompting Hathaway to quip, ``I remember
when I was that skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   And I remember when Lucy was trumpeted as The Young Savior of a
drama that feared getting stale. Either Martin's college work is
preventing her character from being fully developed or the writers
have already lost interest and moved on to the ongoing search for a
hunk equivalent of Clooney. (It's obvious that Noah Wyle is too
lightweight for the job; Goran Visnjic as Dr. Kovac is getting a
tryout.)
</P>
<P>
   If anything pained me this season it was the disrespectful
shoo-away of physician's assistant Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben),
who left the series two episodes back. The writers apparently
having done all they could with her AIDS story line, her presence
there had dwindled. A shame, considering that Boulet's acting at
the end of last season was some of the best stuff from anyone on
any series. Having her merely walk into the emergency room and tell
Dr. Weaver that she was quitting to stay at home with her new baby
and husband wasn't a sign-off worthy of a star to whom we've become
emotionally attached.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. At least my anger was tempered somewhat when Reuben
told David Letterman the other night that her next gig was as
backup dancer on Tina Turner's tour beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because I can no longer afford the exorbitant concert ticket
prices, my only hope of getting a Reuben fix is that she'll slip
off the stage and end up being wheeled into ``ER.'' Sounds like a
nice story line to me.  &QL;

A PLACE TO REACH OUT, VIRTUALLY

 (Attn: N.Y., Texas)   (Circuits)

 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bonnie Frascatore was confined to bed for seven months
during a high-risk pregnancy, the high point of each day came when
she switched on her computer. There, every day, she received e-mail
from a woman who had experienced a pregnancy just as difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Through the e-mail, she found compassion that wasn't always
available at home _ and she did not have to contend with making her
house or herself presentable for a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to write what I wanted to write without having a
family member say, `Oh, get over it,''' said Ms. Frascatore, who is
36 and lives in upstate New York. In fact, when she went into labor
in March, she insisted that her family send e-mail to the woman, a
volunteer with a nationwide support group, to let her know.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the hospital, the first thing I said to my husband was, `I
forgot to e-mail!''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Frascatore has become a volunteer with the same
online support group, the Sidelines National Support Network
(www.sidelines.org), and sends e-mail each day to other women with
high-risk pregnancies. Her experience as a ``virtual volunteer'' is
becoming more common as nonprofit groups learn to organize helpers
who want to contribute to society from their keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Cravens, manager of the Virtual Volunteering Project
(www.serviceleader.org/vv) at the University of Texas at Austin,
has identified more than 250 organizations nationwide that have
started such programs. They range from small grass-roots
environmental groups to large educational organizations that
coordinate online mentoring of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `I want to help, but I want to do it by
computer,''' Ms. Cravens said. Her project tracks groups that allow
volunteers to work via computer and also provides training in
setting up programs.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the program started, the nonprofit world
was resistant to the notion of using the Internet. ``The idea of
working with unseen volunteers _ people think, `I'm never going to
see these people, and the Internet is crawling with pedophiles,'''
Ms. Cravens said. With time, she said, as perceptions of the
Internet matured, organizations became more open to the concept.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, outreach would not be possible without the
Internet. Last year, the San Jose Children's Musical Theater
created a production called ``Pulse: The Rhythm of Life'' by
drawing disabled and seriously ill children into the process online
as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Tegan McLane, director of the Theater as Digital Activity
program (www.sjcmt.com/TADA!), created characters based on
composites of the children who volunteered as online consultants.
</P>
<P>
   For example, producers asked the children what kinds of
challenges an 11-year-old character named Thomas with bone cancer
would face, what episodes would unfold in his life and what his
dreams and fears would be. When the songs and dialogue for the
production were written, they were posted on a Web page for the
children to critique.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cravens is compiling more examples like that every day. She
sees the Internet as an important catalyst for getting people
involved in causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick to death of stories about how the Internet is making
people lonely and cranky,'' she said. ``If anything, I've noticed
the Internet is getting people out more.''

INDEPENDENTS OFFER UP DREAMS ON DEMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, a congregation of programmers, animators and
designers assembles in San Jose, Calif., for the Game Developers
Conference, a techie jamboree dedicated to the art and science of
video games. In the spirit of innovation, last year the conference
featured a festival for independently developed games, along the
lines of Sundance or the South by Southwest conference in Austin,
Texas. The winners are announced in March, but collecting and
culling the entries takes the better part of a year.
</P>
<P>
   The process also requires people willing to install buggy alpha
versions of games with questionable artistic merit (and face the
technological consequences) in order to find the pearls.
Invariably, multiple demos bring your computer to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   But even though my PC, and my psyche, still bear the scars of
last year's balloting, I agreed to do it again this year because,
as the conference organizers reminded me (in successive e-mail
messages), I am the sort of person who supports independent
developers. So here I am again, loading labors of love onto my hard
drive with a mixture of hope and trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   The entries come from all over the world, from Silicon Valley to
Eastern Europe and Asia. As usual, it's interesting to see the way
culture maps onto game design. A posse of programmers in Texas puts
the player in the middle of an extraterrestrial invasion with guns
blazing. A studio in New York takes its inspiration from techno
music and rave graphics. A team of programmers in Russia has
somehow managed to convert a car race into chess. You place markers
along the track and specify what the car will do at those
positions. The idea of drag racing while taking turns never
occurred to me, but somehow it works.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the voices that seem to spring not from a
particular region, but rather from their own passionate and highly
colorful universe.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Azura: Amazon Avatar.
</P>
<P>
   Azura's back story alone is a testament to the fervor of the
unsung game designer: ``Azura stood like a goddess on the high
castle balcony. Casting her eyes down upon the ocean of her people,
the Amazons, she sovereignly declared war. In response, the mass of
people shouting in unison, War! drowned out all other sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Azura quickly turned on her heels into the Throne Room and
from its royal resting place, slowly and with great serenity, she
lifted the Sacred Scimmeron. From its small cylinder shape, the
true form of the Sacred Scimmeron remained hidden. When activated,
it would morph into the fastest and most destructive weapon: The
Death Sled.''
</P>
<P>
   Azura: Amazon Avatar, the entry form promises, has the following
features: ``Nonstop action and excitement! Battle hordes of
Titanaras as they try to take over your home planet of Terran and
enslave your people. Advanced Magick System: Small Fireball,
Freeze, Large Fireball, Summon Drakan and Hellfire! As you advance
in levels, your power grows. Start with the Small Fireball spell
and work your way up to the ultimate destructive spell, Hellfire!''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after several hours of installation migraines and
a dozen crashes, I was not actually able to experience this
interactive tour de force. Azura's adventures with the Death Sled
and the Sacred Scimmeron must, alas, play out in my imagination.
But perhaps that is for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Plowing through a six-inch stack of demo discs, it's easy to
adopt a hard-boiled ``Gong Show'' mentality. But every once in a
while, you find things that are made with so much generosity that
no matter how rough they are, they force you to acknowledge their
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an entry form question (``What do you hope to
achieve personally or professionally by creating this game?''), a
team of Web designers in South Korea wrote: ``Obviously, our
primary concern is that our creditors are paid, our families are
fed, and our children are clothed. We refuse to advertise on our
Web site and within our game, and we allow our customers to pay us
for increments as brief as one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions were made to guarantee that our motivation
would always be to ensure the happiness of our customers. That in
itself is a great reward.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make even the most hard-boiled game maven pine
for the days of home-brewed Commodore 64 demos and floppy-disk
role-playing adventures. Who knows, maybe some of these contest
submissions will turn into commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, most of them will never make it onto a store
shelf _ nor should they. But they need to exist, if only to remind
big-budget game producers that they were once novice programmers
whose dream was to design video games. People are still cobbling
together those dreams with the bolts and scraps of technology
available to them, and it's important that they have a place to
showcase their handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   So, long live indie games. Long live Azura: Amazon Avatar. May
she attain the power of successful installation. And when that
comes to pass, may the Death Sled spare my hard drive.

 &HT;    Heisman fervor evident on Georgia Tech campus:
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech bookstore fairly bristled the morning of Oct.
30. That afternoon, the Yellow Jackets, once-beaten and ranked No.
7, would trample poor N.C. State, thanks largely to their
undersized quarterback. The very same QB who was the impetus for
new T-shirts on sale that day. Which read, in part:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Heisman Candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Below was an outline of the state of Georgia, with the
stiff-arming Heisman Trophy superimposed on it and a large No. 14
off to the left.
</P>
<P>
   The T-shirts ($14.95 plus tax) were going as fast as Dez White
on a streak pattern. On that day, all things seemed possible _ even
that the school where John Heisman once coached finally might have
its own Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Heisman was, or is, Joe Hamilton's motivation.
''No, I don't play for that,'' he said. ''I go out and try to play
to win. Who knows? It's out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the ballots of the Heisman electorate _ at least those
voters who haven't already made up their minds and mailed the
ballots to the Downtown Athletic Club in New York. There, the
Heisman will be presented on Dec. 11. Yet when Georgia Tech and
Georgia _ two 7-3 teams who just don't dislike each other but
loathe each other _ meet Saturday in Bobby Dodd Stadium, it will be
more than Joe Hamilton's last home game and last shot at the Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It's also his last chance to make a lasting Heisman impression.
To convince voters that he, Little Joe _ who weighs 189 pounds and
is listed at 5 feet 10 but actually stands about 5-8 1/2 _ is
worthy of the Heisman. Not Ron Dayne, Wisconsin's 255-pound
fullback who earlier this month became college football's Division
1-A career rushing leader and the Heisman front-runner. Rather, the
little big man from the hamlet of Alvin, S.C., who literally put
his hometown on the South Carolina state map this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Georgia Tech has come to producing a Heisman winner
was in 1963. Another versatile quarterback, Billy Lothridge _ who
passed with his left arm, did all of Tech's punting and
placekicking and played with one kidney _ finished a distant second
in the voting to a scrambling Navy junior named Roger Staubach.
Tech's highest Heisman finish since then: 1978, when tailback Eddie
Lee Ivery was eighth the year Billy Sims ran away with it.
</P>
<P>
   In '63, while the Heisman was still one of sport's most
cherished awards, the selection process was less complicated, the
media scrutiny almost non-existent, the hype almost hushed and the
winner relatively anonymous. The year before, Johnny Gresham _ who
played at Tech 1962-64 and captained the '64 team _ picked up the
newspaper one Sunday morning to find a story about the 1962 Heisman
Trophy winner. ''I said, 'Who is Terry Baker?' '' Gresham said.
Baker was Oregon State's versatile, left-handed quarterback, whose
707 votes edged LSU halfback Jerry Stovall's 618. ''I'd literally
never heard of Terry Baker. I didn't even know he was in the
running for the Heisman Trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ran for the Heisman back then. Not as the players, their
schools and sports-information offices do now _ helped,
intentionally or not, by television networks, newspapers and
magazines that can't help hyping that Heisman thing, no matter how
prematurely. This year, as in many years, the Heisman voters decide
early and mail their ballots. Even back on Oct. 30, Dayne the
senior whom Sports Illustrated already had called one of college
football's 10 biggest disappointments was making a huge comeback.
He was closing in on the all-time rushing record of '98 Heisman
winner Ricky Williams, which Dayne broke two weeks later in his
last home game.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Virginia's Thomas Jones is this year's leading
1-A rusher and that the Heisman is awarded to the best player of
that year. Never mind that some peole view Alabama's Shaun
Alexander as a superior running back to Dayne. The Badger bulldozed
to the top of those weekly Heisman race charts that run all season,
and he did it largely on the strength of his life's body of work,
not this season's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the rules (for the Heisman) change every year,''
said Malcom Moran, who covers Notre Dame for the Chicago Tribune.
''It's like, 2,000 yards (rushing) was a lock, or, the 2,000 means
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Colorado's Rashaan Salaam rushed for the first 2,000
season, he won the 1994 Heisman. When Iowa State's Troy Davis ran
for more than 2,000 the next year, he wasn't even invited to New
York as a Heisman finalist. When Davis did it again in '96, he made
it to the ceremony but was a distant second in the voting to
Florida's Danny Wuerffel.
</P>
<P>
   While Wuerffel would then lead Florida to the national
championship, he already had benefited from another factor in the
Heisman race: television. So has Dayne. ESPN's Lee Corso and ABC's
Terry Bowden for months have been promoting Dayne as the Heisman
choice. On Nov. 7, the day the Heisman race probably turned in
Dayne's favor, ESPN promoted the Wisconsin-Purdue game ''almost as
a Heisman showdown'' between Dayne and Purdue quarterback Drew
Brees, Moran said. ''And Tech-Virginia (later that day on ABC)
almost as an afterthought. Here you have (ESPN), who's probably the
most influential (Heisman) factor presenting their opinions. . . .
I remember thinking, 'Thomas Jones and Joe Hamilton are pretty good
players, and they're not getting anywhere near the attention the
other two guys are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, Dayne had rushed for 222 more yards and was the
No. 2 career rusher; Hamilton and Tech, meanwhile, were upset by
Jones and Virginia's furious comeback, 45-38. When Hamilton threw
for five touchdown passes to beat Clemson the next weekend,
however, he said of the Heisman, ''It ain't over.'' Then came last
Saturday in Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Hamilton was right on track 'til then,'' Mark
Blaudschun of the Boston Globe said. ''I convinced people to hold
off (voting) and wait. But now he's dead. You can't lose to Wake
Forest and expect to win the Heisman. He'll get first-team
All-American quarterback, and that'll be his consolation prize.
That's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no Heisman, however.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor is evident everywhere on the Tech campus:
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statue of John Heisman himself, megaphone on his
right hip, stands in Callaway Plaza beyond the north end of the
stadium; several weeks ago, some students painted a 14 on Heisman's
chest. Last week, Heisman wore a white No. 14 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For each home game, ten Tech student paint themselves yellow,don
yellow fright wigs and yellow tutus and paint blue letters on their
chests so they spell out J-O-E-H-E-I-S-M-A-N
</P>
<P>
   From the Rambling Wreck Club, the booster organization that
distributes ''Hamilton for Heisman'' buttons at home games.
</P>
<P>
   Late the night before the Oct. 9 homecoming game against North
Carolina, the good brothers of Theta Chi fraternity moved couches
out into the street in front of their abode, the better to, uh,
stop traffic while painting a large white rectangle across the
street. In gold letters, they painted: HAMILTON FOR HEISMAN. Tech
never has had a Heisman autumn like this one. There was the
preseason ''Hamilton for Heisman'' CD-ROM the sports information
office mailed to Heisman voters, followed by a computer mouse pad.
Hamilton has gone on to become Tech's all-time passing leader and
the first ACC player to amass 10,000 total yards while directing
the nation's most prolific offense.
</P>
<P>
   The SID office recently got two Heisman-related requests: An
elderly gentleman who said he was calling on behalf of Dick
Kazmaier, who won the 1951 Heisman as a Princeton tailback, for
information about Hamilton's academic credentials and off-the-field
charitable works; and sportswriter Jack Ebling of the Lansing State
Journal, state chairman of the Michigan Heisman voters, who
requested a tape of Tech's 41-35 loss at No. 1 FSU _ in which
Hamilton passed for 387 yards and four touchdowns and ran for a
fifth TD _ because ''four or five of us around here are considering
him as our No. 1 pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech head coach George O'Leary was an assistant at Syracuse when
diminutive Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie won the 1984
Heisman. Flutie, now starring with the Buffalo Bills was ''very
similar to Joe,'' O'Leary said. ``Joe's probably a little bit
niftier. Flutie's probably faster. Both have the same arm
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike Hamilton, Flutie was the late-season Heisman
frontrunner even before he launched the last-second Hail Mary pass
that beat Miami and clinched the Heisman. ''It's like anything
else,'' O'Leary said of the Heisman. ''When that award's given,
it's who's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's first lasting Heisman memory was 1987, when he was 10
and Notre Dame receiver/returner Tim Brown won the Heisman. ''He
did a lot of good things, exciting things,'' Hamilton recalled.
''He scored, he did everything to put his team in position to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was surprised when Salaam prevailed in '94 (''I didn't
think he'd win it''); loved Michigan's Desmond Howard when he
struck the Heisman pose in the end zone in '91; said about the '92
honoree, ''I really didn't think Gino Torretta was a Heisman Trophy
winner;'' and advised people aboard the Peyton Manning bandwagon in
'97, ''Don't count out Charles Woodson.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time? ''You never know what they're looking for in a
player, what they want,'' Hamilton said. ''They might be looking
for a Ron Dayne-type player, or a Drew Brees. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dayne has done great things. To his record, I say
congratulations. But the only I thing I say is, how many people
could do that, do what Dayne did? That's a big question. Maybe some
college athletes could go to Wisconsin and do what he did? I don't
know. But he's a great back.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also apparently at the head of this Heisman class.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Hamilton will join Dayne and the other
finalists in New York for the Heisman presentation. ''It's just an
award,'' said Hamilton, who has played down the Heisman all fall
but knows it's more than just an award. ''Sometimes, you dream
about being in their shoes. What would I do? How would I react?''

 &HT;    Relaxed Ross wins over players
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving Day 1998, Detroit Lions running back Barry
Sanders already had rushed for 1,192 yards in 11 games. Yet the
Lions were 4-7 and seemed to be in disarray under coach Bobby Ross.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lions host the Chicago Bears today in the Pontiac
Silverdome, Ross won't have Sanders, who abruptly retired before
training camp started in July. Without Sanders in the backfield,
the Lions are 6-4 and tied with Tampa Bay and Minnesota for first
place in the NFC Central, even thought they lost their past two
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we're still in it,'' said Ross, who guided
Georgia Tech to a share of the national championship in 1990. ``We
still have a chance. I'm not saying we dug ourselves a hole, but
now it's a competitive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Lions are competitive at all says a lot about Ross, who
spent five seasons with the San Diego Chargers after leaving Tech
and took them to Super Bowl XXIX in January 1995.

   Detroit limped to a 5-11 record last season, the worst finish in
Ross' seven seasons in the NFL. Ross seemed to have lost control of
his team. Bill Ford Jr., vice chairman of the team, wanted to hire
television commentator Matt Millen to run football operations, even
if it meant losing Ross. Millen later backed out.
</P>
<P>
   But so did Sanders, who was on the verge of breaking Walter
Payton's all-time rushing record. Sanders quit two days before
training camp because,he said, he thought the team was going
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things went on last year, and if you want to perceive it
a certain way, fine,'' Ross said. ``I spent the offseason taking a
good look at myself, but I also think that was true of everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's players were greeted by a friendlier and gentler Ross
this season. The former U.S. Army first lieutenant showed his
players that he was willing to bend. The team now provides
breakfast every day and gives each player his own hotel room for
road games. The little things have started adding up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time during a team meeting this year where he came
in wearing this awful-looking tie,'' Lions defensive tackle Luther
Ellis said. ``We kidded him about it, and he laughed right along. A
year ago, nobody would even try to joke about something like that,
because you weren't sure what his response would be. Would he blow
up or something?''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also is seeking more input from his players. Last season,
Sanders and other veterans reportedly were upset when Ross benched
quarterback Scott Mitchell after only two games. Ross replaced
Mitchell with rookie Charlie Batch, who went 3-9 in 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing and probably the biggest change is that he's
more willing to listen to us than he did last year,'' Ellis said.
``He's open to suggestions, and you have no idea what that does to
the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions have overcome a rash of injuries to remain in
contention this year. At least one-third of their starters have
missed one game or more. Running back Ron Rivers, who expected to
replace Sanders, broke his ankle against Carolina in the sixth game
and was lost for the season. Wide receiver Herman Moore, who
started the last three Pro Bowls, doesn't have a catch because of
injuries to both knees. Batch has missed the past two games and
parts of two others because of a bruised thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lions seem less predictable on offense. While Sanders
was often the first _ and sometimes only _ option on offense in
seasons past, several players have emerged in 1999. Wide receiver
Germane Crowell, of Virginia, has blossomed into a star in his
second season. In his last three games, Crowell has 21 catches for
427 yards. Johnnie Morton has 41 receptions for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' running ``was something that always came up and
probably this year was going to be a tremendous topic of discussion
each week,'' Ross said. ``We haven't had to deal with that.
Obviously, our running game isn't what it used to be. So we've gone
to more throwing, probably more than even I like to do. But it's
where we get our playmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprising start, Ross hasn't escaped criticism.
Against Arizona on Nov. 14, the Lions had just scored a touchdown
and trailed 23-19 late in the game. Instead of kicking an extra
point and hoping for a game-tying field goal later, Ross elected to
try a two-point conversion. It failed. With less than two minutes
left, Detroit faced fourth down deep in Cardinals territory. The
Lions had to go for a touchdown and missed.
</P>
<P>
   The loss seemed to stick with the Lions. They lost 26-17 at
Green Bay last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ever going to look back on it,'' Ross said. ``I'm
going to look ahead. The decision wasn't spontaneous. It was
thought out _ right or wrong. This team needs to take the risks. A
part of why we are where we are is because we have taken some
risks.''

<P>
   The city of Taylor, Texas, started its holiday lighting display
five years ago. More than 130,000 lights later, downtown Taylor is
ablaze beginning on Thanksgiving weekend with brightly lighted
Christmas trees, characters from nursery rhymes, a wagon train,
teepees, a 20-foot sailing ship, a Santa Claus with his sleigh and
eight reindeer, the Taj Mahal and a rocket ship that commemorates
John Glenn's return to space.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small project: Shanta Kuhl, executive vice president
of the local Chamber of Commerce, said 300 volunteers had spent
four weeks putting up lights in Taylor, a city of 14,700 residents
northeast of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just love it,'' Ms. Kuhl said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, holiday lights are taken for granted as almost every
city in America puts up some type of display. And more than 80
million households in the United States use them to decorate each
year, according to the Minami International Corp., one of the
largest manufacturers of holiday lights.
</P>
<P>
   Today's holiday lights may be a far cry from the traditional
candles that were once used to celebrate the winter solstice or, in
the Christian faith, to represent Jesus as the light of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in one sense, the lights still have a similar purpose. They
are intended to lighten the mood, raise the spirits. Today, it is
the holiday spirit. Years ago, it was the spirits of Northern
Europeans during the long dark winters.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded use of lights on a Christmas tree was in
1658, when candles were used in southern Germany, according to
``Christmas Ornaments, Lights and Decorations: A Collector's
Identification and Value Guide,'' by George Johnson (Collector
Books, 1987). The candles were attached to trees by melting them
directly onto the branches, attaching them with pins or clipping
them on with special holders.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1850s, gas tubes were added to real trees in provide
lighting. In 1878, a British company unsuccessfully marketed an
iron Christmas tree that contained channels for gas, which could be
lighted through tiny holes in the branches.
</P>
<P>
   The first electric Christmas lights were developed in 1882,
shortly after the advent of commercial electricity. Each light had
to be individually wired, however, which made the tree very
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, the cost of electric lights had dropped, and
electricity was readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, fashions in holiday lights have come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the century, lights of glass or plastic
with figures of animals, fruits, Santas and even Uncle Sam were
often used to decorate Christmas trees. In the 1950s, many used
bubble lights, which have colored liquid and a special chemical
that sends bubbles up the glass when the light heats up. Rotating
color wheels, twinkling lights and miniature lights followed.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Ritzer Ross, who covers trends in Christmas lights for
Selling Christmas Decorations magazine in Randolph, N.J., said
clear or white lights were still popular for indoor lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers say they are selling more colored lights than in the
past. And bubble lights are making something of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday lighting has also seen a large swing toward outdoor
lighting. ``People are getting increasingly competitive about
outdoing their neighbors with outdoor decorating,'' Ms. Ritzer Ross
said. ``People are putting more lights outdoors _ trees, bushes,
hanging on eaves, wherever they can put them.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, ``icicles are still very big,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While retailers might think that outdoor lighting fanatics are
just trying to outdo their neighbors, they may have it wrong. For
many enthusiasts, decorations are about Christmas cheer, no matter
how much wattage is required.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Jezioro, of Manassas, Va., decorates his house with about
40,000 lights. Jezioro, who takes 10 days off work around
Thanksgiving to set up his display, explained: ``I've been doing
this for about eight years. It's kind of a childhood fantasy to
have a house with lights on it _ my parents would take us to see
the houses with lights, and we never had the opportunity to
decorate our house because we always rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Jezioro said the 400 strands of lights (which his wife, Barbara,
tests before he hangs them) added about $350 to his electricity
bill in December. He has also revamped his house's wiring. ``All
told with the electronics, I have about five or six thousand
dollars invested,'' he said. When a display has at least 20,000
lights, it can be considered ``very serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lights are up at the Jezioros' house, people start
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love seeing the families in their cars with the kids and the
blankets in the back seat,'' Jezioro said. ``It makes it all
worthwhile.''

 &HT;    European underdogs have bite
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A club's ticket to the European Champions League depends on its
league finish from the previous season. But three clubs mired in
the lower half of their respective domestic leagues so far are
finding continental play to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina, in 10th place in Italy's Serie A, was outplayed by
Manchester United but won 2-0 on Tuesday, as the second round of
group play began.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, a preseason favorite in the Spanish Primera Division,
is in 10th place, but it thrashed Girodins de Bordeaux 3-0. Another
early flop, Hertha Berlin, in 14th place in the Bundesliga, forged
a 1-1 draw with Barcelona in foggy conditions in the German
capital. For Manchester United, the defending champions, the phrase
``back pass'' will bring a chill down the spines of the normally
reliable Roy Keane and Henning Berg, whose dreadful defending
mistakes led to both Fiorentina goals. In the first case, Gabriel
Batistuta pounced on Keane's effort and slammed home an 18th-minute
goal. In the second half, he intercepted a weak offering from Berg,
then passed over to Adel Balbo, who wasted no time putting home the
second score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admire the finish _ that is what the man is good
at,'' United manager Alex Ferguson, said, referring to Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia dispatched the French champions in the final 30
minutes, getting all three goals in that time from Francisco
Farrios, Adrian Ilie and Kily Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   And in Berlin, neither team scored in the first half before the
fog rolled in, prompting play to continue with an orange ball.
Barcelona manager Louis van Gaal angrily argued that the game
should have been suspended, while a German television announcer had
to rely on another set of eyes: ``Somebody has just hit the post.
At least that's what I've been told.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Ronaldo out two months
</P>
<P>
   Inter Milan striker Ronaldo will be out at least until February
after suffering another injury to his right knee. Ronaldo, 23, tore
tendons when his cleats got stuck in a muddy patch in Inter's 6-0
rout of Lecce on Sunday. . . . Lazio lost its first Serie A match
in 17 games and had its overall unbeaten string snapped at 23 in a
4-1 drubbing by city rivals AS Roma. Some fans took the result
rather hard. Several Lazio supporters scaled a fence during the
club's training session on Monday and hurled abuse at players,
delaying practice for 20 minutes. Two goals apiece by Marco
Delvecchio and Vincenzo Montella lifted AS Roma into third place,
two points behind Lazio and Juventus.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: New coach, same result
</P>
<P>
   A 77th-minute goal from Jose Antonio Pikabea spoiled the debut
of Real Madrid manager Vicente del Bosque as struggling Real
Sociedad pulled out a 1-1 draw on Saturday. Madrid, which fired
John Toshack last week, went ahead in the 66th minute on a goal by
Savio but had to settle for a draw for the fourth time in its last
six outings. Del Bosque, Real's fourth manager in the past seven
years, also served in a caretaking role in 1993 and 1996. . . .
Deportivo La Coruna took the lead in the Primera Division with a
5-2 win over Sevilla, as Pauleta scored a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   England: TV stakes get higher
</P>
<P>
   Published reports in London claim that British Telecom is
prepared to bid $2.1 billion to acquire Premier League television
rights starting in 2001, more than double what British Sky
Broadcasting Corp. reportedly is proposing to extend its current
deal. Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates is spearheading a
consortium that might offer a $1.6 billion price tag. . . . BSkyB
was told by the Premier League this week that it would have to sell
off a fraction of its interest in Manchester United. Rupert
Murdoch's U.K. satellite concern holds an 11 percent stake in the
defending champions, and would have to get under 10 percent.
Earlier this season, BSkyB bought a 9.9 percent share in Leeds
United.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Matthaus injured
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich trounced Freiburg 6-1 Saturday for its fifth
consecutive win in the Bundesliga but lost defender Lothar Matthaus
for at least a week with a strained leg muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Torneo playoffs
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the Torneo Invierno playoffs begin tonight
when Pachuca and Morelia meet to fill the eighth and last
postseason slot. Sunday's second leg will be televised (1 p.m.,
Telemundo), with the quarterfinals getting under way next week.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil: Cruzeiro ousted
</P>
<P>
   Playoff upsets continued in the national championship postseason
Sunday, when Atletico Mineiro got two goals from Guilherme to
eliminate favored Cruzeiro 3-2. Mineiro, the last team to qualify
for the eight-team playoffs, is the first to reach the semifinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You wouldn't expect to find a better spokesman for the Philips
Nino than Blake Patterson. If you visit the Philips Electronics Web
site, you see a prominent link to a site built by Patterson, a
27-year-old Web designer from Alexandria, Va. Philips points to
Patterson as a dedicated user of the Nino, the company's palm-size
computer. Predictably, Patterson's site is a veritable shrine to
the Nino.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that Patterson has not used a Nino, or, for
that matter, any device running Windows CE, the simplified version
of Microsoft's Windows operating system, for more than six months.
Last summer, he soured on CE altogether and after a brief but happy
fling with a Palm organizer, became a fervent early convert to the
new Visor from Handspring, a startup that has licensed the Palm
operating system. Patterson, who was once paid by Philips to write
about the Nino, has not touched his Nino fan page since late last
year and it now hangs, petrified, in cyberspace
(nino.philips.com/community).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Patterson is busy building a new Web site that is
devoted to miscellaneous handheld gadgets. ``I don't think I'll
have much positive to say about CE, if I address it at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Philips wasn't far behind Patterson. Late last
summer, the company decided to drop the Nino from its product line,
citing disappointing market growth. The company is still selling
the Ninos in stock, said Philips spokesman Marty Gordon, , which is
why the Nino Web page is still up.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft first announced Windows CE three years ago (CE
does not stand for anything), hardware manufacturers like Philips
were quick to start producing handheld devices to compete against
the popular Palm organizer, which has its own operating system,
called the Palm OS. Industry analysts' projections were so rosy
they implied that Palm Computing should run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   But a very different picture has emerged since then. According
to NPD Intelect Market Tracking, a research firm in Port
Washington, N.Y., personal digital assistants running CE account
for just 15 percent of the PDAs sold; 75 percent run the Palm OS.
``It's not growing at all,'' said Nazia Khaliq, an account manager
at NPD Intelect.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may be the software giant, but when it comes to
Windows CE, it has certainly not stifled competition or gained
control of the market. In fact, in the portion of the CE market
that consists of handheld organizers, the giant is stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates was at the
Comdex trade show, showing off a small new $200 CE-based Internet
access device called the MSN Web Companion, another corner of the
show was humming with the news that Sony and Palm Computing had
signed a deal to work on a new generation of handheld devices using
the Palm OS. Soon afterward, Everex confirmed rumors that it would
discontinue its CE devices because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's sales, in the meantime, continue to grow, and, with the
exception of some serious shipping glitches, Handspring is off to a
promising start with its relatively inexpensive Visor.
</P>
<P>
   But as Microsoft is quick to point out, Windows CE is not just
for organizers. It is making its way into a variety of products,
like digital set-top boxes, game consoles, cell phones, Internet
appliances, cars and even automated gasoline pumps. If such
products are taken into account, said Rogers Weed, director of
Windows CE marketing at Microsoft, sales of CE licenses to various
manufacturers are up more than 50 percent for the year, compared
with sales at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   But for pocket-size and larger handhelds, something has not
clicked for Windows CE. What is the problem? The answers, from both
analysts and consumers like Patterson, vary widely, but include
explanations like these: The price is too high. Microsoft misjudged
Palm's momentum. Compared with the relatively simple Palm OS, the
CE interface is too difficult to use. The devices are too bulky.
The quality is poor. The feature-laden devices promise too much and
deliver too little.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rhinelander, an analyst at Forrester Research, boiled it
down to this: CE is too rudimentary to act as a suitable substitute
for a real computer and too complicated to run on a PDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Microsoft tried to do was take the entire PC experience
and cram it down into a tiny little screen,'' Rhinelander said.
``Their theory was that people knew and understood Windows and
there would be value in retaining the look and feel, and that was
absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shipley, publisher of DemoLetter, an industry newsletter,
agreed: ``I don't think you want a Windows computing experience in
a palm-size device. You want to look up addresses. You don't want a
Start button.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, related criticism is that both the palm-size devices
and the slightly larger handhelds, which usually come with a small
keyboard, are too packed with capabilities _ that the novelty of
downloading video clips and watching them on a tiny screen wears
off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that consumers have given up trying to like CE
devices. Michael Anderson, an engineer in Marlborough, Mass., who
confesses to a weakness for gadgets, has been buying CE devices
since they first came on the market, searching for the perfect one.
With each new device, his hopes rise, then quickly fall again.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's experience with CE devices over the years has been a
bit like being enticed by a travel brochure into buying a vacation
in paradise, only to arrive and find the hotel bad and the food
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Anderson bought a Hewlett-Packard Jornada 680,
one of the company's latest offerings in the CE line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought the 680 was going to be it,'' Anderson said.
``From the spec sheet, it should be the most amazing thing ever.''
The specifications sheet lists an internal 56,000 bit-per-second
modem, 16 megabytes of internal memory, Internet e-mail support, a
6.5-inch color screen, a keyboard large enough to type on, built-in
voice recording and a 133-megahertz processor (compared with a
16-megahertz chip on the Palm).
</P>
<P>
   But after using the Jornada for a few days, Anderson again grew
frustrated. In spite of the faster processor on the Jornada, he
said, his more efficient Palm V was faster. ``It's a great example
of where something should be the most amazing thing ever, but it's
still not all that fast and the apps are underpowered.''
</P>
<P>
   The CE apps, or applications, Anderson is referring to are
pint-size versions of Windows-based programs like Excel, Word and
PowerPoint. Not only do they fall short of doing all that a
full-blown Windows program can do, but the small screen renders
many of their features useless, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research, said, ``Once
you've got a screen that's small enough that you can't really run
Windows, you ask yourself, what is this for?''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels that way. Many people swear by their
Casiopeias, their Hewlett-Packard Jornadas and their Compaq Aeros.
Aaron Driver, a supervisor for the California Transportation
Department in San Francisco, recently bought a Nino, which he uses
to keep track of daily appointments and contacts and for e-mail
while on the go. Driver said he and a friend who uses a Palm both
agreed that the Nino was easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rado, president of Casio in Dover, N.J., said customer
demand for the newest Casiopeias far outstripped supply. The
company has nearly 10 percent of the market for handhelds, he said.
One of the reasons the Casiopeia is so popular, he said, is its
crisp color screen. ``A lot of people are downloading video and
film clips,'' Rado said. He agreed that people's enthusiasm for
doing so might wear off but said their enthusiasm for the screen
would not. ``People like the vibrant display,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weed, at Microsoft, acknowledged that sales of CE pocket-size
devices had been less than robust. But he pointed out that sales
numbers like those gathered by NPD Intelect took into account only
retail sales. Many more CE devices are sold directly to businesses,
some for specialized applications.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true for Dr. Grant Peoples, a family doctor in
Aurora, Colo., whose office recently bought a half-dozen Journada
680s. Peoples said he was happy with the device but used it for
just one thing: entering diagnoses and ordering prescriptions. He
has no plans to use it for scheduling, let alone for getting access
to e-mail or the Internet, creating spreadsheets or doing any of
the other things possible with the device.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has no intention of conceding any of the market for
pocket-size computers and larger handhelds. ``If you look at the
people in the game in a serious way, they're all continuing to
innovate,'' Weed said. Compaq, Casio and Hewlett-Packard have all
made smaller, easier-to-use devices with better color displays,
digital music support and faster processors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've seen the end of it by any measure,'' said
Ms. Shipley, of DemoLetter. But if manufacturers like Philips are
going to take a second look at CE, she said, ``I do think it has to
be a much different implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Hwang, an analyst at International Data Corp., agreed. ``I
don't think Microsoft would give up the handheld space unless they
just really can't do it,'' she said. ``Microsoft always comes back.
Their challenge is the next generation of CE.''
</P>
<P>
   The development of that next generation, Weed said, is already
well under way at Microsoft. Sometime next year, he said, an
updated version of CE will start showing up in new handheld
products. Weed refused to elaborate because, he said, he does not
want to discourage people from buying products currently on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Rado, of Casio, said his company had no intention of abandoning
CE. On the contrary, Rado said, Casio is busy developing a new
device based on Rapier, Microsoft's code name for the updated
version of the CE operating system. ``When Rapier is ready to go,
we'll have our models available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, the disillusioned No. 1 Nino fan, may have defected
permanently. But the persistent promise of a smaller, slicker,
faster, easier, lighter CE device helps explain why people like
Anderson keep coming back for more.

<P>
   If Dr. Frankenstein's monster had published a best seller, who
would have gotten the rights to that intellectual property?
</P>
<P>
   His inventor up in the castle, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Tough luck for the monster, but these are still early days for
intellectual property rights for thinking machines. No one has
seriously proposed that a computer should receive a share of the
profits from an invention _ at least not yet. But other problems
related to the ownership of items invented by computers are already
being debated in preparation for the time, probably in about 10
years, when such inventions will be commonplace, said David E.
Goldberg, an engineer and a professor at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are already making inroads in the area of intellectual
property as they design antennas, gas turbines and integrated
circuits. Much of the work in this field of automatic discovery is
preliminary and a lot of it is proprietary and therefore secret,
but what can be seen provides tantalizing glimpses of a future in
which computers work day and night _ no breaks for lunch _ to come
up with original solutions with very little help from their
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Herndon, Va., for instance, a program by Derek S. Linden,
chief technical officer for Linden Innovation Research,
automatically designed a satellite communications antenna that was
original enough to be patented by Linden. Programs developed at
Engineous Software, in Morrisville, N.C., and sold to an aircraft
manufacturer came up with improvements to a jet engine so marked
that the aircraft company filed two patents on them.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are still at the stage where they design components
like filters, circuits and engines _ the whole plane is yet to come
_ but their ability to come up with inventions automatically raises
a host of philosophical and legal issues that will intensify, some
people familiar with the field say, as computers grow more powerful
and their discoveries more extensive.
</P>
<P>
   It may be later that you think. ``We think of evolution as slow,
as it took about 3.5 million years for natural systems to evolve,''
Goldberg said. ``Powerful computers will vastly accelerate the
evolution of machine invention and the solving of hard problems.
People thought that inventions were beyond the range of computers,
but that's not so.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is an expert in genetic algorithms, math-based
approaches that solve problems by mimicking the principles of
natural biological selection. Such programs examine successive
generations of solutions to problems and choose the best ones,
whether the problem is scheduling workers in a factory or building
an airplane wing.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs offer the promise of one day solving not only the
problems at hand, but also future ones, long after the program has
been sold and is out in the world with different owners. The issue
of adjudicating these inexhaustible intellectual resources and the
original solutions that result will probably prove quite
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The first result will be a swamped patent office, predicted
Jordan B. Pollack, a professor at Brandeis University who works in
evolutionary robotics and teaches a course in intellectual
property. A patent is denied when an invention is obvious to a
person of ordinary skill in the art, Pollack explained, but
applying that standard may become more complicated as more ideas
come from computers. ``The whole idea of what's new and nonobvious
will have to change,'' he said. ``Our definition of `obvious' will
need to be expanded,'' he added, to account for things that would
be obvious to a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's obvious to a powerful computer is going to be a lot
different from what's obvious to us,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Patent infringement will also be an issue as computers grow
smarter, Pollack said. ``These machines are going to go out on the
factory floor, solving new problems for owner after owner,'' he
predicted. ``They will be tripping over everyone else's patents all
day long.''
</P>
<P>
   The patent system itself, conceived to reward human innovation
with a limited monopoly, will eventually have to be modified,
Pollack said. ``We don't yet realize that machines are engaged in
invention _ but this is already happening in many areas,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   John Koza, president of Genetic Programming in Los Altos,
Calif., is an expert in evolutionary computing. ``The real trick in
these evolutionary inventions lies in recognizing them,'' he said.
``It's actually easier to evolve circuits than to identify a big
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Koza and his colleagues have been creating electrical circuits
using evolutionary computing. ``We recognize when these circuits
infringe upon existing patented circuits because we know the
existing circuits as textbook inventions,'' he said. ``But in our
hundreds of runs, we've probably already invented many other
circuits but haven't yet spotted them.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen to humans as computers become increasingly
skillful at automatic invention? Goldberg predicted that people
would quickly adapt.
</P>
<P>
   He drew an analogy to the Industrial Revolution, when steam
engines removed some of the heavy lifting of industrial work.
``Computers will give us the same kind of leverage in the
intellectual range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many inventions in the future will routinely be handled by
computers. ``No one would think of building a skyscraper with
thousands of workers,'' Goldberg said. ``Similarly, no one will
think about solving a problem without getting the magnitude of
intellectual leverage that is similar to the mechanical leverage of
the steam engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is not worried about who will be in charge _ people
will be. ``This development doesn't mean we'll be supplanted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of automatic invention, people will still be
involved in creative acts and worthy of their royalties, but their
role is going to shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll become managers, directing the machines toward
interesting problems and opportunities,'' Goldberg said. ``The
creative act will be in mentioning the right problems.''

   AIRCRASH-PILOT (Cairo) _ Back in Kafr al-Dabusi, a farming
community set against the lush fields and irrigation canals of the
Nile delta, the villagers still remember the dashing young airman,
Gamil al-Batouti, who would circle in his small plane, scaring the
pigeons from their roosts and sending the women trilling in wonder.
Today, all of Egypt knows about Batouti, but it is an awful
prominence he has suddenly gained, one that has nothing to do with
his life of accomplishment and modest hometown stardom. American
investigators believe Batouti may have deliberately caused the
crash of EgyptAir Flight 990. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   OPERATION-SMILE-II (Beijing) _ Early last August, an
impoverished farmer brought his young son to the Plastic Surgery
Hospital in Beijing to take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity: For one week, plastic surgeons from the American
charity Operation Smile were operating for free on poor Chinese
children with cleft lips and palates, the congenital condition that
afflicted his boy. But that elation quickly turned to anguish when
his son returned from surgery and he discovered that the wrong
operation had been performed. A Special Report, the second of two
parts, by Elisabeth Rosenthal and Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-TREASON (Jerusalem) _ A newspaper's publication of
partial transcripts from the treason trial of Mordechai Vanunu,
arrested in 1986 for alleged disclosures of Israel's nuclear

ambiguity. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   ASSISI-BASILICA (Assisi, Italy) _ When a powerful earthquake
crushed the vaulted ceiling of the basilica of St. Francis of
Assisi two years ago, the damage seemed irreparable. Instead, on
Sunday, the early Renaissance masterpiece will be entirely
re-opened to the public.But another expected miracle _ a free
market experiment in disaster relief that was supposed to rehouse
thousands of victims within two years _ has not materialized. By

not come as a surprise that Mrs. Clinton and Gore should be

NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE AN INTERNATIONALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When George W. Bush plunged headlong into the
simmering debate over America's role in the world as a foe of
isolationism and protectionism, he probably guaranteed that the
next president of the United States will be an internationalist who
advocates free trade.
</P>
<P>
   That is true because the man who takes the presidential oath of
office on Jan. 20, 2001, will very likely be one of four
candidates: Bush or John McCain, who are seeking the Republican
presidential nomination; Al Gore or Bill Bradley, the Democratic
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   All four are allied with the twin pillars of foreign policy that
have guided America since World War II: internationalism and free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Once Patrick Buchanan severed his ties with the Republican Party
and announced plans to seek the presidential nomination of the
Reform Party, the GOP lost its most powerful and bombastic public
advocate of isolationism and protectionism, the discredited
principles that once dominated the party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was critical of President Clinton's handling of
certain aspects of foreign policy, including his dealings with
Russia and China, he said little in his Nov. 19 speech at the
Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., that many Democrats
would find disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a bow to bipartisanship, Bush contended that fears
raised by those who favor isolationism and protectionism have no
place ``in the party of Reagan or the party of Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Russian brutality in Chechnya, Bush said that international
lending institutions should suspend aid to Moscow if it continues
``killing women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Of China, he said that nation should be seen ``as a competitor
not a strategic partner.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that Clinton
favors and that was defeated recently in the Republican-controlled
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But since Bush is only a candidate for president and not yet the
holder of that exalted office, his views on specific relationships
and issues can change drastically in the months and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's criticism of Clinton's handling of foreign
affairs was made in the same week that Clinton and other leaders at
a 54-nation summit in Turkey chastised Russia for its conduct in
Chechnya. At the same time, the United States and China reached an
agreement that will pave the way for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   It was anticipated that Bush would find fault with Clinton's
conduct of foreign policy. But the most important aspect of Bush's
speech was his unequivocal alignment with internationalism and free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The views he expressed were very much like those of his father,
who as president put together a remarkable coalition of countries
to counter Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   If the Texas governor's position could be summed up in a single
sentence, it was contained in his own words: ``America must be
involved in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans would agree with that declaration, because
there still is a pocket of steadfast isolationism in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the 20th century, Republican
internationalists have had to battle Republican isolationists. At
the end of World War I, Woodrow Wilson ran headlong into the
opposition of Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge _ the Republican
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee _ when the
president tried unsuccessfully to win Senate approval of the Treaty
of Versailles and American participation in the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, after World War II had begun in Europe,
Republicans, with the support of some Democrats, clung to
isolationism. But at the 1940 GOP national convention, a miracle
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   When they gathered in Philadelphia to nominate a presidential
candidate, their chief contenders were isolationists, Sen. Robert
A. Taft of Ohio, District Attorney (and later governor) Thomas E.
Dewey of New York, and Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan. But as
delegates roamed through hotel lobbies in silly hats, Adolf
Hitler's conquest of continental Europe became complete with the
fall of France.
</P>
<P>
   Britain then stood alone against Nazi aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Republicans began to pay attention to a colorful
Hoosier lawyer who had been a Democrat and as head of the
Commonwealth and Southern utility company had defeated the
Roosevelt administration's Tennessee Valley Authority in a key
court case.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Wendell Willkie and he won the nomination but lost
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   An internationalist who favored aid to the victims of German
aggression, he later carried a message from Franklin Roosevelt to
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and wrote a popular book
about his wartime travels called ``One World.''
</P>
<P>
   The next big battle within the GOP over foreign policy occurred
in 1952, when Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1964, Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who was skeptical
of foreign commitments, won the GOP nomination over Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller of New York and was badly defeated in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have had their own internecine battles over
protectionism and the war in Vietnam, but, for the most part,
internationalists have dominated the party since the days of
Woodrow Wilson.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hailed as the greatest communicator since Ronald
Reagan, President Bill Clinton took to the new media earlier this
month to convey his message, becoming the first U.S. president to
conduct an Internet chat live online.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, formerly a self-proclaimed computer illiterate, has
clearly become aware that next year's election will be the first in
which the Internet is a perceptible force.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates have their own campaign Web sites; the
publishing millionaire, Steve Forbes, even claimed to have made
history by announcing his presidential bid online.
</P>
<P>
   And as well as getting a candidate's message out, the Web sites
are bringing in both volunteers and cash. Former Senator Bill
Bradley has just passed the $1 million mark in money raised online,
while Senator John McCain has reached $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With hi-tech tools proving so effective for the candidates,
there is a growing belief in the computer world that it is only a
matter of time before voters demand a piece of the action. If they
can bank, shop and make political donations online, why can they
not also vote online?
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. enters its election year, this question is being
asked with new urgency. A recent survey by the computer company
Dell showed that almost 80 percent of regular Internet users wanted
to be able to vote online.
</P>
<P>
   Voting came second only to renewing their driving licenses as
the function they would most like to perform on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this reflects the inconvenience of voting in the U.S.,
with polling stations that often can be reached only by car and
queues to use clumsy voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   Long working hours and commutes are also blamed, along with
general political apathy, for a decline in voting that is little
short of catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the turnout for Congressional elections was
only 36 percent nationwide, meaning that 120 million potential
votes were not cast. In the 1996 presidential election, the turnout
was under 50 percent, compared with 63 percent in 1960. The most
reluctant voters are the 18- to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many groups trying to reverse the decline, several
advocate the introduction of Internet voting, and a number of
states, including Florida, Louisiana, Arizona and California, are
considering limited trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, responsible for tens of thousands of troops
abroad, has initiated a pilot project to test online voting as a
replacement for postal votes. Volunteers are being recruited from
five states.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists, of whom Professor Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia, is one, believes that Internet
voting is simply democracy by other means. It has the potential, he
says, ``to expand our traditional definition and understanding of
the American town square.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Arizona has broached limited Internet voting in its
presidential primary next spring, there is no real prospect that it
will be an option when Americans go to vote for a new president
next November.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it likely that voters will be able to cast their ballot
from their home desktop any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   An unspoken assumption is that there would be an interim stage
during which voters would find a computer in place of the familiar
machine inside the voting booth. This could speed up the procedure
for the computer literate, but could also produce bottlenecks if
even a few were flummoxed by the process.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that electronic voting would favor those with
computers _ that is, the wealthier and better educated. However,
not everyone accepts that the ``digital divide'' would keep the
computer have-nots from voting: computer ownership is more diffuse
than often believed.
</P>
<P>
   Online voting opens the possibility of a 24-hour voting day.
Computer terminals in libraries and cybercafes could be brought
into service for those without their own machines, and internet
voting might even appeal to those elusive 18- to 24- year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   That presupposes, of course, that it is the hassle of voting
that keeps them at home, rather than the nature of politics or the
calibre of the candidates. &QL;

Bradley has just passed the $1 million mark in money raised online,
while Senator John McCain has reached $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With hi-tech tools proving so effective for the candidates,
there is a growing belief in the computer world that it is only a
matter of time before voters demand a piece of the action. If they
can bank, shop and make political donations online, why can they
not also vote online?
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. enters its election year, this question is being
asked with new urgency. A recent survey by the computer company
Dell showed that almost 80 percent of regular Internet users wanted
to be able to vote online.
</P>
<P>
   Voting came second only to renewing their driving licenses as
the function they would most like to perform on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this reflects the inconvenience of voting in the U.S.,
with polling stations that often can be reached only by car and
queues to use clumsy voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   Long working hours and commutes are also blamed, along with
general political apathy, for a decline in voting that is little
short of catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the turnout for Congressional elections was
only 36 percent nationwide, meaning that 120 million potential
votes were not cast. In the 1996 presidential election, the turnout
was under 50 percent, compared with 63 percent in 1960. The most
reluctant voters are the 18- to 24-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many groups trying to reverse the decline, several
advocate the introduction of Internet voting, and a number of
states, including Florida, Louisiana, Arizona and California, are
considering limited trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, responsible for tens of thousands of troops
abroad, has initiated a pilot project to test online voting as a
replacement for postal votes. Volunteers are being recruited from
five states.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists, of whom Professor Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia, is one, believes that Internet
voting is simply democracy by other means. It has the potential, he
says, ``to expand our traditional definition and understanding of
the American town square.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Arizona has broached limited Internet voting in its
presidential primary next spring, there is no real prospect that it
will be an option when Americans go to vote for a new president
next November.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it likely that voters will be able to cast their ballot
from their home desktop any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   An unspoken assumption is that there would be an interim stage
during which voters would find a computer in place of the familiar
machine inside the voting booth. This could speed up the procedure
for the computer literate, but could also produce bottlenecks if
even a few were flummoxed by the process.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that electronic voting would favor those with
computers _ that is, the wealthier and better educated. However,
not everyone accepts that the ``digital divide'' would keep the
computer have-nots from voting: computer ownership is more diffuse
than often believed.
</P>
<P>
   Online voting opens the possibility of a 24-hour voting day.
Computer terminals in libraries and cybercafes could be brought
into service for those without their own machines, and internet
voting might even appeal to those elusive 18- to 24- year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   That presupposes, of course, that it is the hassle of voting
that keeps them at home, rather than the nature of politics or the
calibre of the candidates. &QL;

EDITOR EXPLORES UNINTENDED, AND NEGATIVE, SIDE OF TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen L. Talbott, a former software programmer and technical
writer, has always been wary of computers and their effect on the
human psyche. Even as he made a living editing books on computer
programming, he wondered aloud whether the machines were making
people's lives worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   But when colleagues and outsiders would needle him about his own
choices _ particularly the fact that he used a word processor to
write _ he would shake his head in resignation. It seemed almost
physically impossible, he said, to return to the old days of
molding thoughts using pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really nervous about it,'' Talbott said. ``I asked
myself, `Will I be able to write on a pad?'''
</P>
<P>
   Today Talbott, 53, has transformed that feeling of inertia, of
not being able to shake off the grip of technology, into the focal
point of his life's work. He is the editor of a small but
influential e-mail newsletter called NetFuture, which is an effort
to open people's minds to what he sees as the unintended, and
usually negative, impact of technology on society. His 4,500
subscribers include people involved with the Internet, nationally
recognized computer scientists and other people who are typically
champions of technology, not skeptical about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a largely undiscovered national treasure,'' wrote Peter
J. Denning, a computer science professor at George Mason University
in Virginia, in an e-mail message about the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Articles in NetFuture, which usually comes out every few weeks
and is often forwarded to other e-mail lists, go beyond immediate
concerns of privacy and censorship. They look instead at the ripple
effects of technology, like how people's lives have changed as
tasks are automated and how communities have fared since the dawn
of the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Talbott embarked on publishing his newsletter, in
1995, he continued to depend on technology for his writing. And he
hated it. Working on a computer, he said, caused eyestrain, neck
aches and the feeling that his brain was ``turning to mush.'' A
year before he started NetFuture, he and his family had moved to
rural upstate New York, near the tiny town of Harlemville, where
they bought a house with a wraparound porch, nestled in a wooded
hillside. Yet he was withdrawing from those surroundings whenever
sat down to write.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, he resolved to make a drastic change. He
would sit in front of his computer for no more than 50 percent of
his workday. He would try writing without a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, in his modest office a mile down the road from
his home, Talbott opened a file cabinet to retrieve some of the
fruits of that decision. He drew out four sheets of yellow note
paper. They showed the slight slant of his handwritten sentences,
cascading down the page on every other line, in pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not write any other way now,'' he said. Having the
simplicity of a notepad and a pencil enables him to do his writing
while sitting anywhere in his house, he said, usually in front of
huge picture windows that overlook the foothills of the Berkshire
Mountains. Every so often, perhaps if a red-tailed hawk swoops by,
he puts down his pencil and grabs his binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm  &UR; in &LR;  the writing more, birds notwithstanding,'' he said,
smiling. ``It's been a real pleasure to discover my own error.''
</P>
<P>
   That discovery is one of many that appears to have honed
Talbott's philosophy regarding technology. He sums it up with these
words: ``The computer is our hope if we can accept it as our enemy.
As our friend, it will destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, a slim balding man with white hair and a trim beard,
has the air of a philosopher when he talks. His voice has a natural
hoarseness; his deep-set gray eyes are wide and clear. Talk of
turning computers into enemies may sound extreme to some people.
But to Talbott, his statement is a riddle he delights in
unwrapping.
</P>
<P>
   Only when people consider the computer their enemy, he
explained, do they pull away from it. That act of pulling away can
bring a feeling of freedom, he said, and a new appreciation of the
personal, the creative, the natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer gives us the opportunity to assert ourselves
against it,'' Talbott said. ``That is a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott first touched a computer in 1980. Before then, he had
tried to make a living as an organic farmer and as the founder of a
scientific magazine called Pensee, which focused on theories of how
natural catastrophic events have played a role in Earth's history.
But the magazine folded within three years and farming failed to
pay the bills. So Talbott taught himself how to program computers
and got a technical-writing job at Tektronix, a computer company in
Portland, Ore., where his brother-in-law worked.
</P>
<P>
   That job led Talbott to other computer work, and he was hired in
1991 by Tim O'Reilly, the founder of a publishing and consulting
company that soon became highly regarded among academics and
software engineers for its no-nonsense approach to technology. In
1992, O'Reilly published one of the most influential books about
the early Internet, ``The Whole Internet User's Guide and
Catalog,'' which described how to find resources on the Internet.

<P>
   Where would you choose to spend an exotic vacation? Sunbathing
on a tropical beach with endless white sands fringed with palm
trees? Or maybe you'd appreciate something a little more cultural,
a mountain trek and a tour of ancient ruins and remote villages?
That's the sort of choice we're used to making.
</P>
<P>
   But what if that paradise beach happens to be just miles from an
entrenched civil war? Or an exotic island's business interests are
controlled by a military regime?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most unpalatable regimes in the world are to be
found in countries desperate to attract tourists, and they are
keener than ever to persuade us that they have some of the most
desirable vacation destinations available.
</P>
<P>
   Take Burma, for example. Next month it will be promoting itself
as an ideal place for an exotic break when it takes a stand at the
World Travel Market in London's Earls Court. There will be no
mention of its record of oppressing human rights and its lack of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Burma is becoming adept at putting a gloss on its image:
when it freed human-rights activist Rachel Goldwyn earlier this
month, after she had served less than two months of a seven-year
sentence for singing a pro-democracy protest song, the British
woman was treated as a ``guest'' of the military, heading ``up
country'' for a couple of days sightseeing on an approved tour
before flying home.
</P>
<P>
   Burma will be in good company at the World Travel Market. There
will also be displays by Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sixth leading international tourist destination, China
will be awarded the 1999 World Tourism Award in recognition of the
``outstanding impact of travel and tourism in generating employment
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter if we vacation in such countries? Tourism
Concern, which campaigns for responsible tourism, says it does.
According to its director, Patricia Barnett, visiting such a
country condones its regime, while a boycott would make an
oppressive government realize that not everyone in the West is
willing to turn a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to consider why you're going to Bali,'' she
says, ``and to think incredibly hard about why you feel the need to
have a holiday in a country deeply embedded in civil strife.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Guild of Travel Writers has taken a similar stance
and, for the first time in its history, has urged tourists and tour
operators to boycott Indonesia until peace is restored in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual tourists and tour operators have got to examine
their consciences,'' said Guild vice-chairman Peter Lilley. ``It is
all too easy to stand by and convince oneself that the matter does
not concern you _ or that there is nothing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But others in the tourism business disagree. Tony Champion,
managing director of Magic of the Orient, which features Burma and
Indonesia in its brochures, feels that it's not up to business to
draw a moral line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to keep the doors open and leave the final
decision to the client. It's very difficult because almost every
country has a human-rights record, including our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tour companies also argue that boycotts can do more harm
than good because they affect local people.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Carlos Bellos, head of the Catholic Church in Indonesia,
has reportedly called for a tourism boycott but with the business
worth billions of dollars to the country, thousands of ordinary
Indonesians depend on tourism for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   David Abram, author of the ``Rough Guide to Goa,'' says, ``If
people don't go abroad who's really losing out? It's the poorer
people _ the local hoteliers, the women who rent out the rooms _
they're the ones who will be most affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked those women they'd say tourism is a good thing
that helps them to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   As global tourism proliferates, the lines become ever murkier.
Should we object to lazing on Turkey's beaches when we consider
their treatment of the Kurds?
</P>
<P>
   What about a week in Moscow now that the Russians are
systematically destroying Chechen villages?
</P>
<P>
   And what about France when they were nuclear testing at Muraroa
atoll?
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the moral maze yet further, enter Libya and Iran, now
respectable vacation destinations. After the Lockerbie bombing
suspects were handed over for trial in the Netherlands earlier this
year, a new Mediterranean resort suddenly appeared in the global
tourist marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Explore Worldwide is planning to move into Libya and British
Airways now offers two flights a week, rising to three during the
summer. It's only a matter of time before Tripoli is building
concrete hotels while its souks are overrun with travel guides and
American Express is common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloss of a European resort, Patricia Barnett argues
that tourists should scratch the surface before visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libya is no different to Bali or China _ you have to make a
considered decision about an environment that is perhaps not as
trouble-free as you'd like to believe.'' &QL;

 UNDATED: the Internet. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   O'Reilly has often embraced new ways of thinking about the
Internet. So when Talbott told him that he wanted to start an
e-mail list and write a book designed to shake up traditional
thinking about computers, O'Reilly gave him the computer resources
he needed and the time to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's one of the most important books I've ever
published,'' O'Reilly said of the finished project, ``The Future
Does Not Compute: Transcending the Machines in Our Midst,''
Talbott's 1995 book that elaborated on many of the ideas that come
through in his newsletter. NetFuture's Web page
(www.oreilly.com/stevet/netfuture) is still maintained on O'Reilly
&AMP; Associates computers, though Talbott left the company in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that people have a responsibility to think critically
about technology pervades Talbott's writing and the work of other
contributors to NetFuture. One topic that is often covered, for
example, is agriculture: growing genetically engineered crops , he
and other contributors have written, will have a devastating impact
on ecosystems. Another perennial is education: universities that
focus on computerized instruction and distance education, Talbott
has argued, have resorted to ``fact shoveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott even questions the free and democratic digital culture
that Wired magazine salutes. The fact that Internet users tend to
be more educated and politically involved is not necessarily
something to applaud, Talbott wrote in 1997; those qualities are
merely byproducts of the fact that people with access to computers
tend to come from privileged backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   His newsletter has brought praise from readers, even those who
do not always agree with everything he writes. A note from Lance
McKee, a vice president in the Open GIS Consortium, a group that
promotes technology for the creation of online maps, , is among
several messages from subscribers that Talbott has posted on the
NetFuture Web site. ``I earn my living in the computer industry,
and I'm not sorry I do,'' McKee wrote. But he continued, ``I am
drawn to NetFuture by both my curiosity and my desire to make
choices I won't regret.''
</P>
<P>
   A few incoming messages are less approving. A few weeks ago,
Talbott got an e-mail message from a reader who compared him to the
Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, who railed against technology and
sent mail-bombs that killed 3 people and injured 22 between 1978
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said he was slightly puzzled by the comparison. He said
he had not read more than a few paragraphs of Kaczynski's writings,
did not feel the need to read more and condemned such violence. But
regarding Kaczynski's ideas, Talbott said, ``I'm not worried if
there is some overlap there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Talbott rejects the label of Luddite. His wife, Phyllis,
also dismisses such a characterization. ``He is not
anti-technology,'' she said. ``You can be aware of the
repercussions of something and not get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott is keenly aware that he is able to survive and support
his family _ the couple have three sons _ because he devoted 18
years of his life to writing about computer programming. Two of the
books he edited while at O'Reilly &AMP; Associates were how-to manuals
on programming with Perl, a language that has proliferated on the
Web. Royalties from those books, along with income from his wife's
work as a part-time home-care nurse, have fed his family and paid
his mortgage. Now, as the royalties dwindle, he is asking his
readers for donations and seeking other sources of income. He has
received about $4,500 in donations so far.
</P>
<P>
   A fledgling nonprofit organization called the Nature Institute
has helped as well. The institute is dedicated to research that
focuses on how elements of nature are interconnected. It was
founded last summer by Craig Holdrege, a biologist, schoolteacher
and neighbor of the Talbotts. Talbott joined the Nature Institute
as a senior researcher, and his newsletter is now one of the
institute's publications. A few rooms on the first floor of a house
in Harlemville make up the group's office.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk up to that office on any afternoon, you might see
Talbott through the window, typing on his computer. He still uses
it almost every weekday, sometimes typing in sentences written on
his yellow note pad. And he still pores through computer manuals to
work through glitches or figure out some of the more obscure
qualities of Linux, the operating system he uses.
</P>
<P>
   His newsletter, in fact, does not have a print counterpart; it
exists only online for reasons of both financing and distribution.
In that way, Talbott embodies his riddle: his lifework springs from
his computer, as long as he makes it his enemy.

</P>
<P>
   Bishop Carlos Bellos, head of the Catholic Church in Indonesia,
has reportedly called for a tourism boycott but with the business
worth billions of dollars to the country, thousands of ordinary
Indonesians depend on tourism for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   David Abram, author of the ``Rough Guide to Goa,'' says, ``If
people don't go abroad who's really losing out? It's the poorer
people _ the local hoteliers, the women who rent out the rooms _
they're the ones who will be most affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked those women they'd say tourism is a good thing
that helps them to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   As global tourism proliferates, the lines become ever murkier.
Should we object to lazing on Turkey's beaches when we consider
their treatment of the Kurds?
</P>
<P>
   What about a week in Moscow now that the Russians are
systematically destroying Chechen villages?
</P>
<P>
   And what about France when they were nuclear testing at Muraroa
atoll?
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the moral maze yet further, enter Libya and Iran, now
respectable vacation destinations. After the Lockerbie bombing
suspects were handed over for trial in the Netherlands earlier this
year, a new Mediterranean resort suddenly appeared in the global
tourist marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Explore Worldwide is planning to move into Libya and British
Airways now offers two flights a week, rising to three during the
summer. It's only a matter of time before Tripoli is building
concrete hotels while its souks are overrun with travel guides and
American Express is common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloss of a European resort, Patricia Barnett argues
that tourists should scratch the surface before visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libya is no different to Bali or China _ you have to make a
considered decision about an environment that is perhaps not as
trouble-free as you'd like to believe.'' &QL;

<P>
   Where would you choose to spend an exotic vacation? Sunbathing
on a tropical beach with endless white sands fringed with palm
trees? Or maybe you'd appreciate something a little more cultural,
a mountain trek and a tour of ancient ruins and remote villages?
That's the sort of choice we're used to making.
</P>
<P>
   But what if that paradise beach happens to be just miles from an
entrenched civil war? Or an exotic island's business interests are
controlled by a military regime?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most unpalatable regimes in the world are to be
found in countries desperate to attract tourists, and they are
keener than ever to persuade us that they have some of the most
desirable vacation destinations available.
</P>
<P>
   Take Burma, for example. Next month it will be promoting itself
as an ideal place for an exotic break when it takes a stand at the
World Travel Market in London's Earls Court. There will be no
mention of its record of oppressing human rights and its lack of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Burma is becoming adept at putting a gloss on its image:
when it freed human-rights activist Rachel Goldwyn earlier this
month, after she had served less than two months of a seven-year
sentence for singing a pro-democracy protest song, the British
woman was treated as a ``guest'' of the military, heading ``up
country'' for a couple of days sightseeing on an approved tour
before flying home.
</P>
<P>
   Burma will be in good company at the World Travel Market. There
will also be displays by Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sixth leading international tourist destination, China
will be awarded the 1999 World Tourism Award in recognition of the
``outstanding impact of travel and tourism in generating employment
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter if we vacation in such countries? Tourism
Concern, which campaigns for responsible tourism, says it does.
According to its director, Patricia Barnett, visiting such a
country condones its regime, while a boycott would make an
oppressive government realize that not everyone in the West is
willing to turn a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to consider why you're going to Bali,'' she
says, ``and to think incredibly hard about why you feel the need to
have a holiday in a country deeply embedded in civil strife.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Guild of Travel Writers has taken a similar stance
and, for the first time in its history, has urged tourists and tour
operators to boycott Indonesia until peace is restored in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual tourists and tour operators have got to examine
their consciences,'' said Guild vice-chairman Peter Lilley. ``It is
all too easy to stand by and convince oneself that the matter does
not concern you _ or that there is nothing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But others in the tourism business disagree. Tony Champion,
managing director of Magic of the Orient, which features Burma and
Indonesia in its brochures, feels that it's not up to business to
draw a moral line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to keep the doors open and leave the final
decision to the client. It's very difficult because almost every
country has a human-rights record, including our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tour companies also argue that boycotts can do more harm
than good because they affect local people.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Carlos Bellos, head of the Catholic Church in Indonesia,
has reportedly called for a tourism boycott but with the business
worth billions of dollars to the country, thousands of ordinary
Indonesians depend on tourism for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked those women they'd say tourism is a good thing
that helps them to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>

TURKEY, TEXAS, POP. 500

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURKEY, Texas _ A full-body turkey costume, complete from feet
to wattle, is uncomfortable to wear, particularly on a hot evening
when not a breeze stirs the nearly empty streets of this Panhandle
town.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, owner of the bed and breakfast Hotel Turkey, had
just bought the turkey costume in Amarillo, 100 miles north, in
anticipation of the CBS camera crew that had called to say it would
be arriving to film a segment about Turkey, Texas, to air on ``Late
Night With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson put on the turkey costume to surprise the
``Letterman'' crew. He waited in the lobby of the 1927-vintage
Hotel Turkey. And he waited. And waited. The crew was late. He
couldn't sit because of the tail feathers. Johnson paced the
parlor, which is decorated in Victorian frill, punctuated with a
few mementos of Turkey's famous native son, western swing king Bob
Wills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, also a Turkey native, said some folks in town didn't
believe that Letterman's crew would show up.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Turkey for you. About half the 500 Turkey residents
believe that the cotton-and-peanut farming town will someday be
known as a tourist destination, partly because of its western swing
music heritage, partly because of its wonderful name, and partly
because of its proximity to Caprock Canyons State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The other half aren't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and frustrated, Johnson took off the turkey suit. Will
Turkey's fortunes ever change?
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Biff Henderson and the ``Letterman'' crew
pulled up, ready for two days of filming for a few-minutes-long
segment that aired Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson now says he should have known the crew would show. He's
one of the believers who are working to change the future of this
town abandoned by two-thirds of its population in the 1950s after
the railroad quit running on the Estelline-to-Lubbock spur and
after farming became the province of only those with thousands of
acres. A generation of farm children left for work in the cities.
Roofs fell in on Main Street. Henderson told the nation on
``Letterman'' that Turkey is one sleepy little town.
</P>
<P>
   A few plucky folks are working to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the justice of the peace, and his wife, Suzie, the
mayor, host an annual reservations-only Thanksgiving dinner for
more than 100 paying guests at Hotel Turkey. Oftentimes, the meals
are interrupted by telephone calls from radio talk show hosts from
around the nation who want to have a Thanksgiving-Day chat about
the quaint life in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, son of Clema Johnson, who ran a Turkey beauty shop for
more than 70 years, cutting hair and giving perms until she was in
her 90s, can tell them this:
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys still roost in the cottonwood trees along the
creeks, and they mingle with cattle herds, trying to steal the
feed. Cotton and peanut and sweet potato and watermelon farmers
still gather at the Turkey Cafe and Drive-In at the intersection of
Texas 86 and 70, where they talk about crop-dusting, road paving
and rattlesnakes that refuse to die, no matter how many times you
run over them with a pickup. Those snakes just sink into the red
dirt of the unpaved farm roads and manage to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Farms still flourish. Trucks _ sometimes 20 a day _ have been
leaving the peanut harvest in recent weeks, each hauling 50,000
pounds of peanuts to distributors who ship them out as seed or
edible peanuts for candy. Hershey's is a big buyer of Turkey
peanuts, according to the weekly newspaper ``The Valley Tribune''
of Quitaque, another small town down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The farms are far larger than they used to be, and there are far
fewer of them, said Tom Eudy, who retired after 47 years raising
cotton. And farm owners require far fewer workers than they did
some 40 years ago, when Turkey was a bustling center that drew
crowds to The Gem movie theater and the drugstore on Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Gem has been closed for about 40 years. Lawana Cruse and her
sister-in-law, Marie Cruse, bought it for $10,000 four years ago, a
high price tag in a town with buildings that sometimes sell for
about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters-in-law persuaded the Turkey Volunteer Fire
Department to bring two pump trucks to the theater and hose out 35
years' worth of Panhandle dust from the interior. The Cruses have
been successfully applying for grants and renovating the theater
for use as a performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Lawana Cruse also wants to open a museum of local farming
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good museum for Bob Wills, but we also ought to have
a museum to honor the people who stayed and worked,'' Lawana Cruse
said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of economic development, fiddle player Bob Wills is
Turkey's real cash crop. Born March 6, 1905, in Turkey, Wills
learned how to barber at Ham's Barbershop, which is still operating
after 88 years as a family business on Main Street. Wills went on
to form the band sponsored by Fort Worth's Burris Flour Mills, the
Light Crust Doughboys, and then the Texas Playboys. Wills moved to
Fort Worth in 1963 and died there in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Bob Wills Foundation puts on Jim Bob Wills Days the
last Saturday of every April. For two weeks, the town is packed
with the recreational vehicles of 10,000 or so western swing fans
and bands that play in the music festival, watch the parade and
attend the annual barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder why so many come, what with the dust and
wind,'' says Wilma Eudy, wife of Tom Eudy.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also raises money for community projects, including
the purchase of the old Turkey High School _ former home of the
Turks _ and elementary school, both abandoned in the 1970s for lack
of students. The schools now house City Hall and the Bob Wills
Museum. The museum is Turkey's main year-round attraction. In
October, 50 visitors had signed the guest book. They came from
Texas but also Missouri, Kansas, Alabama, Michigan, Ohio, New
Mexico, Nevada and California to see the hometown of the man known
for ``San Antonio Rose, Faded Love'' and other classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people do want to see Turkey grow, but I like it like
it is,'' says museum volunteer Lorene Setliff, a third-generation
Turkey resident. ``It's quiet and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, there's plenty of turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The old schools also house a community center where each year
for the past 20 years, the Turkey Proud Committee has put together
a Turkey turkey dinner the Sunday before Thanksgiving. About 200 to
300 people are served.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baptists bring the salads, the Church of Christ brings the
mashed potatoes and the Methodists bring something else. The
foundation brings the turkey,'' Gary Johnson says. ``Then everyone
eats until they run out of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson donned his turkey costume for the ``Letterman'' crew
before they left the bed and breakfast. The camera was packed by
the time he got the wattle and tail feathers on and straight, but
that's OK with Johnson. He knows he has a lot of promoting to do,
and that turkey costume is bound to come in handy.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: BUSH FINDS THE SWEET SPOT

   WASHINGTON _ ``I'm going to be the next president of the United
States,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush recently told foreign policy
guru Richard Perle. ``I don't need your help to be elected,'' Bush
went on to say. ``I know how to get that done. But I do need your
help to be a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   We see a candidate who is at once arrogant and humble, disarming
and demanding. Judging by the company he keeps and what he has to
say, Bush seems to have found a political sweet spot.
</P>
<P>
   Perle is a veteran conservative Democrat who held a key Pentagon
job in the Republican 1980s. He has since become rich and says he
doesn't want to return to government. Bush says he's running a
``positive campaign,'' which means he doesn't want to wallop
President Clinton on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Perle does. ``The current crowd is the least component to
hold office in the last half of the 20th century,'' he says. ``They
view every foreign policy issue in terms of how things will look.
Lots of people have died as a result of their concentration on
appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents hold wide latitude in how they act abroad. History
shows that specific foreign policy issues raised in campaigns are
rarely the same ones that officeholders must confront. So evidence
of strong character and good judgment are key tests of what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal he has to learn,'' Perle says, speaking
of Bush's general lack of expertise with big global and military
issues. ``But,'' he adds, ``he's a challenging student who in my
encounters with him has demonstrated a tough-mindedness that I find
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bush political calendar called for a high-profile
foreign policy rollout, the advisers Bush chose and where he chose
to speak were as helpful to his prospects as anything he had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   His eight core advisers worked mostly in second-level but
nevertheless pivotal government posts, either for his father or for
Ronald Reagan. One of them, Condoleeza Rice, a National Security
Council aide under Bush I, could well follow yet another fluent
Russian speaker into the Cabinet: Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Bush II selected as his venue the Reagan Library in Yorba Linda,
Calif. Nancy Reagan sat beaming beside former Secretary of State
George P. Schultz, the campaign's elder statesman, whom Bush
thanked ``for your decades of service, for your kindness, (and) for
your counsel over the past few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the uniform hard-line foreign policy views of his chief
counselors, it's hard to see how Bush could be credibly attacked
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   But he promptly was by Californian Bruce Herschensohn, who held
that Steve Forbes is the only candidate who has made it clear that
``we will defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack.'' Herschensohn spoke
at the National Press Club, along with several other well-known
conservative activists, including Richard Viguerie and Paul
Weyrich.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is fortunate to have these heavy-hitters running around
Iowa and New Hampshire on his behalf. But Bush is even more
fortunate since their attacks help define him as a centrist figure
_ the kind of ``compassionate conservative'' whom voters are apt to
favor.

TEACHING HOSPITALS URGE CONGRESS TO REQUIRE INSURERS TO PAY FEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teaching hospitals intend to press Congress to
require managed care providers, private insurers and large
employers to pay a special fee to help cover the costs of training
medical residents.
</P>
<P>
   The new lobbying campaign was being cranked up after the
teaching hospitals won a big victory earlier this month when
Congress restored to teaching hospitals more than $1 billion in
Medicare cuts made in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough to cover the cost of training medical
residents, conducting medical research, and caring for the
traditionally sicker and poorer patients that these institutions
attract, according to Dr. Jordan Cohen, president of the
Association of American Medical Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is one payer,'' Cohen said. ``Other payers, all of
whom benefit from teaching hospitals, should pay their fair
share.'' The time has come for Congress to require that other
insurers also pony up, he said, because the training of medical
residents is a ``societal good not paid for by the competitive
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Private insurers once covered much of the extra costs at
teaching hospitals. After managed care providers squeezed those
payments, the institutions came to rely more on Medicare payments,
until those also were cut back.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Congress now must find a way to pay for teaching
hospitals' services ``without having to depend upon patient
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, a long-time champion of teaching hospitals, wants
Congress to create a Medical Education Trust Fund to finance the
costs of training medical residents. That fund would be financed by
a 1.5 percent tax on health insurance premiums for private
insurers. The bill would also transfer to the newly created fund
the existing Medicare and Medicaid contributions for medical
education.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's legislation is co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Barbara A. Mikulski and was introduced on
the House side by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md.,
has proposed a similar measure that would place a 1 percent tax on
health care insurance plan premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing the funding source for graduate medical education
from primarily Medicare funds to multiple layers would protect
graduate medical education for the long term,'' Moynihan told the
Senate earlier this month. ``Teaching hospitals are national
treasures; they are the very best in the world. Yet today they find
themselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces
reshape the health care delivery system in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Muller, president and CEO of the University of Chicago
Hospitals and Health Systems, who chairs the Association of
American Medical Colleges, said he is confident that Congress will
act favorably on the Moynihan legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of Congress and the administration saw that some
teaching hospitals were in real trouble,'' Muller said. ``We think
we can help shape the debate next fall. People feel some
substantial changes have to go forth in the health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Medical Center in
Bronx, N.Y., said teaching hospitals are ``in an environment in
which everyone, including us, is just hanging on by our
fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman said teaching hospitals and health insurance payers
``are caught in a tug of war in which the payers are winning _ and
that is causing a substantial amount of disruption for the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore stands to lose $10 million in Medicare payments over
five years _ more than any other teaching hospital _ under a new
payment system approved this month by Congress that would more
evenly distribute Medicare money for resident training.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, 121 teaching hospitals will get less than
they received in the past. Those hospitals previously received more
per resident than other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, about 300 hospitals will receive more
Medicare funding under the new formula.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Coombs, vice president for medical affairs at the
University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, said all
insurers, Medicare and Medicaid must be required to pay for the
training of young doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical education is a public commodity,'' Coombs said. ``It's
something that everyone benefits from. It's a very expensive and
scarce resource and the public demands high quality.'' The issue of
how to pay for it, he said, ``needs to be right on the top of our
political agenda.''

   WASHINGTON _ ``I'm going to be the next president of the United
States,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush recently told foreign policy
guru Richard Perle. ``I don't need your help to be elected,'' Bush
went on to say. ``I know how to get that done. But I do need your
help to be a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   We see a candidate who is at once arrogant and humble, disarming
and demanding. Judging by the company he keeps and what he has to
say, Bush seems to have found a political sweet spot.
</P>
<P>
   Perle is a veteran conservative Democrat who held a key Pentagon
job in the Republican 1980s. He has since become rich and says he
doesn't want to return to government. Bush says he's running a
``positive campaign,'' which means he doesn't want to wallop
President Clinton on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Perle does. ``The current crowd is the least competent to
hold office in the last half of the 20th century,'' he says. ``They
view every foreign policy issue in terms of how things will look.
Lots of people have died as a result of their concentration on
appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents hold wide latitude in how they act abroad. History
shows that specific foreign policy issues raised in campaigns are
rarely the same ones that officeholders must confront. So evidence
of strong character and good judgment are key tests of what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal he has to learn,'' Perle says, speaking
of Bush's general lack of expertise with big global and military
issues. ``But,'' he adds, ``he's a challenging student who in my
encounters with him has demonstrated a tough-mindedness that I find
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bush political calendar called for a high-profile
foreign policy rollout, the advisers Bush chose and where he chose
to speak were as helpful to his prospects as anything he had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   His eight core advisers worked mostly in second-level but
nevertheless pivotal government posts, either for his father or for
Ronald Reagan. One of them, Condoleeza Rice, a National Security
Council aide under Bush I, could well follow yet another fluent
Russian speaker into the Cabinet: Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Bush II selected as his venue the Reagan Library in Yorba Linda,
Calif. Nancy Reagan sat beaming beside former Secretary of State
George P. Schultz, the campaign's elder statesman, whom Bush
thanked ``for your decades of service, for your kindness, (and) for
your counsel over the past few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the uniform hard-line foreign policy views of his chief
counselors, it's hard to see how Bush could be credibly attacked
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   But he promptly was by Californian Bruce Herschensohn, who held
that Steve Forbes is the only candidate who has made it clear that
``we will defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack.'' Herschensohn spoke
at the National Press Club, along with several other well-known
conservative activists, including Richard Viguerie and Paul
Weyrich.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is fortunate to have these heavy-hitters running around
Iowa and New Hampshire on his behalf. But Bush is even more
fortunate since their attacks help define him as a centrist figure
_ the kind of ``compassionate conservative'' whom voters are apt to
favor.

   BONFIRE _ Eric Etheridge climbed off the towering wooden
structure, looked up and noticed a slight tilt. From his perch on
the fourth stack, Derek Woodley's swing dipped suddenly. Both heard
an ear-splintering crack and nightmarish chaos ensued as they and
dozens of their Texas A&AMP;M University classmates tumbled to the
ground along with hundreds of tree trunks. No one can say for sure
what caused the Aggie Bonfire to collapse a week ago, killing 12
students and injuring 27. University President Robert Bowen's
special task force is only now beginning the arduous and
months-long task of interviewing witnesses like Etheridge and
Woodley, and sifting through the rumors, photographs, and piles of
lumber in search of answers. However, interviews with a dozen
students working on the bonfire that night suggest a number of
consistencies. (Copelin/Spencer, Austin American-Statesman). 40.

laws. Thousands of digital, CD-quality music files are floating
across the World Wide Web. Some are offered by their creators, who
hope to spur interest in their work by giving away a sample. But
many are copied and traded illegally, depriving musicians and
record companies of money that, in all likelihood, is exponentially
greater than the $1 million a day lost from bootleg tapes and CDs,

<TEXT>

   When Apple introduced the iBook several months ago as the
portable version of its popular iMac desktop computer, one of its
more intriguing features was a built-in radio antenna that in
theory enabled the iBook to connect to the Internet and share files
with other Macintosh computers without wires.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project,
which scans radio emissions coming from deep space for patterns
that might indicate alien intelligence, and perhaps even explain
the Pokemon phenomenon, the antenna in my iBook picked up only
static.
</P>
<P>
   Apple finally released the missing components last week to allow
the iBook to communicate with other silicon-based life forms: the
$299 AirPort base station and the $99 AirPort wireless networking
card. They were well worth the wait. The AirPort wireless
networking system is confirmation that there is intelligent life in
the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The AirPort networking technology enables two or more
AirPort-equipped computers to share files and Internet connections
via radio waves at distances of up to 150 feet, even through walls
and ceilings, at speeds of up to 11 megabits per second. That is
faster and easier than any wire-based networking scheme I've tried
at home, including prototypes of a 10 mbps system, the Home
Phoneline Networking Association version 2.0 kit for PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Two Macs, each with an AirPort card, can swap files and share
system resources and can be used for multiplayer games. With the
base station, up to 10 (or maybe more) Macs equipped wth AirPort
can share a high-speed Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   That is so important, and it has such potential to change the
way we use computers and information appliances around the house,
that I'm compelled to repeat it in a different way: I'm sitting
outside the house on the deck, with an iBook on my lap, enjoying a
glorious autumn day, reading the current e-news, checking e-mail,
doing a little bit of holiday e-shopping, and writing this column.
</P>
<P>
   There are no wires, cables or extension cords in sight. As the
stars come out, I simply stroll back into the house and continue
working from the sofa in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know how my dog must feel. I'm not supposed to be on the
sofa, at least not with a computer. Computers have been banned from
the living room, mainly for esthetic reasons. But with no wires and
power cords, and an easily carried iBook, no one will know.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the health and happiness of my family, a championship
for the Yankees and my Digital Subscriber Line high-speed Internet
service, AirPort is at the top of my list of things to be grateful
for this Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook itself is a bit of a puzzle, however. How odd it is to
finally receive intelligent radio transmissions from Out There,
only to discover that they emanate from a device that vaguely
resembles an orange or blue toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the iBook is a clamshell design of translucent,
ice-colored plastic with rubberized hot tangerine or cool blueberry
accents. Apple designed it for students and for consumers buying
their first portable PC.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook has many clever features, including an extraordinary
six-hour battery, a powerful PowerPC G3 microprocessor, a rugged
case with a flip-up handle, a plush, full-size keyboard with
comfortable wrist wrests, and the AirPort radio antenna embedded in
the translucent plastic surrounding a big, bright, colorful display
screen. At $1,599, the price measures up admirably against other
laptops in its class.
</P>
<P>
   It also has some turkey features, however, including a base
configuration that offers just 32 megabytes of RAM and a 3.2
gigabyte hard disk. Apple says the iBook weighs 6.6 pounds, which
may be true on Mars. Here on Earth, my scale said it was 8 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The stingy helping of RAM means that only one or two application
programs can be active at once, and that the processor will be
hobbled by frequent hard disk access. But Apple wanted to keep the
iBook's price down, and it chose to spend its money on things that
cannot be upgraded easily, like the Thin Film Transistor screen,
the keyboard and the AirPort system.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the AirPort system, I have been carrying the hefty
iBook everywhere I go in the house. Upstairs, downstairs, in the
kitchen, in the living room, on the deck, in the garage _
everywhere I went, the iBook stayed in touch with its DSL-connected
base station or, in computer-to-computer mode, to another
AirPort-equipped iMac in my office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   AirPort is based on a new wireless networking protocol called
IEEE 802.11b, which has been adopted widely within the computer
industry. This week, in fact, Dell introduced a line of 802.11,
wireless networking products for its corporate computers. Apple,
however, is the first to bring 802.11b to the consumer world, at
down-to-earth prices.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Windows-based machines that adhere to the 802.11b
standard will eventually be able to network wirelessly with Macs.
For now, however, AirPort wireless home networking is a luxury for
Mac owners only, and then only for Macs that have antennas and can
accept the AirPort wireless networking card.
</P>
<P>
   Those include all of the iBooks, all of the newest iMacs (but
not the original ones) and all of the desktop G4 Macintoshes except
the bottom-end 350-megahertz model.
</P>
<P>
   Apple says current PowerBook portables, the larger and more
powerful siblings of the iBooks, and older G3 Macintoshes can be
added to an Airport network with an optional WaveLAN network card
from Lucent, which co-developed the AirPort system with Apple. The
cards cost $179 or $199, depending on features (www.wavelan.com).
Lucent says the cards can also add Windows-based PCs to an AirPort
network, but I did not test that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Older Macs, including the recent G3 Blue and White desktops, are
essentially out of luck. They can be hard-wired, via Ethernet
cable, to an AirPort base station.
</P>
<P>
   The AirPort base station resembles a silver flying saucer from a
1950s science fiction movie. It is stylish enough to leave on the
desktop. The base station contains both a 56K modem and a 10BaseT
Ethernet port for connection to a high-speed local area network,
DSL or cable modem. The real value of the base station is in
sharing a fast Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and DSL connections are always ``on,'' so connections from
a remote AirPort-equipped computer are instant. If the Internet
connection is by dial-up modem, connecting from a remote computer
works just as it does from a wired computer. Clicking on the
browser or e-mail software tells the base station to dial into the
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort works only with ISPs that adhere to common Internet
protocols, which includes just about all of them except America
Online. So, if you connect to the Internet through AOL's dial-up
system, you will need another ISP for the AirPort Internet
connection. Once connected to the Internet through AirPort, it is
easy to log onto AOL and use all its resources, including e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless networking is going to be profoundly important, and I
hope other PC makers follow Apple's bold lead in making 802.11
connections a standard feature. Another wireless standard called
Bluetooth will show up in products next year to allow small
appliances, phones, computer peripherals and consumer electronics
devices to communicate automatically. We will soon be bombarding
the universe with more radio and infrared emissions than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate, then, that another profound application
making its debut this year involves radio waves arriving from the
other direction.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.4 million Internet-connected personal computer
owners in 224 countries have teamed up to donate their otherwise
unused computing cycles to help create the world's largest ad hoc
supercomputer. The common goal is to help the SETI(AT)home Project
at the University of California at Berkeley
(www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) search for extraterrestrial
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the project began in May, these PCs have collectively
contributed 120,000 years' worth of computing time to analyze radio
emissions from outer space, said Dr. Dan Werthimer, the project's
chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   They have not bagged any aliens yet, Werthimer noted.

CLINTON SEES DEAL EMERGING ON VIEQUES BOMBING RANGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday the Pentagon and
Puerto Rico are ``making real headway'' toward a compromise to
reopen a Navy bombing range on the island of Vieques, with an
announcement possible ``in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, fresh from a 10-day trip to Southeastern Europe
and Turkey, told reporters in the White House Rose Garden that he
and his administration have ``worked very hard'' to balance the
combat training requirements of the Navy and Marine Corps at the
island bombing range with the demands of Puerto Rico to permanently
end bombardment that has occurred on Vieques since the outset of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting there,'' Clinton said in remarks following a
traditional presidential pardon to spare a Thanksgiving turkey.
``And I hope in the next few days we'll have something to say about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Pentagon and the government of Puerto Rico
``have been working together'' in closed-door discussions. He
praised the ``good faith'' efforts to seek an agreement designed to
end a seven month standoff between Puerto Rico and the Navy over
future use of the target range. The discussions have involved Gov.
Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico; Carlos Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's
nonvoting representative in Congress; Defense Secretary William
Cohen; and Navy Secretary Richard Danzig.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, assigned by Clinton to seek a compromise, is expected to
brief the president on the results of the discussions as early as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he faces a decision trying to balance ``two
legitimate issues'' _ the concerns of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million
residents and the 9,300 civilians living on Vieques, and the Navy's
``absolutely legitimate concern of sending all of our units out
combat ready.''
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, eight miles east of the main island of Puerto Rico,
an 899-acre bombing range and an adjacent 11,000-acre buffer and
maneuver zone have been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot
mistakenly targeted a range observation post atop a 450-foot hill.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot dropped two 500 pound bombs, killing Navy contract
security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and wounding four
civilian employees on the bombing range. Several dozen protesters
are encamped on the range hoping to prevent resumption of bombing
or naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really worked hard on this in a good spirit and like I
said, I've spent an awful lot of time on it myself,'' Clinton said.
``And I hope we can get it worked out. I'm not sure. I can't say
for sure we will. But we're making real headway and we're working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision carries potential political repercussions for
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign in New York and
for Vice President Al Gore's bid to succeed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens by birth, are an
influential constituency in New York, where about 60 percent of the
state's 2.6 million Hispanics are Puerto Rican. Hispanic voters
also exercise growing political influence in electorally important
states that are represented in Congress by members of the Hispanic
Congressional Caucus, including California, Florida, Illinois, New
Jersey and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the timing of his decision is being driven by the
looming training schedule of the Navy-Marine Corps battle group,
led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, that is due
to train on Vieques in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said Wednesday that ships in the Eisenhower
battle group are scheduled to leave Norfolk, Va., and other East
Coast ports around Dec. 2 to begin a 10-day training exercise that
will include bombing practice by carrier-based warplanes, an
amphibious landing by Marines and naval gunfire by some of all of
the eight destroyers, frigates and cruisers that will accompany the
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
dispute over the Vieques training range has prompted the Navy to
prepare to carry out live-fire training at other locations without
the combined land, sea and air attacks that traditionally have been
carried out at Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Navy warplanes plan to fly simulated combat missions from the
carrier to attack bombing ranges at Eglin Air Force Base on the
Gulf Coast of Florida and the Pine Castle range north of Orlando.
Marine forces plan to stage an amphibious landing at Camp Lejeune,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Navy warships are preparing to fire 5-inch guns from as far away
as 15 miles against shore targets at the range on Vieques, using
inert, non-explosive shells filled with sand or concrete rather
than traditional training rounds that use between seven and nine
pounds of high explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire training is designed to overcome a gap in combat
preparations that the Navy says it cannot remedy anywhere else on
the East Coast. Without the planned gunfire training on Vieques, as
many as five of the eight surface warships scheduled to accompany
the Eisenhower to the Persian Gulf in February would be forced to
operate during all or part of their six month deployment without
the gunfire qualification needed to be certified as combat ready.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Colin Brady is one of those executives whose office is a
computer screen, whether it is the one on his home computer, his
work computer or his laptop. So last July, when both his laptop and
his home computer crashed irreparably within a four-day period, it
was as if two-thirds of his office had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   By all measures, Brady should have been in a panic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he remained calm. His work had been saved in what he
called his ``safe deposit box in the sky,'' an online area that had
been serving as his virtual desktop. Within a few days, after
getting a new laptop, he logged into a Web site called Visto.com
and retrieved his documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a professional lifesaver,'' said Brady, a recruiter for
TMP Worldwide Executive Search.
</P>
<P>
   If last year's buzzword was Web portal, this year it is virtual
desktop, also known as the roaming desktop, the Internet desktop,
and, in some circles, pervasive computing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, portals were heralded for their ability to give people
a central place to find personalized news, sports and stock quotes
from any computer on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, virtual desktops are being promoted for their centrality
and convenience, but they take ``personal'' a step further: users
have constant access to their content _ their files, their address
books, their calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the information you ever wanted to look at will be
available at any time, anywhere,'' said Kevin Herrboldt, director
of engineering for Cyrus InterSoft of Minneapolis, which is
offering virtual desktop software called Speiros. ``You will no
longer say, `I have to go home and download that information from
my computer.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, virtual-desktop services are mostly available in bits
and pieces. Some companies offer online storage while others
provide Web-based calendars or photo albums. A few companies, such
as MyFamily.com and Bungo.com, have tried to put those services in
one package.
</P>
<P>
   The newest services, which are still being tested, provide
spreadsheet or word-processing programs. The programs do not need
to be loaded onto a computer's hard drive. They can simply be
``borrowed'' or ``rented'' from companies such as Cyrus InterSoft
or Desktop.com that keep the applications on servers and operate
them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that concept seems to appeal mostly to users who have
lightning-fast connections.
</P>
<P>
   But just as portals have not become essential for most computer
users, virtual desktops may not live up to their promise either.
How many people, for example, actually manage to keep the
 &UR; physical &LR;  elements of their work and their private lives _ to-do
lists, calendars, projects, phone numbers _ in one place?
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are of the viewpoint: this is where you'll put your
stuff, and that's what people will want to do,'' said Keith Dawson,
editor of an e-mail newsletter, Tasty Bits from the Technology
Front. But ``it's not clear at all that that's what people want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about security, reliability and privacy, not to mention
bandwidth, may keep some people from adopting the virtual desktop,
Dawson said. ``I don't think it's the next big thing,'' he added.
``I think it's a small thing that may not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people say they do not want to be dependent on just one
computer. Many users, in fact, are already using an ad-hoc version
of the virtual desktop: They send documents to their home computer
as e-mail attachments and then use e-mail to transfer them back to
work. Or they set up roaming e-mail accounts, like Hotmail, that
allow them to check their messages from any Web-connected computer,
like those at airport kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is sometimes difficult to maintain a ``home base'' _
that one place that contains the latest version of files. Some
newly updated documents, for example, might be sitting on the
computer at home when they are needed on the laptop or at work.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine, say the advocates of virtual desktops, if those
files could always reside in something like Brady's ``safe deposit
box in the sky.'' The latest changes would always be retrievable;
the documents would be stored on servers maintained by companies
that make a business of keeping that data safe.
</P>
<P>
   That vision has been bandied about for years among computer
manufacturers and information-technology enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Computer historians would argue that the vision was a reality
before the days of personal computers, when people worked on dumb
terminals that were connected to mainframes. In the consumer
market, the idea is more recent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Oracle began developing a device it called the network
computer, a stripped-down machine that tapped into a more powerful
network.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison predicted in 1997 that
network computers would outsell PCs by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most analysts agree that the network computer is as good
as dead. But the companies jumping into the virtual desktop
movement are not discouraged. In fact, many of them argue that as
soon as their software gains acceptance among consumers, the idea
of a network computer will probably take off. This time it will be
called a ``Net appliance,'' a device like a cell phone or handheld
computer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can you go to any computer, you'll have a handheld
device that has a consistent interface'' with the desktop you are
accustomed to seeing on your computer screen, said Sam Fahmy,
president of Bungo.com, one of the virtual-desktop companies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the virtual desktops run on a typical Web
browser, like Netscape or Internet Explorer. Users create
``desktops'' by setting up a user ID and password. Then they upload
files from their computers into the servers maintained by the
desktop companies. Entering data into Web-based calendars and
address books can often be done on the fly, using fill-in-the-blank
forms. Desktop.com provides online calculators, applications that
make graphs of stock quotes and notepads that act as word
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus InterSoft, the company making Speiros, is taking a
different approach. It is abandoning the Web interface and
marketing a standalone product that acts something like a browser,
except that is designed specifically to maintain the security of
personal documents and run applications like spreadsheet programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web was meant to be a place to broadcast public
information,'' said Herrboldt of Cyrus InterSoft. ``It was never
meant to provide a secure location for storing information.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is hoping to add Speiros to Internet computers that
are in airport kiosks. It believes that people would be willing to
download Speiros onto their laptops and computers, since they are
already accustomed to downloading the latest version of Netscape
for Web browsing.
</P>
<P>
   But dial-up users, beware: Trying to maneuver around a
full-service virtual desktop, whether using a Web browser or
another piece of software, can be a chore. If loading a simple Web
page can take minutes using a dial-up modem, imagine the agony of
using a word-processing program that runs over the Web from a
server thousands of miles away. Even over a speedy T-1 line, the
process can be like typing underwater .
</P>
<P>
   Those who have adopted some form of virtual desktop (often those
in areas with broadband Internet access) use them as communal
spaces as much as personal ones. Once data resides on a networked
server, outside a private hard drive, anyone with a password can
gain access. The online desktop becomes part virtual bulletin
board, part virtual conference room.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Stuart Fullinwider, an investor in Bungo.com who
lives in Denver, uses the service to publish a schedule of his
son's ice hockey games, which other team members can tap into. John
Blair, a 40-year-old resident of Longview, Wash., puts photographs
of his late father on a virtual desktop he built using
MyFamily.com. His 10 brothers and sisters, who are scattered around
the country, can log in and add their own. Last summer, the group
planned a reunion using the service. ``It's caused a lot more
interaction,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The family-and-friends benefit is not lost on virtual-desktop
companies. Capturing an audience, particularly one that multiplies
with every group enlisted, can translate into lucrative advertising
revenues and commissions on e-commerce products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service can wrap you in more closely and make you loyal,''
said Dawson, the newsletter editor. ``If your stuff is there, you
are going to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much stuff a person will put in their virtual desktops
is an open question. Marlene Cupit, a 60-year-old resident of
Hurst, Texas, stores family stories on a MyFamily.com site that
nearly 80 family members can enter. Because of the password
protection, she said she was confident that no one else can gain
access. The family even talks about financial matters using the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Others may be less trusting. ``I think people will use these for
nonsensitive data,'' said Bob Rankin, an editor of Tourbus, an
e-mail newsletter. But they will demand high levels of security, he
said, for more private materials. ``Especially,'' he added, ``after
the first highly publicized hacking incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Each virtual desktop company promises that their customers'
documents are safe; many have encrypted the materials and most of
them boast about their back-up procedures. But often the files are
only as private as people's passwords, which are often not as safe
as people think. ``It's very difficult to make these services
bullet-proof,'' said Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   Human psychology comes into play as well. Some observers argue
that people want to be able to point to a machine, Zip disk or
floppy disk and say: Here is where the information resides. ``I
LIKE having MY data on MY hard drive,'' Rankin wrote in an e-mail
message.
</P>
<P>
   Even Brady, the executive who swears by his ``safe deposit box
in the sky,'' backs up his data. He uses a Visto.com utility that
automatically synchronizes his data every day and then sends copies
to Visto.com for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have the latest stuff on all three machines
regardless of which machine on which I originally did the work,''
Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, virtual-desktop companies may say that their services
are available ``anytime, anywhere,'' but that ``anywhere'' comes
with a caveat: you must be connected to the Internet. Until it
becomes practical to log on for hours while flying at 30,000 feet,
Brady will work off line, from a document stored on his hard drive.

   VIRTUAL STORAGE SERVICES
</P>
<P>
   It started with e-mail: Companies like Hotmail.com and Yahoo
offered people an online space to keep their e-mail so they could
gain access from any Web browser. Now the concept has moved to
other desktop services, from online calendars to word-processing
programs that run over the Web. Companies are sprouting up to offer
the services, which are free in exchange for your glances at their
advertisements. Here are a sampling:

   Fruits and Nuts
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been told the cashew tree produces an apple that is
technically not a fruit and a nut that is technically not a nut.
Botanically speaking, what is a fruit, what is a nut, and where
does the bounty of the cashew tree fall?
</P>
<P>
   A. Botanically speaking, a fruit is the matured ovary of a
seed-producing plant, including the seeds, their coating and
anything immediately associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   A nut is harder to crack. Technically, a nut is a hard,
one-celled, one-seeded fruit whose seed is enclosed in a woody or
leathery coating, and it does not open when ripe. But some nuts,
including walnuts, are ambiguous. Because their fleshy coatings
split, they fall somewhere between true nuts and the kernels of
stone fruits, like almonds, which (technically) are not nuts at
all.
</P>
<P>
   But these are models of clarity compared with the cashew,
Anacardium occidentale. In the cashew's case, the large, juicy,
fleshy item, called an apple in spite of its decidedly pear shape,
is technically a swollen peduncle, or stalk. At the end of the
stalk, while it is still small and svelte, a flower grows. From the
flower comes the cashew nut, which is technically the fruit of the
tree. Once the fruit is formed, both it and the stalk start to
swell, and by harvest time, the stalk is 8 to 10 times bigger than
the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much to this so-called fruit except the sweet, meaty
kernel we know as a cashew, but it does include a thin, hard shell
and a clinging film of brown skin.
</P>
<P>
   These are both removed before the nut is marketed, and a good
thing, too. The cashew is related to poison ivy, and the oils in
its shell cause allergic reactions far worse than those inflicted
by that odious vine.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Thistles at Bay
</P>
<P>
   Q. I rent a small plot in a community garden. The problem:
thistle, everywhere. I've tried pulling those vicious plants and
came out the loser. What's worse is that all the neighboring plot
holders just let theirs flower. Short of dropping a bomb, what can
I do? I'd prefer to go organic as I am growing vegetables, but I'm
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't blame you for harboring murderous thoughts, but what
why not look on the bright side, and be glad your laissez-faire
compatriots are not attacking the weeds, and your vegetables, with
chemical herbicides. Then begin a two-pronged program of
cut-and-mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Biennial weeds like thistles are famously difficult to pull up,
but you can get rid of established plants by cutting them off at
the base each time they put out new growth. As long as you don't
let any root-nourishing leaves develop, they will exhaust
themselves and eventually die.
</P>
<P>
   To foil new invaders, mulch all the exposed soil with thick
planter's paper or water-permeable fabric. If the seeds can't get
through, they can't take root.
</P>
<P>
   Wood Ashes
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every winter my mother empties the ashes from her
wood-burning stove and puts them in our vegetable garden. Is this
beneficial to the soil?  &QL; 
A. It is, with two big ifs. The first is: If you live in the
Northeast, where the soil is usually acid. Wood ashes are alkaline,
roughly half as alkaline as lime, so they are good for balancing
acid soils, but they make matters worse where soils are alkaline,
as they are in much of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The second if: Wood ashes are beneficial if they are from
natural unpainted wood. Paint, especially old paint, can contain
heavy metals and other contaminants that fire will not destroy.
Plywood and treated lumber are similarly suspect.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds will buffet the central and northern Rockies on
Thursday as a strong difference in pressure between a high over the
Great Basin and a low near Lake Winnipeg develops. As the fast flow
of air weaves through the rugged terrain, local pockets of
exceptionally strong winds will affect portions of the Front Range.
Indeed, speeds may briefly exceed 70 mph from western Montana to
north-central Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of moisture-laden air from the Pacific will take aim on
portions of the Northwest coast, bringing heavy rain to northwest
Oregon and western Washington. As the eastward-bound damp air
ascends the Cascades, heavy snow will fall near and above pass
level. Foothill showers and high altitude snow will also affect
northeastern Oregon and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding currents of air associated with high pressure near
Utah will bring mainly sunny and milder conditions to the interior
Southwest. Offshore breezes will promote sunny and warm weather
near the southern and central California coast where afternoon
readings will approach 80 degrees near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn dry with sunshine from the eastern Great Lakes
to the central New England coast, but an approaching jet stream
disturbance from the Gulf States will cause clouds to increase and
thicken during the day. Farther south, showers will develop in the
southern and central Appalachians as the disturbance intercepts a
moistening flow of air from the Atlantic Ocean. The rain will
quickly advance north, reaching New England Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Forms of Fog
</P>
<P>
   Many forms of fog have shrouded areas of the East this week. All
fogs form when moist air is cooled to its saturation point. Early
this week, some valleys of East filled with fog when clear skies
allowed the days warmth to dissipate quickly. The resulting mist
that developed is called radiation fog. As the air mass over the
Appalachians moistened during midweek, upslope fog formed as the
humid air was cooled upon ascending the sloping terrain. Also, a
dense sea fog plagued parts of Long Island when the mild air was
cooled to saturation as it passed over the chilly waters of the
North Atlantic.

ORIGAMI SITES SHOW HOW TO FOLD THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By JOYCE COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of origami, all links lead to Joseph Wu.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Wu's Origami Page (www.origami.vancouver.bc.ca), is the
definitive online source of information on origami, the art of
paper folding. Wu tries to connect to every origami site he can and
actively solicits feedback via e-mail; he estimates that he has
about 300 origami links.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's site brings order to the dizzying array of origami
information available on the Web, which includes origami history
and trivia, diagrams for figures of every kind, lists of origami
books and videos, addresses of stores that stock supplies and all
sorts of resources for connecting with fellow folders.
</P>
<P>
   Wu, 29, attributes his Web site's prominence to longevity. It
has been up since 1994, when he was a graduate student in computer
science and he and his classmates started Web sites about their
hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   His site includes diagrams for basic figures, like frogs and
fishes, plus some exceedingly complex creations of his own, like a
great white shark and a three-banded armadillo. But he finds
instructional diagrams tedious, he said, so he has not done that
for many of his own designs.
</P>
<P>
   His site also has pictures of unique folded things, like a devil
made from the wrapper of a bite-size Reese's peanut butter cup.
``The candy wrapper is difficult to work with due to its small size
and to the unforgivingness of the foil,'' Wu said. ``A mistaken
crease is there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Other origami enthusiasts are happy to take advantage of Wu's
links when building their sites. ``We didn't know how to handle the
links, so we just linked to his page,'' said Jan Polish, treasurer
of OrigamiUSA (www.origami-usa.org).
</P>
<P>
   Members of OrigamiUSA, a national group with headquarters at the
American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, create the origami
tree that decorates the museum's lobby every holiday season.
Volunteers are on hand to show children how to fold.
</P>
<P>
   The OrigamiUSA site contains a calendar for the group's Folding
Sundays, which are usually held on the fourth Sunday of the month
from 1 to 4 p.m. at the museum. A large shopping section offers
books, videos, kits and special paper, including one kind that
glows in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Other extensive regional sites are those for the Chicago Area
Origami Society (www.suba.com/blonnie/chaos.html) and the Bay Area
Rapid Folders in San Francisco (www.krmusic.com/barf.htm).
</P>
<P>
   The British Origami Society (www.rpmrecords.co.uk/bos) lists
meetings around England and also runs a sale and exchange board
under the heading Adverts. Most of the requests are from people
seeking out-of-print origami books.
</P>
<P>
   Origami.com is operated by Alex Barber, who has a section
entitled Folders on the Net, with e-mail addresses of nearly 400
origami fans plus a form for signing up to be added to the list
(origami.com). Paperfolding.com, run by Eric Andersen, includes a
detailed history of origami and links to several discussion groups
and to an origami e-mail list (paperfolding.com).
</P>
<P>
   A unique site at web.merrimack.edu/thull belongs to Tom Hull, a
math professor at Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass. He
focuses on the geometry of origami, which becomes apparent in the
pattern of creases when a figure is unfolded. Hull's site includes
a comprehensive origami-math bibliography, links to other
origami-math sites and instructions for making challenging figures
like ``five intersecting tetrahedra.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to OrigamiUSA, two other large sites sell origami
materials by mail. Kim's Crane Origami Supplies, at
www.kimscrane.com, lets people search the online catalog by
category as well as by word. A search for ``dinosaur'' turned up 10
items, including ``Dinosaurs and Fellows,'' an $11 book in English
and Hungarian, which shows how to fold 22 prehistoric figures. (The
author, Peter Budai _ as Wu's site notes _ was 12 when his first
books were published, in 1993.)
</P>
<P>
   The retail site Fascinating Folds (fascinating-folds.com)
features special categories, like materials for beginners and books
in several languages. The site offers things like foot-long dollar
bills, 50 for $6.95, that are, of course, proportional to the real
thing. These are used for ``money folds,'' also called `dollar
folds'' or ``bill folds'' _ shapes made from greenbacks, often
featuring George Washington's portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's site links to sites dealing with money folds and other
origami topics. These include paper airplanes, origami
tessellations (geometric patterns made from a single sheet of
paper), unit or modular origami (simple shapes assembled into more
intricate ones) and wet folding (a technique using damp paper).
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of sites by origami enthusiasts, who post
whatever diagrams, articles and arcana strike their fancy. At the
Mark's Origami Olio site (www.eskimo.com/marmonk/origami.htm), Mark
Morden has a section on origami in the funny pages. In a
``Peanuts'' strip, Charlie Brown stands on a pitcher's mound in a
downpour, surrounded by paper sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   And Janet Hamilton has compiled an extensive list of origami
references in the news and entertainment media. (It is posted in
the Information section on Wu's site.) She recounts an episode of
``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' in which students learn to fold
napkins. Later, one girl tries to impress a football player by
folding a napkin into a bird. He's oblivious, of course, and ends
up using the napkin to wipe his mouth.

COURT'S DECISION IN VERMONT CASE COULD AFFECT LAWSUIT AGAINST TEXAS
HOSPITAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in a
Vermont case that might make or break a nurse's whistle-blower
lawsuit against Houston's St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Riley, a nurse in the hospital's heart-transplant unit,
claims the facility conspired to defraud the federal Medicare
program by unnecessarily admitting patients and needlessly
upgrading the level of services. Riley sued St. Luke's in 1994
under the federal False Claims Act, which permits private citizens
to sue companies on the U.S. government's behalf to recover
ill-gotten gains owed to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
this month blocked Riley's lawsuit from proceeding, ruling that
whistle-blowers who have suffered no direct harm from the alleged
fraud have no standing to sue under the Constitution. The U.S.
government, on whose behalf whistle-blower lawsuits are filed, may
sue because it has sustained an injury, the alleged fraud, the 5th
Circuit ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, for reasons it has not disclosed, has
chosen not to intervene in Riley's lawsuit against St. Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's attorney, Jim Perdue Jr. of Houston, appealed the
panel's decision to the full 5th Circuit, which has agreed to hear
the case the week of Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But, in an unusual turn of events, the Supreme Court on Friday
told the parties in an unrelated False Claims Act case from Vermont
to address a question like the one pending before the 5th Circuit:
``Does a private person have standing ... to litigate claims of
fraud upon the government?''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision on that issue, expected by July, could have
serious ramifications for Riley's lawsuit against St. Luke's. A
ruling that private people have standing would contradict the 5th
Circuit and resurrect Riley's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who gave no explanation for adding the standing
question, told the Vermont whistle-blower and the state agency
being accused of fraud to submit by Tuesday afternoon legal briefs
to the court addressing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Perdue, Riley's attorney, said he suspects the justices added
the question to the Vermont case to allow them to express their
disagreement with the 5th Circuit's decision. The 5th Circuit's
ruling marked the first time an appellate court has held that
whistle-blowers may not sue on behalf of the United States, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any coincidence that it came (just) four
days after the 5th Circuit's decision,'' Perdue said, referring to
the high court's question regarding standing.
</P>
<P>
   Judges can address the issue of standing, that is whether a
person has a legal basis for suing in the first place, at anytime.
Hence, it is not without precedent that the justices have told
parties to a case to argue the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But it is rare for the high court to ask litigants to submit
additional briefs in a case it has already scheduled for argument.
</P>
<P>
   Perdue said he will not file a brief with the justices in the
Vermont case, opting instead to focus his energy on preparing his
argument on Riley's behalf before the 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Perdue's brief in that case is due Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Luke's attorney, L. Boyd Smith Jr. of Houston, disputed
Perdue's theory that the justices raised the standing issue in an
effort to tell the 5th Circuit that its decision was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the Supreme Court has better things to do than seek
out opportunities to head off issues before one of the circuit
courts,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Perdue, Smith said he will focus not on the high court but
on his pending arguments before the full 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hands are full'' in trying to meet a Jan. 3 deadline for
filing briefs with the circuit court, he added. ``We'll be spending
the Christmas holiday reading the Constitution.``
</P>
<P>
   Under the False Claims Act's ``qui tam'' provisions, a private
citizen may sue a company receiving federal funds, even if the U.S.
government decides not to pursue the case. Companies found liable
for defrauding the government can be ordered to pay up to three
times the amount of their fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The citizen, who sues on behalf of the federal government, is
entitled to up to 30 percent of the court's award, with the rest
going to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The act's supporters say it allows the attorney general to
maximize Justice Department resources by not requiring her staff to
file suit for every perceived violation of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had agreed to hear the Vermont case to address
whether states are subject to liability under the False Claims Act.
The justices also said they would use the case to decide if states
can in fact can be sued in light of their general constitutional
immunity from lawsuits for money damages.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources nor
whistle-blower Jonathan Stevens addressed the question of standing
in their initial briefs to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit against St. Luke's, Riley says she can prove that
hospital officials allowed an unlicensed doctor to practice
medicine as part of a scheme to defraud the government on Medicare
claims.
</P>
<P>
   She also alleges that officials conspired to move
heart-transplant patients to intensive-care units sooner than
necessary, thus inflating hospital profits.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt of Houston dismissed the
lawsuit in 1997, saying Riley was an uninjured party with no
standing to recover government money that has been lost to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit panel agreed in a 2-1 decision Nov. 15.

TURKEY, TEXAS, POP. 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURKEY, Texas _ A full-body turkey costume, complete from feet
to wattle, is uncomfortable to wear, particularly on a hot evening
when not a breeze stirs the nearly empty streets of this Panhandle
town.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, owner of the bed and breakfast Hotel Turkey, had
just bought the turkey costume in Amarillo, 100 miles north, in
anticipation of the CBS camera crew that had called to say it would
be arriving to film a segment about Turkey, Texas, to air on ``Late
Night With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson put on the turkey costume to surprise the
``Letterman'' crew. He waited in the lobby of the 1927-vintage
Hotel Turkey. And he waited. And waited. The crew was late. He
couldn't sit because of the tail feathers. Johnson paced the
parlor, which is decorated in Victorian frill, punctuated with a
few mementos of Turkey's famous native son, western swing king Bob
Wills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, also a Turkey native, said some folks in town didn't
believe that Letterman's crew would show up.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Turkey for you. About half the 500 Turkey residents
believe that the cotton-and-peanut farming town will someday be
known as a tourist destination, partly because of its western swing
music heritage, partly because of its wonderful name, and partly
because of its proximity to Caprock Canyons State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The other half aren't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and frustrated, Johnson took off the turkey suit. Will
Turkey's fortunes ever change?
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Biff Henderson and the ``Letterman'' crew
pulled up, ready for two days of filming for a few-minutes-long
segment that aired Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson now says he should have known the crew would show. He's
one of the believers who are working to change the future of this
town abandoned by two-thirds of its population in the 1950s after
the railroad quit running on the Estelline-to-Lubbock spur and
after farming became the province of only those with thousands of
acres. A generation of farm children left for work in the cities.
Roofs fell in on Main Street. Henderson told the nation on
``Letterman'' that Turkey is one sleepy little town.
</P>
<P>
   A few plucky folks are working to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the justice of the peace, and his wife, Suzie, the
mayor, host an annual reservations-only Thanksgiving dinner for
more than 100 paying guests at Hotel Turkey. Oftentimes, the meals
are interrupted by telephone calls from radio talk show hosts from
around the nation who want to have a Thanksgiving-Day chat about
the quaint life in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, son of Clema Johnson, who ran a Turkey beauty shop for
more than 70 years, cutting hair and giving perms until she was in
her 90s, can tell them this:
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys still roost in the cottonwood trees along the
creeks, and they mingle with cattle herds, trying to steal the
feed. Cotton and peanut and sweet potato and watermelon farmers
still gather at the Turkey Cafe and Drive-In at the intersection of
Texas 86 and 70, where they talk about crop-dusting, road paving
and rattlesnakes that refuse to die, no matter how many times you
run over them with a pickup. Those snakes just sink into the red
dirt of the unpaved farm roads and manage to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Farms still flourish. Trucks _ sometimes 20 a day _ have been
leaving the peanut harvest in recent weeks, each hauling 50,000
pounds of peanuts to distributors who ship them out as seed or
edible peanuts for candy. Hershey's is a big buyer of Turkey
peanuts, according to the weekly newspaper ``The Valley Tribune''
of Quitaque, another small town down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The farms are far larger than they used to be, and there are far
fewer of them, said Tom Eudy, who retired after 47 years raising
cotton. And farm owners require far fewer workers than they did
some 40 years ago, when Turkey was a bustling center that drew
crowds to The Gem movie theater and the drugstore on Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Gem has been closed for about 40 years. Lawana Cruse and her
sister-in-law, Marie Cruse, bought it for $10,000 four years ago, a
high price tag in a town with buildings that sometimes sell for
about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters-in-law persuaded the Turkey Volunteer Fire
Department to bring two pump trucks to the theater and hose out 35
years' worth of Panhandle dust from the interior. The Cruses have
been successfully applying for grants and renovating the theater
for use as a performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Lawana Cruse also wants to open a museum of local farming
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good museum for Bob Wills, but we also ought to have
a museum to honor the people who stayed and worked,'' Lawana Cruse
said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of economic development, fiddle player Bob Wills is
Turkey's real cash crop. Born March 6, 1905, in Turkey, Wills
learned how to barber at Ham's Barbershop, which is still operating
after 88 years as a family business on Main Street. Wills went on
to form the band sponsored by Fort Worth's Burris Flour Mills, the
Light Crust Doughboys, and then the Texas Playboys. Wills moved to
Fort Worth in 1963 and died there in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Bob Wills Foundation puts on Jim Bob Wills Days the
last Saturday of every April. For two weeks, the town is packed
with the recreational vehicles of 10,000 or so western swing fans
and bands that play in the music festival, watch the parade and
attend the annual barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder why so many come, what with the dust and
wind,'' says Wilma Eudy, wife of Tom Eudy.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also raises money for community projects, including
the purchase of the old Turkey High School _ former home of the
Turks _ and elementary school, both abandoned in the 1970s for lack
of students. The schools now house City Hall and the Bob Wills
Museum. The museum is Turkey's main year-round attraction. In
October, 50 visitors had signed the guest book. They came from
Texas but also Missouri, Kansas, Alabama, Michigan, Ohio, New
Mexico, Nevada and California to see the hometown of the man known
for ``San Antonio Rose, Faded Love'' and other classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people do want to see Turkey grow, but I like it like
it is,'' says museum volunteer Lorene Setliff, a third-generation
Turkey resident. ``It's quiet and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, there's plenty of turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The old schools also house a community center where each year
for the past 20 years, the Turkey Proud Committee has put together
a Turkey turkey dinner the Sunday before Thanksgiving. About 200 to
300 people are served.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baptists bring the salads, the Church of Christ brings the
mashed potatoes and the Methodists bring something else. The
foundation brings the turkey,'' Gary Johnson says. ``Then everyone
eats until they run out of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson donned his turkey costume for the ``Letterman'' crew
before they left the bed and breakfast. The camera was packed by
the time he got the wattle and tail feathers on and straight, but
that's OK with Johnson. He knows he has a lot of promoting to do,
and that turkey costume is bound to come in handy.

`LEGEND' TAKES A HO-HUM MUSICAL JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through The Legend of 1900 is a scene that appears to
have crossed over from another movie. The title character _ yes,
his name is 1900, a good sign that this movie will have its cloying
moments _ engages in a piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, the
self-proclaimed founder of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The duel is plotted like points on a graph; you not only know
how it will end, but you have a pretty good idea of the steps it
will take to get there. But it's filmed with such vigor and flair
that although it may be predictable, it's a lot of fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of The Legend of 1900 isn't so much fun. As much as the
piano duel moves, the rest of the movie meanders. During the
Depression, down-and-out trumpeter Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince,
narrating with perhaps more world-weariness than is necessary)
hocks his horn but asks the pawnbroker to let him play it one last
time. When the shopkeeper recognizes the rare, melancholy tune, Max
begins telling him the legend of 1900, Max's best buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that 1900 was born _ or at least abandoned as a baby _
on a cruise ship and raised by one of the ship's workers (Bill
Nunn), who named the tyke for the year in which he was born. The
turn-of-the-century tot grows into a piano prodigy, playing as if
he'd been studying all his life. He grows further into Tim Roth,
who downplays his usual snottiness to play the role with a more
wistful touch. Until he's an adult, 1900 never even thinks about
setting foot on land, which becomes a key plot point after 1900
meets an attractive young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Director Giuseppe Tornatore _ who has yet to match Cinema
Paradiso, his wonderful breakthrough film from about a decade ago _
adapted this story from a monologue by an Italian novelist. He
supplies it with an elegiac beauty, helped in no small part by a
winsome Ennio Morricone score (for some, reason enough to see the
film) and Lajos Koltai's empathic cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clarence Williams III's haughty-then-humbled Morton
leaves the scene, the movie's energy departs with him, although
Roth does his best to keep it flowing. Tornatore calls The Legend
of 1900 a fable, but it turns out to be sentimental much ado about
not very much.
</P>
<P>
   The Legend of 1900 is rated R for language.

`FLAWLESS' LOOKS LIKE A VERY ROUGH DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can tell why Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman
wanted to be in ``Flawless.'' Their roles _ an ultraconservative
former security guard recovering from a stroke and a morose but
flamboyant drag queen, respectively _ are the type that whisper
``Oscar nominations'' before the ink dries on the screenplay. It
doesn't matter that the ink dried before this was a fully formed
movie.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro's character, Walt Koontz, appears to have picked his
shabby apartment building because it houses everything he loathes,
especially a group of drag queens who love to taunt Koontz because
of his homophobia. When thugs attack one of Koontz's neighbors, he
tries to come to her rescue but suffers a stroke before he can
prevent her slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Koontz's rehabilitation includes singing lessons as voice
therapy, and who better to give the lessons than the mother hen of
the drag queens, Rusty Zimmerman? Rusty, played by Hoffman, was a
friend of the woman Koontz couldn't save. You don't need a
screenwriting degree to know that Koontz and Rusty bond, although
it's a rocky road.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro is typically meticulous (he even designed special shoes
and arm weights to help him mimic the effects of the stroke) and
the result is a mixed blessing. His performance is all technical,
obscuring the character's soul. De Niro has done a lot of good work
in the past few years _ ``Wag the Dog, Jackie Brown,'' even
``Analyze This'' _ without having to resort to such devices.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for Hoffman, who appears to be channeling
William Hurt in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' right down to the
wounded musicality of his voice. In ``Boogie Nights'' and
especially ``Happiness,'' Hoffman _ one of our most interesting
young actors _ made us care about some dislikable characters. Here,
he's trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Joel Schumacher gives the movie a moody look,
with lots of help from cinematographer Declan Quinn and production
designer Jan Roelfs. But he doesn't seem to have known what story
he wanted to tell. Consequently, ``Flawless'' is a hodgepodge: part
buddy movie, part disease-of-the-week movie, part gay serio-comedy,
part crime drama. By trying to make it all of the above, Schumacher
has made it none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawless'''' is rated R for language and violence.

 By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We grow accustomed to the Dark/When Light is put away,'' wrote
Emily Dickinson, one of John Dugdale's favorite poets, in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale sat, seemingly entranced by the glow from a fire lapping
in the grate one afternoon last week. Auburn leaves were scampering
past a window of the austerely beautiful blue parlor at Lockwood
Farm, his 18th-century retreat in Ulster County, N.Y., but he could
not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale, 39, a fine art photographer who lost almost all his
sight following an AIDS-related stroke six years ago, has much to
celebrate this Thanksgiving. Last Friday evening in Manhattan, he
attended the packed opening of an exhibition of his recent still
lifes, nudes and portraits, which runs through Jan. 9 at the Wessel
&AMP; O'Connor Gallery. (Seventeen of the 65 pictures sold went to
Elton John, a Dugdale collector.)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Dugdale will have the pleasure of welcoming his
family, who have stood by him during his harrowing odyssey, to
their first Thanksgiving at Lockwood Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I love this house so much is that it has given me a
purpose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning to roast chestnuts in the fireplace then paint my
mother, sister and brother with cyanotype chemicals and watch them
turn blue,'' he joked, alluding to the signature azure tint of his
photographs, whose vintage allure derives from an obscure process
invented by Sir John Herschel, the 19th-century British philosopher
and astronomer.
</P>
<P>
   A deep affinity for the spare rural aesthetic and customs of the
mid-19th century informs the life and work of Dugdale, who recalled
being aghast at the monstrous sea of shag carpeting, linoleum,
Formica and venetian blinds that greeted him when he first visited
the house, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was completely entombed in hideousness,'' Dugdale said.
``But the location, surrounded by cornfields, was wonderful. And I
knew that if I stripped it to its bare bones, the house could be
beautiful.'' Taking on a $110,000 mortgage with money scraped
together working as a waiter, he purchased the ramshackle farmhouse
and barn with 12 arable acres in 1983 and attacked the house ``with
a crowbar and hammer and went berserk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the coal furnace gave up the ghost three days later,
Dugdale installed a forced hot air system whose 20th-century hum so
offended him that he ripped out the boiler: he traded it for a
moth-eaten but splendid 19th-century wing chair. Relishing the
spartan thrill of making do with two modest wood stoves to heat the
14-room house, he discovered that few friends were willing to join
him for freezing winter weekends at Lockwood Farm during the eight
years he lived there in its unfurnaced state.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the spring and summer, visitors were puzzled by
Dugdale's decision to extract every electrical wire and light
fitting from the house because he preferred the more authentic glow
of kerosene lamps and candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a despot about what I like and what I surround myself
with,'' he admitted. ``Even as a child, I felt I was born in the
wrong century. Plastic gives me hives and modern design leaves me
cold. But the simplicity of rural America between 1820 and 1840
slays me.''
</P>
<P>
   Offended by the presence of the 1950s windows, he replaced them
with 19th-century frames he painstakingly reglazed with pieces of
antique glass found in local junkyards. ``I'm a maniac for wavy
glass,'' he said of the windowpanes in the cozy basement kitchen
that appear to sag with age.
</P>
<P>
   When a relative of a previous owner offered him photographs of
Lockwood Farm from 1880, showing a porch that had long since
vanished, Dugdale faithfully recreated it, along with its
traditional carved acorns, symbols of thrift. Slowly, he began
adorning the house with treasures, including a rectangular 1856
Chickering piano for the blue parlor (a gift from a neighbor) and
the results of many happy hours of scavenging _ a beautiful old
sink discovered amid straw in a friend's barn, an ever-expanding
collection of pink lusterware and blue Davenport china, housed in a
rustic peeled-paint cupboard in the basement dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Working for several years as a successful commercial
photographer (the only plastic object to be found at Lockwood Farm
is the salad spinner he shot for his first assignment, in 1983),
Dugdale and his dog, Juno, happily divided their time between an
apartment in Manhattan and Ulster County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I named him after a Currier &AMP; Ives print I have called `Juno:
A Celebrated Pointer,''' Dugdale said. ``He's actually a springer,
but never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's rural idyll was interrupted in 1993 when he developed
AIDS, along with a grim opportunistic miscellany including cancer,
viral meningitis, several bouts of viral pneumonia and a stroke
that left him deaf in one ear and coincided with cytomegalovirus
retinitis, which deprived him of all of his vision in one eye and
80 percent in the other. All this took place within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the hospital, what kept me going was thinking
what I'd do to the house,'' Dugdale recalled. ``I paced the
property daily in my mind, determined to finish what I'd started,
convincing myself that I was the only one who knew what had to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   After a wrenching year away that included a seven-month stint in
St. Vincent's hospital in Manhattan, Dugdale returned for an
emotional visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was just as I left it,'' he said. ``My teacup on
the desk, the newspaper on the kitchen table, my pajamas on the
bed.'' The house was unaltered, but he was profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back almost blind, walking with a cane,'' he recalled.
``My sister, Kathleen, who's my best friend, was so patient. I
said: `I have to leave. It's too sad.' But she kept bringing me
back here, and slowly I began to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   He dug a deep grave for the cast-iron bed in which he had
endured five terrifying bouts of viral pneumonia that brought him
close to death. ``I buried that bed in the yard so no one would
ever have to sleep in it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale hired Lynn Snow, a local craftswoman, to paint every
second step in the narrow stairway leading from the basement to the
front hall a dark shade of gray in order to help him distinguish it
from the existing white steps. Also heeding the danger, with his
impaired sight, of knocking over those kerosene lamps, Dugdale
broke down and had the place rewired, installing 1890s Thomas
Edison carbon filament light bulbs he found in a theatrical prop
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my sight, they look like blurry fireflies,'' he said,
admiring a bulb dangling from the ceiling in the front hall that
casts an antique glow over a valuable 14-foot-long ochre-colored
parson's bench he purchased in pieces from a homeless vendor on
Houston Street for $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lamps are ideal for me because they don't create a
glare,'' he explained, noting that the bulbs also last for 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally succumbing to his mother's pleas that he install a
heating system, Dugdale bought a quiet furnace that now warms a
collection of vintage cast-iron radiators he had accumulated from
junkyards all over Ulster County. (In deference to her, he also
installed a telephone, concealing it in an antique closet in the
kitchen.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TURKEY, Texas _ A full-body turkey costume, complete from feet
to wattle, is uncomfortable to wear, particularly on a hot evening
when not a breeze stirs the nearly empty streets of this Panhandle
town.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, owner of the bed and breakfast Hotel Turkey, had
just bought the turkey costume in Amarillo, 100 miles north, in
anticipation of the CBS camera crew that had called to say it would
be arriving to film a segment about Turkey, Texas, to air on ``Late
Night With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson put on the turkey costume to surprise the
``Letterman'' crew. He waited in the lobby of the 1927-vintage
Hotel Turkey. And he waited. And waited. The crew was late. He
couldn't sit because of the tail feathers. Johnson paced the
parlor, which is decorated in Victorian frill, punctuated with a
few mementos of Turkey's famous native son, western swing king Bob
Wills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, also a Turkey native, said some folks in town didn't
believe that Letterman's crew would show up.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Turkey for you. About half the 500 Turkey residents
believe that the cotton-and-peanut farming town will someday be
known as a tourist destination, partly because of its western swing
music heritage, partly because of its wonderful name, and partly
because of its proximity to Caprock Canyons State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The other half aren't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and frustrated, Johnson took off the turkey suit. Will
Turkey's fortunes ever change?
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Biff Henderson and the ``Letterman'' crew
pulled up, ready for two days of filming for a few-minutes-long
segment that aired Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson now says he should have known the crew would show. He's
one of the believers who are working to change the future of this
town abandoned by two-thirds of its population in the 1950s after
the railroad quit running on the Estelline-to-Lubbock spur and
after farming became the province of only those with thousands of
acres. A generation of farm children left for work in the cities.
Roofs fell in on Main Street. Henderson told the nation on
``Letterman'' that Turkey is one sleepy little town.
</P>
<P>
   A few plucky folks are working to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the justice of the peace, and his wife, Suzie, the
mayor, host an annual reservations-only Thanksgiving dinner for
more than 100 paying guests at Hotel Turkey. Oftentimes, the meals
are interrupted by telephone calls from radio talk show hosts from
around the nation who want to have a Thanksgiving-Day chat about
the quaint life in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, son of Clema Johnson, who ran a Turkey beauty shop for
more than 70 years, cutting hair and giving perms until she was in
her 90s, can tell them this:
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys still roost in the cottonwood trees along the
creeks, and they mingle with cattle herds, trying to steal the
feed. Cotton and peanut and sweet potato and watermelon farmers
still gather at the Turkey Cafe and Drive-In at the intersection of
Texas 86 and 70, where they talk about crop-dusting, road paving
and rattlesnakes that refuse to die, no matter how many times you
run over them with a pickup. Those snakes just sink into the red
dirt of the unpaved farm roads and manage to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Farms still flourish. Trucks _ sometimes 20 a day _ have been
leaving the peanut harvest in recent weeks, each hauling 50,000
pounds of peanuts to distributors who ship them out as seed or
edible peanuts for candy. Hershey's is a big buyer of Turkey
peanuts, according to the weekly newspaper ``The Valley Tribune''
of Quitaque, another small town down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The farms are far larger than they used to be, and there are far
fewer of them, said Tom Eudy, who retired after 47 years raising
cotton. And farm owners require far fewer workers than they did
some 40 years ago, when Turkey was a bustling center that drew
crowds to The Gem movie theater and the drugstore on Saturday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Gem has been closed for about 40 years. Lawana Cruse and her
sister-in-law, Marie Cruse, bought it for $10,000 four years ago, a
high price tag in a town with buildings that sometimes sell for
about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters-in-law persuaded the Turkey Volunteer Fire
Department to bring two pump trucks to the theater and hose out 35
years' worth of Panhandle dust from the interior. The Cruses have
been successfully applying for grants and renovating the theater
for use as a performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Lawana Cruse also wants to open a museum of local farming
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good museum for Bob Wills, but we also ought to have
a museum to honor the people who stayed and worked,'' Lawana Cruse
said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of economic development, fiddle player Bob Wills is
Turkey's real cash crop. Born March 6, 1905, in Turkey, Wills
learned how to barber at Ham's Barbershop, which is still operating
after 88 years as a family business on Main Street. Wills went on
to form the band sponsored by Fort Worth's Burris Flour Mills, the
Light Crust Doughboys, and then the Texas Playboys. Wills moved to
Fort Worth in 1963 and died there in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Bob Wills Foundation puts on Jim Bob Wills Days the
last Saturday of every April. For two weeks, the town is packed
with the recreational vehicles of 10,000 or so western swing fans
and bands that play in the music festival, watch the parade and
attend the annual barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder why so many come, what with the dust and
wind,'' says Wilma Eudy, wife of Tom Eudy.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also raises money for community projects, including
the purchase of the old Turkey High School _ former home of the
Turks _ and elementary school, both abandoned in the 1970s for lack
of students. The schools now house City Hall and the Bob Wills
Museum. The museum is Turkey's main year-round attraction. In
October, 50 visitors had signed the guest book. They came from
Texas but also Missouri, Kansas, Alabama, Michigan, Ohio, New
Mexico, Nevada and California to see the hometown of the man known
for ``San Antonio Rose, Faded Love'' and other classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people do want to see Turkey grow, but I like it like
it is,'' says museum volunteer Lorene Setliff, a third-generation
Turkey resident. ``It's quiet and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, there's plenty of turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The old schools also house a community center where each year
for the past 20 years, the Turkey Proud Committee has put together
a Turkey turkey dinner the Sunday before Thanksgiving. About 200 to
300 people are served.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baptists bring the salads, the Church of Christ brings the
mashed potatoes and the Methodists bring something else. The
foundation brings the turkey,'' Gary Johnson says. ``Then everyone
eats until they run out of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson donned his turkey costume for the ``Letterman'' crew
before they left the bed and breakfast. The camera was packed by
the time he got the wattle and tail feathers on and straight, but
that's OK with Johnson. He knows he has a lot of promoting to do,
and that turkey costume is bound to come in handy.

   In Manhattan, Dugdale was obliged to make similar 20th-century
adjustments. His apartment, which doubles as his photographic
studio, is the top floor of an 1828 town house on a picturesque
tree-lined street in Greenwich Village. To the consternation of his
landlord, Dugdale had ripped out old electrical wiring and relied
on candlelight, adding his favorite 1890s light bulbs and new
wiring when it became necessary.
</P>
<P>
   His passion for historical authenticity occasionally exasperates
even his most ardent supporters. ``When John disappeared off to
some obscure school in Massachusetts to learn how to construct an
19th-century fireplace for his studio I really thought he'd lost
it,'' said John Wessel, who, with his partner. Billy O'Connor, gave
Dugdale an exhibition at their Chelsea gallery, Wessel &AMP; O'Connor,
after his stroke in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day John came into the gallery, peering at photographs
with a magnifying glass,'' O'Connor recalled. ``He explained to us
what he had been through and asked if we would give him a show.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to take a risk. ``A torrent of ideas came pouring
out,'' O'Connor recalled. ``For John, this was clearly another
chance at life.'' The work was full of lyrical images inspired by
his intense experiences in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Dugdale has had 38 exhibitions on four continents,
with framed prints selling for between $800 and $2,500. ``I've been
so blessed since this dismal thing that happened with my sight,''
he said. ``It means I'm able to complete projects on my house,
which makes me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a sense of composition honed during his years as
commercial photographer, he conceives of a picture first of all in
his mind's eye. Fortuitously, the obscure cyanotype process Dugdale
had been experimenting with before his illness turned out to be the
safest method for an artist who could no longer tolerate toxic
modern photographic chemicals. The results have mysterious hue of
architectural blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   To capture his images, Dugdale usually uses a large, unwieldy
wooden-framed 19th century camera that dominates a corner of his
high-ceilinged studio. To gather inspiration, he listens to books
on tape from Recording for the Blind: he is a a passionate devourer
of the writings of Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau and Emily
Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the Darkness alters / Or something in the sight /
Adjusts itself to Midnight / And Life steps almost straight,'' she
wrote in a poem that accompanies the current exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale is happy to say his health has been excellent for the
last four years, thanks in part to the protease inhibitors he takes
daily.
</P>
<P>
   He showed off a prized possession, an upright piano given to him
by the performance artist John Kelly, an old friend who informed
him that it had previously belonged to Lypsinka, the legendary drag
performer, and Robert LaFosse, the New York City ballet dancer.
``How's that for a provenance?'' Dugdale said, laughing, before
launching into a Bach toccatta.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the determined Dugdale has only learned to play the
piano since losing his vision. ``I'm not able to read sheet music,
but I can play eight minuets, one prelude and one toccata by
Bach,'' he said. He learns by listening intently as his piano
teacher, Fernando Torm-Toha, plays for him, then he retraces with
his own hands the notes he has just heard.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner in his honor at a friend's SoHo loft following the
opening of his exhibition, Dugdale was coaxed into an impromptu
concert. It was the first time he had performed before an audience.
After a tentative solo, Dugdale began accompanying Kelly, who sang
``Ave Maria.'' More than a few piano notes were mangled, but tears
began to stream down the face of Dugdale's mother, Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's wonderful?'' Mrs. Dugdale said afterwards.
``My son never gave up hope.''

AS SEQUELS GO, ``TS2'' IS WORTHY SUCCESSOR

   With 1995's ``Toy Story,'' Walt Disney Pictures had a number of
hurdles to clear: A collaboration with a new company, Pixar
Animation Studios. A director, John Lasseter, whose only experience
to that point was with short subjects (albeit Oscar-winning ones).
And, most challenging of all, the task of bringing warmth and
character to computer animation, a medium long known for its
detachment and sterility.
</P>
<P>
   The results were stunning and wildly successful, leaving the
inevitable sequel, ``Toy Story 2,'' only one major hurdle _ namely
competing with ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the followup may not be as good as the original _ a
feat that's nearly impossible considering ``Toy Story's'' stunning
innovations, not to mention its first-of-its-kind status _ Part Two
comes about as close to besting its predecessor as any sequel in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly from an animation standpoint, ``Toy Story 2'' is
light-years beyond the technical capabilities of Part One. Pixar's
``A Bug's Life'' seemed like an unbelievable technical marvel, and
``Toy Story 2'' does it one better. The film's colors, use of
light, tactile textures and inventive camera work overcome the
restrictions of live-action movies and add a hyper-reality absent
in cell animation.
</P>
<P>
   The story picks up where the original left off. Spaceman action
figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and cowboy pull-string toy Woody
(Tom Hanks), along with the rest of the toys, have adapted nicely
to the household's new dachshund. But when a garage sale threatens
to do away with one of the toys, it's Woody to the rescue.
Unfortunately, he's stolen by Al (Wayne Knight), an unscrupulous
collector and toy-store owner who recognizes Woody as the final
missing piece of an elaborate collection of spinoff merchandise
from an old marionette TV show called ``Woody's Roundup.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Woody had his own TV posse, including his trusty horse
Bullseye, his gal pal Jessie (Joan Cusack) and his sidekick, Stinky
Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer). Al plans to ship the whole
kit and caboodle to a Japanese toy museum unless Buzz and the gang
can find their way across town in time to save Woody.
</P>
<P>
   The entire ``Toy Story'' toy box returns with Mr. Potato Head
(Don Rickles); Slinky Dog (Jim Varney); Rex (Wallace Shawn); and
Hamm (John Ratzenberger), along with a few new faces. They include
Mrs. Potato Head (Seinfeld's Estelle Harris); a squeaky penguin toy
called Wheezy (Joe Ranft); Emperor Zurg (Andrew Stanton), a
hilarious new outerspace supervillain to challenge Buzz; and, of
course, Barbie (Jodi Benson). After Mattel refused to allow Barbie
to appear in the first movie, it's easy to see why they were
clamoring to be involved with the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``Toy Story 2'' avoids solely cashing in on the
best bits of the first film, and the familiar references that do
appear (the Pizza Planet delivery truck makes a brief appearance)
seem like surprises instead of contrivances. It also fires so many
in-jokes, one-liners and subtle movie references (from ``The Empire
Strikes Back'' to ``Jurassic Park)'') that repeated visits are
essential.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Toy Story's'' message was aimed more at teaching kids to
take care of their toys, the sequel chews on something a little
more meaty _ when kids outgrow their toys. When Jessie sings to
Woody (Sarah McLachlan's heart-tugging song ``When She Loved Me'')
about carefree days spent with her little girl owner _ until she
was donated to charity with that girl's other childish things _
there will be nary a dry eye in the house. And doggone it if this
movie doesn't make you feel guilty for every toy with which you
ever parted ways. It makes you want to leave the theater and rush
home to play.
Toy Story 2 4 stars (on a scale of 5) Director: John Lasseter

THE END DOESN'T COME FAST ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like a great idea for a comedy: Arnold Schwarzenegger
vs. Satan. At the very least, like a sequel to the Jesus/Santa
Claus death match from the ``South Park'' pilot. (Imagine, the
devil squaring off against Schwarzenegger's muscle-bound waddle.)
But, no, ``End of Days'' is as serious as a heart attack, and twice
as in need of life support.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing an ex-cop named Jack, as he did in ``Last
Action Hero,'' Schwarzenegger plays an ex-cop named Jericho. That,
and the fact that he's unshaven, makes this role a real stretch for
the action star. He's suffering a crisis of faith because his wife
and daughter were killed. At the beginning of the film, as New York
prepares for the New Year, Jericho is suicidal. In other words,
it's like the first ``Lethal Weapon,'' except that Jericho works
for some super security agency. It's the kinda place the Terminator
would retire to, armed with stealth helicopters and projectile
launchers. (He's a complicated man, Jericho; he's suicidal and yet
wears a bulletproof vest.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Days'' takes place over three days and seems to occur in real
time. Satan occupies the body of Gabriel Byrne, who's conveniently
wearing all black. The Man, as he's called, has to consummate a
union with a young girl, Christine (Robin Tunney), and sire a child
in the last hour of the year. Jericho and his partner (Kevin
Pollak, playing the sacrificial comic relief) get involved and try
to stop Satan from getting his groove on, which will mean the end
of life as we know it, etc., if it takes place. Y'know, the ``End
of Days.'' Although, based on the lack of sunlight in the movie, it
looks like the end of days has already happened.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything remarkable about ``Days,'' it's that it's
like a thousand other movies. It's cobbled together like a ransom
note from pieces of other B-movies. (The only way to keep yourself
involved, in lieu of actual drama, is to tick off the influences.)
Director Peter Hyams gives much of the film the look of ``Seven,''
which is fast on its way to becoming the most influential _ that
is, copied _ thriller of the past few years. Byrne, the guy who was
not Keyser Soze in ``The Usual Suspects,'' plays the devil. Pollak
was also in ``Suspects,'' and in addition, ``Days'' features a
character saying ``Satan's greatest trick was convincing Man he
didn't exist'' _ a line right out of ``Suspects.'' And Satan's
Party Central, filled with worshippers and candles _ apparently,
the devil doesn't find overhead lighting flattering _ looks like
the set of a Korn video.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Schwarzenegger try a serious role is like watching Fred
Flintstone star in ``The Iceman Cometh.'' As Jericho tries to wrap
his mouth around the biblical prophecy, you may be reminded of his
first turn as Conan the Barbarian, where he talked about
slaughtering men and hearing ``der lamentations of dair vimmen.''
He's supposed to be a sufferer, and, in the painfully cheap irony
of the movie, a man of no faith who has to battle the ultimate
evil. But his plight is overexplained _ like the prologue that sets
up the movie, showing the birth of Christine and a pack of devil
worshippers spilling the blood of a rattlesnake over the newborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Days'' sets up rules only to violate them. Byrne's performance
consists mostly of smirking over corpses. And Tunney does the
crying and running required of a young woman in danger. The most
original thing about the movie is, when the inevitable 666 is
invoked, it turns out to have been a typo. You may find yourself
running home to scan the Bible, if only to see if it warns against
movies like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' is rated R for baroque and plentiful violence,
including a crucifixion and adult language and subject matter. &QL;

<P>
   A county judge in Seattle has raised eyebrows among civil
liberties groups by applying anti-harassment law to the realm of
cyberspace. Last week, as part of a restraining order, the judge
barred a man from posting messages to a public newsgroup.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Scott Abraham, was accused of threatening another
newsgroup participant, David Hobbs, on an online bulletin board
called rec.skiing.alpine. The source of the dispute is unclear _
some reports suggest that it started over a squabble about ski
passes. But messages lingering in the newsgroup's archives show
that whatever the root of the problem, the electronic exchanges did
get nasty: Vicious messages, from Abraham and from others acting
anonymously, were riddled with veiled threats to take up arms or
commit assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham has denied threatening Hobbs and says that he is the one
who has been threatened. But on Friday, at Hobbs' request, Judge
Pro Tempore Marcine Anderson of King County District Court issued a
restraining order against Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   The order is a three-page form, filled out and signed. Added to
it, in longhand, are the judge's words: ``Respondent is further
restrained from making or responding to postings at the Internet
site rec.skiing.alpine either directly or indirectly, in person or
through others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some civil rights groups say that those words are the equivalent
of barring Abraham from speaking freely in a public forum. ``It's
too broad,'' said Tara Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. To halt Abraham from sending messages about his
accusers is one thing, Ms. Lemmey said. ``But what if he wanted to
talk about skiing?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham was not available for comment, but a friend who has come
to his defense, Bert Hoff, said that Abraham had not decided
whether to appeal the order. The Washington office of the American
Civil Liberties Union is also reviewing the case.

   One of the more memorable events in the history of Thanksgiving
occurred in Stockbridge, Mass., on Nov. 25, 1965, when Arlo Guthrie
dumped trash where he wasn't supposed to (the town dump having been
closed for the holiday). Guthrie was arrested the next day for
littering, and the arrest and its ramifications were immortalized
in Guthrie's 18-minute song, ``Alice's Restaurant Massacree.''
</P>
<P>
   The playing of that song has become a Thanksgiving tradition at
some radio stations. Anyone wishing to sing along should visit
Guthrie's official home page, www.arlo.net, where the lyrics
(``transcript'' might be a better word) are available.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a chat room, a concert schedule, and photographs
and news of Guthrie and his fans. There is also a link to the
Guthrie Center, an interfaith foundation in the former church where
Alice (whose last name was Brock) lived with her husband, Ray.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the site would not be complete without viewing the
tribute to William J. Obanhein, otherwise known as Officer Obie,
the man who put the handcuffs on Guthrie.

   Could That Be a Human Voice Coming Out of the Computer?
</P>
<P>
   Text-to-speech technology has been around for nearly 20 years as
a way for the blind to use computers. What has been elusive has
been the ability to make the computer voice sound human rather than
tinny and robotic.
</P>
<P>
   Lernout &AMP; Hauspie recently demonstrated its solution to that
problem, RealSpeak, at a trade show in Manhattan. Lernout &AMP; Hauspie
contends that the program is the first commercially available
text-to-speech product that sounds human and will run on a standard
PC or laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of interest in using the product on
PC's,'' said Pam Ravesi, senior director of product development at
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, ``and we've been working hard to downsize the
program and compress it so that it can run on a standard Pentium
machine.'' One major application for RealSpeak on PC's will
probably be the translation of documents from one language to
another.
</P>
<P>
   RealSpeak for the PC will be available before the end of the
year. The first version will be in American English, followed by
versions in German, French and Italian. The system is not perfect;
there can still be slight variations in tone and inflection that
remind you that the voice is generated by a computer.

   Putting a Multimedia Spin On the Ordinary Business Card
</P>
<P>
   At the Comdex computer show in Las Vegas last week, one of the
hot items was business cards. Not ordinary cards, but CD-ROM's cut
to the size of business cards.
</P>
<P>
   The cards, which are made by several companies and cost about
$1.25 each, depending upon quantity, have a label that can feature
a company logo, a person's name and title, and all the other
information on the typical business card. But they also function as
CD-ROM's and can contain up to 100 megabytes of multimedia data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see these cards as a great tool for introducing our
product,'' said a user, Reba Rosenbluth, vice president of
marketing for One Voice Technologies of San Diego. Ms. Rosenbluth
said the CD-ROM cards were effective because people considered them
to be novelties.
</P>
<P>
   While the business-card size will be most common, BizNetCard,
one of the manufacturers, was displaying a heart-shaped disc. The
reason that CD-ROM's can be cut to odd shapes is that data is read
from the center outward. A data area that is a half-inch wide can
hold 40 megabytes of information, enough space for product photos
or demonstration versions of software.

   PC's Are Adopting New Shapes, One Just a Bit Too Familiar
</P>
<P>
   After Apple's iMac broke the ``any color as long as it's beige''
and ``any shape as long as it's a box'' molds, personal computer
makers have been showing off odd-shaped and colorful computers.
</P>
<P>
   There were a spate of them at Comdex, the big computer industry
trade show, in Las Vegas last week. Advanced Micro Devices was
showing a new design, called EasyNow, which looks like the
cross-section of a football and features a flip-top CD drive. PC
manufacturers are starting to produce systems based on the design,
under license from AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Intel persuaded a number of top design firms to come up with PC
designs for its new line of motherboards, which are intended for
family and specialty PC use.
</P>
<P>
   The unqualified hit was the Ottoman PC from Sozo Designs of
Burlingame, Calif. The all-in-one unit looks like an ottoman when
it is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when the lid is opened to reveal the monitor, the
unit resembles something else.
</P>
<P>
   The whispered question that circulated among some of the more
than 200,000 Comdex attendees was, ``Have you seen the toilet seat
PC?''

   For Online Buyers, It's Caveat Emptor
</P>
<P>
   If you believe all the television commercials, online shopping
will be an effortless and satisfying experience this holiday
season. But a couple of recent reports suggest that dealing with
Web-based stores can be anything but.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted by Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research company, at least 40 percent of retail Web sites did not
respond to e-mail requests for help. Another survey, which polled
consumer agencies, showed that many Internet-based shops had
disappointed and angered customers by sending goods late or not
shipping them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are worse than in earlier years, analysts say. In
the third quarter of 1998, the Jupiter survey found, only 28
percent of Web retailers failed to respond to e-mail requests that
had been sent, anonymously, from Jupiter researchers. And the
National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, which based
its conclusions on data collected through the end of 1998, said
that the number of complaints related to Internet transactions or
Internet service had increased by 39 percent since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter found a gulf between the companies that are ready for
the holiday rush and those that aren't. Of 25 online shops the
company tested, 15 responded to e-mail messages within one day,
while 10 took longer than five days to respond. (Among 100 Web
sites outside retail sales, 46 percent failed to respond to e-mail
requests.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems encountered by consumer agencies went much
further than a lack of response to e-mail. Wendy Weinberg, a
spokeswoman for the national consumer group, said that people had
complained about undisclosed shipping charges, packages that
arrived weeks later than expected and purchases that turned out to
be fraudulent. She advises people to look for traces of the
nonvirtual world before pulling out the credit card: ``At least
check if there is a phone number listed on the Web site first,''
she said.

<P>
   It is not difficult to attach an exhaust vent to a clothes
dryer, but the hookup must be done properly to avoid the
possibility of fire. According to the National Fire Protection
Association, almost 14,000 fires each year are caused by improper
venting of the dryer or careless maintenance procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Before hooking up a vent line to your dryer read the owners
manual. This will outline the steps for installing the vent, but
beware, because some of guidelines may not meet code requirements
in your community. A few manuals, for example, say that it is
acceptable to vent the dryer indoors if it is in a large, open
room.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons this is not a good idea. In the first
place, most codes prohibit this type of venting. Second, the
average load of wash from the washing machine will retain about one
to two gallons of water after the final cycle. The dryer pulls that
moisture from the clothes and expels it into the air as vapor. This
extra humidity will eventually condense on insulation, timbers and
metal, causing them to deteriorate, rot or rust. Also, venting a
gas dryer indoors can be dangerous because the air discharge can
contain a combination of potentially lethal combustion gases.
</P>
<P>
   Dryer manuals specify the diameter of the ducting to be used for
venting. Most dryers have a four-inch diameter male take-off
fitting on the back of the appliance. Attach a duct of the same
diameter to this fitting. Using duct with a narrower diameter would
restrict the airflow. Using a wider duct would diminish the force
of the airflow and allow lint to settle at the bottom of the duct
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Codes are often strict about the length of a dryer vent. Most
codes limit a straight run, without bends, to 25 feet. Subtract
five feet from that distance for each 90-degree bend. Thus a dryer
vent with two 90-degree elbows cannot exceed 15 feet in length. The
type and size of the vent hood at the end of the duct also affects
the total length. The standard vent hood that has a four-inch and
will not affect the length of the duct run. If, however, you
substitute a hood with a narrower two-and-a-half-inch reach you
must subtract six feet from the length of the total duct. Thus the
15-foot dryer vent in the previous example would now be shortened
to 9 feet if a two-and-a-half-inch hood were attached.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even with a hood the duct is still an open hole that
could prove inviting for small rodents, birds or insects. Some
homeowners place a piece of screening across the opening to keep
out pests. The problem with screening is that it captures lint and
restricts the airflow. This could cause the dryer to overheat
during operation. It is better to install a back-draft damper
(available at home centers and appliance supply stores) in the
duct. The damper has a spring-controlled flap that remains shut
until the force of the dryer air pushes it open.
</P>
<P>
   Duct material includes flexible vinyl, flexible Mylar foil,
flexible aluminum and rigid aluminum. Flexible vinyl was once
popular as a ducting material, but now many codes prohibit using it
and foil for dryer ducts. The main problem with using flexible
ducting is that the ridges throughout the length of the duct catch
lint. These accumulations of lint will block the airflow so the
duct must be cleaned periodically. This is not a problem with rigid
aluminum ducts. For this reason rigid aluminum ducts, not flexible
ones, should be used if the duct is to be enclosed in a wall or
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now matter what type of ducting material you use, the sections
should be joined end to end with either approved clamps or tape.
There are two types of duct clamp available. One is all metal and
it looks like a large hose clamp for a washing machine or
automotive radiator hose. The other type of clamp is made of
flexible plastic. Both are available at home centers.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the familiar gray fabric duct tape or metal foil
tape to join sections. Fabric tape is cheaper than metal foil tape
but not as durable. The hot air passing through the duct will cause
it to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you use clamps or tape is largely a matter of
preference. Do not, however, use sheet metal screws or pop rivets
to joint sections of duct. These would snag lint and pose a fire
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   All dryer ducts should be inspected and cleaned at least twice a
year. This may require disconnecting a section or two so you can
look inside and vacuum out lint accumulations. Afterward,
reassemble the sections then check all the connections to make sure
they are secure.

`DOUBLE DOWN' AND `24/7': WINNING BOOKS ABOUT LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do people gamble compulsively? Frederick and Steven
Barthelme, both writers and teachers at the University of Southern
Mississippi, offer some answers to this question _ relating to
greed, companionship, a need to compensate for loss, a sense of
pride, guilt feelings, desire for punishment and a dozen other
complex motives _ in their eloquent, astutely observed memoir,
``Double Down: Reflections on Gambling and Loss,'' in which, they
write, ``Days and nights have been compressed, talk has been
approximated, names have been changed.''
</P>
<P>
   From hard experience, they know whereof they speak. Both having
settled in Hattiesburg, Miss., by 1995, they began to make
late-night forays to the casinos in Gulfport and Biloxi, ``playing
on paychecks, our tiny savings accounts, credit card advances'' and
losing ``everything we could get our hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995 and 1996 their parents died, ``one after another in
quick succession,'' as they put it, and they began to gamble more
and harder, working their way through their quarter-million-dollar
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went and we played and we lost,'' they write. ``We had
hope, but the hope was groundless and we lost. We had plans,
strategies, though not very well constructed nor very well carried
out and we lost. The only thing we did that would have made our
father proud was that we did not give up, we never threw up our
hands and said we can't do this. We never really quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way they write of casino ambiance: the games they
played, the cards they were dealt, the people who dealt them and
the nature of their own addiction, which they always felt they
could break if the going got too rough, just as they had broken
previous addictions, like cigarettes and alcohol. They write
wittily of being Barthelmes, the children of a fiercely protective
mother and an overachieving, emotionally distant father: the
younger siblings of three writers, Donald, the well-known
short-story writer, who died of cancer in 1989; Joan, a
public-relations vice president of Pennzoil Corp.; and Pete, a
Houston advertising executive and an author of mystery novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``As card-carrying Barthelmes we believed two things,'' they
write, ``although neither provided adequate emotional cover: first,
that we could `understand' things and thus tame them, and second,
that words, adroitly deployed, were a bullfighter's cape _ they
allowed you to step aside and avoid the horns of a threatening
experience. It helped to have something smart to say, though that
wasn't essential, since it wasn't the quality of the thought that
was key, just that the thought was always there, between you and
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the morning of Nov. 11, 1996, their play at the Grand
Casino, in Gulfport, was interrupted by security officers, and they
were asked to leave the premises. Later they were indicted and
charged with felony conspiracy to defraud the casino by purportedly
conniving with a card dealer to have her signal them when she had
dealt herself a blackjack, or 21. As they waited for their case to
come to trial, they gambled and lost money with even greater
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, in a different place and under happier
circumstances, Andres Martinez, a lapsed lawyer and newspaper
reporter, persuaded a book publisher to advance him $50,000 to
gamble with in Las Vegas and then write a book about it. This put
him in the wake of the late playwright Jack Richardson, who in the
1970s researched and wrote his harrowing ``Memoir of a Gambler''
(1979) under similar conditions. (Judging from its absence from
Martinez's bibliography, one assumes he is unaware of Richardson's
book.)
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book is ``24/7: Living It Up and Doubling Down in
the New Las Vegas,'' the numerals here referring the hours in the
day and the days in the week that most businesses in the city are
open for action. As Martinez makes his rounds in April 1998, he
reports on the unique places and people of America's fastest
growing city, from lavish casinos to threadbare strip-joints, from
the highest rollers to the most desperate members of Gamblers
Anonymous. All the while he reports on the condition of his nest
egg, which actually grows in fits of blackjack victories until
Martinez drops it in a final green-felt agon. The trouble is, his
own money is never up for grabs, so you never feel the deep
personal risk that is part of the true gambler's life.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the Barthelmes never escape that risk. Curiously they
devote the last episodes of ``Double Down'' to the terrors of being
booked and facing a trial and possible conviction, but they never
describe the relief of having a judge dismiss the charges against
them in August, an event that is mentioned only in their
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests what may be one of the deepest attractions of
gambling to them, namely living in a state of insecurity where you
don't know whether you are doomed or about to be redeemed. Or as
the Barthelmes themselves put it in their winning book about
losing: ``It is as good to lose as to win. There is only a shadow
of difference between them, and that shadow is insignificant.
Winning is better than losing, but neither one is the goal of
gambling, which is playing. Losing never feels like the worst part
of gambling. Quitting often does.''

ALISTAIR COOKE: A ONE-MAN BRIDGE FROM U.S. TO BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alistair Cooke was about to tuck into his lobster
bisque at the Carlyle the other day when a stranger stopped at the
table and said: ``You look familiar. Do I know you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Bob Hope,'' Cooke replied.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder backed off in confusion, and Cooke returned to his
soup, chuckling softly. ``I've used that since my TV days,'' he
said. ``Works every time. They know I'm not Hope, but they don't
know what else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 91, which he turned last week, Cooke always knows what
to say. He has been doing it, in print, on television and, most
important, on radio, for almost 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Americans know Alistair Cooke best from his nine seasons, from
1952 to 1961, as master of ceremonies on the pioneer cultural
television show ``Omnibus'' and from 1971 to 1992 as the elegant
host of ``Masterpiece Theater'' on public television.
</P>
<P>
   But in Britain, where he was born, and throughout much of the
rest of the world, he is known almost exclusively for his weekly
radio talk, ``Letter From America,'' which the BBC has beamed
everywhere but to the United States for more than 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 2,600 ``Letters,'' Cooke has touched on every
aspect of American life from major events like the civil rights
movement and the Vietnam War and the small but not so insignificant
happenings that help to illustrate who Americans are and how they
think.
</P>
<P>
   He has reported on everyone from Douglas Fairbanks to Monica
Lewinsky, in what more than one critic has called superb prose.
Here he is on the defeat of the great middleweight boxer Sugar Ray
Robinson at Madison Square Garden in 1962:
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was over, Sugar Ray flexed his calves for the last
time and did a little hobbling dance over to embrace the victor,
who was pink and sweaty and very happy, identifiable on the score
card as Denny Moyer of Portland, Ore., but on closer inspection was
that bearded figure with a scythe Sugar Ray had dreaded to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Americans, who cannot hear his broadcasts,
except on shortwave, Cooke has gathered many of his letters in
books. The newest, ``Memories of the Great and Good'' (Arcade
Publishing), a collection of 23 profiles, was published in October.
Its subjects range from George C. Marshall and Harold Ross to Erma
Bombeck, all originally served up for a British audience.
</P>
<P>
   Released simultaneously in Britain, the book is already in its
fourth printing and a No. 2 best seller there, trailing a book by
former Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke knew from the outset exactly what he wanted his broadcasts
to be. In a 1946 memo to the BBC proposing the program, he wrote:
``It will be a weekly personal letter to a Briton by the fireside.
I shall try to give him some of the intimate background to
Washington policy, some profiles of important Americans. The stress
will tend always to be on the springs of American life, whose
bubbles are the headlines, rather than on the headlines
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first ``Letter,'' which was broadcast on Sunday, March
24, 1946, Cooke has hewed fairly closely to his original brief. The
critic Bernard De Voto wrote that Cooke had ``acquired a feel for
American realities surer than that of most native-born writers''
and added, ``He has the continental awareness that comes only from
firsthand knowledge of all our regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to legend, the ``Letter'' has not been broadcast every
week since 1946, nor has it always come from the United States.
During its first decades it was off the air for as long as three
months a year, and even now it may be broadcast from London while
Cooke is there for Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   He has not, however, missed a week since 1966, even when
occasional illnesses have forced him to broadcast from his New York
apartment or from a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who has influenced his elegant prose style, Cooke
cites Mark Twain; H.L. Mencken, who was his friend and mentor; and
E.B. White. But he saves special praise for two scholars, historian
D.W. Brogan and Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, who taught him English
literature at Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brogan,'' Cooke once said, ``could give you the most recondite
sort of Harold Laskian analysis of something in government, but he
would cap it with an anecdote from James Farley or some precinct
captain or a lyric from Cole Porter. I think I realized from him
how it could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiller-Couch taught him about writing. ``I would turn in
something filled with high-flown phrases of which I was
inordinately proud,'' Cooke said. ``Q would cut them out. `Cooke,'
he once said to me, `you must learn to murder your darlings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mencken, with whom Cooke corresponded as a student and later
covered the 1948 presidential campaign, impressed upon him the
attractions of the journalist's trade. Cooke can still proudly
recite Mencken's observation that being a newspaper reporter
offered the opportunity to ``lay in all the worldly wisdom of a
police lieutenant, a bartender, a shyster lawyer and a midwife.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Alistair Cooke was born in Manchester in 1898, the son of
Samuel and Mary Elizabeth Byrne Cooke. His father was an ironworker
and a Methodist lay preacher, his mother an Irish immigrant. The
family moved to Blackpool, where the young Alfred won a scholarship
to Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   At Jesus College he edited a literary magazine, put on plays,
ground out film and theater criticism and pursued a rigorous social
life. He managed, too, to win a first in English and, in 1930, to
receive his degree summa cum laude.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was at Cambridge that Alfred Cooke, with his stolid accent of
the north and vague plans for a teacher's life, quietly
disappeared. In his place, his name legally changed, stood Alistair
Cooke, campus dynamo and newly minted sophisticate, with the
inflections of Mayfair and his eye on the main chance.
</P>
<P>
   He first came to the United States in 1932, on a two-year
fellowship to study theater direction. During his first summer, he
traveled around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, in the Depression,'' he later wrote, ``there was a
tremendous energy and vitality to America. From then on, my
interest in the theater began to wane, and I began to take up what
I felt was the real drama going on _ America itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The following summer he spent in Hollywood, collaborating with
Charlie Chaplin on a film about Napoleon. The film was abandoned,
but the experience led to a fascinating profile of Chaplin in
Cooke's 1977 book, ``Six Men.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 the BBC fired its drama critic, Oliver Baldwin, who was
Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's son, and Cooke, who had been
writing about film in the United States, got the job. After three
years in London, he returned to the United States for good,
becoming a citizen in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   After some precarious years of freelancing, he was hired by The
Manchester Guardian, now The Guardian, in 1945 to cover the
founding of the United Nations. Still stringing for the BBC at the
time, he spent nine weeks in San Francisco, filing 2,000 words a
day for The Guardian and doing two or three radio broadcasts every
night. He was to serve as a Guardian correspondent in this country
for the next 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   His coverage of the Alger Hiss trial in 1949 resulted in a book,
``Generation on Trial: U.S.A. vs. Alger Hiss'' (Knopf, 1950). In
The New Yorker, Richard Rovere called it ``one of the most vivid
and literate descriptions on an American political event that has
ever been written.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke's reporting in those days earned him a sobriquet that
still rankles. ``I was called `The Liberal Voice of America,''' he
said. ``I was not. I was and still am a reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, at least, he defines himself as ``a sort of
18th-century libertarian,'' but of the 11 presidents who have
served during his lifetime, his favorite was Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his political stance is better reflected by another man,
Adlai Stevenson. In ``Six Men,'' he compared him to ``that
estimable order of Americans _ Henry Clay, Robert E. Lee, Norman
Thomas, Learned Hand, perhaps Wendell Willkie _ who left a lasting
impression by the energy of their idealism but who were never quite
strong enough or ruthless enough, in the pit of the political
jungle, to turn goodness and mercy into law or policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote, ``Adlai Stevenson remains the liveliest reminder of
our time that there are admirable reasons for failing to be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   As he always has, Cooke bangs out his ``Letter,'' 1,700 or so
words on an old Royal manual typewriter. ``I call it free
association,'' he said. ``I don't correct anything. Then when I'm
finished, I slash hell out of it and get it down to about 13
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke and his wife, the portrait artist Jane White, divide their
time among an apartment on Fifth Avenue, where he does most of his
work; a summer home on the North Fork of Long Island; and trips to
London and San Francisco. Their daughter is a Congregational
minister who lives in Massachusetts. Cooke's son from his first
marriage lives in Wyoming and writes western novels. A stepson
grows wine grapes in California, and a stepdaughter lives in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to California to see my men friends,'' Cooke said.
``Everyone I once knew in New York is gone. Dr. Johnson once said,
`A man must repair his friendships.' And I'm afraid I didn't always
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like New York much anymore,'' he added. ``I loved it
when we were young. I was a denizen of the 52nd Street clubs, a
movie critic, a terrific night owl. Now I can't bear midtown
anymore. Noise is magnified when you're older; the drop of a fork
can be like the World Trade Center going off.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years Cooke lectured, usually at colleges and
universities, on what he calls ``a short list of American
humorists,'' from Mark Twain to Calvin Trillin. No longer. Age is
part of it, but also the fact, as he relates a bit sadly, that
``fewer and fewer people know who they are.''

LUDWIG BEMELMANS: A NEW FOCUS ON THE CREATOR OF A CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madeline must be the only famous French orphan born
in a tavern near Gramercy Park. It was there, 60 years ago, that
Ludwig Bemelmans, her creator, jotted on the back of a menu the
famous phrases, ``In an old house in Paris that was covered with
vines lived 12 little girls in two straight lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A plaque honoring Bemelmans, who died in 1962, was dedicated at
that bar, Pete's Tavern, in late September. The small crowd that
gathered for the occasion included his widow, Madeleine (known as
Mimi), and his daughter, Barbara, who were inspirations for
Madeline, and two of his three grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Madeline'' (pronounced MAD-a-line) was published in 1939,
it was an immediate success, becoming a Caldecott Honor book. Five
more Madeline books followed, forever sealing his identification
with the fearless young girl who was not afraid of mice.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bemelmans explained how her parents lived in the Hotel
Irving nearby and ate dinner at Pete's, ``oh, almost every night.''
She told of being bored and restless as the adults lingered over
coffee, liqueurs, cigarettes and cigars, and how at the age of 5 or
so she would wander off, ending up downstairs wrapped in an apron,
washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her early industriousness was inherited. Ludwig
Bemelmans, who was born in the Austrian Tyrol in 1898, was sent to
New York at 16 and went to work at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. He
stayed there intermittently, rising in the hierarchy to the
position of assistant manager and living luxuriously on the
premises until he left to become a professional artist just as the
Depression began.
</P>
<P>
   His facility in so many mediums, his extravagant ways and his
entrepreneurial instincts were both a strength and a curse. He
traveled ceaselessly on assignment for magazines and publishers,
writing 20 books for adults, including four novels and 16
children's books, always calling or cabling for money. Most of his
correspondence with the Viking Press, one of his principal
publishers, is on hotel stationery, postmarked from seemingly
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Victor Hammer of the Hammer Gallery developed
a steady source of income for Bemelmans, his client, by selling
random sketches and drawings as well as many of his completed
illustrations and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bemelmans, who lives on a horse farm in Three Rivers,
N.J., with her mother living nearby, said ruefully that ``talent
skips a generation.'' When the film rights to Madeline were sold a
dozen years ago to a company that is now a part of Disney, they
included merchandise rights that, her son James Ludwig Marciano
said, she blithely thought were ``balloons and T-shirts.'' There
are now more than 30 lines of franchised Madeline merchandise,
including a very successful line of dolls, made by Eden toys.
</P>
<P>
   Her three sons, however, have some of their grandfather's
entrepreneurial gifts. John Bemelmans Marciano's new books,
``Bemelmans: The Life and Art of Madeline's Creator,'' and
``Madeline in America: And Other Holiday Tales,'' can both be found
on Madeline.com, the Web site set up by his brother James. It was
James who bought the domain name for his mother and grandmother in
anticipation of rising interest in Madeline before the appearance
of the live-action Tri-Star movie in 1998. Already, he says, almost
10,000 parents have joined a Madeline fan club. Barbara Bemelmans'
third son, Paul Lorenzo Marciano, teaches philosophy at Davidson
College in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   James, 33, recently sold the Referit.com Web site, which creates
links to fulfillment agents like Amazon.com for products sold on
the Internet. He is also, he said, ``the guru of affiliate programs
for Webmasters,'' runs TheSquare.com, a Web site for Ivy League
graduates, as well as an online dating service for divorced people.
</P>
<P>
   John, 30, who studied art history and studio art at Columbia
College, spent months going through his grandfather's copious but
disorganized files, finding correspondence, notes, drafts and
corrections for the lavish book published by the Viking Press. Like
his mother, he chooses to be nearly oblivious to the Web site and
e-commerce, devoting himself to restoring and reviving Bemelmans on
the printed page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life and Art'' is a lavish volume including more than 400
examples of Bemelmans' work in an impressive range of mediums,
including comic strips, pen and ink sketches, watercolors, gouache
and finally, oil paintings. The oils are intensely colored,
abstracted views of New York City done in the late 1950s. They were
shown at the Museum of the City of New York in 1959 and have not
been displayed since.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig Bemelmans was an artist who made an art of recycling,
turning Madeline into other income-producing forms. A series of 15
Madeline murals he painted in the children's salon on Aristotle
Onassis' yacht Christina in 1953 will be sold at auction by
Sotheby's on Dec. 1; estimates for the group range from $200,000 to
340,000. (The original cover painting for ``Madeline'' was sold
this year at an auction for $131,000.) At the invitation of Stanley
Marcus, Bemelmans took Madeline, Miss Clavel and the other girls to
Texas for the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog in 1955, a story that
has been republished this fall as part of ``Madeline in America:
And Other Holiday Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   John signed up with Arthur A. Levine and Scholastic Press (the
editor and publisher of the Harry Potter books) to enlarge some
forgotten and out-of-print projects. For ``Madeline in America,''
he applied color gouache to his grandfather's drawings and added a
few new illustrations to the full text of the Neiman Marcus story.
</P>
<P>
   Bemelmans painted on landlocked walls as well, decorating what
is now known as the Bemelmans Bar at the Hotel Carlyle in exchange
for 18 months' free rent. (Sotheby's held a party in the bar last
week to promote interest in the Madeline murals. Girls in party
dresses drank Madeline cocktails: blueberry juice, sparkling apple
cider and grenadine, served in champagne flutes with a slice of
clementine.)
</P>
<P>
   The cover of ``Life and Art'' is a detail from the only oil
painting that includes Madeline. The little girl in her boater hat
and her dog, Genevieve, with a bow in her bangs are standing to one
side of a Parisian flower market, lush with lilies and other
blossoms. The original hangs in Mimi Bemelmans' bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   As lighthearted as the finished books and covers for The New
Yorker or Town &AMP; Country appeared, Bemelmans carefully researched
and drafted his prose and his pictures. Indeed, literally thousands
of sketches and several dummies went into each Madeline book. The
epigraph to the section of ``Life and Art'' explaining the process
is from a note Bemelmans sent his longtime editor, May Massee: ``We
are writing for Children but not for Idiots.''

PATRIOTS' DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR THE BEST, SWITZER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Barry Switzer is on the run these days _
managing his interest in four restaurants, spending time with two
younger children, and one grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Not too busy to defend Ernie Zampese, his friend and former
offensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, who has been accused
of the ``P'' word: predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' said Switzer, who led the Cowboys to a victory in
Super Bowl XXX with Zampese. ``When you're losing, you hear it. You
don't hear it from football people because they know better. You
hear it from people who have never played the game and people who
have never coached. That's who you hear it from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total (expletive). Everybody tries to put a word on why
you're failing at something. They think it can be labeled and once
you label it well you ought to be able to correct it. You correct
it on the football field. You work at it, practice it, do what you
have to do to get it back. You don't snap your fingers and it
appears again.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictability is a word Switzer hates to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best football teams I ever played against were
predictable,'' said Switzer, who won three national titles in his
16 years leading the Oklahoma Sooners. ``Let me give you an
example: Tom Osborne's Nebraska teams. Talk about predicatability.
You don't think I knew what was coming every time they had the
ball? Could I stop it? That was the challenge. If you execute
right, it doesn't matter how predictable you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzer, 62, is now out of the game and about to move back to
Norman, Okla., from Dallas. He said he watches the NFL, two years
after he was fired by Dallas owner Jerry Jones. He still pays close
attention to the people he considers friends in the league. He
watches the Cowboys, and keeps up with Zampese and the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched that game Sunday,'' said Switzer, referring to the
Patriots' 27-17 loss in Miami. ``You blame that on Ernie? How many
times did the quarterback get hit? How many times did he throw it
to the other team's player? If people are blaming Ernie, their
blame is misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole offense is designed to protect the quarterback.
Three-step dropback and make your reads, 1-2-3, and get rid of it.
You're supposed to avoid sacks by doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why does Bledsoe lead the league in knockdowns and sacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he's holding the ball too long or the receivers aren't
getting open,'' said Switzer. ``That's all correctable.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzer said he's angered by criticism of Zampese, as he was
when he was the Dallas head coach. Switzer and most of his staff
were fired following a 6-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man is one of the best offensive minds in the game,''
said Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer said that predictability comes when a team is having
problems on first down. If it can't move the ball on first down and
gain a good hunk of yards, then they become predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get third and long, you pass,'' said Switzer.
``Quarterbacks go back in the shotguns and they look to complete a
pass for first down. That's predictable. When a team has only one
back in the backfield, that's predictable. There are so many things
in this game that are predictable. Every team has things they do
even if they know the other team knows they're going to do them. If
there's a confidence in what you're doing, it doesn't matter if the
other team knows it's coming. You just execute it because you know
you're better than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Switzer-Zampese offense worked, it worked well enough
to win the Super Bowl after a stellar 1995 season. It was the
second year of the Zampese regime, and by then Troy Aikman, Michael
Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Co. had figured it all out. Aikman was
sacked only 19 times as the system worked with great precision.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Zampese system is out of sync. The pass routes are no
longer crisp and sure. Bledsoe is holding on to the ball far too
long. Zampese himself has lengethened the routes for whatever
reason. The 10-15-yard passes are now becoming 30-35 yards long.
</P>
<P>
   When coach Pete Carroll says the Patriots have to improve on
what they're doing and execute, it sounds hollow in the minds of
the fans. But that's the way football people think. That's the way
Switzer thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe in what you're doing and that your system
works,'' said Switzer. ``Ernie's system is proven. It's won a Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys system also had a huge offensive line that ran block
as well as anyone this decade. The running game was prevelant.
Balance was possible. But the Zampese system is built around
controlling the ball with short passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with executing our stuff,'' said Carroll. ``There
isn't a mystery here.''
</P>
<P>
   When the great Green Bay Packer teams were on top, everyone knew
what they were going to do, but nobody could stop them. It's an
attitude. It's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer said he misses some of the people in the game, but not
Jones, the Monday morning quarterback who made his last season in
Dallas miserable. Switzer says he still loves the game, but doesn't
expect to get back in unless someone makes a great case for why he
should.
</P>
<P>
   If he made a different decision in 1972, he might have been a
coach with the Patriots, and perhaps eventually the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chuck (Fairbanks) left Oklahoma, he asked me to go with
him to New England,'' said Switzer. ``I could have been the
backfield coach there and who knows what that would have led to.
But I told Chuck that I wanted to stay behind and have the chance
to be the head coach at Oklahoma. I never regretted that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he ever regret making Zampese his offensive coordinator.

WANT TO SKI FOR LESS? ASK MR. CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People complain about it, but no one does anything about it.
This Twainism may pertain to weather, but it also describes most
skiers' attitudes about lift ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone who hasn't gasped now and then at the sticker
shock at the ticket window? But has anyone ever tried to change it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, and you can just call him Mr. Cheap from Chester,
Vt., a guy who stockpiles cereal and Diet Coke by the case just to
take advantage of bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   How cheap is Chris Estes? Well, there was that discounted
shampoo he bought three years ago? He's still using the stuff. And
50 boxes of cereal? He got them for less than a buck a box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' says the 32-year-old former Killington ski bum, ``I
really am cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this have to do with skiing? For starters, in
this age of $50-plus tickets, Mr. Cheap feels it an offense to pay
more than $25 for a day on the lifts, and prefers $15.
</P>
<P>
   He sizes up advertised bargains such as New Hampshire's offer of
40 ski days for $995 at 17 state resorts, including some biggies _
Attitash/Bear Peak, Cannon, Loon, Waterville Valley, Bretton Woods,
and Sunapee. That's less than $25 per day. That, says Mr. Cheap, is
not a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a great deal. In fact, it's dangerously close to the
$30 mark at which point a price may not be included in Estes
newsletter called, what else: ``Ski Cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the price of a lift ticket at Stratton _ $59, and
that's just unreal. I would never pay that money to go skiing,''
says Estes, ``and there's no need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his driving passion to save money, Estes two years
ago began his newsletter, which is crammed full of money-saving
tips for skiers and boarders in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   As a ski bum at Killington for a few years, Estes, who now works
for Newsbank in Chester, became accustomed to the deals and free
skiing that area employees receive as perks. When he left
Killington for his new job, the very thought of paying for
expensive lift tickets was too painful to contemplate. ``I suddenly
had to pay and I don't like to pay for anything,'' says Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Vermont, he notes, necessitates learning to save
money, since wage scales are lower than in the areas from which
most skiers drive north on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many white collar jobs in Vermont,'' he says.
``To have a middle class existence here you have to be very
frugal.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, develop a business around the concept of frugality. Hence
the newsletter, which received about 2,000 inquiries last season
and 150 subscribers. A modest beginning, perhaps, but Estes still
firmly believes in his idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller resorts are places to find good deals,'' he says,
rattling some off from memory. ``For example, at Black you can get
a family ticket for four for 89 bucks. That's not too bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gunstock has (the same package) for $99, and at Shawnee, it's
$100. That's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but not nearly as cheap as Estes likes. ``I like to ski for
$15,'' he says, and has last year's figures to prove it. He skied
30 days and spent a total of $435. That's $14.50, right in Estes's
comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   With his driving interest in frugality, the newsletter was a
natural development. He charges $15 for a yearly subscription, and
lets folks see a couple of pages on his Web site:
www:ski-ridecheap.com.
</P>
<P>
   Estes will send out one free copy of his newsletter in hopes
that skiers/riders will quickly figure out that their $15 outlay
can be made up several times in one ski season.
</P>
<P>
   With his home computer, Estes does the writing, design, and
layout of his newsletter, and runs off about 750 copies at this
point. He hopes it will take off and hit at least 20 percent of the
50,000 New England subscribers to Ski Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for high ticket prices are easy to trace, says Estes.
The biggest expense is the cost of snowmaking. When he began skiing
in 1973, snowmaking was in its infancy compared with today's white
paved boulevards of manmade snow. For this, he praises ski areas,
despite his belief that the costs are just too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at skiing as a product,'' he says, ``it has really
changed. Everyone complains about the high cost of skiing, but
skiing is so much better than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But $59?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Mr. Cheap.'' No way. It's a good product, but it's
not worth $50 for a lift ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical headline in Ski Cheap gives such information teases
as: ``Probably the best deals of the season are the ski passes
offered by state ski associations that offer multiple tickets for
one price. See below . . . for four unbeatable statewide ski
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two elements in the psyche of Chris Estes seem to conflict,
making it his life's work, he says, to reconcile them: ``I love to
ski. I think people have to get out there as much as they can. But
I am really, really cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes's newsletter address is Ski Cheap/PO Box 429/Chester, VT
05143. Or respond to his website: www.ski-ridecheap.com.

AFTER THE DRAMA, A SHANGHAI `PEONY'? YES, WITH CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ _ One of the few predictable postscripts to
last year's drama over the blocking of a production of ``The Peony
Pavilion'' from a New York performance was that cultural officials
here would come up with their own version of the classic Chinese
opera. The Communist Party-approved ``Pavilion'' was recently
performed in a run-down auditorium here. It won few plaudits
outside the official press, and even in a relatively modest-size
performance hall plenty of seats remained empty.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the production of ``The Peony Pavilion'' that
finally reached New York's Lincoln Center Festival in July and won
praise for Chen Shi-Zheng's creative interpretation and inventive
staging, Shanghai's production was considered flat and lifeless by
many operagoers. At least there were efforts to spruce up the
presentation with rhinestone-studded gowns, flowery backdrops and
flashing lights, which offered an element of kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   It was presented in 30 scenes over three nights, for a total of
seven hours, notably shorter than the full 55-scene, 19-hour show
in New York. The Shanghai production did not have the asset of Qian
Yi, the actress who chose to perform her lead role of Du Liniang in
the New York version. Three pairs of actors performed the lead
roles on separate nights. After the furor on the eve of President
Clinton's visit to China in June 1998, when cultural officials
inexplicably blocked Chen's production, the tepid welcome that the
new version got here may have seemed to be just desserts.
</P>
<P>
   To many in the audience, the seeming weakness of Shanghai's
``Peony Pavilion'' epitomized what is wrong with the arts in China,
where artistic creativity seems to be smothered by the country's
vast bureaucracy, which determines what the public should be
allowed to see.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party officials might be expected to be on the lookout
for art that is politically subversive. This often inflexible
nature of Chinese officialdom can place a crushing burden on any
artist who attempts to come up with anything fresh or inventive.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider living here, one of China's enduring mysteries is
why the world's most populous nation, brimming with talent and
backed by an illustrious cultural history, should have made such a
relatively meager contribution to this century's art. For instance,
in the last 100 years, including the half century before the
Communist Party came to power, China has failed to produce its
share of internationally renowned writers, composers or painters.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers, on the other hand, although they battle Communist
bureaucrats as any other artists do, work in a relatively new art
form and are free from the constraints of ancient traditions. So
despite tight restrictions on what they can do, they have produced
an impressive array of world-class films in the last 15 years. But
in Chinese opera the burden of the past is heavy. A bevy of
cultural officials and critics and directors jealously guard that
art form ensuring that any new interpretation that would modernized
it is kept firmly at bay.
</P>
<P>
   It took an outsider with a special ability, Chen, with both the
education inside Chinese theater and the perspective of someone who
had lived and worked outside China for 10 years, to tackle a
complex classic like ``The Peony Pavilion'' with success. Drawn to
the work (which has stirred controversy since it was written in
1754 by Tang Xianzu), Chen wanted to stage it in its original full
form of 55 scenes, and he hoped to make it engaging and accessible
with an innovative staging.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chen's production rehearsed in China for a year with
the sole intention of performing outside China, cultural officials
became deeply irritated by his refusal to act as submissive as most
other directors in China.
</P>
<P>
   He ignored suggestions by officials about how to improve his
production, but the authorities showed him who was boss by blocking
the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company altogether. Officially, the
bureaucrats denounced Chen's version as feudal, pornographic and
superstitious, an odd thing to call an opera written in a feudal
and superstitious era and displaying no nudity. It was clear to
those involved in the production that Chen's bold creativity and
artistic intransigence were really at issue.
</P>
<P>
   Chen must take responsibility for failing to anticipate
bureaucratic obstacles to his production. When they arose, he could
have agreed to whatever the officials wanted to change, only to
shift it back once he got the company to New York. Instead, he
tried logic, pointing out that the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of
Culture had signed a contract with Lincoln Center, which had paid
for the entire production and had given him full artistic
discretion. Yet logic does not always work in politics. In this
case not even the risk of tarnishing President Clinton's reception
in China could deter the officials involved.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the adverse publicity generated by the incident, it
was embarrassing to China's culture czars that it took a director
from the United States to revive ``The Peony Pavilion'' in its full
form.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they immediately copied the idea and ordered the actors
Chen had worked with to participate. It apparently took months
before officials could find a director who was willing to take on
the project, and it was not hard to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals, both Ma Bomin, the director of the culture
bureau who carried out the decision to block last year's
production, and Shanghai's deputy mayor, Gong Xueping, offered
suggestions about what changes should be made to the staging.
Perhaps the greatest tragedy was for the performers themselves,
many of whom have spent a lifetime studying Kunqu Opera but were
denied a singular chance last year to perform a fresh
interpretation of a fragile and long-neglected work and to take it
to New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a rare, rare opportunity,'' said one of the actors
who participated, expressing admiration for Chen's version. ``It
tore my heart to lose it. But we live in China, and that's life in
China.''

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Jacksonville (No. 1) and Indianapolis (No. 2),
and a larger difference between Indianapolis (No. 2) and Seattle
(No. 3).
</P>
<P>

opponents do not include games against the ranked team.

CHANNELING THE SUN TO CREATE A PAINTING OF LIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCOKEEK, Md. _ Some houses are built around a view, some around
a hearth, some around the kitchen, but rare is the home predicated
on celestial events. In architectural history, the buildings that
channel sunlight are usually religious structures that materialize
light, as though the finger of God were making a divine point by
marking space at a designated time.
</P>
<P>
   At Josephine Withers' house in this forested area across the
Potomac River from Mount Vernon, the star of the show, for the six
months starting in September and ending in March, is the sun, which
peers in through the long, high clerestory windows on the south
side of her two-story living room and strikes coated glass and
mirrored metals suspended from the ceiling. The work, by Janet
Saad-Cook, sends back a ``light painting'' across the south wall.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, the angle of the sun makes the painting
flicker. By now, the painting is in full stride, fluttering as the
remaining leaves filter the sunlight. At the winter solstice, with
the leaves gone and the sun at its nadir, the chromatic apparitions
achieve full bloom. Then, over the following months, the show fades
and gradually expires.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Withers asked McInturff Architects of Bethesda, Md., to
design a modest, 1,500-square-foot house on a rural site in
Maryland, she spelled out her many requirements in a letter. She
wanted the house to follow feng shui principles; it should face and
frame the forest out back, with its oak, beech and holly, and it
should have a horizontality to complement the contours of the land.
</P>
<P>
   She stipulated its character _ informal, calm and serene _
without specifying any architectural style. In addition, she asked
the architects to collaborate with Ms. Saad-Cook, who works in
Arlington, Va., to create a wall that would serve as a canvas for a
projected light piece.
</P>
<P>
   The two women have been friends for many years, and Ms. Withers
has seen Ms. Saad-Cook's work evolve from 1970s sculptures composed
of gauze, bamboo reeds and sisal (earthy materials that interact
with direct sunlight) to work that uses light, itself. Ms.
Saad-Cook uses optical instruments to reflect, refract, split,
shape and throw light onto nearby surfaces in moving washes of
color.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tradition of using natural light to interact with a
space is ancient, Ms. Withers, an associate professor of art
history at the University of Maryland at College Park, places her
friend's work in a Modernist tradition. (Other contemporary light
artists include Robert Irwin, James Turrell and Doug Wheeler.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saad-Cook's shifting color fields set off chromatic events
that have a life of their own, the colors mixing unpredictably in
intensities that depend on the weather, time of day and angle. One
of Ms. Saad-Cook's pieces is at the Haystack Observatory outside
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always thinking about light in architecture _ that's
fundamental to our work,'' said Mark McInturff, the principal in
McInturff Architects. ``But we'd never worked with a light
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lawlor, the project architect, said that he and
McInturff first met Ms. Saad-Cook in her loft, where she bends
metal or glass reflectors and coats them with chemicals to absorb
or reflect light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole studio was devoted to tracking the movement of the
sun, with chalked notations traced all over the floor,'' he said.
``We were blown away. It looked like something out of Copernicus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saad-Cook has visited the great 18th-century observatories
in Jaipur and Delhi, India; the pyramids of Mexico; and the kivas
of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, to ponder their solar mysteries. In
India, she recalls being in a dark astronomical tower and seeing an
intense beam of light slipping off a curved table and shattering on
the floor. ``An unforgettable experience, right up there with
childbirth,'' said Ms. Saad-Cook, the mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Light, it's like a fickle lover. He's not there
when you need him; he's all over the place when it doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun drove decisions at Ms. Withers' bucolic 11-acre site.
``The sun told us approximately where the house wanted to be
located, because there was a clearing, and we needed southern
light,'' Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
   The architects sited the house in a clearing on a saddle sloping
down to two ravines and a stream, and worked with an astronomer,
Peter Boyce Sr., Ms. Saad-Cook's mentor. Boyce made a printout
showing architectural sections of the building and windows, and he
worked up a chart following the path of the sun to show what months
the sun would be active with respect to the proposed light piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Janet are really able to hash out anything,'' Lawlor
said. ``I remember a whole discussion about how a special gimbel
mount would maximize the amount of sun. He had one opinion, she had
the opposite, and it was a battle between art and science right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Withers' most demanding requirement was the cost. ``I
definitely had a budget,'' she said. The result was architectural
simplicity _ a two-story gabled structure as rudimentary as a
Monopoly-board house but split into halves spanned by a covered
bridging structure. The flat-roofed bridge is glazed on the north
side facing the forest, and is clad in corrugated metal on the
south side, where Ms. Saad-Cook's light piece is projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget encouraged us to keep the square footage down and
to minimize foundations, which led us to think of spanning from one
side of the house to the other,'' Lawlor said. The cost for the
house worked out to $100 a square foot, or $150,000, without road
and septic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it a `Case Study House' in inexpensive construction
on the drawings that we gave out to the contractors for bids,''
McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   The architects cut costs by deploying generic details and
materials, like asphalt shingle siding, Ikea cabinets and $8
exterior light fixtures used throughout the interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the two-story volume looks like a loft and acts like a
plaza between the two bookend structures, where two bedrooms and a
study are located. An interior bridge, whose rails act as a truss,
connects the two halves of the upper story. The architects designed
the two metal struts suspended from the ceiling, which hold up the
reflective instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplicity of the interior is disciplining me,'' said Ms.
Withers, who moved into the house last year after living in a
Victorian environment where clutter looked good. ``It did cross my
mind to move paintings onto the south wall during the other half of
the year, but now that I'm here, I like it plain.''
</P>
<P>
   The house has had a profound effect on her consciousness. ``It's
been cleansing to get rid of stuff,'' she said. ``It lightens me
up. I could cram it full of books, but I don't do that because this
house demands a cleanness. The house is speaking to me, and I'm
willing to submit to that discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides becoming more aware of the light, Ms. Withers says she
notices the forested setting because of the way the windows frame
the trees. ``Those are the gifts of the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sun drawing has become a local landmark: on sunny days
during the darker and colder months, neighbors bring friends to see
the south wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Withers was surprised by the first glimmerings of the sun
drawing in early September. ``I wasn't waiting for it,'' she said.
``It's ephemeral. You can't nail it on the wall, and yet it returns
tomorrow, it returns next year.'' Next September, she said, she
will be waiting.

THERE'S A NEW GAME IN CHICAGO _ DISNEYQUEST 
(ACCOMPANIED BY BC-TRAVEL-DISNEYQUEST-REVIEW-TEX)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A middle-aged ``hausfrau,'' speaking from a
wall-mounted television, implores us to ``Save the colonists!'' It
seems our merry band of tourists are the colonists' only hope.
</P>
<P>
   The universal mom figure has issued her orders. We all nod our
heads, lemmings prepared to do her bidding. She sends us into the
rescue ship simulator with a rousing, ``Now, let's go kick some
alien butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. I'm not really sure I know how to apply pedal-force to
the posterior of an alien's anatomy, but I'm confident that my
children do.
</P>
<P>
   The two teens are the reason we're spending a long weekend in
Chicago at DisneyQuest, the most recent device of the Walt Disney
Co. to separate indulgent parents from their dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This second location of DisneyQuest, an indoor interactive game
arcade, is packed with virtual reality games, simulated rides and
computer stations. It is Disney's answer to Sega GameWorks.
</P>
<P>
   But where DisneyQuests are heavily orchestrated to reflect
Disney films and family entertainment, GameWorks are thrill bars _
dark, raucous and filled with teens. At DisneyQuest, a virtual
reality game is Aladdin's Magic Carpet Ride; at GameWorks, it is a
simulation of hang-gliding. And where Sega likes to put its indoor
parks close to megaplex movie theaters, DisneyQuests can stand
alone. The Disney name is the draw.
</P>
<P>
   The family has spent many days and many dollars at various
Disney venues, and we've never been disappointed. And DisneyQuest
is a bargain in today's high-cost entertainment arena; all-day
passes that cost $34 each give you unlimited access to every
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Disney experiences, there is never a tear in the fabric
of the fantasy. The mechanics are always disguised. At DisneyQuest,
every nook, every mural, each and every wall, even the carpet, is
designed to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   I am enchanted by the staging. As I try to find a manufacturer's
name on the chairs that look just like the enchanted ones from
``Beauty and the Beast,'' my children remind me why we have come.
</P>
<P>
   We are here for the virtual reality games. We are willing to don
helmets that give us the profile of a platypus, just to
Ride-the-Comix. We use our light sabers to slash in huge lunging
sweeps, trying to rid the world of evil bikers. Well, everyone
except my daughter, who refuses to look silly. At 13, she is quite
sensitive about perceived dorkiness.
</P>
<P>
   This hypersensitivity to coolosity vs. dorkdom can mean success
or death in the business of family entertainment _ and it explains
a lot about the existence of DisneyQuest.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, my daughter thought she was Ariel, the little
mermaid. Thanks to Disney's movie, she wore Ariel clothes, slept on
Ariel sheets and jumped rope in Ariel-bedecked shoes. Her father
and I could predict the box-office business of each new Disney
release by my daughter's desire for the clothing (millions) or
matching accessories (double-digit millions).
</P>
<P>
   If she wanted the sheets, the movie was going to be really big.
</P>
<P>
   Then, abruptly pre-''Pocahontas,'' all things Disney became
``baby.'' This saves us some money _ not having to buy new linens
for each new animated film _ but it is a big problem for Disney and
its spinoff product lines. The Disney brand appeals to parents and
children. Preteens and teens are SO not interested.
</P>
<P>
   DisneyQuest appeals to this fickle audience with high-tech game
arcades. DisneyQuests also fill the geographic void between Japan
and France, Orlando and Anaheim. The Quests are quick Disney fixes
that can be scattered across the globe; 15 to 20 locations are
planned, though cities have not been named.
</P>
<P>
   The first DisneyQuest, in Orlando, Fla., was followed this
summer by the opening of the Chicago location, a block off the
heavily trafficked Michigan Avenue. Philadelphia will be the site
of the third park in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the full-scale theme parks that ramble over rural acres,
and take at least a full day to experience, DisneyQuests are built
in the inner city. The Chicago location is in a five-story downtown
building. Up to one thousand visitors are expected each day, but
only for a few hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Quick and changeable is the business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent theme-park rides are a huge investment, but
DisneyQuest games and virtual rides are meant to be impermanent.
About one-quarter of them will be changed each year so the company
can quickly respond to the transient interests of teens.
</P>
<P>
   On our visit, the design-your-own roller coaster was a big draw.
Standing in front of a computer screen at Cyber Space Mountain,
Michael, 15, and Katy, 13, choose from among a long list of coaster
thrills _ double loops, barrel rolls, jumps, spirals, camelbacks,
banked curves and high hills _ putting as many upchuck features as
possible in 10,000 feet of track.
</P>
<P>
   They climb aboard the simulator, a large tuna can built for two,
to test their design. I decline to enter what looks like a
claustrophobic vomitorium. Instead, I watch my children's
expressions on the video screen outside the capsule enclosure.
Their smiles and screams are recorded by a tiny video camera.
</P>
<P>
   The simulator operator, Christopher, assures me there are two
cut-off buttons, one inside the compartment, another outside. He
adds: ``I shut it down if I see their eyes roll back in their
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   I, too, design a coaster. It is nothing but a series of huge
hills. The computer informs me one out of five people would think
it scary. I refuse a trial ride. Which is perfectly OK, I explain
to the kids. There is no shame in knowing one's limitations and
tolerance for G-forces.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to save some face, I suggest we check out the Magic
Mirrors. This computer station will take a photo of your face, put
it on a monitor and allow you to manipulate your image. You can
twist and turn, nip and tuck, melt and wave, or rotate your face
into something funny. I opt for cosmetic surgery instead of comic
surgery. A little off the dewlaps, plump up the lips, enlarge the
eyes a tad, and VOILA, I look just like Carol Channing. Eeek.
</P>
<P>
   On to Living Easels, which is Disney Animation for Dummies.
Sitting in front of a monitor mounted in an easel, you pick from a
selection of lusciously rendered backgrounds and add animated
creatures and effects by simply touching the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the Stone Age background with the characters from the
Sweet Stuff page makes a surreal world of geysers, molten lava
fields, swooping pterodactyls and dancing gingerbread couples.
</P>
<P>
   This, beguilingly, was my chance to create a Disney-quality
piece of animation. To be honest, it has been prepackaged by Disney
artists, so it's already a Disney product. The results are
``Fantasia''-like, and I am thoroughly impressed with my facility
for animation.
</P>
<P>
   Too soon, my children come to drag me away. They want to play
the old games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old games?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, in the arcade they have Miss Pac Man,'' trills my
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Tron,'' adds my son in reverential tones.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that in only three decades we have come from binary,
black-and- white, back-and-forth Pong to the magnificent Living
Easels. Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The children wax me at each old game _ cars, motorcycles and
boats. They are ecstatic. I challenge them to Mighty Ducks Pinball
Slam, an interactive game in which you physically become the
pinball. It's an aerobic workout, and I ponder the possibilities of
combining Nautilus equipment with virtual gaming. The kids beat me
at this game too, by a huge margin. I plead weariness and slink
away to Food Quest, where I nurse my injured pride over a soda.
</P>
<P>
   Food is important at entertainment venues; it's the big
revenue-raiser. Gaming gurus say it's where Discovery Zone failed;
the indoor party-playgrounds bellied up this past summer, after two
bankruptcy reorganizations in as many years. They learned too late
what McDonald's learned early with Leaps and Bounds, a Discovery
Zone competitor _ the profits are in the pizza, not the entrance
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Disney enlisted the Cheesecake Factory, a very popular
California-based restaurant chain, to set up a cafeteria and a
sweet shop called Wonderland Cafe. The food stretches beyond
burgers. There are kid-pleasing cheese and PB&AMP;J sandwiches, plus
more exotic fare and wraps. Our bill for lunch comes to $23. And
that is the last penny I spend inside DisneyQuest.
</P>
<P>
   Disney expects us to stay a few hours. We log eight. Because we
are there on a weekday, one that is not a holiday for Chicago
schools, we have the place to ourselves for several hours. Many
times, if we want a second ride, we don't have to return to the
line, because there isn't one. By the time we leave at 7 that
evening, DisneyQuest is packed, and we have experienced our
favorite games and virtual reality rides three or four times. We
have heard that on weekend nights it can become unbearably crowded.
We leave with a smug look on our faces. We feel like our hours of
line-free playing were a glorious gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they build a DisneyQuest in our area, would you want to
go?'' I ask. The kids, in unison, make that indignant coughing
sound that indicates they are about to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uuh....... ye-ah.''

THE EVOLUTION OF GEORGE CARLIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' Regis Philbin
asked his contestant this brain-buster: Who was the very first
guest host on ``Saturday Night Live,'' in October 1975?
</P>
<P>
   George Carlin _ the host in question _ happened to be in front
of a TV, watching. ``The (expletive) didn't know the answer,''
Carlin chuckles. ``And his friend in Albany didn't get it, either.
But I kind of like it, that they didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that money was lost. The George Carlin who
schmoozed that long-ago NBC audience with his hippy-dippy
weatherman routine is barely recognizable in today's Carlin, whose
standup comedy is raw, edgy, angry.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin has been in show business for 43 years, and although he
first gained notoriety as a ``counterculture comic'' in the early
'70s, that particular Carlin was just a morph on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he riffs on religion, advertising, sex and society with a
palpable contempt for almost all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element in it of true anger, but there's an awful
lot of theatrical exaggeration,'' Carlin explains in a telephone
interview. ``So it's a bit of an adversarial and a confrontational
thing, and it plays as anger. I don't live angrily. I'm very
accessible to fans, I'm easygoing, I root for the little guy. I
defer to the least powerful person in the room, usually.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel positive and optimistic about my species and
my culture.''
</P>
<P>
   His verbal attacks, he explains, are ``intended to show
discontent, and to try to shame and embarrass the audience, as
members of the human race, as members of the United States culture,
for what they've done. And what they've allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, 62, is a native of New York City who never made it
through the ninth grade. He joined the Air Force in his late teens,
and it was during his hitch that he started developing his talent
for voices and mimicry. He became a disc jockey, and then a standup
comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Many years and mainstream TV appearances later, Carlin began to
resent the blandness of his time-tested material. He threw in with
the burgeoning counterculture, grew a beard and began writing and
performing more unconventional stuff, including jokes about
sexuality and casual drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he got fired from a prestigious Las Vegas hotel for
using the ``s'' word in his act. There was no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   America took him to its bosom through a series of appearances on
``The Flip Wilson Show'' in 1971. Wilson was co-owner of a record
label, Little David, which released in quick succession a series of
Carlin albums. They all went gold.
</P>
<P>
   He was a comedian like no other. One of his most famous bits was
called ``The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, of course, expanded the list, and by the time of his
first HBO special in 1977, he was too much for the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole structure had changed,'' he explains. ``And I had
completely outgrown it anyway, not just with the language I use,
but the kind of topics I choose.''
</P>
<P>
   His basic philosophy these days is that the world is hopelessly,
irredeemably screwed up. He doesn't say ``screwed,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be only standup comedy, and I know that, I'm not
ashamed of that,'' he says. ``But it's art. It's writing. It's
interpreting the world through your own prism, and that's the
writer's job. And a writer is an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my thoughts and ideas. Of course, it is rhetoric, so
there's a great deal of overstatement and exaggeration. You have to
paint with a broad brush in rhetoric and in comedy, not only to
make your point but to make it in an absurd way.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, he explains, is only natural. ``A person who's 20
years old, who sees a particular phenomenon in society, sees it
against a kind of thin backdrop,'' he says. ``But a person who's 65
has a long experience, and whatever it is they're seeing, the
comparison with what they already know is much richer. So their
conclusions can be richer and have more texture to them. I've been
lucky enough to live this long, and have my faculties, and whatever
I've done has just been through accumulating information on my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a far from perfect job. They say a self-made man is a
good example of unskilled labor, and that might be true of me, but
I'm very happy with the result of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, this self-made man and high school dropout sold
600,000 copies of a book of musings called ``Brain Droppings.'' The
book spent 18 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. A six-CD
box set of his Little David recordings has just been released. ``It
makes a wonderful First Communion gift,'' he says, with a winking
trace of the old Carlin charm.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin may be finding a new audience thanks to his appearance as
Cardinal Glick in the movie ``Dogma,'' which lampoons Catholicism
in much the same way Carlin himself has for years. In fact, the
comedian says, writer/director Kevin Smith created the role with
Carlin in mind. No one else was ever considered.

 &HT;    Sentimentality strikes a chord with readers
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Literary critics decry sentimentality, but apparently it sells.
How else can you explain the success of ``The Notebook'' and
``Message in a Bottle'' by Nicholas Sparks or ``The Christmas Box''
by Richard Paul Evans?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gentle books that help us feel things we haven't felt
in a while,'' said Evans, whose self-published story of a young
family that moves in with an elderly widow became a phenomenon four
years ago. Simon &AMP; Schuster paid $4.2 million for the hardback
rights, and Maureen O'Hara and Richard Thomas starred in the
made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years and 10 million copies of his books later, Evans
is back with ``The Looking Glass'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17.95),
another inspiring tear-jerker. Set in the 1850s Southwest, the
novel is the story of a reclusive gold prospector who still grieves
for his dead wife. All that changes when he meets a young woman who
has been brutally abused by her husband and attacked by ravenous
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   As melodramatic as Evans' plots sound, they touch a chord with
readers. ``They want to believe in the redemptive power of love,''
he said. ``At nearly every book signing for `The Christmas Box,'
people who have lost loved ones came up to me to say they had heard
of the healing power of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans says the books have changed him, too. A former advertising
executive intent on getting rich, the Salt Lake City father of five
found that success can bring problems. When he made millions from
``The Christmas Box,'' many of his friends and some of his family
members turned against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard lottery winners talk about this, but I didn't
believe it until it happened. In America, we love success but hate
the successful. Eventually most of our friends came back. They said
they distanced themselves because they thought I would change.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, for a time. But now the family has moved back into it's
old neighborhood into the small starter house. Evans also has
funded the Christmas Box House, an assessment center and shelter
for abused children in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exciting to be involved with this project,'' he
said. ``We wanted to show our children that you can do good with
money rather than letting it ruin your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans will sign books 4-6 p.m. Sunday at Hobbit Hall in Roswell
(120 Bulloch Ave., 770-587-0907), 6-8 p.m. Monday at Barnes &AMP; Noble
Booksellers in Morrow (1939 Mount Zion Road, 770-471-2227), noon
Tuesday at Chapter 11 Discount Bookstore (3509 Northside Parkway
N.W., 404-841-6338), and 7 p.m. Tuesday at Chapter 11 at Snellville
Plaza (2280 U.S. 78, 770-736-0502).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Millennium poll: J.R.R. Tolkien's ``The Lord of the Rings''
barely beat out Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind'' as the
favorite book of the millennium in an Amazon.com poll. Rounding out
the Top 10, in order, are: ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' by Harper Lee;
``The Catcher in the Rye'' by J.D. Salinger; ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone'' by J.K. Rowling; ``The Stand'' by Stephen King;
``Ulysses'' by James Joyce; ``Atlas Shrugged'' by Ayn Rand; ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' by John Steinbeck; and ``1984'' by George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Bible received the most votes, but since it wasn't
written in the past 1,000 years, it wasn't eligible. Amazon.com
received more than 250,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And more lists: Christopher Caldwell of Talk magazine used no
polls to compile the most talked-about books of the century. Maybe
that's why Tom Wolfe's ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and Jim
Bouton's ``Ball Four'' are lumped in with ``Ulysses'' and ``Lady
Chatterley's Lover.'' Caldwell justifies his choices by pointing
out that Bouton's book made Americans take a more realistic look at
sports heroes, while he describes ``Bonfire'' as ``the last big
novel everyone read.'' Other books included are: ``Introductory
Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' by Sigmund Freud; ``Invisible Man''
by Ralph Ellison; ``Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' and
``Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' by Alfred C. Kinsey;
``Eichmann in Jerusalem'' by Hannah Arendt; ``Quotations From
Chairman Mao'' by Mao Zedong; and ``The Bell Curve'' by Richard
Herrnstein and Charles Murray.

 &HT;    Tree trimming for the holidays
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas tree without ornaments is, well, just a a tree. Even
the gangliest evergreen can stand tall and proud when its boughs
are bedecked with jolly Santas and plump snowmen, some shiny red
balls, a crystal icicle or two and maybe a few silver bells.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything more fun than decorating the tree, it's
unpacking the boxes filled with the memories that each ornament
evokes. But maybe it's time to add a few baubles to your
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the '80s, interest in Christmas ornaments was
waning,'' says Kathy Cook, a home decor expert for Enesco Home
Gallery, ``but in the last part of this decade we've seen a renewed
attraction in them.''
</P>
<P>
   We're seeing more wonderful designs than ever before in gift
stores and Christmas shops around the area. We've gathered what we
consider some of the season's merriest ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   And we offer these ideas on collecting these special keepsakes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think of ornaments as collectibles. Either go for an eclectic
look or focus on one designer, such as Christopher Radko, Kurt S.
Adler or Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   And why put them up after the holidays? They'll be special
additions to your china cabinet or curio chest all year long.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Give ornaments as gifts. Start a tradition such as giving a
beloved child an ornament each year so that she will have an
impressive collection by the time she has her own tree to decorate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy ornaments (or souvenirs that can be adapted for use as an
ornament) when you go on vacation and hang them on the tree. Shells
make great decorations; just glue on a hanger.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy small toys to place on tree boughs. Little plastic horns,
tiny teddy bears and soft-stuffed dolls work well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hang ornaments in unexpected places: on a chandelier, on a
door wreath or pine bough or in a window, suggests Home Gallery's
Kathy Cook. Or group several in glass or silver bowls throughout
the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your hometown or favorite organization produces an annual
ornament, start collecting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you have more ornaments than you can cram on the tree, give
some of your extras to the kids to decorate a small tree for their
room or play space.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Place food-themed ornaments on a small tree for the kitchen.
We've seen candy canes, gingerbread people, tiny fruitcakes and
even blown-glass fruits and vegetables.
</P>

 &HT;    A civil town worthy of Norman Rockwell
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. _ If Norman Rockwell were around today and
looking for a perfect little Southern town to paint, he couldn't
find a better place than Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 20 miles from Nashville, Franklin is a Main Street
type of town built around a 15-block Victorian commercial district
with a towering statue of a Confederate soldier at its center.
</P>
<P>
   The town was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in the
Civil War _ the Battle of Franklin in 1864 _ when Confederate
forces charged entrenched Union troops near the Carter House. The
fierce, five-hour fighting resulted in Confederate losses of 6,000
and Union losses of more than 2,000. Bullet holes can still be seen
in the clapboards of the nearby farm office.
</P>
<P>
   It is much quieter here now. Throngs of visitors and residents
stroll along shady, brick-paved streets that lead past an eclectic
mix of antique shops, gift stores and bookstores, art galleries and
businesses. Just off the square are a number of historic homes,
churches and bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fastest-growing towns in Tennessee, Franklin has
become a haven for busloads of tour groups eager to soak up its
historic atmosphere and browse through the quaint shops.
</P>
<P>
   But things weren't always this prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late '60s, the main businesses in town were discount
furniture stores, a Ben Franklin five-and-dime and other
nondescript shops whose old brick facades were obscured by aluminum
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants watched helplessly as most of the shoppers flocked to
new shopping centers and residents abandoned older downtown homes
for the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point occurred in the early 1980s, when a group of
local investors saw the potential in the historic buildings on Main
Street. The aluminum fronts were ripped off to expose the old
brick, businesses moved in, the rundown Merchant's Hotel was
converted into a restaurant and the upper floors of a 19th century
building at Fourth and Main were turned into elegant apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the downtown got a $2.6 million Streetscape face
lift of brick sidewalks, lighting and tree plantings.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements drew young entrepreneurs such as Paul and
Angela Barrett, who opened a fragrant soap and cosmetics shop
called Bliss two years ago. Barrett, a native of London, was
enthralled by the charm of the town. ``My wife is a Southerner,''
he says, ``and she liked to make different kinds of soap as a
hobby. So we decided to set up shop here and make a clean break
from big-city life, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   If the aromas of the soaps do not bring in customers, the clouds
of bubbles floating out the door will.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the street, Strange and Wonderful Things proves to
be an accurate name for Barbara Kurland's unusual shop. From
sterling silver eating utensils shaped like human bones to an
assortment of bamboo Vietnamese musical instruments, the store is
irresistible to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Just as inviting is Yarrow Acres, Sheri and Mike Gramer's shop
of garden accessories, herbs, country antiques and folk art. The
crowded shelves and narrow aisles evoke the charm of an
old-fashioned hardware store without the unpleasant smells of
fertilizer and chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Other interesting shops on the square include Heart and Hands,
Ellen Forster's shop of pottery, stoneware and other handcrafted
items; Patchwork Palace, which specializes in vintage quilts dating
from 1800 to 1940; and the Heirloom Shop, a colorful store filled
with collectibles and hand-blown glass Christmas ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of the holidays, the whole town becomes one big
Victorian Christmas scene Dec. 11-12, when Franklin celebrates a
Dickens of a Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Five blocks of main street are blocked to traffic, some
residents dress up as characters from ``A Christmas Carol'' and
other Dickens stories and others in costume demonstrate Victorian
crafts in the store windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have horse-drawn carriage rides, carolers and hand-bell
choirs,'' says Nancy Williams of the Downtown Franklin Association.
``We'll even have a Fagin and a little pickpocket running around.''
</P>

<P>
   Q: I am looking for Yardley of London's Rose bar soap and bath
powder.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carole Schneider, Ball Ground, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another Yardley request: I have been in the Atlanta area 10
years and only recently lost my kitchen and guest powder room
mainstay _Yardley English Lavender liquid soap. I still see the
solid bars and liquid body wash. It came in a round pump dispenser
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donna Sue Hettick, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Yardley plea: For several years, I have tried to
locate Yardley's Musk men's cologne. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Helene Camp, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You Yardley fans are a loyal bunch. Since 1770, this English
company has been turning out nostalgic scents including rose and
lavender. Here's the latest scoop: Some items have been
discontinued, such as Yardley smelling salts. Other Yardley
products are sold only in Europe and South Africa, including the
men's Musk cologne and Bond Street cologne, the Black Label shaving
cream, after shave and deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   The English Lavender liquid soap is around, but can be hard to
find. We spotted a 16-ounce bottle for $2.29 at Drug Emporium, 2953
N. Druid Hills Road N.E. (404-636-6108). The liquid soap (16
ounces, $5.99) is also available through the catalog Beauty
Boutique (1-800-497-7463). Or you can order via the company at
1-800-528-3036. One 16-ounce bottle is $2.35.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for fans of Yardley's English Rose scent. It had been
discontinued but because of customer demand, the company is
bringing it back. English Rose will be available in March. A
1-ounce cologne will be $9.75, a trio of bar soaps will be $9.75
and a tin of talc will sell for $7.50. You can also order products
on the company's Web site: www.yardleylondon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I am looking for an old-fashioned wire rug beater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharon Myers, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another old-fashioned request: I have looked everywhere for a
manually operated cookie press. The only kind I can find are
electric or run on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Faster, Carrollton
</P>
<P>
   A: You both will appreciate the Lehman's retail operation. For
over 40 years, this family has operated hardware and appliances
stores in northeastern Ohio, selling nonelectric products to their
Amish neighbors who shun modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amish have shown us that nonelectric products can give us
the ability to complete a task more efficiently than commonly
accepted modern methods,'' says founder Jay Lehman. Among the
inventory: oil lamps and gas refrigerators, wood and cook stoves,
glass-jar butter churns and, yes, a wire rug beater ($11.50) and a
manually operated cookie and pastry press with storage tray
($20.99).
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 items are in the catalog and two retail stores
in Kidron and Mt. Hope. Lehman's Non-Electric catalog is available
online at www.lehmans.com. You can also order at: 1-877-438-5346.
For a catalog ($4), call customer service: 1-888-438-5346.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for Dickinson's fruit preserves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jennifer Webber, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another Dickinson's request: I've searched all over and
can't find Dickinson's jam. I tasted it at a resort in Lake Geneva,
Wis., and it was wonderful. The label said it was made in Oregon. I
would love to find it in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judi Schildts, Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Toast, biscuits and muffins will soon be tastier with
Dickinson's preserves, which have been made in Oregon since 1897.
We found a 10-ounce jar of red raspberry ($2.99) at Cracker Barrel
Old Country Store, 6175 McDonough Drive, Norcross. Most Cracker
Barrel stores carry a wide assortment of flavors, including bing
cherry ($2.79), grape ($1.89) and honey ($3.99). Other stores also
carry the line. A sampling: Cub Foods, all stores, has plum and
seedless boysenberry ($3.38) and Ingles at 675 Buford Drive,
Lawrenceville, has several flavors, including orange marmalade and
peach ($2.69); strawberry ($3.19) and red raspberry and blackberry
($3.39).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you find Christmas ribbon candy? It is old-fashioned
hard candy, shaped like pieces of ribbon. I remember it from my
grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wendy Messick, Grayson, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tie one on this holiday season by indulging in Sevigny's Thin
Ribbon Candy. These colorful _ and fragile _ candies have just made
their annual appearance on store shelves. We found our 9-ounce box
($1.97) at Wal-Mart, 1630 Pleasant Hill Road, Duluth. The
manufacturer recommends you do not refrigerate the candy. To keep
it fresh, place in a covered glass dish or in a tightly covered
tin. Best of all, one piece of candy contains 60 calories but no
fat, cholesterol or salt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you locate Buf-Puf products for me? These cleaning
sponges are great for removing makeup. Many thanks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gloria T. Borders, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: These light-as-air sponges, according to manufacturer 3M
Health Care, lift off dry skin cells and gently take off makeup,
dirt and excess oil. Your skin should feel smooth and prepped for
moisturizer and makeup. A Buf-Puf with cleanser is $3.99 for 40
single sponges. Use a fresh sponge every time you wash. One regular
(also known as original) facial sponge is $3.69, and can be used
daily. It should be replaced every 4-6 weeks. We found ours at
Ulta, 3855 Venture Drive N.W., Duluth (770-232-0606).

 &HT;    Cooke takes true measure of character
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 28.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have enough to lay at the feet of President Clinton and
Kenneth Starr as it is, but an unwelcome mutation has redefined the
word ``character.'' Where it once implied _ not exclusively, but
primarily _ the essential attributes of a person's makeup, it's now
shorthand for undisclosed moral deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   My own profession, to be sure, has not been derelict in doing
its part. It never is. When reporters write about ``the character
issue,'' they hint at the scandalous and titillating without regard
to what in fact a person's character might be. If you doubt it,
consider this: The word is not used unless someone is under
suspicion of wrongdoing, usually of a sexual nature. The
implication is that if one's done nothing to embarrass himself, his
character is a moot issue _ nondescript, of no interest, secondary
to anything else that might be said about him.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the older and more interesting meaning of the
word goes to the person's core. Novelists and playwrights
understand this, even if the press corps doesn't. There was a time
when it did. Alistair Cooke has spent six decades portraying public
people _ politicians, movie stars, writers and artists _ by
delineating their character. Years ago he wrote of Adlai
Stevenson's innate, and politically fatal, sense of noblesse
oblige:
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving among wretched people in mean places, as I often saw
him do, he had the humility of a saint but not the serenity. He was
acutely sensitive to poverty, sickness, disability and grief. But
when he was among his poorer worshipers, he could not improvise the
politician's spread-eagle stance and manic grin. He ambled
nervously among them, spoke gently, hoping to convey by a look that
he was grateful they did not hold their plight against him.''
</P>
<P>
   An artist's intuition
</P>
<P>
   Anyone reasonably competent can report the week-to-week
movements of the polls, parrot back a candidate's canned comments
and secure a quote or two from the crowd. It requires an artist's
intuition to see behind the public mask. Cooke wrote of Bertrand
Russell: ``He raged against the dying of the light of reason in
human affairs, but more against the greed, cowardice, hatreds and
injustices of his fellow man, of whom, from time to time, he
greatly feared he might be one.''
</P>
<P>
   Over several generations, Americans have known Cooke as the
witty and urbane narrator of such television programs as
``Omnibus,'' ``Alistair Cooke's America'' and ``Masterpiece
Theatre.'' But a sizable proportion of today's television audience
would scarcely know the name or the voice. And only a few would
know him as a correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corp. and
The Guardian, or as a skilled portraitist in prose. His most recent
book, ``Memories of the Great &AMP; the Good'' (Arcade, $24.95),
features commentaries on 23 public personalities _ from Frank Lloyd
Wright and Duke Ellington to Erma Bombeck and Bobby Jones _ and
demonstrates his particular gift for seizing on the character of a
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Enviable turns of phrase
</P>
<P>
   Cooke did this best in his book ``Six Men,'' from which the
descriptions of Adlai Stevenson and Bertrand Russell are drawn. But
``Memories of the Great &AMP; the Good,'' even if it has the feel of a
valedictory volume, sparkles with enviable turns of phrase and
Cooke's keen perceptions of personality. Cooke _ 91 years old this
month _ cobbled the collection together from pieces he wrote for
The New Yorker, from BBC broadcasts and from earlier books, and
added to the mix new pieces on George Bernard Shaw, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and James Reston.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bobby Jones in old age he writes: ``My first impression was
the shock of seeing the extent of his disability, the fine strong
hands, twisted like the branches of a cypress, gamely clutching a
tumbler or one of his perpetual cigarettes in a holder. ... (B)ut
the embarrassment a stranger might feel about this was tempered by
the quizzical eyes and the warmth his presence gave off.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barry Goldwater died a few years ago, respected by
Democrats and resented by the Republican far right, Cooke recalled
his impressions during Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964.
The candidate and his constituency, he wrote, did not yet know they
were opposites: ``He has no strain of demagoguery in him. He
detests racial discrimination, but the ingrate South listens and
sees the Negro foiled. He thinks of Jefferson, and his audience
looks on Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke's instinct was to appreciate more than to debunk, and it
could sometimes be a weakness. But when he felt the need to
criticize, he could do so deftly. Of Edward VIII, he wrote: ``He
was at his best only when the going was good.'' It was his style to
see complicated people whole, and he did so by identifying the
character that marked them as clearly as thumb prints.

BAY STATE STOCKS   SIZZLE ON TURKEY DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to travel very far to find at least 61 reasons to
celebrate a very happy Thanksgiving today.
</P>
<P>
   That is the number of publicly traded Massachusetts companies
whose stocks have at least doubled so far in 1999, a figure that
does not include a number of wildly successful initial public
offerings launched this year.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the sheer sizzle of triple-digit gains,
their price appreciation represents the leading edge of what has
turned out to be a banner year to date for public Massachusetts
companies as a broad group.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomberg Massachusetts index, which tracks the stock market
fortunes of 330 local companies, has surged by 40 percent so far
this year and reached a record high Monday. That gain outpaces
advances by nearly all major stock market indexes with the
exception of the Nasdaq Composite index, which has hurtled forward
by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the most striking comparison of all: the
Massachusetts index has moved up on a percentage basis as much this
year as it had over the previous three years combined.
</P>
<P>
   Over past years and in 1999, Massachusetts stocks have been
swayed by larger stock market trends. For now, the wind is firmly
at their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The index includes many large, nontechnical companies like
FleetBoston Financial Corp., Gillette Co., Raytheon Co., and
Staples Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But it consists mostly of scores of smaller and midsized
companies dedicated to a wide range of high-tech businesses. The
index is chock full of much less familiar names like Vicor Corp.,
Alpha Industries Inc., and Project Software &AMP; Development Inc. that
have boomed so far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those stocks have tended to drift in recent years, amid
a market that seemed to be completely uninterested in anything but
very large companies. This year, the boom in technology investments
has spread to stocks of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   As big technology stocks became very expensive, many
institutional investors have bought the cheaper shares of smaller
companies that offer similar kinds of high-growth or prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fund has seen its capitalization decline radically during
the course of the year,'' said Marc Klee, manager of the John
Hancock Global Technology fund. ``It's reflected the fact that we
saw better valuations there.''
</P>
<P>
   For the smaller issues with limited liquidity, demand on the
part of shareholders can have a disproportionate impact on prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's money coming into the small-cap growth
sector,'' said Brian Stack, who manages $3.5 billion at MFS
Investment Management in Boston. ``The illiquidity of the names
really starts to be your friend instead of the bane of your
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The most successful Massachusetts companies so far this year
typically embrace one of several favorite technology investing
themes: high-speed telecommunications, biotechnology,
semiconductors, and anything that works the Internet in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Interleaf Inc. of Cambridge, easily the biggest winner of all,
has gained 1,968 percent to date this year. For years a
down-and-out publishing software company, it's riding high on new
products that may make it easier for devices other than your
standard personal computer to access the Web.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc., the Internet investing hot house based in Andover,
continues to pile up huge 1999 gains after spectacular gains the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies among the best performers, LTX Corp. of Westwood
and Helix Corp. of Mansfield, are tied into the boom in the
semiconductor industry. So is Teradyne Inc. of Boston, which has
soared 113 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, the big manufacturer of computer storage
equipment, has gained 110 percent in 1999 so far. Just this spring,
EMC surpassed Gillette Co. to become the most valuable public
company in the state. Today, EMC's $90 billion market value is
slightly more than twice the value of Gillette shares.
</P>
<P>
   An entire class of new IPO stocks based in Massachusetts have
boomed also, thanks to unquenchable and sometimes unexplainable
demand for Internet and telecommunications investments.
</P>
<P>
   This year's two biggest local new issues, Sycamore Networks Inc.
of Chemlsford and Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, have
traded at six to eight times their IPO price.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there's a list of losers among the state's public
companies, including 19 that have been cut by half or worse this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performing stock of all: assisted-living manager
Carematrix Corp. of Needham, which has lost a crushing 93 percent
of its value in 1999.

FOR LOBBYIST CASSIDY, IT WAS TIME FOR   MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was a time when the photographs in Gerald
Cassidy's office advertised his dazzling success as a Capitol Hill
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   There was Cassidy fishing with US Representative Silvio O.
Conte, the late, longtime ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee. There he was again, beaming, standing
alongside the late House speaker, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when being a lobbyist meant chiefly knowing how to
schmooze. Cassidy was an expert, and his cozy ties with leaders in
Congress helped bring about beneficial legislation or funnel
millions in federal funds to clients from academia to aerospace _
with an emphasis on New England.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the photographs seem as dated as the
three-martini lunch. Searching for a new look, the lobbying
industry is in transformation. Clients today want one-stop shopping
for all their clients' government-relations needs, from polling and
public relations to representation on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   So nearly 25 years after hanging out his shingle as ``Cassidy &AMP;
Associates,'' Cassidy this month sold his lobbying business to
Shandwick International, a public relations firm with offices in 52
countries and a subsidiary of Interpublic Group, a New York-based
global media and public relations conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The selling price was reportedly just under $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy, 59, remains in charge of the four units of his firm
that specialized in lobbying and polling. Each keeps its old name,
but as part of a new office, Shandwick Washington. The fifth unit,
Powell Tate public relations, now becomes part of Shandwick's PR
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But Cassidy has gone from being kingpin of the firm that he
built from just two people in 1975 to 300 today to being a cog in
the works of a ``full service company'' devoted to performing every
public-relations and lobbying function under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his 13th Street office recently, Cassidy
reflected on the transformation. ``When I came here, a couple of
dozen people were the decision-makers in D.C.,'' he said. `'There
was a seniority system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 26 years, I've watched the way in which communications
and public affairs has changed. There's been a growth in the number
of media outlets. There's been a spreading of the power. There's
been the globalization of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, ``everybody's become more sophisticated,''
Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Silber, the chancellor of Boston University, which has
been a big beneficiary of Cassidy's lobbying prowess over the
years, agreed. ``I suppose what's happening here is similar to
what's happening with banks and what's happening to hardware stores
and retail stores and the Internet,'' Silber said. ``These
corporations find they can work more effectively on a global basis
than they can on a local basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of this metamorphosis are the aquisition nearly a
decade ago of Gray &AMP; Co., a lobbying office, by Hill &AMP; Knowlton,
the public relations firm, and the more recent acquisition of
lobbying units by two big Washington law firms. Other, smaller
lobbying firms have also been in merger negotiations recently,
including podesta.com, run by Tony Podesta, a former aide to
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a huge level of consolidation in the industry,
because the industries we serve are consolidating,'' said Nancy
Sterling, a vice president for the Boston-based firm of Mintz,
Levin, which has a Washington office that houses lawyers, a
lobbying unit, and a public relations team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connections are still important,'' Sterling said, ``but I
don't know anyone who has even a one-martini lunch these days.
People are looking for a final product, and what we do is end up
putting together a network of products for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy's history is illustrative. The Brooklyn, N.Y, native
earned a Cornell University law degree in 1967 and, after briefly
working for a legal services program, took a staff job in
Washington with the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   There he met George McGovern, the unsuccessful Democratic
candidate for president in 1972, and other influential Democrats
including O'Neill and Kennedy, followed.
</P>
<P>
   When he decided lobbying was his future, those contacts led to a
ready-made big client, Jean Mayer, the president of Tufts
University, who six years earlier headed a White House Conference
on Food, Nutrition and Health and wanted to build a government
supported nutritional institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy went to work and the result is the $32 million US
Department of Agriculture Jean Mayer Center for Human Nutrition and
Aging, next to the Tufts Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University, with Silber then its new president, soon
signed on for help in pursuing funds for an engineering school. The
relationship continues; Cassidy more recently helped win
congressional support for BU's new Photonics Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy kept his firm's Capitol Hill connections fresh by hiring
from the ranks of congressional committee staffs and by buying out
smaller lobbying firms, including Boland &AMP; Madigan, which had
Republican Party ties. He also acquired Powell Tate, a public
realtions firm founded by Jody Powell, who was former President
Jimmy Carter's press secretary, and Shiela Tate, press aide to
Nancy Reagan and former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other college clients _ Boston College, Columbia
University, and Northwestern University among them _ Cassidy also
signed up corporate interests _ Ocean Spray, the cranberry growers
cooperative; General Dynamics Corp., which builds nuclear
submarines in Connecticut; Crane &AMP; Co., the western Massachusetts
company that makes paper for US currency. Therre were national
clients, too _ the Boeing Co. is one.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues grew: last year Cassidy &AMP; Associates took in $40
million from all operations. Lobbying brought in $19.8 million of
that, making the firm Washington's most lucrative lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   What the change of ownership will mean for Cassidy is still
being worked out. He is still getting used to the new company name
and two weeks after the acquisition was still waiting for new
business cards.
</P>
<P>
   What it means for some clients, though, is easier to predict _
an international public relations network at their disposal _
without losing the services and connections of Cassidy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we want to project Boston University
worldwide, they are in a better position to do that now than they
were before,'' Silber said. ``We have wealthy alumni in Thailand,
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and for them to be more aware of Boston
University helps us in terms of fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be flattering myself,'' Silber continued, ``but I think
Boston University has a very special relationship to the Cassidy
firm, and I think I have a very important relationship to Gerry
Cassidy, which means they aren't going to forget Boston University.
If in the future they do as well as they've done in the past,
they're going to do very damn well.''

BE THANKFUL FOR THE MACINTOSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Two weeks ago, I reviewed Apple's new iBook computer. Although
I praised the computer's industrial design and Apple's marketing
prowess, I couldn't resist taking a swipe at the Macintosh
operating system. Out on the Internet, I said, I had run into
problems _ particularly with Web sites that had been designed with
Windows users in mind, or those which required me to use programs
such as ``telnet'' or ``ftp.'' I also criticized the computer's
browsing speed, saying the iBook ran more slowly with my cable
modem than did my Pentium III desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known better than to say anything negative about
the Macintosh computer in print. Less than three hours after my
column hit the pavement, my in-box was filling up with hostile
e-mail from the Macintosh Faithful. People criticized my analysis,
said I had an inherent anti-Mac bias, and said I shouldn't blame
the MacOS system for the failings of Windows-centric Web designers.
One angry reader tried to organize a letter-writing campaign to the
Globe's ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   This reaction from Macintosh users is somewhat typical. Unlike
Windows users, Mac-heads are quick to circle their wagons and
attack the messenger whenever someone criticizes their beloved
system. Apple evangelists have even organized harassment campaigns
to ``reeducate'' journalists who have written unfavorable Macintosh
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than engage in another war of words, I want to call a
truce. On this Thanksgiving Day, I want to give public thanks for
the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the Macintosh is the friendliest,
easiest-to-use, and the most colorful computer on the market today.
The Mac is a pleasure to operate. It's a computer that respects its
user.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment you turn it on, the Mac brings a smile to your
face. Press the ``on'' switch of a typical Windows computer and
you'll hear a nasty ``beep.'' The Mac, in contrast, plays a
pleasant chord. One of the things that I hate about my Windows
computer is the way it is always interrupting me. I can be in the
middle of typing something in my word processor, but if another
program needs my attention, it pops a window up in my face,
demanding immediate attention. Unfortunately, if I don't
immediately stop typing, it's quite likely that one of my
keystrokes will inadvertantly trigger one of the buttons on the
pop-up, and before I know it I've told the computer to go off and
do something else _ what I'm not sure. Mac programs, on the other
hand, get your attention by pulsing the Apple icon in the
computer's upper-left hand corner. There they will wait patiently
until you decide to see what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers wanted to know why I reviewed Apple's MacOS 8.5
operating system, when Apple had just released version 9.0. The
reason, as I explained in my column, was that the iBook came with
MacOS 8.5 installed. It was only the day after my column ran in the
paper that Apple provided me with MacOS 9.0.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that same day I received a second operating system
in the mail: a copy of Windows 98 Second Edition. So that
afternoon, I upgraded both my iBook and my Windows desktop. The
experience gave me another reason to be thankful for the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The Macintosh upgrade was fast and painless. Following the
instructions on the CD, I put the CD in the iBook's CD-ROM drive,
held down the ``C'' key, and turned the computer on. The computer
booted from the CDROM. Next I ran the MacOS upgrader and was given
the choice of upgrading my current operating system or performing a
``clean install.'' (The clean install is useful if you have damaged
your computer and it will no longer boot.) I chose the upgrade
option; the job was finished in less than 10 minutes. When my
computer rebooted, it was running MacOS 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows upgrade was far more complicated. First, I had to
boot my computer into Windows and run the upgrade program from the
CD-ROM. Then I had to manually kill the ``MS-DOS'' box that I had
used to start up the upgrade program. Then I had to type an
activation key. Finally, I had to watch numerous Microsoft
advertisements for the next 40 minutes, and wait through two
reboots, until my computer was usable again. Microsoft has copied
so much from Apple _ it would be nice if they could copy the Mac's
ease-of-upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new operating system gives us a lot to be thankful for,
as well. Just as with Windows 95, the Mac now supports multiple
users, with different levels of privilege assignable to each. And
it has a cool ``auto-update'' feature that lets you download
operating system updates automatically over the Internet by
clicking a button. Although there is a similar feature built into
Windows 98, I've tried both and the Mac's is far easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Although programs such as ``ftp'' and ``telnet'' don't come with
the iBook, these programs are readily available on the Internet for
people who want to download them. And while it is true some Web
sites require ActiveX or Windows-specific helper-programs, most
don't. I'm thankful the Internet is equalizing many of the
differences between Mac users and PC users.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thankful for the stability of the Macintosh operating
system. Gone are the days when the Mac crashed every few hours.
These days the Mac is an incredibly reliable operating system _ far
more reliable than my Windows PC.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'm thankful for the Macintosh user community _ a vocal
group of computer enthusiasts who are always quick to criticize any
person or company that does not properly support their computer.

COMMENTARY: DO YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR KIDS ARE SAYING? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (For release Thursday, Dec. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I live disconcertingly close to Rockdale County, Ga., the
subject of a PBS recent ``Frontline'' documentary that has become a
national parable about promiscuous suburban teens.
</P>
<P>
   The documentarians chose Rockdale due to the surprising
incidence of syphilis in the teen-agers of the affluent community.
</P>
<P>
   What they discovered was a group of kids, some as young as 13,
living shockingly hedonistic lives _ multiple sex partners, group
sex, unsupervised parties, drugs and alcohol _ while still at home
under their parents' supposed supervision.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things that are disturbing about the
documentary, it's hard to single one out. (For a transcript, visit
the PBS ``Frontline'' Web site at www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/
and click on ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County'' under past
offerings.)
</P>
<P>
   Some are teens who had been set adrift by divorce; parents so
distracted by their own dramas, careers or naivete that they either
didn't care what their child was doing, or had no clue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these children were given every financial advantage _
mansion-style houses, BMWs to drive to school, lots of cash _ and
the freedom to indulge. Other teens who were involved came from
loving homes, whose parents gave them plenty of time and attention
when they were young, then stepped back to allow some independence
during the teen years.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A group of schoolmates gathered weekly in an
upstairs bedroom not to finish a science project, but to watch _
and reenact _ the Playboy channel.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent of two young children, I watched the show with the
same anxiety most parents did. Is Rockdale any different than any
other upscale American suburb?
</P>
<P>
   How can we inoculate our own children against going too far,
experiencing too much at far too young an age, without clamping
down so hard that they rebel or never learn to think for
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Then I read an article in The Family Therapy Networker's
November/December issue, ``Discovering our Children,'' that I
believe captures what's going on with our sons and daughters and
provides some answers for how we can reverse the course.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Taffel, director of the family and couples treatment program
at the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in New York and the
author of the book ``Parenting by Heart,'' believes that today's
children lack emotional literacy, a passion for something other
than the pop culture, and the ability to delay immediate
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   This adds up to aggressive, glibly sophisticated children unable
to control their moods, act respectfully or talk about what really
matters _ their feelings, dreams, wishes and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem, Taffel proposes, is a moral ambiguity that
has swept over modern families. Seeing more and more children at
younger and younger ages explode with defiance and talk and act
with increasing disrespect has led him to believe that parents are
not giving clear signals as to what is acceptable behavior and what
is not _ and carrying through with consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Too many wishy-washy answers, compounded by contradictory advice
and threats without substance have resulted in children who see
parents not as leaders in the family, but ineffectual guides
incapable of providing moral direction.
</P>
<P>
   This allows a child's second family _ the kiddie culture of
peers and the media _ to become more important and more persuasive
than parents, siblings and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again in his conversations with school children,
Taffel heard the refrain, ``We don't spend much time together _
we're always so busy in my house.'' He has concluded that,
``stretched to the limits as we are, we do not really know the
children we have ... we just do not spend enough direct, one-on-one
time with them.''
</P>
<P>
   True, research indicates that parents today spend the same, if
not more, time with their children than ``June and Ward Cleaver
did,'' he says. ``Yet, family members may be spending time near
each other, in the same house, (but) engaged in parallel but
separate activities, and not remotely doing things together.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, mom might check her e-mail while listening to the
5-year-old take a bath, and dad might conduct business on his cell
phone while riding in the car with his son to school. Prime
opportunities for one-on-one attention and conversation lost by the
modern habit of multitasking every minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmingly, what the kids want most, is (their parents')
undivided attention,'' says Taffel.
</P>
<P>
   To go bowling, to lie down together for a bed-time story, to sit
at the kitchen table together during breakfast and tell silly
jokes, to do a jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature abhors a vacuum, and for American children, the great,
roaring hurricane of the mass media culture _ particularly the
culture of celebrity _ rushes in to fill the psychic void that
family used to fill,'' Taffel says.
</P>
<P>
   This blind admiration for celebrities even extends to a desire
to become celebrities themselves _ and there are many ways to
achieve this, as evidenced by the Littleton shootings. ``Violence
becomes the perfect antidote to ... anonymity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What can we do? Taffel says parents should strengthen certain
core attributes in their children to raise sons and daughters with
a strong sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mood mastery _ Model specific ways to soothe intense emotional
states, such as anger and fear, that fit their child's temperament.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respect _ Be clear about expectations and follow through with
reasonable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   _ Passion _ Encourage love of learning and teach how to deal
with disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peer smarts _ Help a child recognize a true friend, and teach
negotiation styles for maintaining a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Body comfort _ Help a child value and accept the way he or she
looks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gratitude _ Instill a healthy appreciation for the good things
in life. And, most of all, pay attention. Really look at, and
listen to, your children. As 11-year-old Amanda told Taffel when he
visited her classroom, ``If the adults don't know what's going on,
it all turns into chaos. The adults need to know.''

Supervisor is Lynn Hoogenboom. (888-346-9867).

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The American economy rolled into autumn
with even more momentum than had been thought, its rapid and widely
envied growth poised to set a record for longevity. ``How can you
not be thankful,'' said James Glassman, chief U.S. economist at
Chase Securities. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   OPERATION-SMILE-II (Beijing) _ Early last August, an
impoverished farmer brought his young son to the Plastic Surgery
Hospital in Beijing to take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity: For one week, plastic surgeons from the American
charity Operation Smile were operating for free on poor Chinese
children with cleft lips and palates, the congenital condition that
afflicted his boy. But that elation quickly turned to anguish when
his son returned from surgery and he discovered that the wrong
operation had been performed. A Special Report, the second of two
parts, by Elisabeth Rosenthal and Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-SUBWAY (Tokyo) _ After waiting decades for a new
underground rail line that would relieve the over crowding on the
above-ground train that now encircles the central city, it now
seems like Tokyo has produced yet another boondoggle. The problem:
The new subway does not run in a complete circle. ``It's like a
Rolls-Royce that you can't shift into reverse,'' said Shintaro
Ishihara, Tokyo's outspoken governor. By Stephanie Strom.

<P>
   COLO-RITALIN-SCHOOLS (Denver) _ The Colorado Board of Education
has become the first in the nation to adopt a policy against
teachers urging parents to put their children on behavior
controlling drugs like Ritalin and Luvox, rekindling a national
debate over the growing use of such drugs by school children. By
Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-TRADE (Washington) _ With the Iowa caucuses only two months
away, the Gore campaign is counting on the endorsement of the
AFL-CIO to translate into intensive door-to-door political work
there and in other early primary states. But the most immediate
attention of the union is focused on Seattle, where it plans huge
demonstrations when global trade talks get underway there next
week. The Clinton administration's trade agreement with China,
hailed by Clinton as one of his greatest foreign policy
achievements, and the administration goals for the Seattle talks
are complicating Al Gore's efforts to energize labor behind his
campaign. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   GIVING-THANKS-I (New York) _ A factory worker walked by a
homeless man near the Port Authority for years; once, he tossed a
couple of quarters his way. Thus is set in motion a remarkable
story of charity, kinship, coincidence and reunion. The worker
befriended the homeless man, cleaned him up, discovered he was from
same part of Virginia and vowed to take him home to his mother,
whose church had been praying for him for three years. Now back
home, the homeless man, Raymond, is playing the organ for the
church choir. By Randy Kennedy.

REMOVING THE COOL FROM CIGARETTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Dec. 2)  
(js) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because it's cool, is what kids say when you ask them why they
smoke cigarettes. Cool, they say, a word older than their
grandfathers, even their great grandfathers, but an image that
spans the generations to indicate a certain attitude and style _
assured, loose, above it all.
</P>
<P>
   So, you have 14-year-olds or younger _ for this is when more
than half of all smokers begin _ in pursuit of coolness and
believing the way to it is to stick a paper wad of lit tobacco in
their mouths. You just wish they could get the same cool factor
from baggy jeans or acing a science quiz.
</P>
<P>
   If coolness is everything, then it follows that the only way to
get kids to not smoke is to make smoking not cool. And how do we do
that?
</P>
<P>
   Cool is separate from healthy and wise. It's a look. You see the
way kids bend over a cigarette, the way they let it dangle from
their fingers. They're like little actors, posing as sophisticates.
So how do we make that look unappealing, something not at all worth
imitating?
</P>
<P>
   The other strategies, well-intended and based on fact, don't
work against coolness. Cancer statistics, secondhand smoke dangers,
the specter of yellow teeth and stinky clothes work on adults but
not on kids.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes California kids, who more than kids in most
parts of the country, and certainly the world, live in smoke-free
environments where smoking is not only antisocial but against the
law, except in private homes or outside far away from any air duct
or another's breathing space. A lot of adults finally quit smoking
when they find themselves outside at the party feeling like a
desperate loner trying to get a match to light in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Kids don't seem to mind the inconvenience. It's part of being a
kid smoker to sneak a smoke where adults can't see you. If you have
to hang out in an alley in the rain to light up, that's kind of,
you know, cool. Even more so to take your chewing tobacco to
school, stuff some in your mouth before class and carry a Diet Coke
can to spit into.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Kerfoot is a nurse and prevention specialist for high
school tobacco programs in Sonoma County, Calif. She works with
kids who've been busted for smoking on campus or who are trying to
quit, and some of the older kids do penance by talking to
fourth-and fifth-grade classes about smoking.
</P>
<P>
   When they ask the younger kids, 9- and 10-year-olds, why they'd
want to smoke, they hear back that ``it's cool.'' The older kids
then explain that by the time you're in high school it's not cool
anymore, but you've got the craving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even kids in middle school want to look cool,'' Denise says.
``And they want to look older and they want to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't everyone who ever smoked know that one? We smoked
because we were at a party and feeling awkward, or when we got to
college and someone showed us how to light a cigarette by holding
the hand of a man with a match and staring into his eyes. We were
all little actors, too, and it was our passport into grownup-land.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a sign of getting into middle school.
</P>
<P>
   People whose jobs are to get people to stop smoking and who
proudly show a drop in adult users are at a loss to explain why
kids are smoking more than they did 10 years ago. They blame it on
magazine advertising that seduces kids with messages of
independence, and, of course, looking cool and fashionably thin.
</P>
<P>
   Or they say it's the way of kids, to indulge in what's bad for
them and believe they're invincible. But these kids have grown up
with antismoking messages. Guest speakers connected to oxygen tanks
come to their school and lecture. They've watched their own parents
struggle to get through a bad day without tumbling back to their
habit.
</P>
<P>
   When a state report showed that the three-county region of
Sonoma-Marin-Napa has the highest percentage of teen smokers in the
state, health professionals could only come up with a weak
suggestion that kids in this largely middle-class population can
better afford the high price of cigarettes than kids in poorer
parts of the state. Most said they don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more mysteries about tobacco itself. It has been
proven to be a major health risk, a public menace and an insidious
drug. In the movie ``The Insider,'' the whistle-blowing tobacco
researcher calls cigarettes a nicotine-delivery device, designed to
hook people. Meanwhile, high school kids go into middle schools and
tell kids that 1,300 Americans die a day because of tobacco, more
than the number dying in car accidents, plane crashes, house fires,
murders, AIDS and suicide combined. And to please, please not do
what they did. That's cool.

 (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``This,'' said William Carden, the director, ``is
theatrical tough love.'' The audience in the cavernous Majestic
Theater roared its approval.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing on the nearly bare stage, backed only by the
black drops that help to create the atmosphere of subterranean
melodrama in ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' the theater's current
tenant.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday night two weeks ago. We were there to see
something a good deal less rococo than ``Phantom'' and, as it
turned out, more historic: a staged reading of ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?,'' Edward Albee's epic consideration of one
American marriage, in which Uta Hagen would recreate the role in
which she triumphed when ``Virginia Woolf'' first arrived on
Broadway 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carden's ``tough love'' was a reference not only to the ferocity
of the play and the minimal production values given the staged
reading (a table, four chairs, the outlines of a doorway), but also
to Ms. Hagen. The night was designed to be a tribute to the actress
on her 80th birthday, and to benefit the HB Playwrights Foundation
and Theater, which she heads. Yet all the work was being done by
Ms. Hagen and her colleagues in the cast: Jonathan Pryce, Mia
Farrow and Matthew Broderick.
</P>
<P>
   ``She honors us,'' Carden went on, anticipating what he
described as ``this leap in time.'' True enough, but nothing anyone
might have said in advance could have been adequate preparation for
the performance that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Most actors loathe staged readings. They don't have time to
learn the text, so they must juggle their scripts, reading their
lines while also being required to make entrances and exits and to
perform a lot of the basic stage business. Actors feel all thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   A staged reading is even tougher than a plain, unadorned sight
reading, done without rehearsal, when the lines need not be acted
as much as heard while someone reads the stage directions, a de
facto storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as directed by Carden, who is also the artistic director of
the HB Theater, this ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' had a
seamless dramatic intensity that suggested virtually a new way of
making theater.
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing three hours of desperate marital combat, the
members of the audience emerged from the Majestic aware that they
had just experienced something available nowhere but in this great
ailing tradition we call the theater. It wasn't conventional
theater, but it's as good as theater gets.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, time is inflexible and cruel, a wearing out of
resources, a diminishment of powers. But when time bends, as the
title of Arthur Miller's memoir suggests, it can, among other
things, accommodate, deepen and make possible the sort of one-of-
a-kind performances of which theatrical legends are made.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagen's great, bawdy one-night stand with the role of Martha
now becomes one of those legends, her physical and psychological
presence possibly even enriched by everything that has happened
since the first time she played the role.
</P>
<P>
   Such legends are unique to theater. They are an impossibility in
any of the performing arts that have been frozen in time on film or
tape. Movies have enormous power but, being representations of
something already completed, they are fixed and quite dead. Only
memory keeps the living theater alive, recalling the particular
circumstances in which time wasn't stopped but, instead, its
passage celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in an acute awareness of the finite, during a
performance you know will never be exactly duplicated, that you
glimpse the meaning of the infinite. That was the effect of this
revivifying production.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagen was, in fact, too young _ 43 _ when she first played
Martha, a college professor's voracious, disappointed wife who is
supposed to be 52. She now says she is too old, and you might
agree, but only if you had not seen this performance. You didn't
hear her as she brayed with the indignation of a fastidious
fishwife: ``I do (italics)not(end italics) bray!'' You didn't see
her as she charged out of the room to attend to poor drunk Honey,
passed out on the bathroom floor clutching a brandy bottle. Loud or
soft, the voice is rich and strong, the body lithe and the brain as
strong and quick as a bear trap. At moments of doomy
self-awareness, she reminded us of Groucho Marx when he said he
wouldn't join any country club that would let him in.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company rehearsed together only a week, there seemed
an easy balance in the casting. Pryce was sneakily strong as
George, Martha's husband, a history professor whose wimpishness is
only one of the various guises he assumes to make their marriage
work.
</P>
<P>
   George and Martha were equals here. During the long night of
boozy game-playing and failed infidelities, George remained laid
back. He collected his injustices quietly, hoarding them, letting
his outrage accumulate so that the final explosion, when it came,
was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   The roles of Nick and Honey usually seem more important as
functions of the plot than as characters in their own right. They
are the new, young and very ambitious biology professor and his
mousy wife, whom Martha and George welcome into the faculty family
with a late-night party they'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as performed by Broderick and Ms. Farrow, Nick and Honey
took on dimensions I have never seen before. He was alternately
bewildered and opportunistic. She was sweet, dangerously stupid and
sly. She was also very, very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Though I have long admired her performances in Woody Allen's
films, especially in ``Broadway Danny Rose,'' ``Radio Days'' and
``The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' I had no inkling that she could take
hold of the stage in this manner. And as there was no consciousness
of the age difference between Ms. Hagen and Pryce, there was none
between Ms. Farrow and Broderick.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The HB Playwrights Foundation and Theater, which was served by
this remarkable evening, includes an 80-seat theater where the
productions of the HB Playwrights Foundation are presented. It is
physically attached to but is an entity separate from the HB
Studio.
</P>
<P>
   The studio, founded by Herbert Berghof in 1945, some years
before he and Ms. Hagen were married, is the acting school where
Ms. Hagen still teaches and Berghof taught until his death in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The theater was his special project, however, as I found out in
1985 when I worked with him on the production of a play I had
written. Berghof, who had a horror of the commercial theater, made
sure that the HB Theater became the kind of sanctuary where people
can make plays unmolested by philistines. Critics are not invited.
Risks can be taken without fear of failure. Admission is free
(donations are accepted). Patrons come from the neighborhood, the
city, California and, sometimes, abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At first I felt Berghof was curious about me as an eccentric
movie critic who had written a play, but then I realized he had
more or less the same contempt for the movie business as he did for
the commercial theater. He delighted in recalling how the Elizabeth
Taylor ``Cleopatra'' had financed the HB Theater. Its cost was
covered by the overtime he received for playing the role of
Theodotos in the picture, whose shooting delays kept him in Rome
for the better part of a year, instead of a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Berghof planned all of his productions well in advance. There
was a feeling of roominess _ of space _ about his methods. He was
civilized. When we worked together, the schedule included almost a
year of meetings once or twice a month before we went into
rehearsals. Sometimes we would discuss the play, sometimes the
history and state of the theater in general, sometimes life. After
several months it came as a shock to realize that he knew the
script word for word, far better than I did.
</P>
<P>
   Our talks weren't idle chat. He was getting my measure and
putting his own ideas in order. An extraordinary actor, director
and man of the theater. Not long after his death, I also had the
opportunity to work with Ms. Hagen, again before I began covering
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of other people in this country, I feel as if I
had studied with Herbert and Uta, but without ever realizing it was
work. It was always life. The work grows out of that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not quite in the same league with the performance of ``Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' but a complete entertainment
nevertheless, was Gerald Gutierrez's recent staged reading (staged
singing?) of ``Sail Away'' with Elaine Stritch, a fine Broadway
cast and a full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 1961 Noel Coward musical in which Ms. Stritch, the
show's original star who is now 74, reprised her role of a
wisecracking cruise director for 10 performances at the Weill
Recital Hall in Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sail Away'' is scarcely comparable to Albee's seminal drama.
It would be difficult to imagine anyone seriously wanting to revive
it today. It would cost a fortune, what with all of the singers and
dancers, sets, costumes, lights, fancy sound amplification system
and other technical marvels required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sail Away'' is not a memorable show. Coward's score has some
of his wittiest satirical numbers, including ``Useful Phrases,'' a
sendup of the contents of one of those ``How to Get Along in
Italy'' books, and ``Why Do the Wrong People Travel?'' (which
speaks for itself), but the other numbers are mostly reminders of
earlier, better Coward songs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the exemplary revivals of musical comedies produced in
concert form by Encores at City Center, there was no dancing in
``Sail Away,'' no costumes except for Ms. Stritch's sailor hat.
There were few entrances or exits. The performers sat on the stage
and came forward only when they were doing a scene.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent supporting cast was headed by Marian Seldes, Jane
White, Jerry Lanning, Jane Connell and Gordon Connell. Ms. Seldes
was especially welcome as an outrageously self-dramatizing writer
of best-selling novels in which loins grow hot and breasts heave.
</P>
<P>
   The production pared away much of the hokum of the original
show, allowing us to savor Coward's multiple moods and charms
without demanding that they justify the expense of a full staging.
More important, it returned Ms. Stritch to the world of musical
comedy, where she is revered as an icon comparable to Ethel Merman.
Her voice and quickness of mind can still pierce and enchant. The
fizz is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Her Tony-winning performance in the 1996 revival of Albee's
``Delicate Balance,'' also directed by Gutierrez, is much
appreciated. Yet there are those who believe that a Stritch who has
no chance to belt, to sashay and to let go with a juicy
double-entendre is hiding something large and fabulous under a
bushel.
</P>
<P>
   That qualifies as criminal negligence.

RUSSIAN CHOICE TO LEAD CHECHNYA HAS CRIMINAL PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's leaders believe they have found the man to
help them put an end to years of lawlessness in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But first, they had to spring him from jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin says the Islamic militants it is fighting in
Chechnya are ``terrorists'' and ``bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Moscow needed a Chechen leader to help win public
support among civilians for Russia's latest campaign in the region,
it turned to Beslan Gantamirov, who was serving a six-year sentence
for embezzling federal funds earmarked for rebuilding the
war-devastated region.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian troops, tanks, and warplanes bombarding their way
through Chechnya, Moscow has ruled out negotiations with the
separatists' elected leader, President Aslan Maskhadov. Instead,
Russia is trying to set up a pro-Moscow administration in Chechnya
and to squeeze out Maskhadov, who the Kremlin says has lost control
of Islamic commanders.
</P>
<P>
   To replace him, the Kremlin wants Gantamirov, who goes by the
nickname ``The Demon.'' Last week, he was appointed head of the
pro-Moscow Chechen State Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's choice underscores just how difficult it is for
Russia to find influential allies in its campaign in Chechnya,
which has few fans among Chechens because of the indiscriminate
bombardment that rebel leaders say has killed 4,000 civilians and
sent at least 200,000 more fleeing from the region.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Gantamirov was convicted on charges that he embezzled
more than $6 million while a member of the Chechen government
during Russia's occupation of the city in 1995 and 1996. The money
had been earmarked for rebuilding the city, which was nearly
flattened during the 1994-1996 war between Moscow and Chechen
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov was set free last month thanks to a rare pardon by
President Boris N. Yeltsin, as Russia sought to create a new
pro-Moscow regime in areas of Chechnya its troops have occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Demon was more useful to us outside jail than inside,''
said one government analyst, explaining the pardon. ``Gantamirov
sees Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation and will fight on
our side. Today that is the most important thing. . . The Demon is
no day at the beach, but he's our man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov, 36, left Moscow for the Caucasus Tuesday, saying he
would raise and command a loyalist militia that would help fight
the separatists. Some Russian press reports said he could raise a
force of some 2,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to fight, and we don't know who of us will be
coming back,'' Gantamirov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release from prison of Beslan Gantamirov and the formation
of some new Chechen authority under his leadership demonstrate
quite clearly that the Russian Government has no rational plan of
action for Chechnya,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the
centrist Yabloko opposition party in the Duma, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say Gantamirov will not make Moscow's campaign to
win the hearts and minds of Chechens any easier. His first tour of
a refugee camp near the Chechen frontier appeared to stir little
enthusiam among Chechens there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent a bandit to find other bandits. They will reach a
deal and divide the money sent from Moscow, like they did during
the last war,'' the Associated Press quoted a 34-year-old Grozny
resident as saying. ``As long as Russia keeps sending criminals to
lead us, we will remain criminals ourselves, since we will have to
live in a criminal state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov's mission comes amid signs that Russia's military
campaign against Islamic militants in Chechnya may be bogging down.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have claimed a series of military successes,
including the capture of Chechnya's second-largest city, Gudermes.
Russia's defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, said Tuesday that federal
troops had Grozny 80 per cent surrounded. He said its residents
would soon force rebels to leave the city, which has been under
heavy bombardment since late September.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Chechen military official Wednesday denied
Sergeyev's claims, saying that the approaches to the city from the
south and east remained open. Mumadi Saydayev, the military
commander of the breakaway republic, also brushed aside Russian
reports that Chechen fighters were leaving the capital en masse and
taking refuge in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``All are in their positions,'' he was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties but have moved
quickly across the northern plains to the outskirts of Grozny. Some
analysts say the military has been exaggerating its successes to
retain public support for the war among Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``All talk about how people are tired of the bandits' arbitrary
rule and meet our paratroopers with open arms is a bluff,'' said
Andrei Rykhlin, who writes for the news magazine Itogi.
``Surrendering towns without battle is a part of Maskhadov's
strategy, and town elders who enter talks with military are trying
to gain one goal _ to save the lives of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov was originally an ally of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the
Chechen president who declared independence from Russia in 1991 and
led the uprising until his death in a Russian rocket attack in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994, an internal struggle put Gantemirov and Dudayev on
opposite sides. Gantemirov became a key leader in a failed
Kremlin-backed attempt to overthrow Dudayev in November, 1994, and
later joined the puppet government Moscow installed when its troops
took the city in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in May 1996, three months before the separatists retook
Grozny and the loyalist government fled, Gantamirov was arrested in
Moscow. He spent three years in prison awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov never denied he misspent the money, but said he was
paying for weapons for his fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course that is true, but he did not forget about himself,''
the weekly Obshaya Gazeta quoted a Gantamirov supporter as saying
last week. ``How could it be otherwise?''

SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is speech recognition software another alternative to the
mouse? How powerful a computer do you need to run one of these
programs?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, a good speech recognition program can take a load off
your mouse if you are willing to work with the software. Although
the most advanced programs on the market today won't let you
interact as effortlessly with your machine as characters on
science-fiction shows do, the technology has become a lot more
accurate and reliable in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   These natural language programs (so called because they allow
you to speak in normal conversational patterns instead of pausing
between each word, as with the older programs) will let you control
your computer and its applications through vocal commands.
</P>
<P>
   You can also dictate text that you would normally type, and some
programs will let you speak up to 140 to 160 words per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Specific system requirements depend on the program that you
choose, but most require your PC to have a 16-bit sound card
installed. Your computer will probably need a minimum of 48
megabytes of RAM installed to run the latest versions of popular
speech recognition programs, and you will probably need 200 to 300
megabytes of free hard drive space.
</P>
<P>
   A fast processor, at least 200 megahertz, is also essential for
smooth performance of the software. Two popular programs in this
category are Dragon NaturallySpeaking by Dragon Systems
(www.dragonsystems.com) and Via Voice, from IBM
(www.ibm.com/software/speech).
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are developing Macintosh versions of the programs
as well for release in the next few months.

POSSIBLE RESOLUTION SEEN IN BRITISH-FRENCH DISPUTE ON BEEF TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The feud between the French and British over France's
refusal to import British beef seemed to inch toward a finish
Wednesday as the French acknowledged that they had taken a set of
recommendations to their national food safety agency to get
approval for lifting the import ban.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said that they did not expect a final answer
before 10 days and they continued to caution that their food safety
agency might find the new proposals unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``protocol of understanding,'' coming on the eve of a
British-French summit meeting, at least made it possible for both
sides to claim progress on an issue that had threatened to
overshadow discussions on a joint drive to coordinate Western
European defense.
</P>
<P>
   The beef dispute _ which has dominated the headlines in France
and in Britain for weeks and triggered a retaliatory boycott of
many French products in Britain _ has severely strained
British-French relations at a time when the two countries were
gearing up for talks on making Western Europe less militarily
dependent on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission said the ``protocol of understanding''
between the British and the French dealt with five points including
how easily the beef could be traced, on the spot controls, new
testing, a policy on derived products and labeling.
</P>
<P>
   New proposals for additional testing and the right to label the
meat as British are thought to be the only real concession to the
French.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials from both counties maintained that the defense talks,
scheduled to begin Thursday, would not be derailed by the beef
dispute. British Prime Minister Tony Blair is scheduled to first
hold talks with French President Jacques Chirac at 10 Downing St.,
and then meet later with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. The
two countries' foreign, treasury and defense ministers are also to
hold parallel talks.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain first put forward the notion of a joint
defense strategy for the European Union at a summit a year ago in
St. Malo, on France's Normandy coast. The war in Kosovo this year,
where the United States provided most of the NATO airpower that
forced the withdrawal of Serbian forces, only brought the issue
more to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit meeting now follows weeks of tension over
France's refusal to lift a ban on British beef imposed in 1996 when
bovine spongiform encephalapathy, commonly known as ``mad cow
disease,'' was linked to a similar fatal, brain-wasting disease in
humans. Some 180,000 British cows were found to be infected with
mad cow disease. British ranchers then destroyed thousands of
cattle in an effort to eliminate the disease from their herds.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the European lifted the ban, saying British beef was
now safe for consumption. But the French refused to accept the
meat, saying there was new evidence that itwas unsafe. The
European Union reviewed the French allegations but rejected them.
Earlier this month, it began legal action against France. But
negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
   If France's food agency approves the new protocol, the country's
Socialist-led government is expected to lift the ban quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said:
``The French government asked for, and was given, more information
and assurances about measures being carried out to ensure the
safety of British beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the European Union country's, only France and Germany have
balked at lifting the ban on British beef. But several non EU
nations, including the United States, still maintain their bans.

BE THANKFUL FOR THE MACINTOSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Two weeks ago, I reviewed Apple's new iBook computer. Although
I praised the computer's industrial design and Apple's marketing
prowess, I couldn't resist taking a swipe at the Macintosh
operating system. Out on the Internet, I said, I had run into
problems _ particularly with Web sites that had been designed with
Windows users in mind, or those which required me to use programs
such as ``telnet'' or ``ftp.'' I also criticized the computer's
browsing speed, saying the iBook ran more slowly with my cable
modem than did my Pentium III desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known better than to say anything negative about
the Macintosh computer in print. Less than three hours after my
column hit the pavement, my in-box was filling up with hostile
e-mail from the Macintosh Faithful. People criticized my analysis,
said I had an inherent anti-Mac bias, and said I shouldn't blame
the MacOS system for the failings of Windows-centric Web designers.
One angry reader tried to organize a letter-writing campaign to the
Globe's ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   This reaction from Macintosh users is somewhat typical. Unlike
Windows users, Mac-heads are quick to circle their wagons and
attack the messenger whenever someone criticizes their beloved
system. Apple evangelists have even organized harassment campaigns
to ``reeducate'' journalists who have written unfavorable Macintosh
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than engage in another war of words, I want to call a
truce. On this Thanksgiving Day, I want to give public thanks for
the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the Macintosh is the friendliest,
easiest-to-use, and the most colorful computer on the market today.
The Mac is a pleasure to operate. It's a computer that respects its
user.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment you turn it on, the Mac brings a smile to your
face. Press the ``on'' switch of a typical Windows computer and
you'll hear a nasty ``beep.'' The Mac, in contrast, plays a
pleasant chord. One of the things that I hate about my Windows
computer is the way it is always interrupting me. I can be in the
middle of typing something in my word processor, but if another
program needs my attention, it pops a window up in my face,
demanding immediate attention. Unfortunately, if I don't
immediately stop typing, it's quite likely that one of my
keystrokes will inadvertantly trigger one of the buttons on the
pop-up, and before I know it I've told the computer to go off and
do something else _ what I'm not sure. Mac programs, on the other
hand, get your attention by pulsing the Apple icon in the
computer's upper-left hand corner. There they will wait patiently
until you decide to see what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers wanted to know why I reviewed Apple's MacOS 8.5
operating system, when Apple had just released version 9.0. The
reason, as I explained in my column, was that the iBook came with
MacOS 8.5 installed. It was only the day after my column ran in the
paper that Apple provided me with MacOS 9.0.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that same day I received a second operating system
in the mail: a copy of Windows 98 Second Edition. So that
afternoon, I upgraded both my iBook and my Windows desktop. The
experience gave me another reason to be thankful for the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The Macintosh upgrade was fast and painless. Following the
instructions on the CD, I put the CD in the iBook's CD-ROM drive,
held down the ``C'' key, and turned the computer on. The computer
booted from the CDROM. Next I ran the MacOS upgrader and was given
the choice of upgrading my current operating system or performing a
``clean install.'' (The clean install is useful if you have damaged
your computer and it will no longer boot.) I chose the upgrade
option; the job was finished in less than 10 minutes. When my
computer rebooted, it was running MacOS 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows upgrade was far more complicated. First, I had to
boot my computer into Windows and run the upgrade program from the
CD-ROM. Then I had to manually kill the ``MS-DOS'' box that I had
used to start up the upgrade program. Then I had to type an
activation key. Finally, I had to watch numerous Microsoft
advertisements for the next 40 minutes, and wait through two
reboots, until my computer was usable again. Microsoft has copied
so much from Apple _ it would be nice if they could copy the Mac's
ease-of-upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new operating system gives us a lot to be thankful for,
as well. Just as with Windows 95, the Mac now supports multiple
users, with different levels of privilege assignable to each. And
it has a cool ``auto-update'' feature that lets you download
operating system updates automatically over the Internet by
clicking a button. Although there is a similar feature built into
Windows 98, I've tried both and the Mac's is far easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Although programs such as ``ftp'' and ``telnet'' don't come with
the iBook, these programs are readily available on the Internet for
people who want to download them. And while it is true some Web
sites require ActiveX or Windows-specific helper-programs, most
don't. I'm thankful the Internet is equalizing many of the
differences between Mac users and PC users.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thankful for the stability of the Macintosh operating
system. Gone are the days when the Mac crashed every few hours.
These days the Mac is an incredibly reliable operating system _ far
more reliable than my Windows PC.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'm thankful for the Macintosh user community _ a vocal
group of computer enthusiasts who are always quick to criticize any
person or company that does not properly support their computer.

WILLETS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BC-VA. TECH SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a Thanksgiving tradition at the Willetts household
in Alexandria, Va. There was turkey and stuffin' on Thursday,
followed on Friday by a four-hour car ride south to Blacksburg to
watch Virginia Tech knock the stuffin' out of the University of
Virginia, the Hokies' archrival.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Thanksgiving was always went for Mike Willetts.
His parents, Randy and Susan, were Virginia Tech graduates and they
delighted in taking their eldest of two sons back to their alma
mater to watch the Hokies. Deep down, they dreamed one day of
making the same trip to watch their son play for Virginia Tech and
chant:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoki, Hoki, Hoki Hy!
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech! Tech! VPI!
</P>
<P>
   ``Sola-Rex Sola-Rah
</P>
<P>
   ``Polytech-Vir-gin-ia!
</P>
<P>
   ``Rae, Ri, VPI!''
</P>
<P>
   Friday Willetts will take part in his family tradition of turkey
and football. About 15 members of his family and 50 more high
school friends from West Potomac High will reunite to watch
Willetts play at Lane Stadium/Worsham Field.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be one important twist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of suiting up for the Hokies, Willetts will don a Boston
College jersey (No. 98) when the No. 20 Eagles (8-2 overall, 4-2
Big East) arrive for a Big East showdown against the second-ranked
Hokies (10-0, 6-0). It is a game that will have national
championship ramifications for Virginia Tech, which will be playing
for a slot in the Bowl Championship Series title game against
top-ranked Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much grew up around Virginia Tech football,'' said
Willetts. ``I would watch it, but they were never really any good.
I remember I would always go down for the UVa-Virginia Tech game,
which was usually played the day after Thanksgiving, but somehow
they always seemed to struggle. It's funny, but once I got to
college it seems that's when Virginia Tech really became good.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been exposed to Virginia Tech football all his
life, Willetts never really was excited about the prospect of
continuing the family legacy. Willetts had been recruited by
Tennessee and Florida, as well as the in-state schools, after he
wound up his senior season at West Potomac as Virginia's Defensive
Player of the Year. Practically everyone in his high school went to
Tech, but Willetts refused to follow the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to set myself apart from other people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he followed a path that eventually landed him in Chestnut
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Virginia, the city was different and I had a great
time coming here to visit,'' Willetts said. ``It was something new
and it was what I was looking for. Plus, at the time, we had just
beaten Notre Dame twice in a row and the D-Line was leading the
nation in sacks. So all those things played a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willetts said his parents never really attempted to steer him to
Virginia Tech, except for one notable exception when his father
took a detour to Blacksburg on the way back from a recruiting visit
to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the drive back from Tennessee, I was sleeping, and my dad
was driving through Virginia Tech and trying to show me around the
campus and stuff,'' Willetts said with a chuckle. ``But I'd been
there before when I was in high school to go down to visit buddies.
So, I kind of gave my dad a little attitude, I was like, `Dad, I'm
sleeping! I don't want to see the campus.' After that, my parents
were really good about it. The second I came here, they were no
longer Virginia Tech fans.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Willetts clan isn't likely to be torn when Mike lines up
with BC and attempts to knock the Hokies out of the national
championship race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a great player and he makes plays when he needs to make
plays,'' said senior defensive tackle Chris Hovan. ``When he gets
single-blocked, I know that Mike is going to make that tackle. I
know Mike is going to make that sack. I have total trust in Mike.
He's a great player and he's got the instincts to make the big
plays when he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch, 281-pound senior defensive tackle is BC's
sixth-leading tackler with 58 stops, including 36 solo and four
sacks for 20 yards in losses.In last week's 31-29 victory at Notre
Dame, Willetts did his part by making six tackles (including one
sack), breaking up a pass, and blocking one very huge extra-point
attempt by Jim Sanson that enabled BC to preserve a 3-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   He would like nothing more than to have an impact on the outcome
of the game against the Hokies, who shifted their traditional game
against Virginia to Oct. 2 in order to accommodate BC in the season
finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if we'd go to a bowl game or not, but I thought
we'd have a good shot at it,'' Willetts said. ``The way I looked at
it, I was like, `Man that could be my last game, you know?' It's
definitely going to be a nice way to end up _ a win over Virginia
Tech, with a 9-2 record, and a bowl game _ in front of everyone
whose close to me.''

Gaile Robinson. Here are their reviews.) ---
</P>
<P>
   By Katy Robinson &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The best thing at DisneyQuest? Designing my very own roller
coaster.
</P>
<P>
   The coasters can only be a certain length, and you pick the
speed _ slow, fast and, my choice, Hang On For Your Life. Then you
get to pick the setting of your coaster, in space, on a volcano, or
on an ice planet.
</P>
<P>
   Next you design it on a computer; you have tons of loops, barrel
rolls, twists and hills to pick from. When you're finished, your
coaster appears on the screen and gets tested for its scariness: If
five out of five people won't ride your coaster, then it's great,
but if everyone will ride it, then that's a pretty lame coaster.
Next, you choose words from two lists to come up with a wacky name.
Mine was the Astro Riot.
</P>
<P>
   Then you get to ride it. You get into a cylinder that has two
chairs with a bar that goes over your head, so it seems like you
are really on a roller coaster. You start moving along with the
ride; you go upside down, twist, turn or whatever you put in.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I thought riding the ride wasn't as much fun as
designing it. I didn't feel as if I were on a real roller coaster;
it wasn't as bumpy or as scary. I still think this ride was a very
good idea and I enjoyed every second of it.
</P>
<P>
   Other stuff I liked:
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster: Now, this isn't some kiddie
ride. This is just like bumper cars, except there are asteroids
flying at you. If one of them hits a spot on your car, your car
goes spinning in a tight circle. You need two people to play this:
one to drive and one to fire the asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Midway on the Moon: This section is filled with fun arcade games
like Basketball, Skee-Ball, Whack-an-Alien (similar to
Whack-a-Mole), and old games like Tron and Ms Pac Man.
</P>
<P>
   Sid's Create-A-Toy: Sid was the character from the movie ``Toy
Story'' who messed with the toys and tried to make new designs. In
this game, you look around Sid's room for bodies, heads, arms and
legs to create your very own toy. After you are done, you can even
buy the toy you just created.
</P>
<P>
   Animation Academy: Here you learn how to draw Disney characters.
The lesson takes about half an hour, and after you are finished you
get your picture and your diploma. You do draw on a computer, so it
is a little harder to do than on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Overall rating: When you're 13, you don't recommend anything.
But I'd go back. ---
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Robinson &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The best virtual reality game was ``Invasion! An Alien
Encounter.'' This game is for four people _ three gunners and one
driver. You start out on this world in a spider walker, trying to
save colonists who are being threatened by aliens. You have about
three and a half minutes to save 27 colonists; the driver must
execute jumps over lava rivers or move platform to platform.
</P>
<P>
   You will never save all the colonists; there is just not enough
time. Plus, the walker goes extremely slow, and the aliens move
fast. If you have good gunners, you may save most of the colonists.
But if you are playing with your mother, like I was, then you're
lucky if you get 15.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this game, you have to enter a transporter before
the world explodes. Then your percentage of kills or the number of
colonists you saved pops up on the screen, and you're given a
ranking. Overall, I give it five out of five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Other stuff I liked, and some I didn't:
</P>
<P>
   Ride the Comix: This is a virtual reality game where you and six
other people fight with these ``swords of light'' and defeat comic
monsters such as a mutant dog or a sewer gang on hover-bikes. I
hated the sword. You couldn't hit any of the enemies because you
couldn't swing far enough to hit them unless they got so close you
could feel their breath, even though you can't feel their breath.
One out of five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesecake Factory: The restaurant actually had good food, such
as pizza and hot sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Jungle Cruise: The setting is a prehistoric river. You
sit in a raft on an air bed and you get cheap paddles with rollers
on the ends. It was hard to steer the raft throughout the ride, and
your arms immediately got tired. There were squirts of water to add
to the effect, but all that did was make little spots on your
shirt. Two out of five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Hercules in the Underworld: Amusing and incredibly easy to play.
All you have to do is collect the lightning bolts scattered about
the game. This is played in a cramped closet where you stand in a
corner in front of your character's joystick. The story wasn't very
appealing to me, but then, it was designed for those who saw the
movie, and I didn't. Two out of five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Overall rating: If I could afford to go back I would, a couple
of times. But the plane trip and other transportation from Texas
was expensive.

SICKLE CELL TAKES ANOTHER VICTIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if she never said as much, you knew Kelley Lewis hated this
dance with death, even as you knew she hoped that sickle cell
disease would someday be curable.
</P>
<P>
   Not in time for her, perhaps, but for the thousands of others
who know the disease's debilitating pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not in my life,'' she told me in September during
National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month. ``But it'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's how it is when you've spent your life in and out of
the hospital, struggling to get through another crisis, feeling
each time as if you've been run over by a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way I know how to describe it,'' Lewis said.
``One day I'm feeling OK, and the next I may be in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound depressing to most of us, but Lewis discussed
her plight as if she were on her way to a vacation spot in the
Caribbean, not the sterile environs of a hospital ward.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, hope isn't enough. Kelley Lewis died Oct. 29. She
was 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for sickle cell disease, an inherited chronic
anemia in which oxygen-deprived blood cells become sickle-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome varies considerably in severity and often results
in extreme fatigue and widespread, life-threatening organ damage.
Some people live long and nearly normal lives; others, like Lewis,
are plagued by strokes and painful crises.
</P>
<P>
   One in 12 people in Tarrant and Denton counties carries the
sickle cell trait, according to Pearl Jones, executive director of
the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America/Greater Fort Worth.
And contrary to popular belief, the disease is not limited to
African-Americans such as Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But many contend that funding for research would be more
generous if the disease did not primarily affect blacks and a small
percentage of people of Mediterranean, East Indian and Middle
Eastern descent.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kelley Lewis believed. Her mother, Sandra, still
does. She wants us to help, to begin to donate to sickle cell
research so that no one else has to endure the pain her daughter
did, so that no one else has to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to try,'' she said recently.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time after Kelley and I talked that day in September,
I thought about her. One moment she was telling me she was sure
she'd die before a cure came, and the next she talked about her
hope for other sickle cell sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   A good friend of hers told me that that's how Kelley Lewis was.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was more worried about everybody else than herself,''
Caryn Perry said. ``This last time she went in the hospital, I told
her I was coming to see her and she said no, to take care of my
kids, I didn't need to be worrying about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's memory is filled with such stories about her friend.
There was the time they went to a thrift shop and Kelley bought
clothes for Perry's youngest daughter; and the time she gave Perry
$20 for a pregnancy test even though her illness prevented her from
holding a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a wonderful, wonderful human being,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis' body grew tired. She spent Oct. 11, her 30th
birthday, at home, surrounded by friends and relatives. The next 17
days were spent in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, her dance with death was over.

   NEW YORK _ Adriana Reyneri and her two young sons, Jake and
Luke, were exploring FAO Schwartz in Manhattan on Wednesday when
they stopped in front of a display for ``Toy Story 2,'' the sequel
to the 1995 animated movie.
</P>
<P>
   The toys tied to the movie are expected to be big sellers this
holiday season, but Ms. Reyneri of Northbrook, Ill., gave them a
thumbs down. ``This is the Pokemon Christmas for us,'' she said
resolutely as her boys nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, Furby. Get a life, Beanie Babies. Pokemon now rules.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to another hit movie, Pokemon items are
disappearing from the shelves faster than you can say, ``I choose
you, Pikachu.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as one in five of the toys, games and books given to
children this holiday season _ which the industry counts on for its
profits _ will be based on Pokemon, said Chris Byrne, the editor of
The Toy Report, a weekly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Toys `R' Us, said, ``Kids
can't seem to get enough of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they may not get exactly what they want. Some of the most
popular Pokemon items, like trading cards and Pikachu dolls that
also say their name, are in short supply in some places. ``We're
making them as quickly as we can,'' said Wayne S. Charness, a
spokesman for Hasbro, the company that is expected to clean up on
Pokemon this year, along with its Tiger Electronics and Wizards of
the Coast subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by last year's disappointing season and ever optimistic
when it comes to projections, the Toy Manufacturers of America
expects sales of toys and video games to jump 6 percent this year,
to a record $28 billion. Sales were virtually flat last year, after
early predictions of 4 percent gains, in part because behemoth Toys
`R' Us lost its footing, and action figures and dolls did poorly.
</P>
<P>
   This year, merchants and toy makers seem to be counting on
growth fed by a widespread selection of technologically advanced
merchandise, appealing because, at least in theory, it stands a
better chance of holding a child's interest beyond Christmas
morning.
</P>
<P>
   These items are intended for jaded children like Jared Carr, 6,
of Chicago, who has not been smitten by Pokemon, a craze that
evolved from a Japanese cartoon series. ``It's really popular, but
they don't do anything,'' said Jared, who had his eye on a
radio-controlled toy bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   The big sellers are expected to include some familiar names in
new incarnations. Among them will be Rock and Roll Elmo and Rock
and Roll Ernie ($30), well known ``Sesame Street'' characters
licensed by Fisher-Price, part of Mattel Corp.. Then there is
Flight Control Buzz Lightyear ($40) and Strumming' Singing' Woody
($25) from ``Toy Story 2,'' all made by Mattel. The popularity of
televised wrestling has also spawned a collection of figures that
would make Jesse Ventura proud.
</P>
<P>
   Not every television and movie tie-in is a sure thing, though.
Star Wars toys, introduced by Hasbro earlier this year to accompany
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' have been
disappointing. ``Toys are really a fashion business,'' said Michael
L. Glazer, the chief executive of KayBee Toys, the chain of 1,400
stores owned by Consolidated Stores Corp. ``The life cycle is
really short.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, which makes the Star Wars items, has smartly diversified
in recent years so it is not dependent on the big tie-in. Furby and
Pokemon products should more than make up for the Star Wars
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft effectively admitted defeat in the toy business
earlier this year by discontinuing its $60 line of Actimate
Teletubbies, which proved to be high priced for toddlers, who do
not necessarily need such indulgences. ``If they don't talk, they
can't ask for it,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst at Gerard Klauer
Mattison. ``A 1-year-old will take whatever you give him.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the more promising offerings are Furby Babies ($30), which
were spawned by last year's Furby craze and have ``20 percent more
vocabulary and 200 percent more interactivity'' than their
progenitors, said Charness of Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The babies speak more words, and they're cuter,'' said
Margaret Morgan, 12, of Memphis. Better still, there is no sign of
shortage. ``Furby,'' said McGowan, ``is going to do five times the
volume of last year because it's available.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A Yoda toy, inspired by Furby, was supposed to reach stores for
the holidays but will not appear until next year because of
production delays stemming from the Taiwan earthquake, Charness
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies appear to have run their course and are being
discontinued after this year, which could, of course, lead to a
spike in holiday sales, and which could be just a prelude to
another line extension, a la Furby Babies.
</P>
<P>
   After losing ground in recent years, Barbie is making a comeback
_ a turnaround that Jim Silver, one of the publishers of Toy
Wishes, a new consumer buying guide, said is directly linked to the
waning popularity of Beanie Babies, even though the two items do
not share the same store aisles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A miscalculation by Mattel led to a glut of Holiday Barbies in
past years and turned off consumers, especially collectors who
expect prices of their limited editions to rise. Millennium Barbie
($30), dressed in a blue velvet gown with silver trim, was the
second best-selling toy in the country in October after Furby,
according to the NPD Group, a company that compiles sales figures
for the Toy Manufacturers of America. The sales are especially
important to Mattel, which is reeling from a series of missteps,
including a disappointing acquisition of the Learning Company and
inventory management problems last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Ally, big sister to last year's Amazing Amy, is another
heavily promoted doll, this one from Playmates. Ally, whose mouth
moves when she is talking, tells stories and jokes and can remember
birthdays. But her ``friendship'' costs $60. ``It's for the
grandparent who wants to buy a granddaughter a toy that is really
elaborate,'' said Jill Bilzi, the editor of Playthings, an industry
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Those girls' brothers may be asking for wrestling figures with
infrared sensors that can recognize and taunt one another (WCW Tuff
Talkin' Wrestlers at $40 by Toy Biz) or others (WWF Titan Tron Live
Series at $32 by Jakks Pacific) that can recite dialogue downloaded
from the Internet. For kids (or parents) who prefer more polite
conversation, Mattel makes Chat Pals ($40), based on characters
from ``Winnie-the-Pooh.'' Other popular toys are likely to include
Toy Biz's Kindergarten Babies ($20), aromatic descendants of the
Cabbage Patch dolls who would rather be sniffed than heard.

<P>
   As no parent needs to be told, with 5,000 new toys produced each
year, demand is usually fueled by advertising dollars. FamilyFun
magazine tested 66 toys by giving several hundred children across
the country three weeks to play with them. Only a handful of the
toys preferred by the children have been named as hot prospects by
people in the toy industry.
</P>
<P>
   In video games, however, no such test was needed to determine
that the cutting-edge Sega Dreamcast (especially with the Sega
Sports NFL 2 game) is everyone's favorite. Despite the $200 price
tag, the consoles are hard to find. ``We sold out the first day,''
said Ms. McLaughlin of Toys `R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Given the price, some shrewd parents are advising their children
to wait until next year, when the next generation of the popular
Sony Playstation comes out, said Silver of Toy Wishes. ``They're
telling them it's going to be better,'' he said of Playstation 2.
</P>
<P>
   Spending Saturday afternoon at a toy store may not be every
parent's idea of a good time, but buying over the Internet is
expected to account for just 1 percent of total toy and game sales
this year, according to several stock analysts who specialize in
e-commerce. ``A lot of people are just not going to entrust their
kids' holiday gifts to the Net,'' said Seema Williams, an analyst
with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. And many shoppers still
have security concerns, Ms. Williams said, about providing credit
card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reports of service, inventory and delivery problems
with the online toy sites could scare last-minute shoppers away.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been a source of frustration for Toys `R' Us as
it tries to recover from poor performance last year at its stores
and the surge in sales and publicity that went to its new online
rival, Etoys.com. Earlier this month, after Toys `R' Us distributed
62 million catalogs praising its online capability, its Web site
was overwhelmed. A company spokeswoman, Leeann Lavin, acknowledged
that the company experienced a ``site slowdown due to the volume of
visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lavin said toyrus.com had responded by increasing its
Internet capacity and extending its holiday discount through the
end of November. The promotion enabled Toys `R' Us to pull ahead of
Etoy.com in number of visitors for the week ended Nov. 14 (the most
recent week for which figures are available), according to Media
Metrix, an Internet measurement company that uses a panel of people
to gauge traffic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Small as it is, Internet sales are expected to account for much
of the future growth in the toy industry. Ms. Williams predicted
that Internet toy sales would rise to $3.7 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   While adults may want to see a product before buying it,
children's selections can be as simple as a click. ``Kids know
exactly what they want,'' said Christopher E. Vroom, a toy stocks
analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, in San Francisco. ``They're a
very focused customer group.''

COMMENTARY: G-8 MINUS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Yeltsin ``family'' and its new KGB front man,
Vladimir Putin, came up with a plan to regain popularity in the
coming elections: Use foreign funds to build up the army and _
under the pretext of anti-terrorism _ exterminate the militant
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's working. The Russian generals, humiliated by the
independence forces five years ago, are using new tactics that
inflict civilian casualties with missiles and artillery. Controlled
media show victories, not 200,000 pitiful Chechen refugees or
Russian body bags. The Yeltsin-Putin party's popularity is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   As hubris takes over, the invading forces are being equipped
with gas masks. Purely defensive, of course; Gen. Stanislav Petrov
told Interfax that ``the bandits are preparing to use highly toxic
chemical weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West, conventional wisdom says that this time the Russian
Army will triumph. The Chechens are divided and impoverished; their
key cities are being leveled. Outgunned and disillusioned, facing
the terror of fuel-air explosives and Petrov's troops in gas masks,
they have supposedly lost the will to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Clinton administration has lost the will to
discourage this politically inspired war of ethnic extermination.
``The last thing I think we should be doing,'' says Madeleine
Albright, ``is trying to turn Russia back into an enemy.'' No
diplomatic consequences for indiscriminate killing; no stoppage of
Western aid now being used to buy missiles and shells; just a few
hand-wringing Clinton statements on how terrible it all is.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the conventional wisdom is mistaken. It could be that
the Chechens will adapt to the new Russian tactics, and instead of
defending towns, wage hit-and-run guerrilla war. Afghan allies may
infiltrate; Muslim money may ship in weapons; occupying troops may
be ambushed; and in time, Russian casualties will be revealed.
Irrational Chechen grit has been underrated by both Stalin and
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   If the war should drag on, the current tide of hubris would ebb.
A few voices in Russia's press would wonder about the perpetrators
of apartment-house bombings and other atrocities now conveniently
blamed on Chechen terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what the next year in Chechnya will bring, other
than blood and hatred. Nor can we tell what Russian candidate will
be riding high in next summer's election. (A month ago, Yevgeny
Primakov led all the polls; a year before, Boris Nemtsov shot to
the top; the only consistent winner is ``none of the above.'')
</P>
<P>
   But government savagery must have its consequences. Russia's
``enemy'' is its own militarism. As thousands are murdered and
hundreds of thousands flee, we cannot adopt the Albright Corollary
to the Clinton Doctrine: ``We are trying very hard to keep our eye
on the ball about what is important.''
</P>
<P>
   What is important is to provide disincentives to despotism.
Suspend U.S. Export-Import Bank lending. End the self-deluding
practice of continuing to allow Russia not to repay the money it
owes the IMF. Make certain the money we give Russia to dismantle
nuclear weapons is used only for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Russia's renewed bloody-mindedness
should impel us to admit the Baltic nations to NATO. We should
redirect our credits propping up Russia over to its southern
neighbors Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, we should take up an idea being put forward by
Zbigniew Brzezinski: Bring back the Group of Seven.
</P>
<P>
   Because we wanted to encourage Russia to embrace democratic
capitalism, the world's leading industrial nations invited Russia
in _ thereby becoming the Group of Eight. This built up Yeltsin's
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia does not rate membership on the basis of its economy
_ only on the basis of its potential as a civilized society. By
virtue of its savage attack on civilians in Chechnya, the
Yeltsin-Putin regime does not deserve membership in that informal
league of the advanced industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Only when it stops killing innocent people for the purpose of
improving poll ratings and remaining in power should that
militarist regime be invited to a summit meeting of the Group of
Seven.
</P>
<P>
   The West cannot intervene militarily. But we're not helpless.

COMMENTARY: THE COURAGE TO LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The education of young girls was supposed to have ceased when
the Taliban took power in Afghanistan a few years ago. It was
outlawed. The stifling cloak of ignorance was to have been thrown
like a burqa over the country's females.
</P>
<P>
   But quietly, and with very little in the way of resources, brave
groups of Afghan women have been conducting underground classes for
girls in private homes and other secret locations.
</P>
<P>
   I've been in touch with women who are running at least 30 home
schools in Herat, Kabul and Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say that we are scared,'' said one. ``Not for
ourselves. But, of course, there is the fear the program may be
stopped. We have that fear every day that we go to work. So we
don't want to make a huge noise about it. The community is behind
us, protecting us. They know what we are doing. We operate quietly
and all day long we keep the classes going.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers get a small salary and are specially trained for
their delicate mission. Most had at least five years of classroom
experience before the Taliban banned schooling for girls. The
number of grades that are taught varies with each operation, but
the schools seldom go beyond the sixth grade. Books and other
supplies are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   A home school typically gets started as follows: A female
teacher, now barred from working, decides she wants to somehow
continue teaching. She discusses this with members of her extended
family, usually over tea. If the family supports the effort, then
neighbors begin to be included. Word spreads. Pupils who are
considered ``safe,'' who can be trusted not to reveal the existence
of the school to those who might betray it, are recruited. A home
in which classes can be conducted is selected.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts, initially uncoordinated, are now getting a small
measure of professional support from organizations committed to
relieving the misery imposed by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of one of those organizations told me she had mixed
feelings about talking to the press. She asked that neither her
name nor the name of her group be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need publicity, but at the same time we have to be very
careful,'' she said. ``Right now there are so many people coming to
us, so many people who want schools to open that it's overwhelming.
But it is impossible for us to respond to them because we don't
have enough funding. We are teaching about 1,000 girls now but the
funding is so limited we cannot provide them with even the books
that they need. We tell the teachers to try to teach in a way that
doesn't depend so much on books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing breaks my heart. These kids are like any
other kids. We had one little girl, she was 12, who said, `I love
this school!' Her father had died and she was very lonely and a
school was started right next door to her. These kids want to learn
like any other kids want to learn. They are desperate, so we have
to help them. And we need help in order to do that. But at the same
time I'm afraid for the life of my personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the teachers were reminded repeatedly to draw as little
attention to themselves as possible. ``They go according to Islamic
rule and Islamic law. We accept it. We encourage them to remain
covered. We are not defiant.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the schools, while clearly a form of resistance, had
not been created with that in mind. ``When we give the policies and
procedures to our teachers, we say, `OK, what is our objective
here?' And the answer is to educate our children, to keep the door
of education open.''
</P>
<P>
   I first learned of the home schools from Ruth Messinger, the
president of American Jewish World Service, an organization in New
York that is providing some of the funding for the 30 schools in
Herat, Kabul and Jalalabad. The Global Fund for Children is also
providing funding. The money is routed, for technical and security
reasons, through a human rights group in Dearborn, Mich., called
Creating Hope International.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Messinger said of the women and girls in Afghanistan: ``This
is a community that is facing oppression and violence beyond our
imagination, and they have nevertheless taken their future into
their own hands. We are very proud to stand with them.''

THOUSANDS EXPECTED TO ATTEND VIGIL AT TEXAS A&AMP;M

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid growing concerns about lax safety standards in the
construction of the Aggie Bonfire, tens of thousands of Texas A&AMP;M
students and alumni will gather on campus Thursday night for a
``remembrance'' of the 12 who died in last week's collapse of the
massive log pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said 50,000, some have said twice that,''
said A&AMP;M spokesman Jonathan Kraatz, referring to the potential size
of the crowd. ``We don't really know.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has about 43,000 students, but graduates and
others are expected to swell attendance at the unstructured vigil
near Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M is about 90 miles northwest of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The vigil will begin at sundown on the field where the Bonfire
would have been ignited in a ritual dating back nearly a century.
There is no planned program, no scheduled speakers and no time
limit for the vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can stay as long as they want to stay,'' Kraatz said.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. CST, however, a ``yell practice'' will begin at Kyle
Field, walking distance from the Bonfire site, and most of the
crowd is expected to attend that, Kraatz said. In the past, the
``yell practice'' has begun at midnight, following the Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the woodpile last Thursday morning, the
Bonfire was canceled for only the second time since 1909, the first
being after the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. But,
criticism of the event following the fatal tragedy has threatened
to cancel it for good.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the university administration began laying the
groundwork for an investigation into the collapse of the log
structure. A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen was expected to announce by
week's end the names of those appointed to a commission to study
what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas Board of Professional Engineers disclosed plans to
determine if the Texas Engineering Practices Act applies to the
Aggie Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires state and local governments to file plans with
the engineering board and provide for a licensed professional
engineer to oversee construction of building projects that could
affect public safety or welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law does not mention anything about a pile of logs that
are going to be burned,'' said Jimmy Smith, interim director of the
engineering board. ``There is no precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the Aggie Bonfire was just a pile of logs and
other trash wood. In the 1940s and 1950s, it became much more
sophisticated _ a multitiered structure of bundled logs stacked on
end to a height of 55 feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some engineering professors raised questions
about the safety of the pile and a construction handbook was
developed.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Larry Grosse, a former A&AMP;M construction science
professor and Bonfire adviser for 13 years, said he believes the
structure collapsed because safety and design features spelled out
in that handbook were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Among the safety measures he helped develop: interlocking the
tiers of logs, driving some of the bottom level logs into the
ground, and lashing the first two levels with steel cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, there was not someone overseeing all of this to make
sure it was being done,'' Grosse, now a professor at Colorado State
University in Fort Collins, told WFAA-TV in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the tiers were simply placed one on top of
another and the logs were held together by wire.
</P>
<P>
   Grosse said the handbook also specified that only students with
two years experience in building the Bonfire would be allowed above
the first level. That condition also was not enforced this year.
Some freshmen have told reporters that they were working as high as
the fourth tier.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, an administrator who has been Bonfire adviser
for two years, acknowledged that all of the handbook procedures had
not been followed, but he told reporters he was comfortable with
the safety measures that were enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but earlier
he was quoted by The Associated Press as saying: ``I don't think
the fact that there were freshmen or sophomores on the stack was
the reason it fell. Something went wrong somewhere within that
stack.''
</P>
<P>

(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As the final plans for the memorial vigil were being made, about
120 passengers of a charter flight to California, where one of the
victims was being buried, returned to Texas after a lengthy delay
caused by mysterious damage to their airplane.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane landed in Stockton and the Aggie delegation, led
by Bowen, had departed for nearby Turlock, maintenance crews found
a hole in the wing flap of the chartered Boeing 737. The cause of
the damage was not immediately determined, but lightning was a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had been scheduled to return Tuesday evening to
College Station, but it wasn't until Wednesday afternoon that a
replacement jet was found, according to an airport official in
Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, three students remained hospitalized Wednesday, while
another was released.
</P>
<P>
   John Comstock of Richardson and Dominic Braus of Hallettsville
were still in critical and fair condition, respectively, at College
Station Medical Center. William Davis of Bellaire was listed in
fair condition at St. Joseph's Regional Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Milton ``Chip'' Thiel of Livingston was released from St.
Joseph's on Wednesday.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ On a Saturday morning here, there is only one
possible place to be, at least for parents with children under 10.
Dr. Edward M. Hallowell is at a soccer game. His son Jack, 7, is
playing for the Maroon team; his wife, Sue Hallowell, is team
manager. Because this is Cambridge, ground zero for self-conscious
parenting, every soccer team has been taught to chant, ``One, two,
three, four _ We don't care about the score!''
</P>
<P>
   Hallowell, 49, a child and adult psychiatrist, is the author of
``Connect,'' a book that argues the necessity of human
connectedness in the interest of health and happiness. So how does
he square connecting and competing? Even 8-and-under soccer, he
would argue, is more than little boys in shorts and shin guards
running themselves breathless on a bright fall morning; it, too, is
a form of connection.
</P>
<P>
   As the game starts, the woman who coaches the Maroon team
admonishes the adults, ``Parents _ we don't scream orders! We just
say good things!'' When Jack gets subbed in, and his mother and
father (``we don't care about the score'' momentarily set aside) go
on instant parent alert, leaning forward when he has the ball,
following him with their body language: ``Go on! Get it! Shoot,
Shoot, Shoot!''
</P>
<P>
   When talking to the avatar of family connection amid the falling
leaves of a Massachusetts autumn, when hearing about the vital
importance of establishing, re-establishing, deepening and
maintaining ties with immediate and extended family, a person
cannot but think: Oh-oh. Thanksgiving!
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, Thanksgiving is the zinger of family
connectedness,'' he admitted. ``There always is conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to his theories, there is still hope. That's
because it is better to fight over which tablecloth to use and who
last spoke to cousin Robin, than not to gather around the table at
all. Yes, he believes there is connectedness even in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the extended family is there for the connecting.
``Instead of holding your nose and getting through it, which is
what most of us do,'' said Hallowell, ``try saying, `Maybe I'll
plant a few seeds this Thanksgiving.' And maybe by next
Thanksgiving, you won't have to hold your nose that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   No. He does not mean planting a few seeds of envy, about the new
car you are getting, or spite, about your sister-in-law losing her
job. He means facing each other and hashing out the problems that
stand between you.
</P>
<P>
   Hallowell will say things like ``It's better to connect than to
make $1 million dollars.'' But don't we all know that? Isn't it the
Hollywood cliche (think Bedford Falls at Christmas), the greeting
card truth we all subscribe to and then ignore?
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, Hallowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallowell, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Medical School and
an expert on attention deficit disorder, has turned his focus on
the squishy area of feelings and found that feeling good is good
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are unaware of the body of scientific data he cites.
``Social isolation is as much a risk factor for dying as cigarette
smoking,'' he said. ``This is not a `Well, people have a lot of
feelings left over from the '60s, hearts and flowers thing.'' In
other words, there's a reason to go to Thanksgiving dinner besides
the gravy and pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Hallowell combines the data on social isolation and
family connection with a large body of practical, homey advice. He
is not unlike the family nag _ or sage _ you ignored for years,
until you realized she had been right all along.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that his advice is hard to follow. Common sense
or not, this is no quick route to feeling good about yourself. What
it often comes down to on Thanksgiving is dealing with what
Hallowell calls one's family of origin. Make sure you see everyone
in your family of origin at least once a year, he writes. Speak to
everyone at least once a month, make up with family members from
whom you are estranged, don't take no for an answer, discuss how
they feel about the family.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but what about the alcoholics and the nasties and the just
plain crazies? What about those people who are genuinely difficult?
Do people have to connect to them?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what every family is like!'' he said. ``The norm for
families is rage, conflict, irresolvable difficulty. Instead of
just trying to avoid explosions and survive, which is what most of
us do, try to go deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will mean a big fight and more conflict,'' he said.
``Maybe it will get messy and dirty. It's just that simple and just
that hard. Everybody has a reason why their situation is
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He's on a roll now. ``Life is impossible. Families are
impossible.'' He paused dramatically. ``But it isn't. If you're
willing to shed some blood and swallow some pride, you can get to a
better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallowell's common-sense advice is grounded in real family life,
both his own and his patients'. The message is not delivered as a
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be the first to identify the missing ingredient in
many lives,'' said Publisher's Weekly, ``but he can claim authority
of a splendid articulation.'' That authority often comes from
self-exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In order to write his books, Hallowell goes into sometimes
harrowing detail about himself and his family. His father was
manic-depressive, his mother married an alcoholic and abusive
stepfather, whom he called Uncle Noble.
</P>
<P>
   How abusive?
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter ``Speaking Personally,'' he writes, ``Things
happened back then that shouldn't have.'' He describes his father
taking him downstairs in the middle of the night in the family home
in Charleston, S.C., to see his mother, lying naked on the bed,
surrounded by three of his father's friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen my mother naked, so that in itself was a
shock.'' Even more upsetting was what they were doing: shooting
craps against his mother's bare backside. ``Uncle Noble asked me if
I wanted to play,'' he writes. He was not yet 10.
</P>
<P>
   He says in ``Connect'' that he had always felt that if people
knew his story they would think less of him, and that he felt
tainted. He writes about all this to show the human connections
that saved him, the teachers at boarding school who recognized him
and helped him through. After fifth grade, those boarding schools
``became my home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he made his peace with Charleston. ``I went back to
the city where I had learned how to hate,'' he writes. His mother
and stepfather are both dead, as is his real father. But he went
back to the big brick house he remembered as a font of sadness and
worry in his childhood, and he made his peace with that. ``It is a
mistake to disconnect yourself from who you were and where you've
been,'' he writes. ``It's better to reconcile.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Arlington, in a large sunny house on a hill, the
Hallowell family is connecting through chaos in a kitchen filled
with soccer trophies, children's art supplies, school schedules.
Jack and the other Hallowell son, Tucker, 4, are eating lunch,
along with their 10-year-old sister, Lucy. Lucy is named for her
distinguished foremother, Lucretia Mott, a heroine in the battle
for women's suffrage and Hallowell's direct ancestor. One child is
doing acrobatics on a kitchen chair while eating a bowl of Ramen
noodle soup; the daughter clearly feels she knows much more than
her parents. Their keeshond dog, Pippi, is running around the
kitchen, hoping for spilled food.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hallowell and his wife seem unguarded about letting a
visitor see the squabbling and the bumps of family life. ``This is
who we are,'' he said. ``We don't feel we have to be the Partridge
family. I can't be a perfect parent.'' He and his wife seem, in
fact, most delighted when their children fail to toe the party
line: ``Oh, Dad, not this again!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hallowell is probably best known for ``Driven to Distraction,''
the 1995 book he wrote with Dr. John J. Ratey about attention
deficit disorder. It is the kind of book that changes people's
thinking. People read it and say, this explains my child, this
explains my whole life.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a leap from attention deficit to the subject of
connectedness, but Hallowell does not think so. He reached a point
where he saw the world becoming distracting for everyone. ``I was
seeing all this worry, the combination of this speeded-up,
electronically superconnected age, and the way we're
interpersonally disconnected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more speeded up and electronically superconnected than
Hallowell. In his travels and lecture tours, he has visited every
state except Alaska. His wife, Sue, 43, a social worker with a
part-time practice in Cambridge, said that because of his travels
``it's important for me to be at home more.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there is an obvious question coming. ``I write a book
about `connect,' how connected am I at home?'' He makes an obvious
effort to be as connected as possible, and when he's on the road,
he stays in touch through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Note: his book cites a Carnegie-Mellon study that found
correlations between depression and loneliness and the amount of
time people spent on the computer. Yet he is a ferocious e-mailer.
He seems to make a habit of e-mailing people to tell them to e-mail
other people _ an electronic daisy chain of connections. The
paradox of the modern age, he says, is that the same technology
that speeds life up and smothers us in information makes it
possible to respond to each other through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   He relies on his wife to remind him of things like potluck
dinners. They both try to make sure that family life doesn't get
lost in the shuffle. That's because, he said, ``what we did this
morning, both parents going to a game, never happened for me in my
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Lucy, interrupted. ``Enough with the sad stuff,
Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the sad stuff that ends up motivating me,'' her
father answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Hallowells assembled for a photograph; all five members of
the family piled onto a couch plus Pippi. Five pairs of sneakers,
large and small, were kicked off on the floor. There was no
possible way to keep everyone on the couch and not poking one
another and not blocking one another and not making a stupid face.
It is a happy chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are the issues of the prophet in his own home,
where connection is Daddy's hobbyhorse, and Lucy pronounces,
``Connect, connect, connect,'' with the I've-heard-all-this-before
intonation of a bored 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having kids keeps me humble, teaches me I don't have the
answers, teaches me how surprising life can be,'' Hallowell said.
``Jack once observed, `I don't know why anyone would want to hear
you talk,''' his father recounts proudly.
</P>
<P>
   People have asked him, he goes on, somewhat ruefully, ``Ned,
when are you going to run out of personal problems you can write
books about?''
</P>
<P>
   But that misses the point: ``I'm trying to normalize having
problems,'' he said. ``Life is problems, life is conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy Thanksgiving.

   ``Hitler's Niece''
</P>
<P>
   by Ron Hansen
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, $25
</P>
<P>
   Before Eva Braun there was Angelika Raubal, known affectionately
as Geli by Adolf Hitler and members of his family and inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   In his splendid historical novel, ``Hitler's Niece,''
distinguished novelist Ron Hansen makes a compelling case that Geli
was the great love of the Fuhrer's life, although he married Eva
just before ending her life and his as the curtain descended on the
Third Reich ``Gotterdammerung'' in a Berlin bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eva Braun was to Hitler the ``girl at my disposal in
Munchen'' for 14 years, Hansen, in an afterword to his compelling
story, quotes Hitler as having told his secretary a few months
before the end: ``Eva is very nice, but only Geli could have
inspired in me genuine passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Geli died Sept. 18, 1931, of a gunshot wound. Her death was
officially ruled a suicide. But rumors have abounded that the
Fuhrer either killed her or had it done. Through the years, many
books and magazine articles have speculated about Hitler's
relationship with a woman 19 years younger than he was, and about
the tragic end of the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the preponderance of that speculation weighs in against
Hitler's version, the issue is now moot. But Hansen does not allow
that inconclusiveness to stand in the way of a good story.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of spinning a fascinating yarn out of a historical
footnote, Hansen casts the Fuhrer and his cronies in an almost
comedic light. They are still monsters. But they are flawed,
pathetic characters, who have to be taken seriously only because of
the enormity of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A short dialogue captures the glaring irony in the way those
megalomaniacal mediocrities saw themselves, and the way they really
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got in, he (Heinrich Hoffman) said, `I've just heard
a good one. What is an Aryan's Nordic ideal?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Tell me.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `To be thin like Goring, tall like Goebbels, and blond like
Hitler.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The story is set against the background of jarring political
upheaval in Germany between the end of World War I and Hitler's
climb to the threshold of dictatorial power. That greater story
elevates to a higher significance the smaller drama of Hitler's
relationship with the daughter of his half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the worst-kept secret in Germany. She shares an
apartment with him in Munich. She and her mother live with him and
keep house for him in Obersaltzburg in Bavaria. He spends lavishly
on Geli's clothes and education, and she accompanies her uncle to
many social events, where his possessiveness is much in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A young man spends too much time dancing and conversing with
Geli on one of those occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clenching his jaw, Hitler held the large twenty-two-year-old
in his scalding eyes until Schirach's fortitude, his friendliness,
the flush in his feminine cheeks were all gone,'' Hansen writes. ``
`She is with me,' Hitler said, and she followed him as he went to
where Rudolf Hess was holding the coats.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret that no one knows, except some of his closest inner
circle, is that Hitler is impotent. His sexual encounters with
women, including Geli, are bizarre and unnatural.
</P>
<P>
   Geli's disgust with Hitler's sexual perverseness and his
smothering domination ultimately leads to her death at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reader suspects early on how the strange
relationship between Hitler and his beautiful niece will end, that
predictability does not ruin the climax, which is handled
masterfully.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sex in the novel is graphic, it is not
pornographic. To his great credit, Hansen resists the temptation to
produce an exploitative piece of sexual titillation. Instead, he
has delivered a jewel of fact-based fiction that explores important
moral and political issues, and teases the reader into thinking:
``Yes, it could have happened that way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States government, which acts as steward and
protector of the nation's environment, is itself the worst polluter
in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have contaminated more than 60,000 sites across
the country and the cost of cleaning up the mess is officially
expected to approach $300 billion, nearly five times the price of
environmental destruction caused by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the real cost is likely tens of billions of dollars more,
according to government audits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every military base and nuclear arms facility in the
country is contaminated. The pollution extends from the US Mint,
which releases hazardous chemicals into the air when producing
commemorative coins, to the national parks, where leaky oil tanks
and raw sewage are polluting pristine rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Environmental Protection Agency, charged with enforcing
the country's environmental laws, has been fined for violating
toxic waste laws at its laboratories. At the EPA's lab in
Lexington, Mass., for example, mercury was discovered leaching into
the ground water three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of government pollution has been severe and
widespread. Some of the most contaminated spots on earth are the
property of the United States. The toxic waste has been linked to
increased cases of cancer and other illnesses for those living near
such sites.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pollution is historical residue that can be blamed
on some of the century's defining events: America's quest to put a
man on the moon to winning the Cold War against the former Soviet
Union. But the polluting by federal agencies is perpetuated by a
system in which there are often two sets of rules: one for the
government and another for private companies. There is also growing
concern among environmentalists and some enforcement officials that
instead of getting tougher with government polluters, Congress and
federal regulators are creating new loopholes and further relaxing
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sites have been cleaned up, but the government remains
the nation's premiere environmental felon,'' said Jonathan Turley,
a lawyer who directs George Washington University's Environmental
Crimes Project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legacy of pollution, federal agencies remain exempt
from some environmental laws. Only last month, in a move that
surprised regulators, Congress added language to a budget bill that
would make it virtually impossible for the EPA to fine the military
for environmental violations.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also caught in a classic conflict of interest:
It is both the criminal and the cop.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, federal regulators have been accused of ignoring
evidence of environmental recklessness by their official brethren.
But even when doing their job, the regulators are handicapped. The
government can sue private companies to force them to clean up
contaminated sites and if warranted, take criminal action against
the firms and their employees. Yet those tools are off-limits to
officials when the polluter is the government itself.
</P>
<P>
   The result, critics say, is a system where the deck is stacked
in favor of the federal agency that violates the environment. ``The
government,'' said Virginia attorney Harry Kelso, a former federal
environmental crimes prosecutor, ``has a license to pollute.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's sewage problem
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every summer tourists migrate to Yellowstone National Park to
admire the ancient canyons, the magic of ``Old Faithful,'' and the
dark blue lakes and rivers that make up the 3,400-square-mile
historic site.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors from across the world admire the natural wonders,
the antiquated sewage system at the park struggles behind the
scenes to process the waste generated at park lodges and public
toilets. It often fails.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, tens of thousands of gallons of raw
sewage have flowed untreated into the lakes and streams of
Yellowstone National Park, in clear violation of the federal Clean
Water Act. Park officials have been embarrassed by the
contamination, but complain that for years their pleas to Congress
to upgrade the system have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   If the park were the property of a private company _ and not the
federal government _ the state of Wyoming or the EPA could punish
the polluter with fines and lawsuits. When the violator is the
National Park Service, however, there is little regulators can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many examples of the federal government failing to live
up to its own rules,'' said Gary Beach, the administrator of the
water quality division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be spending my time on the private sector,'' he said.
``I shouldn't have to be spending my time getting the federal
government to comply with their laws. I think it is embarrassing
when the Park Service, which is supposed to be a defender of the
environment, is polluting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every other federal agency, the Park Service is exempt from
enforcement under the Clean Water Act, the historic measure
approved 30 years ago to protect the country's rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to penalize federal agencies that pollute
waterways is costly to the environment. Federal facilities are more
likely to violate water standards than private companies, EPA
records show. In addition, according to a report issued earlier
this year by the EPA Inspector General, federal agencies are
increasingly violating the law, with 27 percent of all government
facilities out of compliance in 1996, the latest year figures were
available, compared to 10 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, federal agencies have sent raw sewage flowing into
rivers and improperly disposed of waste from laboratories,
hospitals, and military installations, according to Mary Sweeney,
an assistant state attorney general who prosecutes environmental
violators. ``There is simply no reason for federal facilities to
continue to be held to a lower standard than private industry,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Congress has waived the government's
immunity from punishment under several environmental laws,
including hazardous waste disposal requirements and the release of
toxins into the air. The threat of fines in those areas, regulators
say, has prompted the government to pollute less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the military has been credited with improving its
daily environmental compliance in the past decade and becoming more
responsive to community concerns about contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been spending a hell of a lot of money for quite a while
now,'' said Gary Vest, the principal assistant deputy
undersecretary of defense for environmental security. ``It's almost
at 30 years now of having a formal environmental program at DOD. We
spent $5 billion a couple of years ago. When you spend so much
money on clean air and clean water, you would hope that you are
getting somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Exemptions and loopholes remain, however.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies are still exempt from many state environmental
laws, which in some cases are more stringent than federal
requirements. The US Navy, for example, is immune from state laws
and Coast Guard regulations governing oil spills. In Washington,
state regulators have repeatedly complained of Navy spills spoiling
Puget Sound. Last year, 6,000 gallons of jet fuel from the aircraft
carrier USS Kitty Hawk fouled the sound, one of three Navy spills
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials said the spills were the result of
negligence and would have resulted in fines of $90,000 if the Navy
were a private company. Instead, the Navy policed its own cleanup,
paid no fines, and even prevented state environmental experts from
boarding ships.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in California, where the Navy is the
largest spiller of oil, according to state officials. In San Diego,
environmental activists say information has been withheld on some
incidents, including a 6,000-gallon oil spill at a Navy pier last
year and the 1996 release of mercury into the bay from a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had to play by the same rules everyone has to, it
would be a better situation,'' said Laura Hunter, the director of
the Clean Bay Campaign, an advocacy group that monitors US Navy
pollution. ``We get less protection than guaranteed by law because
of the presence of the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, in a statement, acknowledged that it is granted
``flexibility'' by Congress because of its ``unique mission,'' but
said it does not misuse that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy recognizes that with this flexibility comes
responsbility,'' the statement said. ``As a good steward of the
environment, (the) Navy has implemented its own spill contingency
planning, spill response, and spill reporting. It reports every
single spill.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of toughening standards for federal agencies,
enforcement officials are worried pollution standards are being
softened. ``Things are getting worse,'' said Vicki Peters, an
environmental prosecutor with the Colorado attorney general's
office. ``I am seeing backpedaling. . . . Anyone living around a
federal facility is not getting the same amount of protection as
someone living around a private site.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent reorganization of the Department of Energy, prompted
by concerns of security breaches at top-secret weapons plants, also
has had the effect of placing those plants outside the grasp of
environmental regulators.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton approved the new arrangement last month, but
said he had reservations about a number of the provisions,
including the section exempting the country's nuclear weapons
complex from environmental regulation. The new arrangement so
worried state environmental prosecutors that 43 of the 50 state
attorneys general in the country signed a letter warning Congress
of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over four decades, DOE and its predecessors operated with
no external oversight of (the) environment,'' they wrote. ``Over
the past 12 years or so, the disastrous consequences of this
self-regulation have become plain. DOE now oversees the largest
environmental cleanup program in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month, in a decision that several federal regulators
termed outrageous, Congress approved a defense spending plan that
would ``prohibit the payment of environmental fines or penalties
unless authorized by law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, when approving the spending plan, said he was troubled
by the fine provision. Environmental regulators said the measure
effectively takes away the ability to penalize the Department of
Defense when it pollutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breathtaking attack on federal enforcement,'' US
Representative William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote in
a letter to colleagues last month. ``At stake is the capacity of
the EPA and Justice Department to enforce pollution standards with
the tools essential to back up their sanctions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The environmental contamination by the US government is so
severe and widespread that every region of the country is affected
in some way.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of cleaning up all of the privately-owned Superfund
sites in the United States _ properties operated by chemical and
oil companies, rubber manufacturers, huge industrial concerns, and
others _ is estimated by the EPA to cost $57 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up Superfund properties polluted by the federal
government, according to the EPA, could cost as much as $280
billion _ nearly five times the amount of private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Superfund list accounts for only a fraction of the
sites polluted by the federal government. In 1996, a panel of
government officials identified 61,155 sites across the country
contaminated by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense alone generates 750,000 tons of
hazardous waste each year, more than the combined production of the
country's five largest chemical companies, according to a study by
a task force of governors and attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of cleaning up sites not on the Superfund list is
expected to add billions more in costs. Though by most estimates
the cleanup of the government sites will take many more decades,
not enough money is being allocated to keep pace with established
timetables.
</P>
<P>
   DOE's budget for environmental cleanup has repeatedly been cut
during this decade. The Federation of American Scientists, a
Washington arms-control group, projects a shortfall of $4.4 billion
in the agency's cleanup budget through fiscal 2006.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress drastically slashed the budget for cleaning
up military bases scheduled for closure, likely delaying cleanups
at those sites. And within the Department of Defense, the amount
needed to restore contaminated sites is being underreported,
according to several audits. In 1998, the Pentagon estimated it
will cost $34.2 billion to clean up environmental hazards at bases
across the country. But that figure is inaccurate and the true cost
is much higher, according to a report issued in July by the
Pentagon's Inspector General.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the Navy failed to account for the cost of
disposing of nuclear reactors and nuclear waste, an amount that
could be as much as $13.2 billion. And the Army did not include
estimates for the cleanup of unexploded bombs, which could also
cost billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the most expensive cleanup will occur at weapons
plants operated by the Department of Energy, where a half century
of nuclear missile and bomb production has contaminated 475 billion
gallons of ground water.
</P>
<P>
   DOE this year told Congress it will spend at least $147 billion
to cleanup 113 sites across the country _ and that the work will
take another 75 years to complete. Former workers at nuclear
weapons plants across the country are charging in lawsuits that
they were sickened and colleagues died from years of exposure to
radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   New England is home to hundreds of locations polluted by the
federal government, including a dozen Superfund sites.
</P>
<P>
   The soil at the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station, which
local officials want to convert into a massive mall, is
contaminated with volatile organic compounds and heavy metals,
according to the EPA. Ground water near former landfills, dumps,
and training areas on the site is also contaminated with heavy
metals.
</P>
<P>
   At the US Army's Natick Laboratory, contamination threatens the
drinking water supply for nearby residents and Lake Cochituate,
where the town has posted a warning about eating fish caught there
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The government Superfund sites stretch across New England, from
the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine to the New London
Submarine Base in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But government pollution extends beyond the country's military
and nuclear weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has identified 913 potentially contaminated sites at 22
facilities in 10 states. The agency has estimated cleanup costs at
$1.5 billion. As of 1997, only 3 percent of the sites had been, or
were being, cleaned up. The agency was slow to identify polluted
areas, taking five years just to survey its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the magnitude of the problems at
federally-contaminated sites, the issue suffers from political
indifference, said Kelso, the former environmental prosecutor who
has forced the government to clean up some polluted sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure this country has been leveled with,'' he said.
``I'm not even sure that Congress has been leveled with, or the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Regulator wears two hats
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, a US Navy jet left Andrews Air Force Base en route
to a rendezvous with an aircraft carrier off the Florida coast. On
board were members of the Navy general counsel's office and other
military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Also along for the ride was Lois Schiffer, the top environmental
official for the Department of Justice, and another high-ranking
Justice lawyer. The group spent a night aboard the nuclear-powered
USS John C. Stennis.
</P>
<P>
   For Navy officials, the trip to Florida was a chance to build
good will with Schiffer. To others it highlighted an inherent
conflict of interest at the Justice Department. Schiffer wears two
hats: She is at once the highest-ranking environmental prosecutor
in the country and the chief defender for federal agencies accused
of violating environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have cases for the Navy, sometimes as a polluter in
cases related to aircraft carriers,'' she said of the trip. ``It is
a lot easier to figure out your position on a case if you see
one.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers working for Schiffer has charged that the
Justice Department's environmental and natural resources division
actually works to protect government agencies engaged in
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is a systemic one, caused by the existence of a
Division culture that places a premium on the protection of the
government bureaucracy instead of an attorney's duties to the
public interest, the truth, and the court,'' wrote attorney Daniel
Jacobs in a letter this year to Attorney General Janet Reno, a copy
of which was provided to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs told Reno he has evidence of a US government agency that
he did not name routinely destroying records.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that when he reported the alleged government
wrongdoing, Schiffer allegedly retaliated against him, and later
warned him that releasing documents relating to the case was
illegal. Jacobs is now involved in an extraordinary legal battle
with his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs's performance rating was downgraded and he was
transferred to another job. Jacobs recently won a court case
allowing him to show his attorney the same records he provided
Schiffer. The attorney can now advise Jacobs of his legal options.
Schiffer declined comment on Jacobs's case.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there is little the Justice Department can do to
penalize federal agencies that pollute. The Justice Department is
prohibited from filing lawsuits or issuing fines against other
federal agencies. Both of these tools are frequently employed by
the department when pursuing private polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal agencies are required by a 1992 law to comply
with all environmental statutes, there are few consequences if they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   The small EPA office charged with keeping federal polluters in
line is often overmatched politically. Several EPA officials said
privately they want to take more action against federal agencies
that pollute, but are hamstrung by special exemptions and political
considerations, such as congressmen worried about the impact of
environmental enforcement on hometown bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, on environmental compliance, the EPA is like a
David with a bunch of Goliaths, especially when it comes to the
military,'' said Cathy Lemar, director of the Military Toxics
Project, a nonprofit group that monitors base cleanups across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has also stumbled internally, unable to complete even
basic mandates requiring the agency to monitor the compliance of
federal facilities with environmental laws, and track their
spending on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many frustrated regulators, particularly at the EPA, said little
will change until Congress and the president toughen laws and
federal agencies fear the consequences of polluting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what folks have been willing to pay for,''
said one EPA official, who agreed to an interview only if he was
not named. ``This is (what) I would call less than a band-aid
applied against a compound fracture of the nation's skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the federal government is getting away with murder
and the EPA is not legally or politically powerful enough to turn
the tide.''

 CHRON   WORKING COOK: Tuna and Pasta Combine in One Big Smile  
   
   
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  There are some nights of the week when the
refrigerator shelves are bare, but going grocery shopping requires
way too much effort. The reality of it hits you with a dull thud _
dinner is coming straight out of a can.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luckily, others have grappled with this dilemma as well. As many
a harried Italian mother knows, a wonderful tasting and
protein-rich pasta sauce can be made from canned tuna and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the idea behind Fusilli with Tuna, Capers and Chickpeas,
the 30-Minute Main Dish, and truly dinner out of a can. Make that
three cans and a jar of capers, a box of pasta and an onion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, using the best ingredients makes this dish even
better. Regular water-packed tuna works fine, but olive oil-packed
tuna is even better. The boxed Pomi brand chopped tomatoes, which
contain neither salt nor preservatives, have a fresher flavor than
most canned varieties.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Fast&AMP;Fresh entree derives from a Vietnamese dish of
grilled pork with rice noodles. Thin slices of tender pork are
grilled and then layered, hot, on a bed of light-as-a-feather
noodles, under which hide rings of cucumber and other raw
vegetables. Garnish it with a tangy dipping sauce and peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of sweet and salty, warm and cold, and crunchy
and soft makes the noodles one of my favorite dishes. This recipe
has similar components but is constructed more like a salad, with
all of the ingredients tossed together.
</P>
<P>
   For a homey Sunday dinner, try the Now&AMP;Later recipe, Chicken and
Rice Pilaf Casserole. It is actually easy enough for a weeknight
dinner _ all it takes is browning the chicken and sauteing bell
peppers and onions. Then add the rice to saute with the vegetables,
and bake all the ingredients together. Fresh lemon zest and juice
make a bright note.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity of liquid makes this dish more like a comforting
stew, and more suitable for freezing extra portions. Be sure to let
it rest for about 10 minutes before serving so the rice fully
softens and absorbs more of the juices.
</P>

 &LR; RICE STICK NOODLES WITH GRILLED PORK &AMP; LIME VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to heat up a grill, use a grill pan or quickly
stir-fry the pork in a hot wok or a large nonstick skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup lime juice (the juice of about 3 limes)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup rice vinegar + 1 tablespoon for the cucumber
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons sugar

   1/4 cup peanut or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into thin rounds
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces rice stick noodles (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 cucumber, sliced into half moons
</P>
<P>
   6 green onions, trimmed and sliced on the bias
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup roasted and lightly salted peanuts, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat a grill before beginning preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Put a large pot of water on to boil for the noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the lime juice, 1/4 cup vinegar and the fish sauce.
Add the sugar and salt; stir until dissolved. Whisk in the oils.
Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Season the pork pieces liberally with salt and pepper. Cook the
pork on the grill until just cooked through, about 1 to 2 minutes
per side. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Drain and
rinse briefly to cool, then drain well, shaking the colander
vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the sliced cucumber with 1 tablespoon rice vinegar. Combine
the cucumber, pork, noodles and most of the green onions and
chopped peanuts in a large bowl; toss to combine. Add the
vinaigrette and toss again.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with the remaining green onions and peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

<P>
   3 onions, diced
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers, deribbed and diced
</P>
<P>
   41/2 cups basmati or other long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   3 quarts chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large skillet. When hot, add enough of the oil to cover
the bottom of the pan. Heat the oil to almost smoking. Add the
chicken pieces in batches and brown over medium-high heat until
golden, about 5 minutes per side, adding more oil as needed. As the
chicken browns, transfer the finished pieces to 2 large baking
pans. Drizzle liberally with lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, carefully drain some of the oil from the skillet,
leaving about 1 or 2 tablespoons in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Reheat the oil, and add the lemon zest, oregano and onions,
scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Saute the
onions for 5 minutes, then add the bell peppers and saute until
softened, about 5 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rice and cook, stirring, until all of the grains are
coated with oil, about 1 minute. Stir in the broth and water and
bring to a boil. (If using unsalted broth, season with salt to
taste at this point or the cooked rice will be bland.)
</P>
<P>
   Pour the broth and rice mixture evenly over the chicken. Cover
tightly and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the rice
is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and let rest, still covered, at least 10
minutes before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 CHRON  
 BEST WAY: Thanksgiving Pie Crust   By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _    Baking a pie crust is like playing golf: You
can't think about it too much or it will drive you crazy. Just
relax and do it without overanalyzing _ the results are usually
better, ideally a crust that is tender, crisp and flaky.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chronicle Food department tested piecrusts to determine
which type of fat, liquid and mixing method made the best crust. We
chose a basic piecrust recipe from the ``Fannie Farmer Baking
Book'' that made ample dough for a single, 9-inch crust. The
crusts, made with all-purpose flour, were either blind-baked (baked
without any filling) at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes or made with
a pumpkin pie filling.
</P>
<P>
   Our first task was to select the type of fat that was best for
flavor and texture. We blind-baked crusts made with all shortening,
all butter, all lard, and half butter-half shortening. The winner:
the 50-50 combination of Crisco vegetable shortening and unsalted
butter. The lard crust was by far the flakiest and most tender,
although it was rich; it took second place. The butter crust had
the best flavor but was not as flaky.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure we would like the crust as much in a pie as we did by
itself, we baked the 50-50 crust and the lard crust with pumpkin
pie fillings. While both pies were yummy, the 50-50 crust was best
again.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we tried various methods of blending the dough _ with a
hand-held pastry blender, in a food processor and with our
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The crust made with a pastry blender was acceptable but the food
processor crust _ we were careful not to overprocess it _ was more
tender. It also took the least amount of ice water _ 3 tablespoons
_ to get the dough to come together. But the crust made with the
fingertips to blend the fat into the flour was the best. It needed
a little over 31/2 tablespoons of ice water. This version was the
most tender and was extremely flaky.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we determined the best fat and mixing method, we tried
replacing part of the ice water with vinegar to see if that
ingredient made the crust more tender. If it did, it wasn't
noticeable. We couldn't discern a substantial difference.
</P>
<P>
   Our final try at improving the crust was to rest it for 45-60
minutes in the refrigerator before rolling it out. Again, the extra
time and effort did not make a noticeable difference. But resting
the dough (it lets the gluten in the dough relax) may be more
important if you are using a food processor, which mixes the dough
vigorously. Letting the piecrust rest in the refrigerator for 2
hours after it is rolled out and fitted in the pan is supposed to
minimize shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
We found the best piecrust is one that is made with half shortening
and half unsalted butter and mixed with your fingertips. Handle it
lightly and keep it cold so the fats don't melt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A PLEASING ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
If your hands tend to be hot or you aren't comfortable about making
pie dough with the snap of your fingers, try a food processor or
hand-held pastry blender. Both produce good results. Process the
dough minimally, and be sure to use ice water as the liquid to help
keep the dough cool.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we learned one more thing about making piecrusts. It
improves with practice, unlike many people's golf game.

BEST WAY PIECRUST RECIPE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the ``Fannie Farmer Baking Book,'' by Marion
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   3-4 tablespoons ice water
</P>
<P>
   additional flour for rolling
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl, add the shortening
and butter, and work it into the flour with your fingertips or a
pastry blender until the mixture resembles fresh bread crumbs.
Sprinkle on the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring
(``fluffing'') lightly with a fork after each addition. Use enough
water so the dough holds together.
</P>
<P>
   Form the dough into a ball and flatten the top to form a disk.
If you use a food processor, wrap the dough completely in plastic
wrap and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 45 minutes to 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface or between 2
sheets of wax paper until it is about 1/8-inch thick and 2 inches
larger than your inverted pie pan.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the dough to the pan, then trim the edges to even them
out. Roll the cut edge under and crimp edges.
</P>
<P>
   If your filling recipe calls for a prebaked shell, use a piece
of aluminum foil, shiny side toward the dough and fill the shell
with dried beans or rice. Place in a preheated 425 oven for 15
minutes then remove foil and beans. Return piecrust to the oven to
more evenly brown the bottom of the crust. Continue baking and
rotating in the oven until golden, about 10-15 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Yields one 9-inch pie shell.

 EDITORS NOTE: This story is not only for a holiday, but also
for  its aftermath. It's followed by recipes for using the
leftover 
 bird.   For the Holidays: Turkey Survival Guide 
 &HT;       
 By Sean Forsha and Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  The honorable Thanksgiving turkey. It's been
selected and purchased. It's been stuffed, seasoned and roasted.
It's been carved and enjoyed. And now the leftovers remain _
refrigerated zip-close plastic bags bulging with white and dark
meat that will most likely end up on sandwiches or eaten by
snacking fingers.
<P>
   For the culinary die-hards, the ones who remain willing to cook
following the Thanksgiving task, we have provided six recipes that
will turn those leftovers into exciting meals.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey proves its versatility. In one dish it's tossed in a
bright pasta with currants and butternut squash; in another it's
stir-fried Cantonese-style with onions and green beans. A curried
turkey salad teamed with radish sprouts makes for a new take on the
day-after sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   We have kept in mind that simplicity is the key to post-holiday
cooking so these offerings feature ingredients that will be readily
available and substitutions can be made easily.

SPICY ASIAN-STYLE CABBAGE &AMP; TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   The spiciness of this Asian-style dish can be adjusted by using
more or less of the chile paste. The turkey adds a meaty texture,
but the vegetables are definitely the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced lengthwise (about 1 cup)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound green cabbage, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup turkey or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, peeled and julienned
</P>
<P>
   1/2 large red bell pepper, deribbed and julienned
</P>
<P>
   1 cup julienned roasted turkey
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons oyster sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Asian chile paste (or to taste)
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion (green part only), thinly sliced on the diagonal
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place a nonstick frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. When
hot, add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and ginger.
Stir-fry until fragrant but do not let the garlic brown. Add the
onion and stir-fry until it starts to turn translucent, about 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cabbage, wine and stock. Continue to cook, stirring
occasionally, until the cabbage begins to soften, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the carrots, bell pepper and turkey, then the oyster sauce,
fish sauce and soy sauce. Cook 1 minute longer, or until the turkey
is heated through and the carrots and pepper are still slightly
crisp. Season with salt, then add the chile paste, stirring to
combine well.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with green onions. Serve with white rice.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 EDITORS NOTE: Two sidebars follow the main story --
well-known  cooks' least favorite gizmos and a few unlikely gadgets
that 
 work.   BOTTOM-DRAWER BLUES: Gadgets, gizmos and gewgaws nobody loves  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Cookware guru Chuck Williams held up a slim,
three-pronged kitchen gadget and sighed. He was certain the French
tool, designed to make it easier to peel a hot, boiled potato,
would be a hit at his Williams-Sonoma stores.
 &HT;    Instead, it bombed.
 &HT;    ``I don't understand it,'' he said, a wistful look crossing his
84-year-old eyes. ``Maybe it's because we don't eat as many boiled
potatoes as the Europeans do.''
 &HT;    Or maybe it's because peeling the darn thing with a knife is
easier.
 &HT;    So it goes in the mercurial world of kitchen gadgets. More often
than not, tools that offer a clever solution to a vexing kitchen
problem are used once or twice and then relegated to the place all
bad kitchen gadgets go to die _ the bottom drawer.
 &HT;    Don't look so smug. You know you have one. Likely, it's filled
with olive grabbers, cherry pitters, butter curlers and bundt pans.
 &HT;    The bottom drawer has a corollary _ the bottom shelf. That's
reserved for kitchen appliances that once held the promise of
certain culinary glory, only to be shoved in the pantry after a few
uses. The items are often so heavy and bulky, their sheer weight
keeps them from being pulled out for use. Count among the
candidates food processors, electric juicers, yogurt makers and
electric pasta machines.
 &HT;    Although we ought to know better, cooks just can't stop buying
gadgets, ever hopeful that the olive will be easier to pit, the
cheese easier to grate. Last year, according to the National
Housewares Manufacturers Association, Americans spent almost $15.75
billion on kitchen cookware _ including pots and pans and basic
tools like spatulas _ but also including more esoteric items. And
the trend shows no sign of slowing.
 &HT;    So what makes a gadget go bad? Why does an item that seems so
promising in the store end up in the bottom drawer? After
interviewing dozens of cooks and sellers of kitchen tools, some
broad _ albeit completeley unscientific _ theories emerged:
 &HT;     It's simply easier to do the task by hand. 
 &HT;    Williams' boiled potato holder falls into this category. So do
egg separators. Remember when tasting spoons were popular? They had
a hollowed handle so soup or sauce could cool as it flowed from the
bowl down the handle to your lips. Somehow, just using a regular
spoon seems a lot easier.
 &HT;    Stephanie Connelly, an avid San Francisco home cook, offers a
perfect example. ``The one gadget that I bought that I tried to use
to no avail was a shrimp deveiner _ a little plastic thing with a
metal prong that you are supposed to scrape along the bottom of the
shrimp to remove the vein. The thing was more trouble than it was
worth. Just stick with your fingers; they work better.''
 &HT;     Food fashion changes. 
 &HT;    Still have your larding needles? How about that terra cotta
garlic roaster or your sea salt grinder? Food trends change as fast
as fashion trends, and the bottom drawer is a mini-museum of the
way we once cooked.
 &HT;    Williams doesn't sell many of those two-piece wire baskets used
make deep-fried shredded potato nests anymore. Nor does he sell a
lot of escargot equipment or vertical chicken roasters. He does
sell truckloads of oil misters, a gadget that reflect today's
lighter cooking styles .
 &HT;    But like bell-bottoms, keep a gadget in the drawer long enough
and it might come back in fashion. Just look at the crepe pan and
the fondue pot.
 &HT;     It's easier to buy the food than to make it. 
 &HT;    Many a cook has discovered this truth after buying a pasta
maker, bread machine, beef jerky maker or counter-top potato chip
fryer.
 &HT;    Allex Gruman, a division merchandising director for Macy's, puts
pizza stones in this category. ``Pizza stones were big when
thin-crust Italian pizza became fashionable five or six years ago.
But people realized it was a pain to roll out the crust and it
never tasted like the pizzas from the wood ovens anyway.''
 &HT;    But that wasn't the worst entry in this category, he says. ``The
total ultimate dog was the seltzer maker. I'll never forget it. It
was 1989. We found out nobody wants to make seltzer water at
home.''
 &HT;     You rarely or never make the food for which the tool is 
 designed. 
 &HT;    Holiday-specific cooking gadgets comprise much of this category.
Just shuffle through a drawer full of Pilgrim-shaped cookie
cutters, heart-shaped gelatin molds and cast-iron rosette irons.
Alongside, you'll find zuchinni ballers, soft-boiled egg cups,
turkey roasting accessories and donut making equipment.
 &HT;    Maybe it's time you admit you're never going to curl butter.
 &HT;     Cleaning the tool is too much work .
 &HT;    Although some people swear by them, garlic presses might be the
poster children for this problem. Spend time with a toothpick
trying to get garlic bits out of the holes and you'll be back to
using a knife in no time.
 &HT;    Home cook Jon Dickson of Oakland offers the combination pasta
and sausage maker as an example of a kitchen tool that got
consigned to the bottom shelf not only because cleanup was a
hassle, but because making the food wasn't worth the trouble.
 &HT;    ``I bought it, used it twice for pasta and once to make
sausages. It took more time to use than if I'd made pasta and
sausages by hand,'' he says. ``And the cleanup ... let's not even
go there.''
 &HT;     You can't resist the pitch. 
 &HT;    It slices, it dices _ and it usually doesn't work. This is the
universe of gadget sellers like Ron Popeil, and likely where bottom
drawer items are likely to be born.
 &HT;    Whether as complex as a half-hour infomercial or as simple as a
well-written packaging claim, the pitch on some kitchen items can
be too strong to resist. Of course you want a simple way to get
garlic odors off your fingers. But is a piece of polished stainless
steel really the answer?
 &HT;    Instant frothers, little glass disks that keep pots from boiling
over, in-the-shell egg scramblers, devices to make hard-boiled eggs
square, counter-top hamburger grills and knives that can cut a
soft-drink can then slice a tomato _ they all sound so promising,
so necessary. And how about those machines that cut segments of
citrus with the turn of a handle or slice onions into perfect
blossoms, just like you see in restaurants. Brilliant _ until you
find out that they don't work, they're too much hassle or you never
really liked those deep-fried onions anyway.
 &HT;    Clearly, weak moments fill bottom drawers. But good tools are as
essential to cooking as fresh ingredients. So how can a smart cook
balance the temptation to buy time-saving gadgets against the need
to have the right tools?
 &HT;    Easy. Be a smart shopper and go for solid kitchenware that will
endure.
 &HT;    ``The basic tools are what you'll always use,'' Williams says.
``Good knives, slicers and vegetable peelers, a zester, a whisk.''
 &HT;    Of course, that doesn't mean his stores will never stock
candidates for the bottom drawer. Among the kitchen items stacked
in his office for consideration recently was a wide-bladed knife
designed specifically to cut and serve cottage cheese.
 &HT;    Williams admitted it was a rather esoteric item. But then he got
a twinkle in his eye. ``Well,'' he said, ``you can get a lot of
cottage cheese up with it.''
 &HT;     
 
 
SIDEBAR: Chef's Least Chosen 
 
Here's what some Bay Area chefs, food writers and personalities
keep in their bottom drawers: &HT;     Nancy Oakes, chef/owner Boulevard . A garlic peeler shaped like
a rubber tube. ``Some things are just too much trouble to clean.''
 &HT;     Emily Luchetti, pastry chef, Farallon . A Mason jar lid opener.
``I have no idea where it came from. I think it has always been
with me.''
 &HT;     Craig Stoll, chef/owner, Delfina . A Parisian scoop. ``What am
I going to do? Take a beautiful vegetable from the farmer's market
and make little balls out of it?''
 &HT;     Mollie Katzen, cookbook author . A double cherry pitter. ``The
first time I used it I almost injured someone.''
 &HT;     Robert Helstrom, chef, Kuleto's . A sushi maker. ``I've had it
for 10 years and it has never been out of the box.''
 &HT;     Dan Scherotter, chef, Palio d' Asti.  A metal bar that removes
onion and garlic odor from hands. ``The French chef that was
selling them swore by them.''
 &HT;     Kevin Godes, chef, Cafe Pescatore.  A sandwich press. ``My
roommate from college had it. I brought it all the way from
Wisconsin.''
 &HT;

SIDEBAR: A FEW UNLIKELY GIZMOS THAT WORK 
 
By Rebecca Markowitz 
c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ We asked experts from Williams-Sonoma, Home Chef
and Sur La Table cookware stores to list gadgets they expect to be
hot sellers for holiday gifts. Which will endure as favorite
kitchen tools and which will end up in the bottom drawer? Only time
will tell.
<P>
   &UR; Razor-sharp graters and zesters. &LR;  This line from Microplane, a
company that makes extraordinarily sharp woodworking tools, has
entered the cookware market. Kit Dombrowski from Sur La Table calls
the graters ``amazing.'' They come in five sizes, and retail from
$13-$19.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Potato ricers and food mills.  &LR; These tools are far from new,
but Home Chef founder Judith Ets-Hokin says they are _ and predicts
they will continue to be _ strong sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Potato ricers create fluffy, lump-free mashed potatoes and
retail for around $20.
</P>
<P>
   Food mills are much more versatile; they work as a masher,
strainer, blender and ricer _ but they can be expensive. Home
Chef's most popular food mill retails for $85 and comes with
exchangeable disks for additional versatility. Prices range from
$30-$100.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nonstick baking sheet liners.  &LR; Ets-Hokin says these are a great
gift choice for bakers. The silicon-coated liners allow cookies and
candies to easily slide off and are making a move from the
professional to home kitchen. Home Chef's eight stores sold 61 of
them in one recent business day. The liners come in two sizes and
retail for around $26.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Instant-Marinator.  &LR; Vacuvin makes this piece of equipment
that reduces the time it takes to marinate meat from one hour to 17
seconds. The meat is placed in a pouch with the marinade &UR;  &LR; and the
device removes the air, causing the pores to open. &UR;  &LR; After 17
seconds, the air is let back into the pouch. The pores close,
holding flavor inside. The Instant-Marinator retails for $29.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A gravy/stock strainer.  &LR; These measuring cups, with a long
pouring spout coming off the bottom, are not new but are remarkably
useful to get rid of fat in stock and pan drippings. Since fat
rises to the top, when liquids are poured out of the cup through
the bottom spout, the fat remains and can be discarded. The
strainer retails around $15.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OXO Good Grips turkey lifter.  &LR; This gadget eases the chore of
getting the heavy holiday bird out of the pan. Slip the hook into
the turkey cavity and pull. It retails for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Camerons Smoker. &LR;  No need to wait for summer barbecue season if
you enjoy smoked foods. This smoker is designed to be used indoors.
It sits on any stovetop and imparts smoke flavor into meat,
poultry, fish or vegetables as they cook. It retails for around
$60.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Popeil Showtime Rotissierie and Grill ($179.99) and George &LR; 
 &UR; Forman Grill ($99.95).  &LR; Both are ``as seen on TV'' items, bringing
outdoor cooking into the kitchen. The table-top rotissiere is large
enough to hold two chickens. The Foreman ``lean, mean grilling
machine'' is an electric grilling pan that allows fat to run off
into a tray. At Macy's, these two items have been outselling the
classic Cuisinart food processor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Millennium-themed items.  &LR; Stores are heavily promoting
everything from caviar spoons to monogrammed Champagne stoppers for
end-of-the-year celebrations. But what will happen to these come
Jan. 2, 2000?

 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 PETALUMA, Calif. _  The client list of fourth-generation duck
farmer Jim Reichardt reads like a Gault-Millau guide.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Spago and Jiraffe in Los Angeles to Sorento in Seattle to
the Bay Area's Postrio, La Folie, Jardini &LR; e &LR; re, Hawthorne Lane,
Chez Panisse, Bay Wolf and Cafe Rouge, to name a few, top
restaurants use Reichardt's birds to make the likes of port-cured
duck confit, duck with Armagnac sauce and dried apricots, and duck
liver flan with green peppercorns and Marsala.
</P>
<P>
   Descended from a long line of Bay Area duck farmers _
great-grandfather Otto Reichardt started his business in 1901 in
San Francisco _ Jim Reichardt almost didn't make it into the
thinning ranks of independent poultry farmers.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated from high school, his family, who had
relocated to Petaluma in the late '50s, felt the outlook for
independents like themselves was so dicey that their youngsters
needed to learn another profession. So Jim Reichardt dutifully got
a degree in architecture and, after finding draughting thoroughly
unsatisfactory, studied photography at the California College of
Arts and Crafts.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 29, he returned to the family business,
Reichardt Duck Farm. Seven years ago, he struck out on his own,
calling his business Sonoma County Poultry, Liberty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of an industry dominated by giant producers,
Reichardt's farm is a boutique operation. ``We bring about 1,500
ducks to market in a week,'' he says. ``Compare that to Foster
Farms with at least 300,000 chickens  &LR; a day &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Reichardt and such faithful customers as Bay
Wolf's Michael Wild, Liberty ducks are birds of a different feather
from mass-produced poultry. Reichardt ducks, they assert, are
exceptionally meaty and have excellent flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The duck farmer says there are several reasons for these
qualities. He raises a strain of Pekin (CQ) &LR; ducks from a Danish
bloodline he considers outstanding, feeds them corn and other
grains (no hormones or antibiotics) and slaughters them at eight to
nine weeks, rather than the six to seven weeks that are standard in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Reichardt alerts consumers that a bird promoted as not having
been fed antibiotics may still be inoculated with them. His are
not. He says he does lose some birds to disease but that his losses
are small because he keeps his flock healthy by natural means.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanliness, obviously is a factor, but so is space. In
large-scale poultry farming, a chicken may be allotted as little as
one square-foot of space. By comparison, Reichardt's ducks can
positively roam, with 50 to 75 square-feet of space allowed per
duck.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that they can move around, the farmer says, means more
blood circulating, which translates into meat with more flavor.
</P>
<P>
   And it keeps them healthy. Being able to exercise, says
Reichardt, they are not under the stress experienced by tightly
caged birds, ``and it's stress that makes (any creature) vulnerable
to disease.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHERE TO FIND &QL; 
THE DUCKS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Liberty Ducks from Jim Reichardt's Sonoma County Poultry are
mostly sold to top-flight restaurants in the Bay Area, Los Angeles
and the Pacific Northwest, though they are available retail _ or
can be ordered _ from Food For Thought in Santa Rosa, Sunshine and
Keller's markets in St. Helena and Enzo's in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no salesroom at either the farm or the
processing plant in Petaluma, individual customers can order birds
and pick them up at the plant (by prearrangement only) or have them
shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are $1.90 per pound dressed (although prices are subject
to change). Sizes average 5 to 6 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The phone number for Liberty Ducks is (800) 953-8257 or (707)
795-3797. You can visit the company online at
 &LR; www.libertyducks.com &LR;  or e-mail the farm at  &LR; scpducks &LR; aol.com. &LR;

 chef's secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow 
 in optional trim.   SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Humble and Haute Hobnot in a Posh Portobello 
 Salad  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Nancy Oakes, chef/owner of the wildly popular
Boulevard, loves the restaurant's Shaved Portobello with Fennel and
Radish Salad. She says, ``It allows the celery and radishes, which
often are ignored, to step out on the town with their more
glamorous friends: endive, fennel and portobello mushrooms.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the features that makes this bright winter salad
different is the fact that all the ingredients are sliced very
thinly, making for a delicious melding of tastes and textures. It
also makes it easy to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables are crowned with shavings of Spanish Manchego
cheese and dressed with a roasted lemon vinaigrette, another
unusual feature. This is a spectacular salad _ you won't find it
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes is one of the most original cooks in the Bay Area, and
this belle epoque-style restaurant designed by Pat Kuleto is an
appropriate stage for her talents.

SHAVED PORTOBELLO, FENNEL &AMP; RADISH SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 large head fennel, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   12 large red radishes, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   5 stalks celery, (preferably with pale green leaves)
</P>
<P>
   1 head frisee
</P>
<P>
   3 heads white or red endive
</P>
<P>
   1 large portobello mushroom, stemmed, gills removed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Manchego cheese
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Lemon Vinaigrette (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as Italian parsley,
tarragon and chervil (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large bowl with ice and add water to cover. Place the
fennel on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise. Using a
Japanese or French mandoline, slice the fennel as thinly as
possible. Drop into the ice water.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the radishes into rounds and add to the ice water. Repeat
with the celery stalks. Add celery leaves to the ice water as well.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the frisee by cutting off all tough green leaves down to
the white part. Then cut away the root. Add the frisee to the ice
water.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the large leaves from the endive; try to get 18 large
leaves. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the heads of endive in half lengthwise. Carefully cut a
``V'' shape in the root end of each half. This core is bitter;
discard it. Place the endive halves on a cutting board and thinly
slice crosswise. Add to the ice water.
</P>
<P>
   Let the vegetables soak in the ice water for 10 minutes. Drain
and spin in a lettuce dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Using the mandoline, slice the portobello mushroom and Manchego
cheese very thinly.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, place 3 large endive leaves on each salad plate
forming a loose triangle. Drizzle with a little of the Roasted
Lemon Vinaigrette. Combine the drained vegetables in a large bowl.
Drizzle with enough of the remaining vinaigrette to coat. Toss.
Season with salt and pepper. Add the optional herbs, the shaved
cheese and portobello. Toss to combine. Place a handful of salad in
the middle of each endive triangle.

chicken, fish or pork.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar
</P>

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pierce each lemon with a paring knife. Place the lemons in a
microwave-safe container and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on
HIGH for 10 minutes. Remove cover and let cool. (If you do not have
a microwave, pierce lemons and wrap in several layers of aluminum
foil, making sure no liquid can escape. Place in a pan and roast in
a 325-degree oven for 45 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   When the lemons have cooled to room temperature, gently squeeze
them to release the juices, but not so hard as to force out the
seeds. Put the juice in a blender; add the sugar, vinegar and
tomatoes. Puree until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.

BEST WAY: COOK THAT BIRD  
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON  
 EDITORS NOTE: The Best Way, a regular feature in the San  Francisco
Chronicle, describes the best methods for cooking 
 particular foods. This week, we talk about turkey. Descriptions 
 of the methods are followed by a recipe for brining _ the 
 staff's favorite.   c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Last week, The Chronicle Food section gave you the
four best ways to cook the Thanksgiving turkey _ a traditional
roasted method, roasted and brined, barbecued and smoked, and the
best big bird _ which we determined after two weeks of cooking and
tasting 28 turkeys.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a re-cap. These methods are for a 12- to 16-pound, or a
22-pound, unstuffed turkey. For the best way to roast a stuffed
turkey, see the chart elsewhere in this section.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, roasting times may vary depending on the
temperature of the turkey when it goes in the oven and the accuracy
of the oven thermostat. To be sure the bird is done, the internal
temperature should read 165 degrees at the thickest part of the
thigh. When pricked with a fork, the juices should run clear. Let
the turkey rest 20-30 minutes after taking it out of the oven
before carving, during which time the internal temperature will
rise several degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; BEST WAY TRADITIONAL
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread 2 tablespoons of softened
butter over the skin and sprinkle 41/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and
11/2 teaspoons of ground pepper over the skin and in the cavity.
Tuck the wing tips under, truss the legs and place the turkey on a
v-shaped rack in a roasting pan. Tent the breast with foil and
place the turkey in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   After about 1 hour, remove the foil and baste the turkey with
1/2 cup stock. Re-baste it with pan drippings and any remaining
stock every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the turkey until the internal thigh temperature reaches
165 degrees, 13/4-21/4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST WAY BRINED
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  This was the Food staff's favorite turkey. Brine the turkey for
12 to 24 hours, using the accompanying recipe for the brine.
</P>
<P>
   Before roasting, rinse and dry the turkey well, and follow the
directions for the Best Way Traditional turkey, but do not sprinkle
the turkey with salt.
</P>
<P>
   Start checking the internal temperature after about 11/2 hours
of roasting time. If the legs begin to overbrown, cover them
loosely with foil. Roast until the internal thigh temperature
reaches 165 degrees, 2-23/4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST WAY NON-ROASTED
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Brine the turkey according to the accompanying recipe, then rinse
and dry the turkey well, rub the skin with 2 tablespoons of
softened butter and sprinkle with 11/2 teaspoons of pepper on the
skin and inside the cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a covered grill with a charcoal fire, centering an
aluminum or metal drip pan directly under the grill and arranging
the coals on either side. Soak applewood chips as directed on the
package, then sprinkle a handful over the hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Place the prepared turkey on the grill, close the cover and cook
the turkey until the internal thigh temperature registers 165
degrees, about 21/4-3 hours. Add additional coals and soaked chips
as needed to maintain an even temperature and smokiness. Cover the
turkey with aluminum foil if it begins to overbrown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST WAY BIG BIRD
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a 20-22 pound turkey as
directed for the Best Way Traditional bird, but double the amount
of softened butter, salt and pepper, then roast and baste (using
about 1 cup stock) according to the Best Way Traditional
directions. Cover the legs with foil if they begin to overbrown.
Roast until the internal thigh temperature registers 165 degrees,
about 31/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   CHEZ PANISSE'S BRINE FOR TURKEY
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   21/2 gallons cold water
</P>
<P>
   2 cups kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves, torn into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh thyme, or 4 tablespoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1 whole head of garlic, cloves separated and peeled
</P>
<P>
   5 whole allspice berries, crushed
</P>
<P>
   4 juniper berries, smashed
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the water in a large pot that can easily hold the liquid
and the turkey you intend to brine. Add all ingredients and stir
for a minute or two until the sugar and salt dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Put your turkey into the brine and refrigerate for 24 hours. If
the turkey floats to the top, use a plate or other weight to keep
it completely submerged in the brine.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Note: &LR;  The recipe may be halved or doubled; the important
thing is to have enough brine to completely cover the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Before roasting, remove the bird from the brine and drain well.
Pat dry.  &QL;

 CHRON   COOK'S BOOKS : ``West Coast Seafood'' 
 
 
By Karola Saekel 
c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ A young professional cook of our acquaintance spent
an hour or so perusing ``West Coast Seafood'' the other day and
said that if you had no other book on seafood, this would tell you
all you needed to know _ from basic facts to techniques to recipes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's a pretty strong endorsement, but it's right on the mark.
Veteran chef/food writer Jay Harlow leaves no fin unturned in this
just-published volume. And while there are some excellent books on
fish and seafood cookery on the market, most are geared to East
Coast catches. Harlow is West Coast specific.
</P>
<P>
   As a cookbook author, Harlow is eminently practical. He doesn't
just state that a certain fish is great for barbecuing, poaching or
sauteing, he explains why, so the reader gains an understanding of
the inherent nature of different fish and can make informed
choices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the book explains how tuna is graded and why it's a
waste of money to buy grade one (sashimi-grade) fish unless you
intend to eat it raw.
</P>
<P>
   Even seafood novices should have no problem preparing great
meals from this book _ and may even tackle intimidating tasks such
as boning and filleting a fish or cooking live crab and lobster.
(Harlow details the most humane manner of dispatching the
crustaceans.)
</P>
<P>
   All of Harlow's recipes meet the three essential C's: They're
clear, concise and consumer-friendly. In flavor combinations, they
roam the globe, with much inspiration from the Pacific Rim _ Shrimp
and Vegetable Curry with Tamarind, a soupy dish to be spooned over
rice; Real Sweet and Sour Fish with a choice of two sauces; and
Stir-Fried Oysters With Black Bean Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   These Asian-inspired preparations share billing with Italian,
French, Caribbean, Creole and good &LR; all-American dishes such as
Beer-Steamed Clams and Basic Buttermilk Fried Catfish.
</P>
<P>
   The catfish is a superbly budget-pampering dish. If you want to
go to the other side of the cost spectrum, go for the Abalone and
Chanterelle Salad. I intend to make it as soon as the NASDAQ goes
up another 500 points.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow puts the appropriate finish on dishes _ and the book _
with a selection of sauces as familiar as tartar sauce and as
interesting as charmoula, the garlicky Moroccan preparation that
doubles as marinade and sauce. In Harlow's processor/blender
version, it's a snap to make.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``West Coast Seafood: The Complete Cookbook,'' by Jay Harlow &LR; 
 &LR; (Sasquatch Books; 366 pages, trade paperback; $23.95). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; FISH DIEPPOISE
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; This is a festive, rich dish, inspired by the fish-shellfish
combinations favored in the French port of Dieppe.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soft butter
</P>
<P>
   1 heaping tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   12 mussels, cleaned
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   12 medium-size raw shrimp, peeled, deveined, shells reserved
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   4 sole or flounder fillets, about 3 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Blend the butter and flour thoroughly; set aside at room
temperature. Combine the mussels, shallots and half of the wine in
a saucepan. Cover, bring to a boil and steam until the mussel
shells open, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the mussels and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce the heat to a simmer, add the shrimp and simmer just
until they turn opaque. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and
set aside. Add the shrimp shells to the pan and leave at a simmer.
Shuck the mussels, discard the shells and add the mussels to the
bowl with the shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the remaining wine and the green onions in a nonstick
skillet just large enough to hold the fish. Add water to a depth
equal to the thickness of the fillets, bring almost to a boil,
reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes. Season the fish fillets
lightly with salt, add them to the skillet and poach until just
done. Transfer to a warm platter or individual plates.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the green onions and strain the contents of the
shellfish pan into the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce by
two-thirds and add the cream, cayenne and a large pinch of salt.
Reduce until lightly thickened, whisk in the butter-flour mixture
and simmer another minute or so. Taste for seasoning and adjust to
taste. Add the shellfish to the sauce to reheat briefly, then spoon
the sauce and shellfish over the fish.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vincent Jones cannot forget the first time he saw the
homeless man, so skinny he was ``holding up his pants with one hand
and holding onto the wall with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A police officer was rousting the man from his regular square of
sidewalk on 39th Street near Seventh Avenue. And Jones walked past
as he had walked past so many men like him over the years, drinking
and drugging themselves into the grave in the dismal orbit of the
Port Authority bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But something _ Jones still finds it hard to explain _ drew him
back. ``The look on that man's face,'' he says now.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Raymond Lawrence, asked Jones for a quarter. Jones gave
him two. He bought him a cup of coffee and a bacon-and-egg
sandwich. He asked the man _ please _ not to spend his money on
alcohol, and then he walked away, sure that he would never see him
again.
</P>
<P>
   That was three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Jones pulled his battered gray minivan up to a
tiny white, shingled house in Portsmouth, Va., where he stepped out
and then Lawrence stepped out and then Lawrence's 73-year-old
mother, Alberta, walked slowly onto the lawn with her arms in the
air, crying.
</P>
<P>
   It had been three years since she had heard from her son, and,
despite her prayers and those of every parishioner in two Virginia
Baptist churches during that time, she had given him up for dead.
</P>
<P>
   The act of charity that brought about the reunion that October
evening was unlikely enough. But in its details, the story of the
bond that developed between a stocky, easy-going 56-year-old
Garment District delivery man from Queens Village and a troubled,
51-year-old alcoholic becomes even more so.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the chance encounter on 39th Street, Jones
began to slowly and doggedly work his way into Lawrence's life and
discovered several things: that the homeless man who usually had
trouble opening a bottle of Thunderbird had once been an
accomplished jazz pianist and attended the Berklee College of Music
in Boston. That one of Lawrence's sisters worked in midtown
Manhattan and regularly took the bus in from New Jersey to the Port
Authority, never knowing that her lost brother was usually lying on
the sidewalk one block away.
</P>
<P>
   And that Lawrence's mother, still working as a nurse, lived only
5 miles from where Jones himself had been born and raised, in
segregation-era Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   To Jones, a deeply religious man, few of these things were
particularly surprising and none were coincidences. ``I truly
believe that God led me to Raymond,'' he says. ``Sometimes I would
even say to him, `Lord, why do I keep running into this man?'''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with his faith and scriptures at the ready, even Jones
finds it hard to believe that today, the same Raymond Lawrence he
knew on the streets of New York will sit down with his mother, and
his nephew's family in Newport News, for his first Thanksgiving
dinner in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' Jones said, ``there were times when I said to
myself: I am going to watch this man die out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, the story of what the handtruck delivery
man did for the homeless man has spread slowly through the Garment
District like a kind of urban legend. Lawrence has taken on the
dimensions of a samaritan too good to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McDonald, a homeless outreach worker who had struggled to
help Lawrence for three years, said, ``I was suspicious at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center
Business Improvement District _ who heard about it from the
agency's security guards and later mentioned it to a newspaper
editor _ said she had decided that Jones must be ``totally crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was a fixture in this district for so long, and he
was not just a nuisance; he was offensive,'' she said of Lawrence,
who was often covered in urine and feces, bellowing at passersby
when he was drunk. Ms. Randall added: ``We were always kind of
hoping that something would happen to him. We didn't think it would
be anything good.''
</P>
<P>
   But when people stop Jones to marvel at what he did he will
usually only pause for a moment and concede: ``I guess it is a
little unusual, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, even this never seemed to occur to
him. At first, he would seek the homeless man out in the middle of
his fabric deliveries and offer a dollar here and there and food
whenever he asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   On a couple of occasions, when he could not stand to see
Lawrence shaking so uncontrollably, Jones would break down and buy
him a bottle of cheap wine. But he soon vowed never to do it again.
And he stopped giving money altogether, because he knew it would
end up in the cash register of the Athens Liquor Store on 40th
Street near the Port Authority. (By all accounts, Lawrence never
used drugs.)
</P>
<P>
   But alcohol was all Lawrence wanted, and it was often not easy
for Jones to refuse him when he saw the frail man _ Lawrence is
5-foot-9 but weighed only 125 pounds; he is 51 but looks 70 _
beaten by fellow homeless men or crying because they had robbed him
in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's shoes were stolen so often that through the winters,
the toes on his left foot became unbearably painful and one night
in 1998, he said, ``I guess I dialed 911 because I couldn't walk no
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons amputated all of the toes on his left foot and the
little toe on his right foot. For several months, he stayed in a
nursing home in the Bronx, but then, as he always did, he made his
way back to his old haunt, rolling down Seventh Avenue and calling
out to Jones from a shiny new wheelchair. It was stolen within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Jones knew Lawrence, he said, the more he would try
to keep track of him, enlisting Fashion Center security guards to
let him know when they spotted the homeless man. He also began
slowly trying to pry loose some of Lawrence's past, which usually
came out confused or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, the outreach worker for the Partnership for the
Homeless, said that over his three years' acquaintance with
Lawrence _ even as he helped place him in several detoxification
programs and get him medical care _ he could never win his trust.
``Every time I saw him _ every time,'' said McDonald, ``he would
act like he didn't remember my name.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But where McDonald and others failed to get through to him,
Jones became like a kind of older brother, at times protective and
compassionate, and at other times argumentative and overbearing
like an older brother can be.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With incredible patience, Jones began to piece together a
picture of a lost life. Lawrence had been in the Navy, serving in
San Diego during the Vietnam War; at some point, it seemed, he had
been court-martialed for being AWOL and drunk; he had moved to
Boston and in the 1970s had auditioned for the Berklee College of
Music, playing a jazz piece and a Bach prelude; he was accepted and
lasted for a year before the drinking destroyed his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades, he bounced almost everywhere _ Alaska,
Arizona, New York, California, the Carolinas and back to New York _
but he can now summon few memories of those years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Jones extracted the details he needed: Lawrence had a
sister, Mary Helen, somewhere in New Jersey; a mother somewhere in
Virginia and another sister near Boston. In May 1996, the last time
anyone in his family had heard his voice, he had called that sister
to wish her happy Mother's Day. And somehow, he still remembered
her number.
</P>
<P>
   It was with this scrap of the past _ 10 digits _ that Jones' set
himself in motion.
</P>
<P>
   He called Lawrence's sister Cathaleen, who got him in touch with
their mother. On a morning soon after, Jones held a cell phone up
to the homeless man's ear and told him his mother was on the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence looked at the phone and then said into it, tears
welling in his eyes: ``Is this really my mother?''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of a woman, crying, shot back: ``On October 3, 1948,
they handed me a baby and told me it was you, so I guess it's your
mother, Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   In a life that had seemed on an unswerving trajectory toward
death, that was the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lawrence said she was asked by friends later: ``How long
have you known this Vincent fellow? And I said, `I've never met the
man before in my life!' They asked what he wanted, and I said, `He
doesn't want anything. He won't take anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was so excited that he wanted to drive Lawrence to
Virginia the next day, but was persuaded to wait until he had gone
though a detoxification program. And so on the afternoon of Oct.
20, Jones picked up his trembling charge from a midtown office and
drove him back to his own cramped house in Queens Village, which
Jones shares with his longtime girlfriend, Lillie Whitmore.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the least, an unusual scene, but Ms. Whitmore was
not exactly surprised. Once, several years earlier, Jones had taken
off time to care for an elderly neighbor in Sullivan County, where
he often goes with friends to hunt. Over the years he knew
Lawrence, he would often come home and tell her how worried he was
about the man. And Jones tried to act on the advice his mother had
given him just before she died: ``Never look down on a person
unless you are picking them up.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge differences between Jones and Lawrence, Ms.
Whitmore could also see the similarities between the two men. They
both grew up essentially without fathers and both had principled,
strong-willed mothers. And when Lawrence was not drinking, he was
as humble and hard-working as Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That night, they all dined on baked chicken, corn, peas and
potatoes. Jones asked his girlfriend's son, Brent Whitmore _ a hair
stylist who goes by the monicker Sharnteek, and who has worked for
Mike Tyson, Puff Daddy and Johnnie Cochran _ to come over and see
what he could do about Lawrence's matted hair and beard. Whitmore
pulled out his clippers, took off most of the hair and left
Lawrence with a small, stylish mustache. ``I reconstructed his
whole look,'' he recalled the other day, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence slept in the spare bedroom. And the next morning,
Lawrence and Jones and Jones' howling Walker hound, Max, piled into
the van for a 10-hour drive to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Whitmore watched them leave that morning, she looked at
her beaming boyfriend, whom everyone in his family calls Butch, and
she thought to herself: ``That's Butch, bless his heart. He will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But before it was all over that day, one final thing happened to
reassure Jones once again that there are no coincidences: half an
hour after they arrived in Portsmouth from their long road trip,
Lawrence suffered a grand mal seizure, brought on by his withdrawal
from alcohol. His mother, a nurse, knew exactly what to do before
he was taken to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three weeks in a veterans' hospital. He is now back
home with his mother and has an appetite for the first time in a
year. He has not had a drink in more than a month. But those around
him say they know he wants one, and worry that he will try to get
back to the sidewalks where Jones found him.
</P>
<P>
   He says he thinks often about Jones and is not sure how to feel:
``I don't know why he did that for me,'' he says. ``Maybe I remind
him of somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence has begun to find a new sense of purpose in playing the
piano at his mother's church, the Noble Street Baptist Church in
Portsmouth, where the parishioners had prayed for him for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, he found himself sitting in a clean, grey
thrift-store suit at the other church that prayed for his return,
the Life-Line Full Gospel Baptist Church in Newport News, where his
nephew is the music minister.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had traveled down with a reporter once again to visit the
Lawrence family and check up on his friend Raymond. Before the
service began, he pulled Lawrence close to him and held on to his
thin arm like an older brother. ``Raymond,'' he said, ``you can't
come back to New York City. It's not the same up there, man.
Giuliani is putting all the homeless people in jail. You stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pews began to fill, he made another request. Would
Lawrence and the choir play his favorite hymn, ``Pass Me Not, Oh
Gentle Savior''?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the service, Lawrence sat almost hidden behind the
black baby grand piano. Closing his eyes tightly shut and placing
his shaking fingers above the keys, he began to play. The voices of
Mrs. Lawrence and her daughter, Mary Helen Hollins, rose and joined
with the choir and filled the church with sound.
</P>
<P>
   The song ended. Jones rose and smiled and said to no one in
particular: ``That's my buddy Raymond.''

   Timeline
</P>
<P>
   by Michael Crichton
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $26.95
</P>
<P>
   Um.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to write a review that essentially trashes a
sure-fire bestseller, a book that will be made into summer 2000's
smash hit film and, not coincidentally, earn its already flush
author another few million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Timeline,'' Michael Crichton's latest potboiler,
exemplifies the kind of novel that ought, properly, to be a comic
book. It's crammed with one-dimensional characters and improbable
plot twists, and it features a plot that has been exhausted by
previous generations of writers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Timeline'' is going to sell at least a million copies
in hardcover _ that means hopeful publisher Knopf, shipping 1.5
million to bookstores as its first printing, can have 500,000 left
over for remainder bins and still turn a tidy profit. The movie
sale is already made, and Crichton's so certain of ``Jurassic
Park''-type success that he's cut himself in for a box-office
percentage instead of a sure-thing one-time rights sale.
</P>
<P>
   So what is ``Timeline'' about? Time travel, natch. Scientists
working for a nasty boy-genius billionaire figure out how to send
people back to medieval times. Things don't always work perfectly,
and one key team member, a revered professor, gets stuck smack in
the middle of some contretemps in 14th-century France. Some other
people are sent to fetch him back, but they must somehow do this
``without radically affecting the course of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Crichton serves up the present/past literary cocktail with
ingredients that taste good but don't provide much intellectual
nourishment; let's call it the fictional equivalent of Pop-Tarts.
The author spews out just enough scientific stuff to give the false
impression that readers are learning a lot about quantum physics,
and his descriptions of castle life are just vivid enough to fill
in frames of a TV cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   The jousts and sword fights are appropriately grisly. Rotting
teeth are described perhaps more frequently than necessary. We
learn what sort of drawers the knights wore under their armor.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense, such as it is, is cartoonish, too. Believe it or
not, things go wrong for the rescue team, and their modern-day
means of getting back to the present hang in the scientific
balance. Will the scientists battling present-day technology
disasters fix things in time to rescue their friends battling enemy
knights in the past? Gee, take a wild guess.
</P>
<P>
   But Crichton has succeeded as a novelist any time he has
provided predictable cartoon entertainment. There was nothing
particularly innovative about ``Jurassic Park,'' ``Congo'' or ``The
Andromeda Strain,'' to name his other fiction megasuccesses.
Writers from H.G. Wells to Edgar Rice Burroughs had plowed those
literary fields before. The familiar sells; just consider those
clone-like TV sitcoms that top the Nielsen ratings every week.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton's sales have tumbled when he has tried to deal with
real-life issues. ``Rising Sun'' (Japanese-bashing), ``Disclosure''
(sexual harassment) and ``Airframe'' (air safety) all flopped, at
least compared with ``Jurassic Park.'' Cartoon characters work only
with appropriately cartoonish subjects, like dinosaurs in the
modern world or scientists in the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be blunt: ``Timeline'' is not a very good book, but, for
its purposes and audience, it doesn't have to be. It is the
frothiest kind of mind candy, spiffed up with a few scientific
terms here and there to give the impression that it's delivering
more information than it really is. Professional wrestling pretends
to be real, too, and calls itself ``sports entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``Timeline'' is entertainment. Just don't kid yourselves
you're getting the literary equivalent of the Olympics. You're
getting pro wrestling..MDUL/.MDNM/

   ``Dark Thicket''
</P>
<P>
   by Elmer Kelton
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   TCU Press, $21.95
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Kelton fans generally have to wait a year or so between
his highly crafted stories. The last was ``The Buckskin Line,'' a
Civil War-era tale of Texas Rangers and a young man's growth to
manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just months from that book's release, comes the rerelease
of ``Dark Thicket,'' a 1985 book that also centers on Texas during
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   There is much in common between the two Kelton novels. A young
boy must mature amid family discord, battling neighbors and
differing political views.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a young woman involved. Kelton always seems
to soften the hardships of the Texas frontier with the presence of
a woman to turn a man's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Thicket'' is a tightly written story. Owen Danforth has
gone off to war, to fight for the Confederacy against his father's
wishes. The two men were estranged, and now Owen is coming home
with a deep saber wound across his arm.
</P>
<P>
   He is to rest, recuperate, then rejoin his gray-uniformed
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to convalesce at his home, where he and his father can
heal their relationship as well.
</P>
<P>
   But in their way stands the ``heel flies,'' a band of ``home
guards'' who have taken the war as an opportunity to steal land and
livestock. They get their nickname by buzzing around the heels of
anyone who doesn't believe in the Confederacy. They are devoted to
the Confederacy, and property belonging to Union sympathizers is
free for the taking. Texas is filled with Union sympathizers, and
being a heel fly can be lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Owen's father believes that the Union should be preserved, and
the heel flies constantly swirl around his place. He keeps the
flies stirring by aiding others who flee rebel conscription,
sending them to the safety of the dark, deep East Texas thicket.
</P>
<P>
   Owen arrives in this mess, protected only slightly by his
threadbare uniform and his orders to return to duty. He is
mistrusted, though, because of his father's sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   He is quickly tossed into conflict that makes him reassess his
feelings for his country and his father. He reluctantly ends up in
the thicket, hiding from the heel flies and protecting families
that also mistrust him because of his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He is still a Confederate soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Thicket'' is a typical Kelton novel. Stories come full
circle, details are attended to, and the dialogue is as real as
Kelton's West Texas upbringing can allow. It is enjoyable reading
in which good always overcomes bad, and the boy always gets the
girl.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Of all the NHL coaches, few are more familiar with
the Bruins' personnel _ recent past and present _ than Nashville
Predators coach Barry Trotz.
</P>
<P>
   Trotz nurtured many talented players while at the helm of the
Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League. Among those he
coached were Bruins centers Jason Allison and Anson Carter and
goaltender Byron Dafoe. Trotz also coached former Bruins goalie Jim
Carey, ex-Bruins forward Dmitri Khristich, and Olaf Kolzig,
Washington's No. 1 netminder.
</P>
<P>
   Trotz, whose team took on the Bruins here Wednesday night, said
he was sure Carter would find success at the NHL level, but wasn't
as certain about Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anson was an easier read than Jason. Anson was a guy who was
naturally a gifted athlete. He was very powerful, very quick. He
was very smooth on the ice. He had a good work ethic and he was
quite mature for being in the AHL,'' said Trotz. ``He stuck out
like a sore thumb. It was obvious he was going to do fine. Jason
was a guy who, because of his awkward skating, was a tougher guy to
get a read on. You knew if he was consistent in his work ethic and
he would listen and he would pay attention to both parts of the
game, that with his hands and size and reach that he could do some
good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotz said it took a little while for Allison to whittle off
some of his rough edges. ``He was a young 18-year-old when we
drafted him and he was sort of set in his ways,'' said Trotz.
``When he played in London (Ontario of the OHL), he played 40
minutes a game. He just sort of ended up standing around but
because of his hand skills and his vision, he could do some good
things in junior and score a lot of points. But he wasn't skating,
he wasn't moving his feet. He wasn't having success when he came up
to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotz said Allison was caught between being too good for the
junior leagues and too young for the NHL, and he wasn't eligible to
go to the minors so it made for a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed that adjustment period,'' said Trotz. ``He played
very well for Portland when he played for us on the offensive side.
He was a little bit stubborn in how he saw the game, but he loves
the game. You could talk to Jason about hockey and he'd talk to you
for hours, but he was set in his ways, a little stubborn. I think
as he's matured, he's seen he has to do different things to be
successful. He's got the work ethic. He's not the most graceful
guy. But as he got strong, he got better.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you knew he could do is dish the puck and he could
see the ice. He's got great patience. He's tough to contain. We
knew he was going to be a good player. Anson was a guy you'd knew
would be a consistently 50-60 point guy on your first line or your
checking line. And both those kids are good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After missing one game with a bruised knee, Joe Thornton was
back in the lineup against the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good (Wednesday) morning,'' said Thornton, who sat out
Monday's game in Carolina. ``So, I'm ready to go. (Trainer Don Del
Negro) has done a great job. It was a little sore after practice
(Tuesday) because it was the first time skating in a couple of
days, but it felt good. I'm ready to go. It's tough not being in
the lineup. It's nice to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison joked that Thornton just hated the trapping, obnoxiously
tough style of the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the Carolina flu,'' kidded Allison. ``Make sure you put
that in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Brandon Smith arrived early evening on Tuesday and
was in the lineup Wednesday. Smith, who was paired with Darren Van
Impe, was recalled from Providence after Mattias Timander was
sidelined by a separated left shoulder he suffered against
Carolina. Smith was a victim of a numbers game at the end of
training camp with the Bruins' decision to keep rookie Jonathan
Girard. Had they not, Smith would've likely been in Boston all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of caught me off guard because I had the feeling I was
going to be around for the start of the season, so it kind of came
as a surprise,'' said Smith. ``But it's all part of the game. I'm
kind of used to it, but it was very disappointing. To see what
happened to Johnny Grahame was kind of surprising also but it's all
part of the game. All we can do is go out and play and they make
the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Smith wasn't thrown off by being demoted.
After going down, it took him some time to find his game. ``It was
a little struggle the first couple of weeks because it was really
disappointing and my head wasn't into it,'' he said. ``But things
were starting to come around the last couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember all the activity back in June? The Bruins exposed
forward Peter Ferraro and goaltender Rob Tallas in the expansion
draft. Tallas was scheduled to be taken by Atlanta, but in exchange
for not taking him, the Bruins got Ferraro back and gave up center
Randy Robitaille. Robitaille's rights were then traded to Nashville
for Denny Lambert two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Now Robitaille is trying to carve out a niche with the
Predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played fine,'' said general manager David Poile. ``And in
fairness to him, in a very limited role. He doesn't dress in all
the games. Some games he's played on the fourth line. I think we're
a little ahead of the Bruins in terms of giving him an opportunity.
Still, we haven't put him in a top three line position for any
number of games. I think that's what we have to do if we're going
to be committed to him and vice versa. Maybe he's not showing
enough to warrant that. But it's real close. Statistically, he's
done not bad for the amount of ice time he has. He has some real
good skills offensively. When all is said and done, we should know
whether he's going to be a long-term player here or not.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In its ceaseless effort to prod its maddeningly lifeless
economy into action, Japan has spent more than $1 trillion, much of
it on bridges, tunnels, airports, concert halls and pavement aimed
at propping up the economy and satisfying political promises.
</P>
<P>
   The goal has been old-fashioned pump priming in the manner of
John Maynard Keynes, whose prescription for reviving an economy
was, more or less, dig a hole and fill it up, again and again if
need be. That is an oversimplification, but he was the leading
proponent of government spending as a means of restarting economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   So in Japan, airport runways have been added when an extension
would suffice. Tunnels are dug instead of simple roads. The
cobblestone sidewalks in a graceful old graveyard have been dug up
_ and relaid. Many a town is getting a multimillion-dollar concert
hall that would be the envy of Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the new Tokyo subway line. After waiting decades
for a new underground rail line that would relieve overcrowding on
the above-ground train that encircles the central city, Tokyo now
seems to have produced yet another boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when local population and subway ridership trends are
flat, it will cost taxpayers a stunning $10 billion _ 50 percent
more than originally projected in 1989 _ and it is two years behind
schedule. By one estimate, tickets will have to cost about $9.50
for the city to recoup its investment, a price that makes Tokyo's
infamously expensive taxis look like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just the half of it. What has really raised tempers
here is the fact that the new line will not live up to its billing
when it opens because it does not run in a complete circle. Riders
seeking the most direct route from the northern part of the city to
the southwest, or vice versa, will have to get off the train at one
point, walk across the platform to another track and wait for
another train.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Rolls-Royce that you can't shift into reverse,''
Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo's outspoken governor, said recently in one
of his milder critiques of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Route 12, as the line is known, is just one of many public works
projects here that seem extravagant, wasteful, pointless or just
plain dumb, especially if one is unfamiliar with the complicated
politics that brought them to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 50 percent of the spending has been useless at
stimulating further economic activity beyond the initial
investment,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here.
``And maintenance costs for it all will be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, the government announced yet another stimulus
package, its ninth, which included a minimum of $24 billion to
$28.5 billion at current exchange rates for traditional public
works.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how many jobs or how much economic growth has
been created by such lavish spending, but economists generally
agree that it has kept the Japanese economy from slipping into a
severe recession or even a depression. Indeed, a good portion of it
has come at the behest of the U.S. Treasury, which believes that a
healthy Japan is good for the world and certainly for the United
States. Never mind that in today's political climate, Washington
would never be allowed to spend so freely were the U.S. economy to
slip.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many economists argue, much of the money has been
spent profligately, staving off inevitable and necessary changes in
the economy but failing to put it back on its feet so that it can
move ahead. Some also have suggested that Japan would have been
better served if the money had been used to help more start-up
companies or to create a better safety net for the unemployed
instead of propping up failing construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not totally against public works,'' said Masaaki Kanno,
chief economist at J.P. Morgan Securities. After all, he notes, it
is hard to find a pothole in Tokyo's streets, and most public
facilities are clean and in good condition. ``But the government
should focus on projects whose returns on investment would be much
higher, like encouraging the construction of taller buildings in
Tokyo to enhance land usage.''
</P>
<P>
   That would require changes in the tax code, which penalizes
those who replace small ramshackle buildings with skyscrapers, as
opposed to outright spending. Instead, money keeps getting spent,
often in places where it seems to make no sense.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Consider the colored asphalt that is now used to keep Tokyo's
streets flawlessly paved. The roads are beginning to resemble
patchwork quilts, with stretches of red and green pavement
alternating with ordinary gray.
</P>
<P>
   A square yard or so of the green asphalt used by the Minato
Ward, Tokyo's wealthiest district, costs about $238, compared with
$146 for regular asphalt, said a ward spokesman. The green
pavement's rough surface helps keep cars from slipping, he said,
and is also used to distinguish the part of the road intended for
pedestrian use.
</P>
<P>
   But in an adjacent ward, a green stretch of pavement means there
is a school nearby and red pavement is used to prevent slippage and
warn drivers of blind curves.
</P>
<P>
   Given the stop-and-start nature of Tokyo traffic, drivers can
hardly be bothered to remember that in one district green pavement
means one thing while in another it means something else.

   Officials are also under pressure to spend all of the money
allocated to them for public works within a fiscal year. If they do
not, they get less the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Japanese system of single-year budgets, budget
organizers only think about the completion of roads and so forth
and do not consider future usage or maintenance costs,'' said
Atsushi Miyawaki, a professor of law at Hokkaido University who
specializes in government finance. ``Political pork barreling
becomes much easier if you disregard future costs.''
</P>
<P>
   And public works here, as in many other places, are nothing if
not political pork. Most involve construction, because that
industry directly and indirectly employs 10 million Japanese
workers and voters, said Takayoshi Igarashi, a professor at Hosei
University who has been an especially outspoken critic of public
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public works benefit the general contractors, their
subcontractors and so on, so that the eventual list of
beneficiaries, including the politicians who receive contributions
from the construction companies, is a long one,'' he said. ``It's a
very strong network.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new underground subway, there are 58 general contractors,
a fact that, coupled with the cost overruns and delays, led
Ishihara to charge earlier this year that the whole project was
ridden with ``dango,'' or price collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal bureaucrats denied his accusations, and Ishihara has
since chosen his words more carefully by criticizing the difference
between what the government agreed to pay and the actual cost of
the line. ``I don't know that dango is involved,'' he said. ``I
don't think so, but it's very strange, isn't it, very mysterious
that such discrepancies in cost would arise, considering there were
so many smart people here working on the bidding.''

<P>
   The planning of many public works projects also seems inept.
Take the airport in Fukushima Prefecture. The prefecture, about 100
miles north of Tokyo, was less than a year into the construction
when it decided that the airport needed a longer runway.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than merely adding several hundred feet, the
prefecture successfully appealed to the national government for
funding for a new runway.
</P>
<P>
   Makoto Kano, a prefectural official, said a new runway was the
obvious answer. Forecasts suggested there would be a demand for
jumbo jet service, he said, and they require not only a longer
runway, but also a path for jets to enter it. The original runway
was too close to the terminal building to construct one, he said,
so a new runway was built. The cost: about $267 million at current
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But even before construction could be completed last December,
the prefecture decided that the new runway also would have to be
extended, and it received national government approval for that,
too. Fukushima Ombudsman, a citizens' watchdog group that opposes
extending the new runway, estimates that the extension will cost
anywhere from $380 million to $667 million.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the extension more expensive than building the runway in
the first place? Kano did not have an answer, other than to say
that the prefecture was still debating the total length. He said he
expects the extension to cost a little more than $380 million.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The urge to spend certainly seems to take precedence over
planning. In Hokkaido, the northernmost of the four main Japanese
islands, authorities decided to build the Doto Jidoshado, a toll
road that will eventually cross the island.
</P>
<P>
   About 32 miles of the new 160-mile highway has been completed,
at a cost of about $1.9 billion at current exchange rates. But it
has failed to attract drivers largely because an existing highway
running parallel to it is free.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have tried to attract drivers by offering prizes, golf
competitions and the chance to drive a snowplow. The campaign
succeeded in increasing the average number of cars using the toll
road to 862 a day but it still has the distinction of being the
least used road in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   All this spending, too, has led to a tremendously expensive game
of one-upmanship. In Hamamatsu, a city of about 555,000 people
southwest of Tokyo, almost $1.9 billion of public and private money
was spent to build a concert hall and performance center.
</P>
<P>
   Act City Hamamatsu, which opened in 1994, features a $3 million
organ and a high-tech, four-stage performance hall. ``It is
expensive,'' a spokesman for the hall said. ``There are few stages
in the world that use a four-panel stage because of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   So grand is Act City that its cross-prefecture rival, Shizuoka
City, with a population of about 471,000 decided it needed one too.
The Granship Shizuoka, designed by the leading Japanese architect,
Arata Isozaki, has a meeting hall with a view of Mount Fuji and six
booths for simultaneous translators, and its main hall can be used
for sporting events because all of its 4,600 seats are removable.
</P>
<P>
   It opened last March, about 40 miles from its competitor. The
price: $672 million in public money.

TREATMENT OF KIDNEY FAILURE IS FLAWED, 2 STUDIES SUGGEST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two studies being published Thursday suggest that flaws in the
treatment of kidney failure may endanger thousands of Americans.
Both studies concern dialysis, the treatment given several times a
week to cleanse the blood of waste products that build up when the
kidneys do not work.
</P>
<P>
   The first report, by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and
Harvard Medical School, found that people with kidney failure who
had dialysis at for-profit treatment centers were 20 percent more
likely to die and 26 percent less likely to be referred for a
transplant than patients treated at nonprofit centers. Two-thirds
of the 200,000 Americans on dialysis are treated at for-profit
centers, which have come to dominate the dialysis industry in the
last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they did not know the reasons for the
disparities, but speculated that for-profit centers might be
cutting corners in ways that harmed patients, and failing to
recommend transplants in order to hang on to customers and keep
dialysis payments coming in.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, also by Harvard researchers, found that blacks
with kidney failure were considerably less likely than whites to be
referred for the best treatment, a transplant _ a difference that
could not be explained by medical differences between blacks and
whites or on blacks' wanting transplants less than whites. More
likely, the authors said, the difference was in doctors' failure to
inform blacks properly about the advantages of the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies are being published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The first, directed by Dr. Pushkal P. Garg, an instructor in
medicine and health care policy at Harvard Medical School, included
3,569 patients who began dialysis in 1990 or 1993, and studied them
for three to six years; 2,168 were treated at for-profit dialysis
centers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that for every 100 patients treated per
year, 21.2 died at for-profit centers, as against 17.1 at nonprofit
centers _ a 20 percent higher risk of death. The study also found
that patients at those centers were 26 percent less likely to be
referred to transplant centers and placed on waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   Garg and his colleagues suggested that the root of the problem
was the Medicare program, which pays for dialysis for all patients
but has not raised the price it pays since 1973. The shrinking
value of the payments, they said, might have led centers needing to
show a profit to skimp on patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts viewed Garg's findings with caution, and several
noted that earlier studies had examined similar data and found no
difference in death or transplant referral rates between for-profit
and nonprofit centers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Kidney Foundation, a patient advocacy group that
receives some of its financing from dialysis centers, issued a
statement saying that Garg's data was several years old and that
treatment of dialysis patients had improved in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The new study did not look for cost-cutting tactics at dialysis
centers, but previous studies by other researchers have found that
some centers had tried to save money by shortening the time each
patient spent on dialysis, giving smaller doses of expensive drugs,
reducing staff size, replacing nurses with lower-paid technicians
and reusing disposable equipment. It is not known whether those
practices took place in the new study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the likeliest explanation but there is no direct proof,''
said Dr. Norman Levinsky, a kidney specialist and professor of
medicine at Boston University, who wrote an editorial about the
studies in the same issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   Garg acknowledged that dialysis patients might be alarmed by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual patients will be concerned about what's happening
at their corner dialysis center, but our study doesn't address
that,'' Garg said. ``We try to emphasize that this is an average
effect across all facilities in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, he added, that some for-profit centers may provide
excellent care and some nonprofit centers may give poor care.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when asked which type of center he would choose if
he suddenly needed dialysis, Garg said, ``The odds would be in my
favor if I went to a nonprofit center.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinsky said, ``Neither patients nor relatives should be
frightened that they're in danger of imminent death. But they can
use this as an occasion for a dialogue with their nephrologists.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be a good idea for patients in both kinds of
units to ask their kidney specialists if their center was providing
enough dialysis and if it had enough technicians, nurses and social
workers to provide good care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Josephine Briggs, director of the kidney, urologic and
hematologic division of the National Institute of Diabetes,
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, said that because other researchers
had not made findings similar to Garg's, ``this kind of analysis
needs to be done again and followed over time,'' and added, ``If
it's a persistent trend, it will have to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eli Friedman, who runs a nonprofit dialysis unit for Kings
County Hospital and the State University Medical Center in
Brooklyn, said: ``Though I doubt it is true that proprietary units
are increasing the mortality in patients to increase their profits,
I'm happy to see the discussion provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added that it would make no sense for dialysis centers
to provide poor care, because if patients died they would be losing
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be dumb business, bad medicine and inhumane, and I
don't think that combination exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, a team led by Dr. John Z. Ayanian, an
assistant professor of medicine and health care policy at Harvard
Medical School, conducted a survey of 1,392 dialysis patients,
slightly more than half of whom were black.
</P>
<P>
   It was already known that blacks were less likely than whites to
have transplants, as well as other effective medical procedures
like bypass surgery, knee and hip replacement, and cataract
surgery. The reasons for the differences are not known, but it has
been suggested that blacks simply did not want the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Ayanian and his colleagues found that blacks were slightly less
likely than whites to want transplants. But the small difference in
interest could not begin to account for the large difference in
referrals by doctors to transplant centers. Among black women, 50.4
percent were referred to a transplant center, but with white women
the figure was 70.5 percent. For black men, 53.9 percent were
referred, as opposed to 76.2 percent for white men.
</P>
<P>
   Ayanian said he did not think the differences reflected overt
prejudice on the part of doctors, who are mostly white. ``I think
primarily we're talking about deficits in communication and
trust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, citing Ayanian's study, the federal Health Care
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, announced that
it would take new steps to make sure that everyone on dialysis is
evaluated for a kidney transplant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh was hoping to get started
on the investigation of EgyptAir Flight 990 when he went in to see
Attorney General Janet Reno nine days ago. She favored the move,
but with one caveat: All other interested parties must sign on,
including the US State Department and the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the National Transportation Safety Board, which had
been poised to turn over the investigation to the FBI, has pulled
back. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been walking a
diplomatic tightrope, attempting to prevent the investigation from
harming relations with an important Middle East ally while also
making sure that the Egyptians do not hinder the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While news reports have already exhaustively examined the
sequence of events in the Oct. 31 crash and the performance of the
EgyptAir crew, the investigation officially remains in an early
stage. And US officials say progress is being complicated by
diplomatic and cultural clashes of two countries that sometimes
appear to have conflicting goals, and by the variety of US agencies
involved.
</P>
<P>
   US government and law enforcement officials say the situation
has not reached the level of an international crisis, but several
concede that the dispute with Egypt may eventually require
President Clinton's decision on how to handle the investigaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's eventually going to reach the White House,
because of the diplomatic sensitivity'' said a law enforcement
official.
</P>
<P>
   As for transferring the case to the FBI, a Justice Department
official said: ``I don't think it's possible to ever put a real
timeline on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluidity of the timetable is apparent in the comment of
Abdel El Abyad, a spokesman for the Egyptian Embassy in Washington.
a decision on making the investigation a criminal probe cannot be
made until Egyptian investigators examine all the flight data, he
said, which could take days, weeks, or even months.
</P>
<P>
   The first real test of America's patience and Egypt's
willingness to concede that something other than mechanical failure
caused the crash, which the NTSB had initially ruled out, may come
as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say that by then, Egyptian investigators should
have finished transcribing data from the cockpit voice recorder and
matching it with the flight data recorder. But those same officials
also don't rule out that Egypt may want to take their examination a
step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to go as far as we need to go with Egypt,'' a
State Department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the conflict within the US government, the law
enforcement official said, ``Politics shouldn't play a role in
solving tragic events like this. The only thing that everyone
should be interested in is finding the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts between the two countries' approach was also
apparent Wednesday, when a senior Egyptian Transportation Ministry
official said that an explosion caused the crash, in which all 217
people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario differs sharply with the preliminary assessment
of NTSB Chairman James Hall, who said early this week that data
from the aircraft's ``black boxes'' suggest that mechanical
problems or bad weather did not cause the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's remarks by General Issam Ahmed, who heads the
government's flight-training program at the ministry, marked the
first time any senior Egyptian official publicly said an explosion
was the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who previously headed the Transportation Ministry's plane
accidents committee, said the Egyptian experts in the United States
should concentrate on investigating the tail of the plane, which
``carries the mystery of the accident,'' the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cases carrying the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders, the ``black boxes'' in the plane's tail, were severely
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that the tail of the plane, where the two boxes
are located, was subjected to an explosion at the height of 33,000
feet. It was either an internal or external explosion,'' Ahmed, who
is not involved in investigating the Flight 990 crash, said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences of interpretation have been evident since the
crash. In the United States, much has been made of the fact that
co-pilot Gamil El Batouty uttered the phrase ``I put my phrase in
God's hands.'' That phrase, combined such evidence as the shutting
off of the autopilot and the wild movements of the plane, have led
some to construct a scenario in which Batouty was saying a prayer
before deliberately putting the plane into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians have angrily responded that the phrase is a common
saying among Arabs and has no special significance. They argue that
Americans have stereotyped Arabs as religious fanatics and rushed
to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though NTSB Chairman Hall has said the crash might be result of
a ``deliberate act,'' he has noted the ``differences in cultural
interpretation'' over El Batouty's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the crash, the NTSB was operating on two
levels _ informing Egyptian officials of their concern that the
accident was the result of deliberate pilot action, while Hall
discussed with Freeh the possibility of having the bureau take over
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking government source said the State Department's
concern is two-fold. On the one hand, the diplomats do not want to
see an erosion of relations with a key nation in the Middle East.
In addition, there is concern that fundamentalists in Egypt could
use the US investigation as a trigger to an attempt to unseat Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying hard to the Egyptians as much room and time
as they need to see the case the way we do,'' the government source
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Clinton is being kept informed of the investigation through his
National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a very strategically important ally that
is cooperating fully in a very difficult investigation,'' Leavy
said of Egypt. ``It was their carrier, their pilot, and there are
the obvious diplomatic sensitivities that have to be taken into
account, but it's a far cry from an international crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdel El Abyad of the Egyptian Embassy in Washington said
Egyptian crash investigators had done nothing to interrupt the
probe. When asked about the involvement of the FBI, he said, ``The
leading role is played by the NTSB, and they are still playing that
role. I wouldn't inject the FBI in this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While control of the inquiry remains in flux, evidence continues
to be collected. According to NTSB spokesman Jamie Finch, the FBI
is still working with crash investigators, and ``we're just
maintaining the evidence as it needs to be properly maintained
until a final decison is made on the status of the type of
investigation it will be.''

FRANCE REJECTS COCA-COLA'S BID FOR ORANGINA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a two-year struggle with French regulators, the Coca-Cola
Co.'s bid to buy the Orangina soft-drink brand from Pernod Ricard
SA was rejected Wednesday for the second time, and a spokesman for
Coca-Cola said the company regarded the decision as final.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement from the French government came as a surprise
because Coca-Cola had carefully reconstructed its original offer to
satisfy officials of the competition council, who had turned the
deal down in September of last year. The government's concern was
that if Coke bought Orangina, it would control too much of the
distribution network in France that other soft-drink makers use.
Among the companies that might have been affected is Pepsico, which
had lodged a complaint with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The French finance minister, Christian Sautter, said the terms
of the revised $733 million bid, in which Coca-Cola offered to
exclude the distribution of Orangina in restaurants and other
public places, did not do enough to allay concerns about market
dominance. ``The modifications of Coca-Cola's bid were not judged
sufficient to meet all the guarantees needed in terms of
competition,'' he said in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement provided by a spokesman in Paris, Thierry
Jacquillat, president of Pernod Ricard, said: ``We share the
disappointment of the entire staff of the Orangina company. This
decision deprives them of legitimate ambitions and considerable
means of development on the global market, and it is detrimental to
the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard must now seek a new buyer for Orangina, which it
has said many times it wants to sell in order to concentrate on its
other businesses, which include wine and spirits as well as fruit
processing. A Pepsico spokesman, Jeff Brown, refused to say whether
the company would try to buy it, although he did applaud the French
government for having ``again established itself as one of the
foremost defenders of fair competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision will help preserve choice and fair pricing
for French consumers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola said the company accepted the
decision. ``We're disappointed that the ministry has rejected the
sale of Orangina, but we respect the government's final decision,''
said the spokesman, Rob Baskin. ``We would have preferred a
different outcome, but the minister's decision does not diminish
our commitment to French consumers and our core French business.''
</P>
<P>
   Several industry experts noted that in the time that had elapsed
since December 1997, when Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive,
M. Douglas Ivester, announced the Orangina acquisition for about
$780 million, Coca-Cola has made other acquisitions that seem like
better bargains. In particular, the purchase of the Cadbury
Schweppes brands in most of the world outside the United States,
for $1.1 billion, added far more volume to the Coca-Cola system
than the Orangina deal would have. Orangina would have represented
about 55 million cases a year; the Cadbury purchase accounts for
about 400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice for Coke to complete this
transaction,'' said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a
trade newsletter. ``But losing it is no big deal, by a long shot.
The Cadbury deal is a lot bigger and a lot more consistent with
Coke's strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the loss of Orangina was seen by one analyst as a blow to
the image of Coca-Cola and its chairman, as well as to plans to
expand Coca-Cola's influence in France, which has one of the lowest
per-capita consumptions of Coke in Europe. ``The curse on the
Continent continues,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney, referring to what has been a difficult
year for Coca-Cola in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A huge recall in June cost the company and its bottler,
Coca-Cola Enterprises, more than $100 million in revenue. Coca-Cola
is also spending heavily on marketing to rebuild its reputation
with consumers. There have also been problems with European
Commission regulators that eroded part of the Cadbury deal, and
there are continuing investigations of Coca-Cola's dealings in
Italy, Germany and other parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years is a long time for investors to wait for something
to happen,'' Ms. Solomon said, noting that many investors had
stopped worrying about whether the Orangina purchase would be
completed. ``But it's one more frustration for Ivester.'' Ivester
announced the deal barely two months after taking over the top job
from Roberto Goizueta, who died of cancer in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, with more than $700 million now freed up,
Coca-Cola may resume its share buyback program, said another
beverage analyst, Andrew J. Conway of Morgan Stanley. ``The French
competitive council's decision implies that Coke won't be able to
significantly expand its brand in the next five years there,'' he
said. ``But this opens up more share repurchase opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola halted the share buyback program earlier this year
after credit agencies expressed worry about the company's profits
in light of its other acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's earnings have declined since last summer, when
economic crises around the world and other issues slowed the
company's growth. After a sharp selloff this fall, its shares have
risen drastically over the last week after announcements of much
higher concentrate prices at both Coca-Cola and Pepsico. The stock
has also been helped by a Merrill Lynch analyst's report that
predicted impressive earnings growth next year. Shares of Coca-Cola
rose $1.25 Wednesday, to $67.9375.

   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh was hoping to get started
on the investigation of EgyptAir Flight 990 when he went in to see
Attorney General Janet Reno nine days ago. She favored the move,
but with one caveat: All other interested parties must sign on,
including the US State Department and the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the National Transportation Safety Board, which had
been poised to turn over the investigation to the FBI, has pulled
back. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been walking a
diplomatic tightrope, attempting to prevent the investigation from
harming relations with an important Middle East ally while also
making sure that the Egyptians do not hinder the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While news reports have already exhaustively examined the
sequence of events in the Oct. 31 crash and the performance of the
EgyptAir crew, the investigation officially remains in an early
stage. And US officials say progress is being complicated by
diplomatic and cultural clashes of two countries that sometimes
appear to have conflicting goals, and by the variety of US agencies
involved.
</P>
<P>
   US government and law enforcement officials say the situation
has not reached the level of an international crisis, but several
concede that the dispute with Egypt may eventually require
President Clinton's decision on how to handle the investigaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's eventually going to reach the White House,
because of the diplomatic sensitivity'' said a law enforcement
official.
</P>
<P>
   As for transferring the case to the FBI, a Justice Department
official said: ``I don't think it's possible to ever put a real
timeline on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluidity of the timetable is apparent in the comment of
Abdel El Abyad, a spokesman for the Egyptian Embassy in Washington.
a decision on making the investigation a criminal probe cannot be
made until Egyptian investigators examine all the flight data, he
said, which could take days, weeks, or even months.
</P>
<P>
   The first real test of America's patience and Egypt's
willingness to concede that something other than mechanical failure
caused the crash, which the NTSB had initially ruled out, may come
as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say that by then, Egyptian investigators should
have finished transcribing data from the cockpit voice recorder and
matching it with the flight data recorder. But those same officials
also don't rule out that Egypt may want to take their examination a
step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to go as far as we need to go with Egypt,'' a
State Department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the conflict within the US government, the law
enforcement official said, ``Politics shouldn't play a role in
solving tragic events like this. The only thing that everyone
should be interested in is finding the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts between the two countries' approach was also
apparent Wednesday, when a senior Egyptian Transportation Ministry
official said that an explosion caused the crash, in which all 217
people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario differs sharply with the preliminary assessment
of NTSB Chairman James Hall, who said early this week that data
from the aircraft's ``black boxes'' suggest that mechanical
problems or bad weather did not cause the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's remarks by General Issam Ahmed, who heads the
government's flight-training program at the ministry, marked the
first time any senior Egyptian official publicly said an explosion
was the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who previously headed the Transportation Ministry's plane
accidents committee, said the Egyptian experts in the United States
should concentrate on investigating the tail of the plane, which
``carries the mystery of the accident,'' the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cases carrying the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders, the ``black boxes'' in the plane's tail, were severely
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that the tail of the plane, where the two boxes
are located, was subjected to an explosion at the height of 33,000
feet. It was either an internal or external explosion,'' Ahmed, who
is not involved in investigating the Flight 990 crash, said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences of interpretation have been evident since the
crash. In the United States, much has been made of the fact that
co-pilot Gamil El Batouty uttered the phrase ``I put my phrase in
God's hands.'' That phrase, combined such evidence as the shutting
off of the autopilot and the wild movements of the plane, have led
some to construct a scenario in which Batouty was saying a prayer
before deliberately putting the plane into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians have angrily responded that the phrase is a common
saying among Arabs and has no special significance. They argue that
Americans have stereotyped Arabs as religious fanatics and rushed
to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though NTSB Chairman Hall has said the crash might be result of
a ``deliberate act,'' he has noted the ``differences in cultural
interpretation'' over El Batouty's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the crash, the NTSB was operating on two
levels _ informing Egyptian officials of their concern that the
accident was the result of deliberate pilot action, while Hall
discussed with Freeh the possibility of having the bureau take over
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking government source said the State Department's
concern is two-fold. On the one hand, the diplomats do not want to
see an erosion of relations with a key nation in the Middle East.
In addition, there is concern that fundamentalists in Egypt could
use the US investigation as a trigger to an attempt to unseat Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying hard to the Egyptians as much room and time
as they need to see the case the way we do,'' the government source
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Clinton is being kept informed of the investigation through his
National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a very strategically important ally that
is cooperating fully in a very difficult investigation,'' Leavy
said of Egypt. ``It was their carrier, their pilot, and there are
the obvious diplomatic sensitivities that have to be taken into
account, but it's a far cry from an international crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdel El Abyad of the Egyptian Embassy in Washington said
Egyptian crash investigators had done nothing to interrupt the
probe. When asked about the involvement of the FBI, he said, ``The
leading role is played by the NTSB, and they are still playing that
role. I wouldn't inject the FBI in this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While control of the inquiry remains in flux, evidence continues
to be collected. According to NTSB spokesman Jamie Finch, the FBI
is still working with crash investigators, and ``we're just
maintaining the evidence as it needs to be properly maintained
until a final decison is made on the status of the type of
investigation it will be.''

MURDOCH ERRED IN NBC REMARKS, SAYS ASSOCIATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch's suggestion that NBC had
been offered for sale to Time Warner was ``a bit of a mistake,'' an
executive close to Murdoch said Wednesday. The executive also
sought to counter any criticism that Murdoch, with his remarks, had
been seeking to affect the Time Warner stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the executive said, Murdoch had simply reacted to a
television interviewer's unexpected question by repeating reports
he had heard about Time Warner vice chairman Ted Turner's interest
in acquiring NBC from General Electric. ``Rupert misspoke,'' said
the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's comments came Tuesday evening, after the close of the
stock market, on a financial news program on the Fox News cable
channel, which his company owns. He was responding to a question
about whether he was interested in buying NBC. He said that General
Electric had already offered NBC's television operations to Time
Warner for $25 billion and that some Time Warner board members were
very interested in the deal while others were strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC and Time Warner reacted with unusually rapid and
adamant denials. Within hours, representatives of both Time Warner
and GE issued strong statements. GE spokeswoman Beth Comstock said,
``We don't usually comment on the musings of others, but this is
flat-out denial.'' Beyond dismissing Murdoch's remarks as musings,
Ms. Comstock's specific denial carried unusual weight because GE
and NBC routinely respond to questions of the possible sale of the
network with a pro forma response: ``We don't comment on rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal reason for the caution is that the companies could
face sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission if they
deny such talks but are in fact discussing a sale. With both Time
Warner and GE on record with formal denials, any such deal between
them could not now legally be in the works.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Initially, some executives at Time Warner had speculated about
Murdoch's motives for making the remarks about the sale by
questioning whether he was trying to undermine the company's stock
price. That price had already been negatively affected this week
after a media analyst, Jessica Reif-Cohen of Merrill Lynch,
downgraded her evaluation of the company from a buy to an
accumulate rating. Wednesday, Time Warner shares gained $3.1875,
closing at $62.875.
</P>
<P>
   The executive close to Murdoch said Wednesday that this was not
at all his intention. ``There was no grand scheme,'' the executive
said. ``Rupert is an executive who is very much in the flow of
information. He has heard that Ted Turner is pushing Time Warner to
buy NBC.'' The executive noted, as did many other executives
Wednesday, that Murdoch has had a longstanding personal feud with
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   One other executive familiar with Time Warner's corporate
strategy confirmed that ``some executives in the company are
extremely interested in seeing if something could be done with NBC,
but nothing is going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring NBC would entail enormous complications for Time
Warner. It would create a company with two broadcast networks _ NBC
and WB _ as well as a company with cable systems in the same cities
as television stations (in New York, for example, NBC owns Channel
4 and Time Warner owns most of the cable systems). Both of those
cross-ownership situations are barred by the Federal Communications
Commission, though media companies are lobbying to have the rules
changed.

THEFT OF A YOUNG SUPERSTAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are 16 green-and-white championship banners
hanging from the rafters of the huge house. The first one was
raised in 1957. The last one found its place in 1986. The 17th
banner, which would have been earned last June, was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The Celtics had a title stolen from them one
Sunday afternoon two years ago in New Jersey. They were betrayed by
a plastic ball in a bin. They wanted the ball to bounce left and it
went right. In those few inches, the Celtics and their fans would
say goodbye and hello to players that they never would have said
hello or goodbye to if the larceny hadn't occurred. You've heard of
being a year or two away from a title? The Celtics were an inch or
two away.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the worst news: In those few seconds, the Celtics
had their 17th championship delayed by, at least, one year. They
would have won it last season, not the San Antonio Spurs, if their
pockets hadn't been picked. Even the main character in our play,
Tim Duncan, understands the details of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to Boston,'' Duncan said Wednesday. ``I
had articles pinned up in my dorm room. Everyone said the Celtics
were going to be the worst team and that they would pick me first.
I had people in Boston trying to find a place for me to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were the worst team in the East. They won 15 games,
only one of them in their division and finished a staggering 46
games out of first place. Duncan probably had his bags packed
before watching the 1997 lottery on television. His life changed
when he sat in front of his TV and, ``I saw that the Celtics got
(draft picks) 3 and 6. I was thinking, `Oh (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one thinking that. Another character in our
play, M.L. Carr, was the Celtics' representative that afternoon in
Secaucus, N.J. I watched Carr's reaction when the picks were
announced and, to this day, I have never seen a man of color lose
his color as fast as Carr did. He didn't even look real as he sat
there. He appeared to be a life-sized portrait with an anguished
half-smile painted on his face (that day, ``M.L.'' could have stood
for ``Mona Lisa'').
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and the Spurs played the Celtics Wednesday night at the
FleetCenter. The 7-foot forward-center is averaging 21 points, 14
rebounds, and 3.3 assists. He is 23 years old. There are only two
players in the league _ Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O'Neal _ who
can even think about shutting him down. He and a remixed band of
Celtics certainly would have won a title last season. This will be
detailed in our play.
</P>
<P>
   Title: ``Tim, 'Toine, and Rick: A Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Key Characters: Tim Duncan (a young superstar), Antoine Walker,
Rick Pitino, The Renounced Free Agents, Kenny Anderson, Walter
McCarty, Tom Heinsohn, Chauncey Billups, David Wesley, Tony Battie,
Travis Knight, Chris Mills, Andrew DeClercq, Paul Pierce, Dino
Radja, Eric Williams, a pro-Celtics plastic ball.
</P>
<P>
   Potential Understudies: Ruben Patterson, Michael Dickerson,
Bryce Drew, Matt Harpring, Pat Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We join the play in progress. The pro-Celtics plastic ball has
just bounced left instead of right. Boston has the first and sixth
picks in the NBA draft. Carr surprises no one and announces that
the Celtics will draft Duncan No.1. Sources confirm that the
Celtics have reached an agreement with Bill Russell. The legendary
center has one assignment: tutor Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   June and July are heavy personnel times for new Celtics coach
Pitino. He knows he will have Duncan as his center and Antoine
Walker at either small or power forward. He has a roster loaded
with 10 free agents, most of them marginal pros. But he does have a
veteran free agent swingman in Rick Fox and a good free agent point
guard in Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino knows that Fox and Wesley are both solid in the locker
room, and you need that for a young team. He also understands that
both are above-average defensive players. He plans to draft Ron
Mercer with the sixth pick. A player such as Mercer _ one who can
consistently make 17-foot jumpers _ makes Duncan even more
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that Pitino will renounce all of his free agents to
sign Lakers free agent center Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitino: Why would I sign Travis Knight? I've got Tim Duncan.
Next thing you know, someone will say I want to sign Tyus Edney.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coach signs Fox and Wesley and renounces the remaining eight
free agents to create salary-cap room. The one man he regrets
cutting is Marty Conlon. He and owner Paul Gaston agree to buy out
the contract of Radja, who does not fit in the team's plans. With
additional cap space, the Celtics sign Warriors free agent DeClercq
to back up Duncan. If the Celtics can get 12-17 minutes per game
out of him, they will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can see it: The Celtics are definitely going to make
the playoffs in 1997-98. They made great decisions in the draft.
They passed on Colorado guard Billups and Texas Tech forward Battie
so they could take Mercer. They laughed at Mills' agent, Arn
Tellem, when he suggested that they sign his client to a seven-year
contract worth more than $35 million. They hung up on the Denver
Nuggets when the team asked about Eric Williams . . . for a
second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the season, the Celtics wondered why Trail Blazers
guard Anderson did not report to the Raptors when he was traded
there. They teased broadcaster Heinsohn about his special
relationship with Knicks forward McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn: I love Walter!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics won 43 games and made the playoffs. The only
negative thing about that is they watched a fine player from the
University of Kansas, forward Pierce, taken by the Nets (who won 36
games and had the 10th pick) in the 1998 draft. The Celtics,
instead of drafting from among guards Dickerson and Drew and
forwards Harpring and Garrity, traded out of the first round. They
moved Greg Minor's contract in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Their 1998-99 lineup: Wesley and Mercer in the backcourt, Duncan
at center, and Fox and Walker at forward. Bench: Dana Barros,
Williams, DeClercq, Adrian Griffin (why not?), Dee Brown, Patterson
(free-agent signee), and Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 Spur starters: Avery Johnson and Mario Elie at
guard, David Robinson at center, and forwards Duncan and Sean
Elliott. Top Reserves: Antonio Daniels, Steve Kerr, Malik Rose, Wil
Perdue, Jerome Kersey . . .
</P>
<P>
   There was no Michael Jordan last season. There was no one in the
playoffs who could stop Duncan. As he showed Wednesday night, most
people cannot stop him. He would have won a title in Boston if the
team had not been robbed in the New Jersey daylight.

 SPORTS COLUMN: WITH THANKS FROM LeSHON JOHNSON  
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, he had two young children to preoccupy his thoughts
and his wife to assist him in keeping his faith. Thanksgiving was
spent quietly, pensively, in his Jersey City, N.J., apartment,
supposedly a convenient ride to where he was receiving treatment
for the cancer that so rudely had rerouted his life.
</P>
<P>
   LeShon Johnson was not familiar with New Jersey. He barely knew
the Giants. The traffic and the tunnel and the cacophony that
awaited him on the Manhattan end were really the environment he
found forbidding, and strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord knows I wouldn't drive in the city,'' Johnson said
recently. ``Even though I hadn't played a down for them, the Giants
were nice enough to send a car.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the inevitable crawl of crosstown traffic, during
those frightening collisions with mortality's terms, that Johnson
found himself experiencing cravings for the rural Oklahoma
countryside he once zealously swore was no longer home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never coming back to a small town,'' he recalls saying
when he left Haskell, Okla., for junior college.
</P>
<P>
   In those dark days of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
when his weight was down and his hair was gone, a town of 2,200
people suddenly was the most inviting place on the face of the
earth. Haskell, without a stoplight or stop sign, was where traffic
flowed like the adjacent Arkansas River. It was where LeShon
Johnson had carried the football to statewide prominence, where he
had graduated in his high school's largest-ever class, 53 students.
It was where life once felt like an open road.
</P>
<P>
   It was where a call to the Chamber of Commerce was answered
Wednesday by Rocky Purdom, at his town convenience store. ``Oh, we
don't really have an office,'' Purdom said. ``We just set it up so
that if anyone calls, it'll be to a place where the phone is
manned.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, of course he knew LeShon Johnson, the way he knew most
everyone in the rural hamlet that is 35 miles south of Tulsa. As a
matter of fact, LeShon's cousin, Chris, was the current talk of the
town, what with Haskell High School still alive in the state
football tournament and Chris Johnson 33 yards short of 5,000 for
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, Purdom said, runs with the same abandon as LeShon, son of
Luther, one of the country's most successful black ranchers. In
addition to raising horses on his Five Bar Ranch, Luther Johnson
had been a professional bull rider. LeShon, one of three children,
began riding at the age of 8, competing in rodeos until he was 17.
</P>
<P>
   Running a football, riding a bull. These were trade hazards that
could never seem as perilous as those interminable journeys across
the Hudson, the car creeping toward the Cornell Medical Center at
New York Hospital for another round of radiation, another drain on
the body that no longer was as sturdy as a bull's.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's cancer was diagnosed in May 1998, the result of a
minicamp physical after he had signed with the Giants as a veteran
free agent. An X-ray detected the malignancy, in his chest. He was
27 years old, married all of eight days to his college sweetheart,
Nalani.
</P>
<P>
   By last Thanksgiving, Johnson was nearing the end of his seven
chemotherapy treatments. He didn't know if he would play football
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where I was headed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He just knew he didn't want to go for any more rides to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   By February, doctors were giving him a clean bill of health. By
July, he was back on the field, if not altogether physically whole.
His recuperating muscles still need massages many nights from his
wife. His season, in which he has averaged roughly 2.5 yards a
carry, has been less a revelation than he originally hoped. Yet how
can he voice frustration?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Thanksgiving,'' he said, ``and when I look back to where
I was at this time last year, I know I have so much to be thankful
for.''
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, he didn't know any Giants well enough to
ask over for a home-cooked meal. This year, he has extended
invitations to a few. This year, regardless of where football may
yet take him, he has a far better idea of where he is headed.
</P>
<P>
   With his next examination set for Dec. 5, Johnson is starting to
look down the distant road. He has begun the process of building a
home on the outskirts of Haskell. That is where he wants to raise
Kaleo, 5, and Klayton, 2. That is where he sees his hopes, his
dreams. That is where he imagines giving future thanks, for many
more years of serenity and life.

 &HT;    Eds: Runs with BONFIRE
 &HT;    Cause of bonfire collapse still uncertain
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Imagine shoving one end of a yardstick
into the ground and then pushing sideways on the other end. Before
long, the yardstick will snap.
</P>
<P>
   The same forces might explain how a giant woodpile collapsed at
Texas A&AMP;M University last week, according to engineers in Texas and
around the nation. The engineers, who are not involved in
investigations into the collapse, said in interviews that it was
too early and information was too sketchy to reach any firm
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But based on details that have emerged, they say, one likely
scenario is that some of the logs making up the teepee-like
structure shifted. That, in turn, could have caused lateral
pressure that snapped the 100-foot-long center pole of
pressure-treated pine, bringing down the entire structure.
</P>
<P>
   This theory seems consistent with the sequence of events
described by many students working on the bonfire, which was
intended to be burned tonight before Friday's football game between
Texas A&AMP;M and the University of Texas. The students said they
noticed a shift in the load, followed by a loud crack and the
collapse of the woodpile. Twelve people were killed, and 27 others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The woodpile, which was 40 to 45 feet tall at the time it
collapsed, consisted of four cake-style layers of logs lashed to
each other and leaning against the center pole. The center pole,
which was made of two logs spliced together, broke in at least two
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is balancing the load,'' said Hal Watson Jr., a
professor of mechanical engineering at Southern Methodist
University who has testified many times in court cases involving
accident reconstruction. ``It was evident from aerial helicopter
views that the center pole did snap somewhere close to its base.
That, more than likely, plus an unbalanced load, was the reason it
fell over.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that an unbalanced load alone caused the
woodpile to collapse and that the fracturing of the center pole was
a result of the collapse and not an initiating factor, said William
Bulleit, a professor of civil engineering at Michigan Technological
University and a specialist in structural and wood engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The load could have become unbalanced in myriad ways, Bulleit
said. A gap in the layers of logs could have allowed one or more to
shift and the other logs followed suit. Logs might not have been
added evenly, causing the woodpile to lean to one side. Or logs
might have started to slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or it could be that one of the layers shifted enough to break
the center pole, and that caused other layers to come down,''
Bulleit said. ``Or perhaps the center pole didn't break at first
but deformed, allowing a layer of logs to shift, and then the pole
broke. You could probably dream up possibilities all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another possibility is that the center pole had a weakness
or defect in it. An internal flaw would not be detectable without
special nondestructive testing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a structure of this type is a complex system, with the
strength of the wood, the strength of connections and the design
all figuring into its stability, said Franz-Josef Ulm, a professor
of civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Accident investigators ought to be able to pinpoint a weak link by
running various simulations on a computerized model, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of inquiry undoubtedly will be whether a shift in the
woodpile was sufficient to produce what engineers call a ``bending
moment.'' That is the technical term for sideways pressure causing
the center pole to snap, much like the hypothetical yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like a very stable structure,'' said James
Ricles, an associate professor of civil engineering and a
specialist in structures at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. ``I
don't know if I would stand on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he was horrified at the lack of safety precautions
for construction of the bonfire, with scores of students atop it at
one time. ``Having them crawl all over the structure like they were
_ I think that was an accident waiting to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How could basic engineering and safety principles possibly be
compromised at an institution known for top-flight engineering
faculty and programs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think their engineering people were that much
involved with it,'' Watson said. ``It was an Aggie tradition. I
think the tradition overpowered any strict control.''

 &HT;    Texas bonfire: Students tales consistent
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer and Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION _ Eric Etheridge climbed off the huge pile of
logs, looked up and noticed a slight tilt. Derek Woodley, hanging
from the centerpole and working on the fourth level, felt his swing
dip suddenly. Both heard a deafening crack, and the 90th Aggie
Bonfire fell in a heap, killing 12 people and injuring 27.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a week later, no one can say for sure why. However,
interviews conducted by the American-Statesman with a dozen
students who worked on the bonfire early Nov. 18, including
Etheridge and Woodley, reveal a number of consistencies:
</P>
<P>
   Students from ground level to the stack's peak say the entire
structure shifted and swayed mere seconds before the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, several students sitting in harnesses hanging
from the center pole say, they felt their swings dip suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the loud crack of splitting timber.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, a task force appointed by the university
will investigate the collapse and issue a report by March 31. In
the meantime, university officials caution against jumping to
conclusions, including one offered by a former A&AMP;M professor who
says the bonfire likely collapsed because students failed to follow
engineering safety procedures he developed in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas A&AMP;M welcomes any and all individuals who have the
expertise and background to offer substantive opinions about what
may have happened to cause this tragic accident,'' the university
press office said in a statement Wednesday. ``It is way too early
to know what factor or factors contributed to this accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Among students present when the stacks crashed to the ground at
2:40 a.m. last Thursday, a few theories on what caused the collapse
have developed: a weak center pole, loose wiring a lopsided stack,
unstable soil. But they concede their explanations are guesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two seconds before it fell, it kind of sank, like the center
pole might have leaned,'' said Woodley, who is from Georgetown.
``The center pole shifted somehow.'' Woodley suffered several
broken bones, cuts and bruises in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, freshman Rachael Hines, 18, of Katy, noticed the
stack shift as she wired logs into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logs started to move, so I looked up to my swing man to
tell him to stop the log from moving, and then I realized it wasn't
just my log moving,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge, an 18-year-old freshman from Richardson, had just
climbed off the stack when he noticed something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking it was leaning a little and right as I
ended that thought, it fell over,'' he said. ``It looked like it
cracked on the top half, right above the first stack. That part
started to go over to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittny Allison, a sophomore, was hanging in a swing waiting for
another log to wire to the second stack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was staring at the log in front of me when it suddenly
looked like it was moving,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   She looked up and saw the logs on the third and fourth stack
starting to lean before toppling away from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh God! It's falling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her swing tethered to the center pole, Allison was jerked onto
the top of the collapsing pile.
</P>
<P>
   A log fell onto her left arm and her left foot was caught
between two logs. Yet somehow Allison escaped with only a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wiggled out and crawled off the pile,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pile toppled, she had heard someone complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said, `Stack isn't tight enough,''' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   No one else interviewed reported hearing those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Grosse, a professor who headed A&AMP;M's construction science
department from 1992 to 1996 and who now works at Colorado State
University in Fort Collins, said he believes the accident may have
happened because students working on the bonfire ignored proven
safety measures he helped develop.
</P>
<P>
   Those design modifications called for driving logs into the
ground every 15 to 20 feet along the outside of the first level,
wrapping a steel cable around the two bottom stacks, and
interlocking logs between all levels.
</P>
<P>
   The system proved effective in 1994, when heavy rains softened
the ground beneath the unfinished stack, causing the structure to
tilt toward the ground but remain intact, Grosse said.
</P>
<P>
   Grosse said he served as an unofficial technical adviser to the
Red Pots _ the students in charge of building the bonfire _ for 13
years before leaving the university for a post at Colorado State.
His design changes were adopted in 1988, Grosse said. When he heard
of the bonfire collapse, Grosse wondered what could have gone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a moment to study the photographs of the collapsed
structure and it raised some questions. Structurally, it was not
sound, and I think that led to the problems,'' Grosse said. ``It's
pretty obvious (the upgraded design plans) were not being
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, one of the Red Pots gave a copy of the revised plans to
then-bonfire adviser Bill Kibler, now A&AMP;M's vice president of
student affairs, said Grosse. He criticized A&AMP;M officials for not
providing more guidance to the Red Pots and making sure they were
using the most up-to-date techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should have been somebody out there carrying the ball
and continuing it on, and it's pretty obvious there wasn't,''
Grosse said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three strengthening measures he recommended were not
used, the result would be too much stress on the center pole,
Grosse said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center pole should be used primarily for attaching ropes
to and a guide to build the stacks by,'' he said. ``The center pole
cannot be expected to provide the structural integrity of the
bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Kibler, who was the official bonfire adviser from 1983 to 1992,
said he recalls receiving bonfire-related documents from a student
but does not remember whether those documents addressed the design
modifications Grosse mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of the specific recommendations that were made.
I think all of those things will come out as a result of the
investigation the university has commissioned,'' Kibler said. A&AMP;M
administrators assumed each class of Red Pots had passed down their
construction diagrams to the next, Kibler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't someone external to the students who was assuring
that the precise techniques of this part or that part of the
bonfire were passed along,'' Kibler said. ``That was the
responsibility of the students.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the photographs indicate that aside from the center
pole, no posts were driven into the ground and the steel wires were
not in place to hold the bottom two stacks together, Grosse said.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, the current bonfire adviser, partially disputed
Grosse's claim, a university spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to Mr. Thompson, who has spoken this morning
with some of the students most directly involved in the
construction of the bonfire this year. Our best information, based
on that feedback, indicates that what Larry Grosse described as
'should have happened' did happen,'' said Cynthia Lawson,. ``That
includes sinking the poles into the ground and interlocking the
layers. However, we obviously want to investigate this further,
just as we're doing with the many theories, suggestions and
speculations that have been forthcoming since the time of the
accident. Photographs and videos that are being collected should
help tell the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts by the American-Statesman to interview the Red Pots in
charge of building the 1999 bonfire were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Robbins, a sophomore, said he attended the raising of
the center pole and helped with the beginning of the first stack.
</P>
<P>
   He did not see any of the first-stack logs buried in the ground
for added support.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be too hard,'' he said. ``All the first-stack logs
sit flat on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also said the first two stacks were not surrounded by
large cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't make sense since we weren't done with the first
and second stacks,'' he said. But he agreed with university
officials who said there were interlocking logs between the bottom
two stacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want that to happen because it makes it stronger,''
Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Egenes, the head student medic in charge that night,
watched the stack crumble from just outside the construction zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like three picture frames; starting, half-way
down and then on the ground. A lot of dirt and dust was kicked up
at that point,'' he said. ``I knew right away that I needed other
help out there. At that point, there were so many people that were
hurt, we had to triage the patients and go through and determine
the priority patients. That's the saddest thing for an (emergency
technician) to do. You have to leave them and say, 'I'll be back
for you.'''

PERINI PLANS SALE OF $40 MILLION IN NEW SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking an infusion of capital after a string of heavy real
estate losses, Perini Corp. has signed a letter of intent to sell
new shares valued at $40 million to the Tutor Group.
</P>
<P>
   The investment group is headed by Ronald N. Tutor, who has
already invested $3 million in Perini and was named its chairman
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials stressed that the action _ a move that would
give Tutor a far bigger stake in the Framingham, Mass. construction
company _ is subject to, among other things, Perini's ability to
negotiate new bank credit agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Perini, which employs more than 2,000 workers and has commercial
construction projects worldwide, said Wednesday it has hired
Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin as financial advisers. It has
authorized them to explore alternative ways to recapitalize, should
the Tutor negotiations break down.
</P>
<P>
   Perini needs an infusion of money to restore positive net worth,
company officals say, after being forced earlier this year to write
off $99.6 million in real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also had setbacks in some of its construction
projects in past years, but officials say the core construction
business remains strong, with more than $1 billion in sales
annually. After several difficult years, the company has again
begun to post modest after-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has turned around,'' insists Robert Band, Perini's
chief financial officer. He said it has now shed all of its
troubled real estate and is concentrating solely on its
international construction business.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposed recapitalization with Tutor Group was not a
step toward selling the company. ``I tend to call it an investment
at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has previously ruled out an outright sale, and
observers say it faces no liquidity crisis or interruption of work.
But the huge real estate loss has left it short of the capital it
needs to meet bank debt.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal with Tutor would involved common and preferred
shares valued at a total of $40 million, with the common stock
valued at $4.25 a share. Although the company cautioned that it was
not a binding agreement, Perini will have to pay Tutor $750,000 if
it cuts a deal with a different group.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had little to say about the latest move by Perini to
get its house in order. ``This is way too tentative for us to
comment. It's contigent on a lot of other things happening,'' said
Walter J. Kirchberger, who follows Perini for PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Perini stock closed Wednesday at 3 7/8, up 3/8, on the American
Stock Exchange.

MEDICATION FOR PROBLEM STUDENTS: POSSIBLE SOLUTION OR UNACCEPTABLE
RISK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As a debate over the growing use of behavioral drugs
for children intensifies across the country, the Colorado Board of
Education has passed a resolution meant to discourage teachers from
recommending prescription drugs like Ritalin and Luvox for
students.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution carries no legal weight. But as the first of its
kind in the nation, it urges teachers and other school personnel to
use discipline and instruction to overcome problem behavior in the
classroom, rather than to encourage parents to put their children
on drugs that are commonly prescribed for attention deficit and
hyperactive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the resolution, which passed by a 6-1 vote Nov.
11, said they were motivated, in part, by evidence that they said
suggests dozens of violent crimes in recent years, including the
massacre last spring at Columbine High School, were committed by
young people taking psychotropic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teen-age shooters at Columbine, Eric Harris, had been
taking Luvox, an anti-depressant, although there is no evidence
that the drug had anything to do with the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   No other states are considering a measure similar to the one in
Colorado, where an unusual set of circumstances played a role in
the resolution's passage: an elected and fairly conservative school
board responding, in part, to the outcry from one of the nation's
worst school shootings. But the resolution reflects broader issues,
as well, as parents, mental health professionals and school
officials around the country debate the rising use of behavioral
drugs for children.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in children's mental health issues point out that
children who take the drugs do so because they were having
difficulties to begin with. They acknowledge that impulsive or
violent behavior is a recognized side effect in a small percentage
of people taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in arguing that an overwhelming majority of children who use
the drugs are benefiting, they contend that the Colorado resolution
is irresponsible and perhaps even dangerous in that it could lead
school personnel to ignore signs of serious mental disorders in
children and that it would discourage communication between
teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what happened in Colorado is the exception and not the
rule,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental
Health Association, conceding that he fears other states and school
districts might replicate Colorado's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding up psychotropic medicines as the possible cause of
violent behavior is absurd. There's a wealth of information to show
that they have helped dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of Ritalin and other psychotropic drugs has steadily
increased over the years among school-age children to a current
level of about 2.5 million, according to Children and Adults with
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a national nonprofit
organization known as CHADD, which is based in Landover, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Colorado, increased usage has turned a new focus onto
the role that teachers and administrators play in the daily lives
of children who attend their schools. It has also pitted experts
who say use is growing because the drugs are beneficial against
those who contend that parents and teachers are too quick to seek
out prescription medicine as the simplest way to treat children
with behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Johnson, the Colorado school board member who organized a
hearing on the issue and proposed the resolution, said that in the
five years she has served on the board, she has received ``numerous
complaints'' from parents who claimed a teacher had insisted that
their child go on Ritalin or another drug before returning to
class.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the case of one girl, who was showing signs of
attention deficit disorder through mood sweeps and napping in
class, Ms. Johnson said the girl was later diagnosed to be
suffering from hypoglycemia and just needed to change her diet.
According to the girl's parents, Ms. Johnson said, the teacher told
them, ``You need to get her a prescription for Ritalin.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, a resolution was designed to remove
school personnel from any medical decisions. She said the board,
which consists of six Republicans and one Democrat, passed the
resolution along party lines with minimal debate. The lone
Democrat, Gully Stanford, did not return a telephone call. No other
versions of of the resolution were considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution does not stop teachers from communicating with
parents,'' Ms. Johnson said in an interview. ``What it does do is
stop teachers from giving parents an ultimatum: `Put your kid on a
drug or we're not going to teach them.' That can't happen any more.
It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
of State Boards of Education, said that Colorado's is one of only
seven elected state boards of education in the country and those
boards tend to be more ideological.
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, ``I agree that too often the first answer
for children with some behavior problem is to reach for medication.
Some of the numbers we are seeing for medication of children are
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards
Association, said she knew of no other school board examining the
question. She added that while many are concerned about
overmedication, ``We would be reluctant to support such a
resolution because there are children who may need such services,
who may benefit from the medication.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Stahl, a professor of psychiatry at the University
of California in San Diego, said that because of the complexities
of mental disorders and the rapidly changing personalities of
children as they grow older, both sides of the psychotropic debate
may be right. And wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no blood test for this,'' he said. ``It's not
objective. If a kid is acting out in class and a stimulant like
Ritalin calms him down, it would be immoral not to give him the
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem comes,'' he added, ``when the stimulants don't
work and parents give them anyway as an excuse to avoid tough
decisions or talking with teachers and doctors to learn what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem complicating the issue, Stahl said, is the
location of the school. Typically, he said, in poor areas, mental
disorders are underdiagnosed, and often in more affluent school
districts, children are overdiagnosed, sometimes making a bad
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Besides complaints from parents about insistent teachers, Ms.
Johnson said she was also motivated to propose the resolution by
the violent crimes involving young people, in which investigators
said the perpetrators were using psychotropic drugs. Accounts of
those incidents also persuaded a Colorado state lawmaker, Penn
Pfiffner of Lakeland, to hold a separate hearing on the issue,
which, by coincidence, came two days before the school board voted
on Ms. Johnson's measure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Breggin, director of the International Center for the
Study of Psychiatry and Psychology, a nonprofit research
organization in Bethesda, Md., testified at both hearings and said
doctors have become too eager to prescribe psychotropic drugs at
the expense of conversations among parents, teachers and children
to learn why children are acting in anti-social ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous mistake to subdue the behavior of children
instead of tending to their needs,'' Breggin said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drugging them into submission rather than identifying
and meeting the genuine needs of the family, the school and the
community. It's wrong in principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Harris and other young killers who were found to be
taking Ritalin and other drugs, Breggin said he is convinced that
there is a direct link between the drugs and violent acts. He also
asserted that the drug harms children.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen of CHADD and others said the resolution might inhibit
teachers from applying their own common sense and experience in the
case of a troublesome child by merely telling parents that
something is wrong without offering a full range of possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child has hearing or vision problems that the teacher
identifies, we would expect the teacher to talk to the parents,''
said Jeanne Mueller Rohner, executive director of the Mental Health
Association of Colorado, which opposed the resolution. ``It should
be the same thing for mental health.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure also said they were uncomfortable with
the ardent support offered the measure by the Church of Scientology
through an affiliate organization, the Citizens Commission on Human
Rights. The president of its American branch, Bruce Wiseman, who
described the commission as a ``psychiatric watchdog group,''
testified at both hearings and urged rejection of Ritalin and other
drugs as a solution to troublesome behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Johnson, as well as Pfiffner, said the commission's
support was not a critical factor in any of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson conceded that only a small number of teachers in
Colorado have ever insisted on a child taking prescription drugs as
a precondition to returning to class. It is largely for them that
the resolution was intended.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, said Andrea Giunta, president of the largest
teachers' union in Denver, it might not matter, anyway. By the time
most children are diagnosed with an attention deficit or
hyperactive disorder, she said, they have been observed and
analyzed over time by a team of experts, including teachers,
nurses, counselors and school psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher shouldn't recommend a specific course of action,''
Ms. Giunta said. ``But what she can do is say, `This has been my
experience with other children when they have displayed this kind
of behavior. What you do is up to you.'''

</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the resolution, which passed by a 6-1 vote Nov.
11, said they were motivated, in part, by evidence that they said
suggests dozens of violent crimes in recent years, including the
massacre last spring at Columbine High School, were committed by
young people taking psychotropic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teen-age shooters at Columbine, Eric Harris, had been
taking Luvox, an anti-depressant, although there is no evidence
that the drug had anything to do with the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   No other states are considering a measure similar to the one in
Colorado, where an unusual set of circumstances played a role in
the resolution's passage: an elected and fairly conservative school
board responding, in part, to the outcry from one of the nation's
worst school shootings. But the resolution reflects broader issues,
as well, as parents, mental health professionals and school
officials around the country debate the rising use of behavioral
drugs for children.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in children's mental health issues point out that
children who take the drugs do so because they were having
difficulties to begin with. They acknowledge that impulsive or
violent behavior is a recognized side effect in a small percentage
of people taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in arguing that an overwhelming majority of children who use
the drugs are benefiting, they contend that the Colorado resolution
is irresponsible and perhaps even dangerous in that it could lead
school personnel to ignore signs of serious mental disorders in
children and that it would discourage communication between
teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what happened in Colorado is the exception and not the
rule,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental
Health Association, conceding that he fears other states and school
districts might replicate Colorado's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding up psychotropic medicines as the possible cause of
violent behavior is absurd. There's a wealth of information to show
that they have helped dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of Ritalin and other psychotropic drugs has steadily
increased over the years among school-age children to a current
level of about 2.5 million, according to Children and Adults with
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a national nonprofit
organization known as CHADD, which is based in Landover, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Colorado, increased usage has turned a new focus onto
the role that teachers and administrators play in the daily lives
of children who attend their schools. It has also pitted experts
who say use is growing because the drugs are beneficial against
those who contend that parents and teachers are too quick to seek
out prescription medicine as the simplest way to treat children
with behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Johnson, the Colorado school board member who organized a
hearing on the issue and proposed the resolution, said that in the
five years she has served on the board, she has received ``numerous
complaints'' from parents who claimed a teacher had insisted that
their child go on Ritalin or another drug before returning to
class.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the case of one girl, who was showing signs of
attention deficit disorder through mood sweeps and napping in
class, Ms. Johnson said the girl was later diagnosed to be
suffering from hypoglycemia and just needed to change her diet.
According to the girl's parents, Ms. Johnson said, the teacher told
them, ``You need to get her a prescription for Ritalin.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, a resolution was designed to remove
school personnel from any medical decisions. She said the board,
which consists of six Republicans and one Democrat, passed the
resolution along party lines with minimal debate. The lone
Democrat, Gully Stanford, did not return a telephone call. No other
versions of of the resolution were considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution does not stop teachers from communicating with
parents,'' Ms. Johnson said in an interview. ``What it does do is
stop teachers from giving parents an ultimatum: `Put your kid on a
drug or we're not going to teach them.' That can't happen any more.
It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
of State Boards of Education, said that Colorado's is one of only
seven elected state boards of education in the country and those
boards tend to be more ideological.
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, ``I agree that too often the first answer
for children with some behavior problem is to reach for medication.
Some of the numbers we are seeing for medication of children are
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards
Association, said she knew of no other school board examining the
question. She added that while many are concerned about
overmedication, ``We would be reluctant to support such a
resolution because there are children who may need such services,
who may benefit from the medication.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Stahl, a professor of psychiatry at the University
of California in San Diego, said that because of the complexities
of mental disorders and the rapidly changing personalities of
children as they grow older, both sides of the psychotropic debate
may be right. And wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no blood test for this,'' he said. ``It's not
objective. If a kid is acting out in class and a stimulant like
Ritalin calms him down, it would be immoral not to give him the
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem comes,'' he added, ``when the stimulants don't
work and parents give them anyway as an excuse to avoid tough
decisions or talking with teachers and doctors to learn what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem complicating the issue, Stahl said, is the
location of the school. Typically, he said, in poor areas, mental
disorders are underdiagnosed, and often in more affluent school
districts, children are overdiagnosed, sometimes making a bad
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Besides complaints from parents about insistent teachers, Ms.
Johnson said she was also motivated to propose the resolution by
the violent crimes involving young people, in which investigators
said the perpetrators were using psychotropic drugs. Accounts of
those incidents also persuaded a Colorado state lawmaker, Penn
Pfiffner of Lakeland, to hold a separate hearing on the issue,
which, by coincidence, came two days before the school board voted
on Ms. Johnson's measure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Breggin, director of the International Center for the
Study of Psychiatry and Psychology, a nonprofit research
organization in Bethesda, Md., testified at both hearings and said
doctors have become too eager to prescribe psychotropic drugs at
the expense of conversations among parents, teachers and children
to learn why children are acting in anti-social ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous mistake to subdue the behavior of children
instead of tending to their needs,'' Breggin said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drugging them into submission rather than identifying
and meeting the genuine needs of the family, the school and the
community. It's wrong in principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Harris and other young killers who were found to be
taking Ritalin and other drugs, Breggin said he is convinced that
there is a direct link between the drugs and violent acts. He also
asserted that the drug harms children.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen of CHADD and others said the resolution might inhibit
teachers from applying their own common sense and experience in the
case of a troublesome child by merely telling parents that
something is wrong without offering a full range of possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child has hearing or vision problems that the teacher
identifies, we would expect the teacher to talk to the parents,''
said Jeanne Mueller Rohner, executive director of the Mental Health
Association of Colorado, which opposed the resolution. ``It should
be the same thing for mental health.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure also said they were uncomfortable with
the ardent support offered the measure by the Church of Scientology
through an affiliate organization, the Citizens Commission on Human
Rights. The president of its American branch, Bruce Wiseman, who
described the commission as a ``psychiatric watchdog group,''
testified at both hearings and urged rejection of Ritalin and other
drugs as a solution to troublesome behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Johnson, as well as Pfiffner, said the commission's
support was not a critical factor in any of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson conceded that only a small number of teachers in
Colorado have ever insisted on a child taking prescription drugs as
a precondition to returning to class. It is largely for them that
the resolution was intended.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, said Andrea Giunta, president of the largest
teachers' union in Denver, it might not matter, anyway. By the time
most children are diagnosed with an attention deficit or
hyperactive disorder, she said, they have been observed and
analyzed over time by a team of experts, including teachers,
nurses, counselors and school psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher shouldn't recommend a specific course of action,''
Ms. Giunta said. ``But what she can do is say, `This has been my
experience with other children when they have displayed this kind
of behavior. What you do is up to you.'''

FAR FROM BATTLE OVER EUROPE'S PHONES, A HONG KONG TYCOON COUNTS HIS
BILLIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Panama, Australia,
India and Israel)   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ As Mannesmann of Germany and the British company
Vodafone Airtouch roll out the heavy artillery for their bitter
takeover battle, there is already one undisputed victor: a Hong
Kong tycoon who is watching Europe's great corporate war from the
penthouse of a skyscraper half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   He is Li Ka-shing, the billionaire developer and chairman of the
Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. With the closing of a
deal to sell its British mobile-phone operation, Orange PLC, to
Mannesmann, Li's company has become the largest single shareholder
in the German company.
</P>
<P>
   Li has made an enormous profit because of the Orange-Mannesmann
deal and could make more if Vodafone buys Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the latest of many shrewd moves for Li, 71, who
has amassed a $12 billion fortune since he came to this former
British colony in the 1940s as a penniless refugee from mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
   As Vodafone seeks to entice Mannesmann's shareholders with its
$127.7 billion hostile bid, analysts said the British company would
have to win over Hutchison, which in addition to its 10.1 percent
stake has a seat on Mannesmann's supervisory board. That will not
be easy, since Li said on Tuesday that he would back Mannesmann's
chief executive, Klaus Esser, in rebuffing Vodafone's advances.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and bankers noted, however, that Hutchison's loyalty
stemmed at least partly from a legal obligation to hold its shares
in Mannesmann for 18 months after the mobile-phone deal. Should
Vodafone further sweeten its offer, Mannesmann would likely feel
obliged to let Hutchison sell its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been incredibly lucky,'' said Peter Milliken, an
analyst who follows Hutchison for DBS Securities here. ``But Li
Ka-shing isn't just a lucky guy. Some of it is foresight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann paid $14 billion in cash and stock to buy Hutchison's
controlling stake in Orange _ a sky-high price that analysts said
was driven by Mannesmann's urge to protect itself from a predatory
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   When Vodafone started its hostile bid for Mannesmann, the value
of Hutchison's shares soared 25 percent. If Mannesmann accepted the
current bid, Li would make more than a 40 percent return in barely
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Vodafone has indicated that if it won control of
Mannesmann, it would spin off Orange to the German company's
existing shareholders. Although that move would be aimed at
mollifying British regulators, it would also leave Hutchison with a
stake in the same company it just sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they sold Orange at a huge premium,'' said an executive
close to Hutchison who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Now
they're getting a double-dip with the Vodafone bid for Mannesmann.
If Vodafone were to spin off Orange, it would be a triple-dip.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Li nor his lieutenants would comment beyond a statement
on Tuesday in which Hutchison said it viewed its stake in
Mannesmann as a long-term strategic investment. ``Jointly with
Orange, Mannesmann will be an outstanding company and better
positioned than Vodafone for the future opportunities in the
telecom sector,'' said Canning Fok, the managing director of
Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that reaction was not surprising. If Vodafone took
over Mannesmann, Hutchison's stake in the new company would be
diluted to 4.5 percent. Though that might be enough to secure a
board seat, Li would clearly not enjoy as much influence.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison cannot stand in the way of a takeover. Under
Mannesmann's bylaws, no single shareholder exercises more than 5
percent of the vote. Mannesmann's fate will be determined more by
Vodafone's next move _ it has declared it will not raise its bid _
than by the wishes of an Asian tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Li's position, according to analysts, is that
regardless of the outcome, Hutchison will continue to be a player
in the global mobile-phone business. In addition to its interest in
Mannesmann, Hutchison controls cellular companies in Australia,
India and Israel. The company is also active in wireless in the
United States, through an investment in the VoiceStream Wireless
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, a city where nobody leaves home without a cellular
phone, Hutchison is the leading service provider, with 1.6 million
subscribers. The company also competes with the dominant local
phone company, Cable and Wireless HKT, in fixed-line telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hutchison announced a $1.2 billion joint venture with
Global Crossing Ltd., the operator of a worldwide fiber-optic
network, that will further expand its presence in its home market.
The new venture, to be called Hutchison Global Crossing, will build
a high-speed fiber-optic voice and data network. Global Crossing
will contribute $400 million in stock and $50 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a classic Hutchison deal,'' said Tim Dattels, the
head of investment banking in Asia for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which
advised the company. ``They've chosen their partners well.''
</P>
<P>
   Li took over Hutchison Whampoa in 1981, becoming the first
Chinese businessman to control a traditionally British trading
company in Hong Kong. The company's roots are in ports, and it now
runs container ports in Hong Kong, mainland canal. That last
franchise recently landed Hutchison in a tempest in Washington. The
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said the canal would fall under
Chinese influence after the United States departs in December
because Li had links to the Chinese Army.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have dismissed Lott's claims, though nobody
denies that Li has cultivated close ties to China's leaders. That
could come in handy in the aftermath of a landmark trade deal
between the United States and China. As part of the agreement,
Beijing has pledged to open its telecommunications market to
foreign companies. Few are better positioned than Hutchison
Whampoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason Global Crossing was willing to pay so
much,'' Milliken said. ``They were paying for Li's connections _
and not just telephone connections.''

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ A wall put up six weeks ago to separate
Gypsies from their Czech neighbors in a town in northern Bohemia
was torn down Wednesday, to the relief of an embarrassed Czech
government and foreigners who had suggested that racism might
thwart the country's bid to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The government, unable to prevent local authorities from
building the wall in the depressed industrial town of Usti nad
Labem, negotiated its removal after agreeing to give the city
government $286,000 to improve social conditions in the town.
</P>
<P>
   For the Gypsies and human rights activists, it was a Pyrrhic
victory: The city council announced it would use at least one-third
of the money to buy the houses of Czechs who refused to live next
to Gypsies. ``Now, it will be a real ghetto,'' said Tibor Bada, a
local Gypsy activist.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete barrier, 65 yards long and 6 feet high, was built
overnight on Oct. 13, with about 80 police officers present to
prevent any violence. It was supposed to separate Gypsy residents
from three houses owned by Czechs who had claimed that the Gypsies,
most of them rent defaulters who had been moved into substandard
municipal housing, produced disturbing amounts of noise and waste.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities said the wall was intended to prevent Gypsy
children from coming to the street and playing in front of houses
owned by residents who wanted no contact with Gypsies. It quickly
became a symbol of racism and segregation in the Czech Republic and
of the new social divisions that have emerged in Europe in the
decade since the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of communist
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy that this tragic symbol of separation
disappeared,'' the U.S. ambassador, John Shattuck, said in a radio
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Vaclav Havel and Guenter Verheugen, the European
Union official overseeing efforts to enlarge the 15-nation economic
bloc, applauded the destruction of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Verheugen, who had indicated that the wall might impede the
Czechs' bid to enter the European Union, said the demolition would
``enhance the image of the Czech Republic and its human rights
record.'' He added that he hoped it would be followed by a dialogue
aimed at solving the social problems of Gypsies in the Czech
Republic, who call themselves Romany or Roma.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Gypsy community expressed scant hope of such a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Ladislav Bily, the executive secretary of the Romany Board, said
the Czech government, ``when confronted face to face with racism,
has allowed itself to be dragged into a game played by the Usti
town hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying up family houses on the street will end any coexistence
of Gypsy and non-Gypsy neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies in the Czech Republic often complain about racial
discrimination and ask for asylum abroad.
</P>

<P>
   Last weekend seven Gypsies in a music band were injured when
they were attacked by skinheads in Ceske Budejovice, south of
Prague. Seventeen youths have been charged with racially motivated
violence and hooliganism and could face up to three years in jail
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The band leader, Gejza Ladic, told the daily newspaper Pravo
that the group had written to the Canadian and British embassies in
Prague asking for asylum. Thousands of Gypsies in the Czech
Republic have sought asylum in Britain in recent months, usually
unsuccessfully, prompting the British government to threaten to
re-introduce visa requirements for Czechs.

   Thanksgiving episodes often fall flat because they're more
maudlin than the PaxTV prime-time lineup. Producers are feverishly
working to remedy that by encouraging writers to create
cutting-edge scripts. However, change comes slowly to the TV
industry, so the proposed Thanksgiving episodes outlined here
didn't make it this year. But stay tuned. There's always next year.
And the year after that. And the year after ...
</P>
<P>
   ``ER.'' The County General staff is stunned when Nurse Hathaway
gives birth to a 22-pound Butterball named Tommy. Dr. Weaver chides
Hathaway for not following a more healthful, free-range pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Dr. Carter falls in love with a young woman he is
treating for pecan-pie addiction. George Clooney makes a special
appearance when his character, Dr. Ross, is called in for a
pediatric consult on a case involving a little boy who accidentally
inhales his pet cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy.'' A custody battle gets ugly when a mother has to
choose between her daughter and her secret recipe for
sausage-and-raisin stuffing. Judge Amy resolves the matter by
recessing until after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order.'' Detectives Lennie Briscoe and Ed Green happen
upon a mess of smashed pumpkins in Central Park. There are no
witnesses to the senseless gourdage, but a canvass of the area
uncovers a small-caliber food processor in a trash can near Sheep
Meadow. Fingerprints on the Cuisinart lead to the Hamptons and the
summertime home of Martha Stewart. During a vigorous interrogation
at Riker's Island, Stewart tearfully admits she doesn't always get
her pumpkin flan to come out right on the first try and has to go
through a lot of pumpkins. Assistant D.A. Jack McCoy decides to
prosecute her for fraud and conspiracy to commit froufrou. But
Stewart walks when the judge rules that the food processor is
inadmissible as evidence because police violated the trash can's
constitutional right to privacy and Stewart's confession can't be
used because anyone who would gold-leaf a doorknob has no
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing.'' President Josiah Bartlet issues the customary
pardon to the White House turkey, but on the way to the fowl
retirement home the turkey is brutally slain by a rogue band of
animatronic pigs unemployed since the filming of TNT's ``Animal
Farm.'' They claim that every pardoned turkey requires an increase
in the senseless slaughter of swine to facilitate production of
more honey-baked, spiral-cut hams. Bartlet defuses the situation by
outlawing the sale of ham guns in November and declaring the
chalupa an official Thanksgiving table alternative, provided Taco
Bell stops running those commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace.'' Grace is depressed during Thanksgiving dinner
because her chest is smaller than the turkey's. Will assures her
it's only because turkeys are corn-fed to enhance their appeal to
shoppers, and that a man would never be attracted to a woman simply
because she had her measurements enhanced. Grace doesn't buy it and
begins power-noshing corn niblets, which explains why the episode
is titled ``Maize in Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waltons.'' The whole clan, minus those who are dead,
returns to the homestead for one last holiday gathering and is
startled to discover that a distant relative, Gym-Bag Walton, has
moved in and is using cheap Southern labor to manufacture Nike
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Giles attempts to embrace quaint
American customs by hosting his first Thanksgiving dinner. Things
go awry when the sage for the stuffing combines with the nutmeg for
the pumpkin pie, causing a chemical reaction that summons from the
netherworld a long-dormant demon/vamp of the kids' table named
Nomogravy. It can only be subdued if all the kids seated at kids'
tables in Sunnydale eat their white meat without benefit of
lubrication. Of course, this will cause the entire child population
to die of turkey-stuck-in-the-throat-itis. (Also, if a child whines
for a drop of gravy from the adult table, Nomogravy invades the
child's soul and disconnects the dessert reflex, replacing it with
a yearning for candied yams.) Buffy, Willow and Xander save the day
by luring Nomogravy to a dark alley with a plate of garlic mashed
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal.'' Ally dreams she is having sex in a cranberry
bog with a Massachusetts farmer. John Cage dreams he is having sex
in a Winnebago with a randy Pilgrim. The two dreams come together
in reality when Billy tells Georgia he wants to have sex with her

burlap thong. Meanwhile, Richard Fish goes out to a turkey farm
where he collapses from exhaustion after caressing 4,000 wattles.

   ASBESTOS-GOVERNOR (Libby, Mont.) _ As a child, the governor of
Montana played in piles of asbestos-contaminated vermiculite ore
that some residents here say has caused death and disease. Now,
after the Post-Intelligencer last week documented dozens of deaths
related to the contamination, Gov. Marc Racicot is vowing to take
action.

   TV-THANKSGIVING (Undated) _ Thanksgiving episodes often fall
flat because they're more maudlin than the PaxTV prime-time lineup.
Producers are feverishly working to remedy that by encouraging
writers to create cutting-edge scripts. However, change comes
slowly to the TV industry, so the proposed Thanksgiving episodes
outlined here didn't make it this year. But stay tuned. There's
always next year.

   A Charge to Keep
</P>
<P>
   By George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   (ghostwritten by Karen Hughes)
</P>
<P>
   Memoir
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, $23
</P>
<P>
   Before evaluating a campaign-related autobiography, let's agree
on its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jimmy Carter's ``Why Not the Best?'' and other engagingly
self-serving, ghostwritten ``memoirs'' before it, ``A Charge to
Keep'' is not meant to give interested readers the real lowdown on
its subject. ``A Charge to Keep'' was written in the name of _
although not by _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush to cement his high
standing with those who've already decided they want him to be the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   It is intended to seduce some fence-sitters who aren't quite
certain ``Dub-ya'' is qualified for the highest U.S. office, and _
perhaps most important _ to neutralize extreme Republican
conservatives who might otherwise sit out the 2000 election instead
of supporting Bush against Al Gore or Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, ``A Charge to Keep'' addresses devout
Christians who wonder about Bush's level of commitment to their
religious agenda. The first chapter immediately identifies one of
his life's ``defining moments'' _ a stirring sermon delivered just
before Bush's swearing-in for his second term as governor. Bush
also lists other inspiring sermons he has heard over the years.
</P>
<P>
   There are remembrances of loving family moments, excerpts from
Bush's inaugural address, some meditations on the importance of
raising kids right ... and we're scarcely a dozen pages into a book
Bush says he reluctantly wrote after deciding it would be wrong,
with so many other books about him being published, ``to let others
define me.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he's right about that. So far, the Bush biography
receiving the most attention, ``Fortunate Son'' by J.H. Hatfield,
claimed to reveal details of a Bush cocaine arrest in 1972. That
headline-grabbing charge was quickly discredited with news about
Hatfield's criminal past, which involved hiring a hit man in a
failed attempt to kill his boss. So who can blame Bush for wanting
to get his own sanitized, spin-friendly life story on bookstore
shelves?
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Charge to Keep'' suffers from typical campaign blurb
disease. Every word seems too carefully considered _ how much can
be said on any topic without inviting criticism? Did the governor
help pass a concealed-gun law vehemently opposed by gun-control
spokesmen? Well, there's a page or two about how Bush says that
responsible Texans ought to be able to carry arms for self-defense,
followed by another page insisting he wants some sort of generic
prosecution for those who tote guns for nefarious reasons. For
every opinion, there's a subsequent qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems truly definite only when discussing his love for his
family _ wife, daughters, parents, in-laws, brothers, sisters,
cousins, friends who are as close as blood relatives ... and this
is comforting. Even Bush-detractors will tear up when reading about
the death of Bush's little sister from leukemia (he was 7, she was
almost 4). He obviously is someone capable of loving and being
loved in return. That's an important gift.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the political chapters are, as the Scots say, pap.
Who doesn't believe in good schools, fair taxes, respect between
races and honest government? Mickey Herskowitz, the well-known
journalist whose ghostwriting credits include books for Nolan Ryan,
Mickey Mantle and John Connally, says he quit/was fired from ``A
Charge to Keep'' when he insisted that there ought to be some
substance in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replaced Herskowitz with communications director Karen
Hughes, who includes her own ``Reflections'' section that says Bush
insisted she skip some important campaign events to attend her
son's baseball games. (Herskowitz is thanked by Bush for ``his help
and work in getting the project started.'')
</P>
<P>
   To make certain that ``A Charge to Keep'' attracts no undue
criticism, Bush mentions in several places that all royalties
earned by the book will be donated to the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts,
Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of America and Girls, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to learn about George W. Bush, ``A Charge to
Keep'' is interesting, but not enlightening. Several other Bush
biographies are being published now or will be in the next few
months. Bear in mind that the authors of these books also have
agendas. Some will want to be objective, some will want to take
cheap shots. ``A Charge to Keep'' is a reasonably well-presented
effort to protect whatever political territory George W. Bush has
already won.

DOCTOR HAS SPECIAL INCENTIVE TO FIND CURE FOR RARE DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kevin Parsons is a doctor who knows what it's like be
so sick you ask your wife to kiss you goodbye for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Parsons is a doctor who knows what it's like to be told no
one knows what's wrong, even as your body weakens and your will
wavers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Parsons is a doctor who knows what it's like to be racing
for a cure for a disease that few people have and even fewer care
about.
</P>
<P>
   He knows these things because he's living them.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, 46, has Lambert-Eaton Syndrome, an extremely rare
autoimmune disease that interrupts the transmission of signals
between nerves and muscles, causing crippling, sometimes fatal,
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just lay in bed and die,'' said Parsons, 46, who
was diagnosed with the disease at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't know yet what triggers the disease, but
something causes the body to make antibodies to a protein on the
surface of nerve endings. The antibodies block the nerves from
releasing chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, that
communicate with muscles to cause movement.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle weakness can be so profound, it's difficult to even
blink an eye. Or breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of neurotransmitters across the neuromuscular junction
is like a firehose for most people, said Parsons. ``For me, it's
more like a drip.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 300 people in the world have the disease. Parsons has
emerged as their leader, a man who not only knows what it feels
like to have Lambert-Eaton, but is trying to cure it as well.
Fourteen months ago, with the backing of Virginia Mason Medical
Research Center, he set up a research lab to investigate new
strategies for treating his own disease.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago Parsons never dreamed he would be making the
journey from doctor to patient to medical researcher, or that his
life would depend on it.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in internal medicine with a specialty in geriatrics, the
irony of his situation is not lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt like an old man for the last 10 years,'' he said. He
has been bedridden, used a wheelchair, a walker and a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Today he takes an experimental medication called 3,4
diaminopyradine (DAP), which temporarily restores his muscle
strength for a few hours at a time. Although he now walks without a
cane, he still has the careful gait of an old man with a fear of
falling. He can't run or jump, and has trouble with hills. He has
to take a pill an hour before getting out of bed, just to have
enough strength to sit up.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has changed the way he practices medicine, and
the way he views the role of a doctor. No longer able to maintain a
full-time patient load, he now spends most of his days teaching
himself immunology, communicating with other Lambert-Eaton patients
and searching for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quest that began with a routine flu.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons was newly married and working at a medical center in
Texas in 1983 when he and his wife, Hillary, came down with a
severe influenza. His wifegot better, but Parsons never quite
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to know whether the flu triggered the autoimmune
response that caused his disease, but Parsons suspects his body's
normal response to fighting an illness somehow got derailed, and
ended up turning on itself.
</P>
<P>
   With his health continuing to deteriorate, he and Hillary moved
to Southern California to be closer to his family. But the move
didn't help. At one point, he got a series of painful infections so
severe they put him in the hospital. It was during that
hospitalization that doctors discovered he had almost no white
cells _ the body's front-line defense against disease.
</P>
<P>
   The low white cell count indicated leukemia. But none of the
other tests they ran could detect any cancer in his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former tennis player, who worked weights and loved to ski, it
was all Parsons could do to continue seeing his own patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be looking in people's ears and throats and everything
would go double,'' he said. His vertigo, another symptom of
Lambert-Eaton, got so severe, he would have to lie down to keep the
room from spinning.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually got so weak, he stopped taking stairs at work. He
brought a camping cot to his office and spent his lunch hours
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   He lost 30 pounds off an already trim frame from vertigo-induced
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, either,'' he
said. ``I looked like a cancer patient, but I didn't have cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons relates his own medical history matter-of-factly, with a
clinician's detachment and a touch of the surgeon's gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never that interested in rare diseases,'' he admits.
``Until I got one.''
</P>
<P>
   He chuckles and draws a sip from a slanted mug that says
``Nobody's Perfect.'' He glances at his watch, but not because he's
impatient. He's gauging how long before he has to pop the next
batch of little yellow pills that turbo charge his muscles enough
to get him through the day. The pills only work for two or three
hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others with Lambert-Eaton, it took Parsons about four
years before he finally got a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching my husband die, literally before my eyes,''
Hillary Parsons said. ``I couldn't figure out what to do anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1991, Kevin Parsons collapsed at the Veteran's
Administration Hospital where he was working. In desperation,
Hillary grabbed all his medical records from where she worked,
drove him to UCLA Medical Center emergency room and begged doctors
to admit him one more time.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up in the intensive care unit, too weak to turn over or
to cough. Hillary could see he was trying to tell her something.
She bent near to his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss me goodbye,'' he said. ``I'm dying.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really angry,'' she said. ``I said, `No you're not.
You're not leaving me with two small children.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, doctors finally diagnosed Lambert-Eaton
Syndrome using an electrical test that shocks the nerves and traces
the resulting impulses. It was the first case UCLA had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   But having a diagnosis didn't solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was no one knew much about the disease, or how to
treat it. That plunged Parsons into a depression even more
debilitating than his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just lying in bed all day,'' said Hillary Parsons. ``It
was like talking to a blank wall.
</P>
<P>
   One day she took him in a wheelchair to a busy mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she told him. ``They're living. You're not. You may
have nothing left of a body, and you may be unhappy about that, but
your brain is still there, and it's a hell of a brain. You can help
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she gave him an ultimatum. If he didn't try to get out of
bed, she would put him in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very next day, he said, `Give me a walker,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got on the phone, calling around the world to speak to
anyone who had any insight into Lambert-Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he moved his family to Seattle to be treated by Dr.
John Ravits at Virginia Mason Medical Center, one of only a handful
of neurologists in the country who know anything about the disease.
Ravits helped him get started on DAP, the drug that allows him to
function.
</P>
<P>
   But DAP has drawbacks. At the high doses Parsons takes, it can
cause seizures. And because it wears off quickly, his energy levels
fluctuate like a roller coaster through the day.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever going to be a better solution, Parsons figured
he was going to have to find it himself. Because there are so few
patients involved, few other scientists, let alone drug companies,
were attracted to the idea of doing research on Lambert-Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have such a rare disease, there's no money in drug
development for it,'' said Ravits. ``It leaves us (clinicians) high
and dry trying to treat patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons approached Jerry Nepom, director of Virginia Mason
Research Center, who gave him lab space and technical support to
get going.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Parsons is trying to find a way to block the binding
of the antibodies and restore normal communication between the
nerves and muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a large black box that I'm diving into alone,''
Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his research, Parsons also acts as the de facto
doctor for the small community of Lambert-Eaton patients he's
gathered through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He follows about 40 patients worldwide, including 30 in North
America and a handful in the Pacific Northwest. They call him day
and night. He talks to their personal physicians. He gives them
suggestions about medications, and strategies for coping with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The patients also help him with his research, sending him their
blood to use in his experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful man,'' said Mildred Schiro, 67, who lives in
Illinois and has never met Parsons. But by phone and by e-mail, she
credits Parsons with giving her hope and getting her on medication
that has given her back some independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't be here,'' she said.
Two years ago, she couldn't lift her head from her pillow, used a
wheelchair, and had to have assistance for daily living. Today, she
can walk a hallway by herself, crochet, take care of her animals
and bathe herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't appreciate those little things until you lose
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons believes his experiences as a patient have made him a
better doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians really don't understand patients that well because
most have never been sick, especially with a chronic illness,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested now in their emotional states, in
educating them about the disease, and in (building) communication
between patients,'' he said. And he spends more time thinking about
ways to help restore patient functionality, even if it means
risking side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about what I would do if the patient were my father
rather than worrying about malpractice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks about a cure, even on the days when he comes home
so exhausted, his wife has to beg him to not to push himself so
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be smart,'' he said. ``But it's worth it to me.''

LABOR'S SUPPORT FOR GORE TESTED BY U.S. TRADE AGREEMENT WITH
CHINA

(js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's trade agreement with
China, hailed by President Clinton as one of his greatest foreign
policy achievements, is complicating Vice President Al Gore's
efforts to energize labor behind his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the Iowa presidential caucuses only two months away, the
Gore campaign is counting on his endorsement last month by the
AFL-CIO to translate into intensive door-to-door political work
there and in other early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   But the labor federation is focused more immediately on the
global trade talks set to begin next week in Seattle, where it
plans huge demonstrations against the World Trade Organization and
the Clinton administration's eagerness to strike pro-business trade
accords, like the deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is worried that lowering trade barriers _ a goal of the
Seattle talks _ will make U.S. products less competitive and
encourage businesses to build plants overseas to take advantage of
cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   In one early sign of potential problems for Gore, the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees has delayed
distributing pro-Gore literature to its hundreds of members in
factories because of anger toward the administration about the
China deal.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated primary schedule is also putting pressure on
Gore, and all candidates, to hurriedly organize petition drives for
their slates of delegates. For example, in Pennsylvania, which just
set its primary for April 4, three weeks earlier than usual,
presidential candidates must file their delegate slates by Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That gives labor leaders, who have ready-made networks of people
who can circulate petitions for presidential delegates, just more
than a month to gather signatures. And compounding Gore's problem
in Pennsylvania, most political attention there is focused on the
U.S. Senate race in which 11 Democrats, five of them pro-labor, are
competing for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential race hasn't penetrated down to the rank and
file,'' said Rick Bloomingdale, treasurer of the Pennsylvania
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   While two of the biggest AFL-CIO affiliates objected to the Gore
endorsement and are among the strongest voices opposing the
administration's steps on trade, even important Gore backers in
organized labor recognize that rank-and-file enthusiasm for the
vice president is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a job and a half to educate our membership
what this is all about,'' John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO,
said. ``Of course he's got a problem. We all have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said very little about the sweeping agreement,
referring to it in passing on the day it was sealed as ``good news
indeed.'' And when the talks get underway in Seattle, he will be
campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But he has said that any trade pacts in a Gore administration
would include labor and environmental agreements, not as side deals
but as part of the pacts. And he has told union officials that he
in fact pushed labor's cause in the China negotiations, fighting
for an anti-dumping clause to block low-cost imports and calling on
all 135 member-nations of the world organization to meet certain
standards on matters such as wages, job safety and child labor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not the only Democrat caught in a political bind over
the trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, who has
long been labor's champion against trade deals, is also aware of
the potential political benefits of this agreement to other
important constituencies, including business and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and labor officials say that labor's active
opposition to the China agreement could stir up the same kind of
animus that prevailed in 1993 over the North American Free Trade
Agreement. It is gospel within organized labor that anger over
NAFTA suppressed union support for Democrats and helped the
Republicans to take the House for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the fate of the House, with its slim Republican
majority, once again up for grabs, and with the opportunity to
become speaker in sight, Gephardt has taken a lower profile on the
China agreement than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   He has muffled his concerns, saying he is not sure how he will
vote when the matter, in the form of permanent normal
trade-relations status, comes before the House next year. But since
the deal is overwhelmingly supported by business and farmers, whose
financial contributions to the Democrats are vital to their success
next year, it is widely expected to pass. And Gephardt is trying to
make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in labor are very much concerned about China just coming
into the WTO and not having attention paid to labor and human
rights,'' Gephardt said. ``But we're in a different place than we
were in '93. Labor has begun to change its message and its stance
on trade. At one time, labor was protectionist; I don't believe
that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor leaders seem willing to forgive both Gore and
Gephardt this time because they believe that electing Gore
president and giving Gephardt a majority in the House would serve
their longer-term purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Upton, a spokesman for the International Association of
Machinists, which abstained from endorsing Gore last month but did
so last weekend, said that his union had been persuaded by Gore's
support for core labor standards in trade agreements and that this
had outweighed his backing of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is one issue that we're going to disagree very strongly
about, but you have to look at other issues,'' Upton said. ``The
vice president was very adamant about the need for a larger
percentage of the U.S. workforce to be organized. He's been there
on fights against gutting Medicare and gutting OSHA and gutting
NLRB funding. So you have to look at the whole thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Sweeney said that firing up the unions on Gore's behalf
would entail some work, he also said that the leaders planned to
``educate'' the membership on where the other candidates stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley says he's proud of his vote on NAFTA and would
support it again,'' Sweeney said of Gore's only rival for the
Democratic nomination. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, the leading Republican candidates, have given
their qualified endorsement to the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   In giving Gore a pass, the labor leaders are acquiescing in
Gore's effort to distance himself from the Clinton administration.
They intend to focus their anger at the global trade talks in
Seattle against Clinton and the World Trade Organization, not Gore.
``The vice president is much stronger on the issue of core labor
standards than the president is,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, and chairman of the AFL-CIO's
political committee, also emphasized that Gore is vice president,
not president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of unions that are going to be really
upset, angry with everybody about this,'' McEntee said. ``But I
think most unions recognize the fact that this is Clinton's China
policy.'' He added: ``There has also been a very deliberate
disengagement on behalf of Gore in relations to the administration.
They have held a number of meetings with groups lately and they've
been telling Gore what's happening because he's intentionally
disengaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the question is less what labor leaders think than what
their membership does. ``In the end,'' said Greg Tarpinian,
president of the Labor Relations Association, a New York-based
consulting group to unions, ``what the top leadership does is one
thing _ the level of involvement and activities of the membership
is another. Anything that detracts from the unions' being able to
thoroughly say `This is our guy,' doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials say that Gore was sacrificed to Clinton's
desire to establish a strong foreign-policy legacy. They charge
that the president deliberately held off on the China deal until
after Gore won labor's endorsement and then took the endorsement as
a green light to proceed with the China negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   William Klinefelter, political director of the United
Steelworkers of America, said, ``Once again, Clinton has thought
only of his own legacy and has driven home a deal that didn't have
to be done at this point in time.''

ECONOMY PROVING IT'S MORE ROBUST THAN ANTICIPATED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-running expansion of the American economy rolled into
autumn with even more momentum than had been thought, and is poised
to set a record for longevity with the arrival of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With employment, incomes, confidence and major stock-market
averages at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its
estimate Wednesday of economic growth from July to September to an
annual pace of 5.5 percent from 4.8 percent, surpassing nearly all
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you not be thankful?'' asked James Glassman, chief
U.S. economist at Chase Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce report arrives with few signs of revived inflation.
``This is not something you expect to see this late in the game,''
Glassman said.
</P>
<P>
   But unless growth slows dramatically, analysts fear the Federal
Reserve could be forced to raise interest rates again and dampen
the expansion, which is now 8 and a half years old.
</P>
<P>
   One source of anxiety is the fact that inflation is creeping up
in the early stages of production, before products reach consumers.
But consumers are already seeing the highest oil prices since the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The latest consensus, according to Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a monthly survey of economic forecasters, is for gross
domestic product to rise at a 4.1 percent pace in the current
quarter and by 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth is going to be well above historical averages,'' said
John M. Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, which is
forecasting a 4.5 percent growth rate in the final three months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And stock prices keep rising. Wednesday, the technology-laden
Nasdaq market sailed to a new peak that puts it 56 percent ahead
for the year while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Dow Jones
industrial averages hovered near records.
</P>
<P>
   While the government's latest snapshot of the $8.9 trillion
economy covers only the third quarter, the growth rate and other
data for October and November were said to bode well for the
holiday shopping season. Consumer spending, which makes up about
two-thirds of overall economic activity, rose at a 4.6 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, initially reported as an increase
of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures also advanced the likelihood that January
will become the 107th consecutive month of economic growth,
breaking the mark set between 1961 and 1969, when national output
was spurred by the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report Wednesday, the Labor Department said
first-time claims for unemployment insurance tumbled by 13,000 last
week, to 274,000, the third decline in the past five weeks. With
stores gearing up for Christmas, this was further evidence that
little or no slack has yet developed in the tautest labor market _
an unemployment rate of only 4.1 percent _ in a generation. On a
four-week moving average, initial claims have now totaled less than
300,000 for 18 straight weeks, the longest string since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer optimism is also high, with the University of
Michigan's confidence index climbing to 107.2 in November from
103.2 in October, according to subscribers to its polling service.
The index reflects consumers' positive assessment of current
economic conditions and their optimism about the future.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for the extraordinary longevity of the 1990s
expansion, which has seemed little affected so far by the Federal
Reserve's three quarter-point increases in its interest-rate target
since midyear?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is accelerated productivity, which Chase economists
say is translating into compensation gains that exceed the
expectations of workers who had become accustomed to increases
averaging only about 1 percentage point more than inflation. This,
the bank said, fostered ``a general level of satisfaction'' that
has helped spur major increases in spending by consumers, which
grew at a 4.6 percent pace in the summer quarter, according to data
released Wednesday by the government, up from the initial estimate
of 4.3 percent in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, analysts said, was the foreign economic crisis
in Asia and Russia in the second half of 1998, which funneled
overseas capital to the safety of the American securities markets,
helping to keep interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, contributed to the rise in American stock, bond
and home prices, all of which sustained confidence and buying
power.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over possible disruptions from the so-called year
2000 computer problem has prompted some producers and consumers to
stockpile products, such as medicines, or to replace hardware or
software they otherwise might only have fixed. This accounts for at
least some of the surge in capital investment and inventories, the
latter one of the biggest factors in Wednesday's upward revision in
gross domestic product.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economists said that while they could not quantify the year 2000
effect, they suggested it might turn out to be less than expected.
If so, there would presumably be little falloff in such demand
early next year, as some have feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to disentangle Y2K from other rebuilding'' of
depleted inventories, said Youngdahl of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The largest positive factor in the upward revision of the gross
domestic product was fewer imports, the Commerce Department report
also showed, while the biggest drag was less production of
equipment and software than first estimated.
</P>
<P>
   As for inflation, the price index for gross domestic purchases
edged up to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent last month, which analysts
disregarded as trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report also included the government's first estimate
of corporate profits for the quarter, which on a current production
basis rose $8.2 billion in the summer after falling $6.5 billion in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Current production cash flow, which adjusts for inventory
valuation and capital consumption, rose $16 billion following a
$6.7 billion decline in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Profits were reduced by about $8 billion because of the effects
of Hurricane Floyd, the department said, $6 billion of this in
benefits paid by insurance companies and $2 billion from uninsured
losses.

<P>
   A record number of travelers jammed airports and highways across
the nation Wednesday to celebrate Thanksgiving with family and
friends. Despite the crowds, the day went off with no more than the
usual frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Snow in some Rocky Mountain states earlier in the week did not
help matters for motorists or airline passengers there, but it was
a godsend for ski resorts and for huddling around the fireplace
after Thursday's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here are staying in town to take advantage of
the snow,'' said Robyn Robinson, an architect in Aspen, Colo. But
she herself was scheduled to fly to Portland, Ore., Wednesday
afternoon to have Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house, before
flying home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson can expect plenty of company on that return trip,
when a record 2.2 million people _ almost 1 million more passengers
than Wednesday _ are expected to fill just about every seat on
every flight.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the biggest share of the record 28 million vehicles
expected to be on the road this holiday will also be heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Police will also be out in force during the holiday, not just to
deal with speeders and drunk drivers, but also to ticket motorists
whose child passengers are not properly buckled up. The latter
campaign is part of a nationwide effort to enforce child passenger
and seat belt laws, which go unheeded an estimated 25 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices are up 22.8 cents a gallon this holiday from the
same period last year. But the 3 percent fare increase announced by
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines late Tuesday night will have
little if any effect this holiday, since most passengers will have
booked their flights well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a home-cooked turkey dinner with all the trimmings
for 10 people will average $33.83, 74 cents less than last year,
according to the annual survey by the American Farm Bureau
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The 24,000 people expected at the Raul Jimenez Thanksgiving
Dinner in San Antonio on Thursday will not have to pay a cent.
Started 20 years ago by a local businessman to honor elderly
people, the dinner quickly became an annual event to feed anyone in
need. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 7,000 people that first year,'' said Alice Guerra, who
coordinated the event for the first 19 years, ``and now 5,000
volunteers, including lots of tourists to San Antonio, serve all
day long in the city's convention center. We just set the tables
and open the doors, no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there will be no sleeping-in Thursday morning for
Vincent Gravelli. A detective with the New York City Police
Department, Gravelli was scheduled to report for duty at 6 a.m.,
and to work the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the afternoon I'll go to Mom's house in Brooklyn,'' he
said, for a reunion with his sister and eight or nine relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with
a lot of food.''

   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Jason Ferguson, the Jets' nose guard, was
suspended Wednesday for four games by the National Football League
for testing positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson is the first Jet to be suspended for violating the
league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. He tested positive
for marijuana at the 1997 combine, which dropped him to the seventh
round.
</P>
<P>
   After he was drafted, Ferguson was contrite, saying he was sorry
that he had embarrassed his mother. The Jets had no statement on
the matter Wednesday, with neither Coach Bill Parcells nor Ferguson
available for a comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson sprained a knee in the season opener and missed the
next three games. The Jets lost two of those games; since his
return, the team has won three and lost two, surrendering more than
20 points just once.

<P>
   DENVER _ As a debate over the growing use of behavioral drugs
for children intensifies across the country, the Colorado Board of
Education has passed a resolution meant to discourage teachers from
recommending prescription drugs like Ritalin and Luvox for
students.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, the first of its kind in the country, carries no
legal weight. But it urges teachers and other school personnel to
use discipline and instruction to overcome problem behavior in the
classroom, rather than to encourage parents to put their children
on drugs that are commonly prescribed for attention deficit and
hyperactive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the resolution, which passed by a 6-1 vote Nov.
11, said they were motivated, in part, by evidence that they said
suggests dozens of violent crimes in recent years, including the
massacre last spring at Columbine High School, were committed by
young people taking psychotropic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teen-age shooters at Columbine, Eric Harris, had been
taking Luvox, an anti-depressant, although there is no evidence
that the drug had anything to do with the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   No other states are considering a measure similar to the one in
Colorado, where an unusual set of circumstances played a role in
the resolution's passage: an elected and fairly conservative school
board responding, in part, to the outcry from one of the nation's
worst school shootings. But the resolution reflects broader issues,
as well, as parents, mental health professionals and school
officials around the country debate the rising use of behavioral
drugs for children.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in children's mental health issues point out that
children who take the drugs do so because they were having
difficulties to begin with. They acknowledge that impulsive or
violent behavior is a recognized side effect in a small percentage
of people taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in arguing that an overwhelming majority of children who use
the drugs are benefiting, they contend that the Colorado resolution
is irresponsible and perhaps even dangerous in that it could lead
school personnel to ignore signs of serious mental disorders in
children and that it would discourage communication between
teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what happened in Colorado is the exception and not the
rule,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental
Health Association, conceding that he fears other states and school
districts might replicate Colorado's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding up psychotropic medicines as the possible cause of
violent behavior is absurd. There's a wealth of information to show
that they have helped dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of Ritalin and other psychotropic drugs has steadily
increased over the years among school-age children to a current
level of about 2.5 million, according to Children and Adults with
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a national nonprofit
organization known as CHADD, which is based in Landover, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Colorado, increased usage has turned a new focus onto
the role that teachers and administrators play in the daily lives
of children who attend their schools. It has also pitted experts
who say use is growing because the drugs are beneficial against
those who contend that parents and teachers are too quick to seek
out prescription medicine as the simplest way to treat children
with behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Johnson, the Colorado school board member who organized a
hearing on the issue and proposed the resolution, said that in the
five years she has served on the board, she has received ``numerous
complaints'' from parents who claimed a teacher had insisted that
their child go on Ritalin or another drug before returning to
class.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the case of one girl, who was showing signs of
attention deficit disorder through mood sweeps and napping in
class, Ms. Johnson said the girl was later diagnosed to be
suffering from hypoglycemia and just needed to change her diet.
According to the girl's parents, Ms. Johnson said, the teacher told
them, ``You need to get her a prescription for Ritalin.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, a resolution was designed to remove
school personnel from any medical decisions. She said the board,
which consists of six Republicans and one Democrat, passed the
resolution along party lines with minimal debate. The lone
Democrat, Gully Stanford, did not return a telephone call. No other
versions of of the resolution were considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution does not stop teachers from communicating with
parents,'' Ms. Johnson said in an interview. ``What it does do is
stop teachers from giving parents an ultimatum: `Put your kid on a
drug or we're not going to teach them.' That can't happen any more.
It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
of State Boards of Education, said that Colorado's is one of only
seven elected state boards of education in the country and those
boards tend to be more ideological.
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, ``I agree that too often the first answer
for children with some behavior problem is to reach for medication.
Some of the numbers we are seeing for medication of children are
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards
Association, said she knew of no other school board examining the
question. She added that while many are concerned about
overmedication, ``We would be reluctant to support such a
resolution because there are children who may need such services,
who may benefit from the medication.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Stahl, a professor of psychiatry at the University
of California in San Diego, said that because of the complexities
of mental disorders and the rapidly changing personalities of
children as they grow older, both sides of the psychotropic debate
may be right. And wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no blood test for this,'' he said. ``It's not
objective. If a kid is acting out in class and a stimulant like
Ritalin calms him down, it would be immoral not to give him the
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem comes,'' he added, ``when the stimulants don't
work and parents give them anyway as an excuse to avoid tough
decisions or talking with teachers and doctors to learn what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem complicating the issue, Stahl said, is the
location of the school. Typically, he said, in poor areas, mental
disorders are underdiagnosed, and often in more affluent school
districts, children are overdiagnosed, sometimes making a bad
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Besides complaints from parents about insistent teachers, Ms.
Johnson said she was also motivated to propose the resolution by
the violent crimes involving young people, in which investigators
said the perpetrators were using psychotropic drugs. Accounts of
those incidents also persuaded a Colorado state lawmaker, Penn
Pfiffner of Lakeland, to hold a separate hearing on the issue,
which, by coincidence, came two days before the school board voted
on Ms. Johnson's measure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Breggin, director of the International Center for the
Study of Psychiatry and Psychology, a nonprofit research
organization in Bethesda, Md., testified at both hearings and said
doctors have become too eager to prescribe psychotropic drugs at
the expense of conversations among parents, teachers and children
to learn why children are acting in anti-social ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous mistake to subdue the behavior of children
instead of tending to their needs,'' Breggin said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drugging them into submission rather than identifying
and meeting the genuine needs of the family, the school and the
community. It's wrong in principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Harris and other young killers who were found to be
taking Ritalin and other drugs, Breggin said he is convinced that
there is a direct link between the drugs and violent acts. He also
asserted that the drug harms children.
</P>
<P>
   CHADD executive director Matthew Cohen and others said the
resolution might inhibit teachers from applying their own common
sense and experience in the case of a troublesome child by merely
telling parents that something is wrong without offering a full
range of possible solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child has hearing or vision problems that the teacher
identifies, we would expect the teacher to talk to the parents,''
said Jeanne Mueller Rohner, executive director of the Mental Health
Association of Colorado, which opposed the resolution. ``It should
be the same thing for mental health.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure also said they were uncomfortable with
the ardent support offered the measure by the Church of Scientology
through an affiliate organization, the Citizens Commission on Human
Rights. The president of its American branch, Bruce Wiseman, who
described the commission as a ``psychiatric watchdog group,''
testified at both hearings and urged rejection of Ritalin and other
drugs as a solution to troublesome behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Johnson, as well as Pfiffner, said the commission's
support was not a critical factor in any of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson conceded that only a small number of teachers in
Colorado have ever insisted on a child taking prescription drugs as
a precondition to returning to class. It is largely for them that
the resolution was intended.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, said Andrea Giunta, president of the largest
teachers' union in Denver, it might not matter, anyway. By the time
most children are diagnosed with an attention deficit or
hyperactive disorder, she said, they have been observed and
analyzed over time by a team of experts, including teachers,
nurses, counselors and school psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher shouldn't recommend a specific course of action,''
Ms. Giunta said. ``But what she can do is say, `This has been my
experience with other children when they have displayed this kind
of behavior. What you do is up to you.'''

SPREWELL IS FINED $10,000 BY THE NBA

<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association all but ordered Latrell
Sprewell to wash his mouth out with soap by fining him $10,000
Wednesday for directing profanity toward fans during his emotional
return to Golden State in Oakland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was traveling to New York from Los Angeles on Wednesday
with the Knicks after their five-game road trip and was unavailable
for comment. On Tuesday, he said that if he did receive a fine he
might appeal ``depending on how much the amount was.'' Earlier that
day, he said he was surprised by a morning phone call from a league
security official asking him about the obscenities he shouted
toward his hecklers at the Arena in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have dialogue with the fans,'' Sprewell said,
explaining his actions. ``I think because it was Golden State,
there was the hype about me and P.J. Carlesimo and a bigger focus
on the game. That made it more of an issue. But I like talking to
the fans. I'm not the type to back down from that. Frankly, I think
the fans like that back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, the league's vice president of basketball operations,
reviewed Sprewell's conduct during the game and determined that the
Knicks' impulsive guard went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game even began, Sprewell confronted a detractor and
used profanity to tell the man to ``shut up.'' During the game,
when three men sitting in corner court-side seats were chiding
Sprewell for his attack on Carlesimo, then his coach, two years
ago, Sprewell used more obscene language to address them. Near the
end of the game, Sprewell could be seen shouting profanities into
the air as he left the court during a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really recall saying that much, except to the three
guys in the corner,'' Sprewell said. When asked what the league's
intentions were in investigating the incident, Sprewell, who was
suspended by Commissioner David Stern after choking Carlesimo, said
if he was being used as an example, ``it wouldn't be the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sprewell is not the first player to be fined $10,000 for
directing profanity at fans, which is a violation of the league's
code of conduct. In April 1998, Houston's Charles Barkley was fined
the same amount for directing obscene gestures and profanity at a
Utah fan in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Sprewell has been financially punished on
several occasions. In 1997, he lost $6 million because of his
four-month suspension after choking Carlesimo. Last season, after
critical comments made by his agent, he was fined $25,000 by the
Knicks, although that fine was later rescinded by the team.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the team fined him $130,000, which included a
penalty for missing training camp and a one-game suspension for the
first game of the preseason. Throughout this past week, Coach Jeff
Van Gundy has defended Sprewell's response during the Golden State
game and blamed the escalated tension on unruly fans.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks General Manager Scott Layden issued a statement
Wednesday, saying: ``The league investigated the situation and felt
it necessary to fine Latrell. The league is objective; it made a
decision that should bring closure to an emotional situation.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES
 &HT;    Fifth in a series

   Paris potpourri ...
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) No matter how many times I visit, the Paris version of
the Statue of Liberty always takes me by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scale model of the gift France made to the United States
in 1885. You'll find it at Pont de Grenelle in the middle of the
River Seine, facing west toward New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the Seine is the Liberty Flame, a replica of the
statue's torch, given to France by the International Herald Tribune
after World War II, in memory of the fighters of the French
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it's better known for its location, directly above the
Right Bank entrance to the tunnel where Princess Diana was killed
in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and other remembrances are placed there daily by
visitors who mistake the Liberty Flame for a memorial to Diana.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) The French and the English will never be able to come
to an understanding, not as long as one speaks French and the
other, English.
</P>
<P>
   An English translation on one particular marker, recalling a
visit by one of England's future kings, identified him as the
``Prince of Whales.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Phone cards can be tricky, and it's almost impossible
to find a pay phone that works with coins.
</P>
<P>
   I kept shoving the card into the appropriate slot, but to no
avail. Finally a nice young woman came to my aid.
</P>
<P>
   It seems you still need a coin - one to scratch off the gray
stripe on the back of the card to reveal a code number. You punch
in those numbers and the phone will work. C'est le French
technology.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) It's hard to find a bad meal in this town, but it's not
always easy to find a quick, satisfying snack.
</P>
<P>
   Four-course, sit-down dinners for $50 apiece are memorable.
Sometimes, though, you just want to grab a sandwich on the run. The
French, who take their food very seriously, will have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, MacDonald's and the French equivalent, Le
Quick. Better you should stop at a neighborhood pastry shop.
</P>
<P>
   Try a hot dog, French style - a weenie baked inside a small loaf
of bread and topped with melted cheese. Just don't go asking for
onions and chili. Dijon mustard, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) The French are as particular, and peculiar, about
fashion as they are food.
</P>
<P>
   I was there in late October, early November. For that time of
year, the weather should have been chilly and damp. Instead, Paris
was enjoying balmy days when you go about in your shirt sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Not the French. They were bundled up in coats, sweaters and
mufflers, their shoulders hunched as if against the cold as they
trudged the boulevards. Never mind what the thermometer says. They
seem to dress according to the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Personally, I have no problem with the language, since
I seldom attempt it. Things usually work out OK anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I was riding in a cab. The sun was shining, and rain was
falling. The taxi driver explained that the French have an
expression to describe that kind of weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say-tan bot le femme,'' he recited, or something that sounded
like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is beating his wife?'' I responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah!'' he exclaimed, taking both hands from the steering wheel
of the moving car and waving them about. ``You speak French!''

WITH TUDJMAN NEAR DEATH, CROATS CONSIDER SUCCESSION ISSUE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ With Croatia's dominant political figure,
President Franjo Tudjman, apparently on the brink of death,
Parliament passed a constitutional amendment Wednesday that would
allow the country to be governed in the meantime, with some of his
duties passed on to the speaker of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's doctors said Wednesday that his condition was grave,
their most dire description yet in the three weeks since he entered
the hospital for emergency intestinal surgery. There have been
persistent rumors that Tudjman, who has stomach cancer, is being
kept breathing artificially and is attached to life-support
equipment while his divided party, the Croatian Democratic Union,
figures out who will succeed him. Seeking to address those rumors,
party officials said Wednesday that he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman is apparently unable to sign the documents for
parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for Dec. 22, so the
country is in a state of morbid expectation, reminding some people
of the lingering, four-month death watch for Josip Broz Tito, the
founder of Yugoslavia, who died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, 77, who has patterned his habits and his taste for
uniforms on Tito's, is a historian and former Yugoslav army general
who pulled Croatia out of Yugoslavia in 1991, thereby helping to
collapse the old Communist federation.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman has run Croatia as an autocrat since 1991 while winning
repeated elections as its president, the last in 1997. But a
pattern of economic corruption and cronyism, a disregard for human
rights and a tight rein on the news media, especially television
and radio, have brought Tudjman considerable criticism from
Washington and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the West would like the Croatian government to be
more fully cooperative with the international war crimes tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands, and to stop
refusing to hand over people indicted as war criminals; to welcome,
rather than discourage, the return to Croatia of Serbs driven from
the country after Tudjman's forces recaptured the Serb-held
territory in August 1995; and to hold free and fair elections with
free and fair access granted to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the political confusion here stems from the increasing
unpopularity of Tudjman's umbrella party, since the economy is
stagnant, corruption is visible and unemployment is very high.
Reputable polls taken earlier this month indicated that an
opposition grouping of center-left parties would probably win a
majority in Parliament, although Tudjman's Croatian Democratic
Union _ universally known here by its Croatian initials HDZ _ would
remain the largest party.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, parliamentary elections were scheduled for Dec. 22 _
a pre-Christmas date that seemed designed, in this largely Roman
Catholic country, to help his party, since many of its critics,
including Croats who also have homes abroad, would be on vacation
or out of the country. But Parliament's mandate expires on
Saturday, and no solution is yet in sight for calling fresh
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's death would leave his party divided into roughly three
factions. The first is led by Ivic Pasalic, Tudjman's adviser.
Pasalic has no state function but is considered instrumental in
internal and security policy. He is the leader of the ``Herzegovina
lobby'' that supports the Bosnian Croats, fervent devotees of
Tudjman's party who are also allowed to vote in Croatian elections
despite their Bosnian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The second faction is led by the deputy speaker of Parliament,
Vladimir Seks, a hard-line Croatian nationalist who announced
Wednesday on television that Tudjman ``is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The third faction, more liberal and pro-European, is led by
Foreign Minister Mate Granic, a favorite of Washington. While
Granic is popular in the country, he is less so within the party.
</P>
<P>
   The party, then, is thought to be trying to buy time while the
leadership decides who will run for the presidency and when to call
parliamentary elections. If Tudjman dies, the parliamentary
speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, a relatively colorless figure, will run
the country before new presidential elections within 60 days.
Parliament's term is scheduled to expire on Jan. 27, and new
elections should be called by Dec. 26 at the latest, to allow 30
days of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But to have them during the Christmas break would require
Tudjman _ or, if he is declared incapable, Pavletic _ to sign an
order this week. Wednesday's Parliament vote was an indication of
the confusion. The Constitution describes procedures in the case of
a president's death, resignation or ``permanent incapacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seks said that the party ``will under no circumstances agree
to apply the institute of permanent incapacitation.'' To do so, he
said, would be ``immoral and disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   So in extraordinary session, Parliament passed, by a vote of
85-28 with 24 abstentions, a constitutional amendment that created
a category of ``temporary incapacity,'' which must be decided upon
by the Constitutional Court when asked to do so by the Cabinet. But
the law allows 30 days for the whole procedure, causing opposition
politicians to protest that the political instability would simply
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament also voted to extend the mandate of the speaker,
Pavletic, so he could serve after the legislature is dissolved on
Saturday but before new elections are held. That would enable him
to assume some of Tudjman's duties if he is declared temporarily
incapacitated or dies.

L.A. gets the `Blues'  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:   2.5 stars 
(Eds:  Not for use before Friday, Nov. 26) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By Reed Johnson 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spirit of the blues soars heavenward, but its flesh is
notoriously weak. It's music that hankers after transcendence, yet
revels in its raw humanity. The blues is about lust followed by
loss, repenting on Sunday morning after raising hell on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' the patchy and overly
earnest, but ultimately rewarding, new musical theater piece at the
Geffen Playhouse, those contradictions are strikingly personified
by co-author/performer Ron Taylor, a man of ample soulfulness and
ample corporeal substance.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's defining moment occurs in the second act, when he
throws himself into the raunchy standard ``I'm Your Hoochie Coochie
Man,'' one of 40 songs that make up the kinetic score. Filling
practically every inch of his vintage earth-toned suit, Taylor
gathers his heroic bulk, summons his rich, loamy baritone and
flashes the audience a look of evil playfulness. Then, savoring the
song's insinuating lyrics like a mouthful of good whiskey, he
extends an incantatory hand, as if beckoning us to plunge with him
into some lascivious musical underworld.
</P>
<P>
   This number is among the high points of a loosely structured
evening in which musical insight and narrative context come
together only about half the time. Even when the tunes are
beautifully sung, as they mostly are, the performers don't always
do an adequate job of selling them dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when everything clicks under Randal Myler's direction, the
show provides a kind of generous, uptempo lift now rare in the
American theater. In this season that celebrates gratitude, that's
a lot to be thankful for.
</P>
<P>
   Making generous use of sepia-toned rear-screen projections of
photos, drawings and other images, ``It Ain't Nothin' but the
Blues'' tells the story of how African American slaves cultivated a
sacred and profane singing style that gave rise to a uniquely
American art form.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing itself into two acts _ the first representing blues in
the Old South, the second its migratory manifestations in early
20th-century Chicago _ the show traces the evolution of blues from
African call-and-response chanting to the sweetly mournful
spirituals of slaves, sharecroppers and chain gang members and on
through the rise of jazz and the birth of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   It's an inspiring story, told with great conviction by Taylor
and fellow performers Eloise Laws, Janiva Magness, Jewel Tompkins,
Billy Valentine, Mark Leroy Jackson and Dan Wheetman, a fine guitar
player who also is one of the show's five co-authors and its
musical director. A crack backup band keeps the sound shapely and
funky throughout.
</P>
<P>
   In telling this epic tale, however, ``It Ain't Nothin' but the
Blues'' frequently betrays its roots as a 45-minute touring revue
that was developed as part of Denver Center Theatre's outreach
program and later expanded into a Tony-nominated Broadway musical.
The authors demonstrate greater sophistication in their handling of
music than in the chatty between-numbers dialogue, which sometimes
has the feel of a well-meaning civics lesson.
</P>
<P>
   What the show does best is what the blues does best: tell a
story of everyday living through deceptively simple metaphors and
chord progressions. Listening to Valentine's gently resigned ``I
Can't Stop Lovin' You,'' Tompkins' smoky ``St. Louis Blues'' or the
company's rousing Act 1 gospel closer, ``Catch on Fire,'' you may
find yourself wondering why it took so long to bring this music to
Broadway in its pure form. Make that one less historical injustice
left to be overturned.

MISSILE SHIELD WOULD SET OFF ARMS RACE, CHINA WARNS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's chief of arms control issued a new warning
Wednesday that U.S. plans for a national missile defense system,
even if intended to stop attacks from countries like North Korea
and Iraq, would set off a global arms race and cause more countries
to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, which the United
States proposes altering to allow limited defenses, has long been a
cornerstone of nuclear stability, Sha Zukang, director of arms
control and disarmament in China's foreign ministry, said Wednesday
in an article in the official newspaper China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amending it in search of national missile defense will tip the
global balance, trigger a new arms race and jeopardize world and
regional stability,'' Sha wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, the main nuclear rival of the United States, has also
been vociferous in opposing missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   China has objected to proposed theater missile defenses, local
systems intended to protect American allies in Asia from missile
attacks. China worries that such high-technology defenses would be
offered to Taiwan, encouraging it to declare formal independence
and cementing military ties between Taiwan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the debate is already heated, theater defenses that could
stop a blitz of short-range missiles are still in the unproved
research stage.
</P>
<P>
   But in Wednesday's article and recent speeches, Chinese
officials have also vehemently challenged the progressing American
plans for a national defense system, perhaps designed to stop a
handful of incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A prime reason for Chinese concern, weapons experts say, is that
even a limited system would undercut China's own nuclear strategy,
forcing it to spend far more than it wants to build extra rockets
and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States and Russia, each of which fielded
thousands of nuclear weapons in a race for slim advantages, China
has deployed small numbers of weapons intended simply to give
adversaries second thoughts about attacking it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Western analysts say, China may have no more than two
dozen long-range missiles, capable of reaching parts of the United
States with single warheads. China's theory is that if a
prospective attacker believes that even one or two of China's
missiles can get through to destroy a city, then a nuclear attack
will be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese know that their current aging missiles are
vulnerable to a sudden attack on the ground and plan to replace
them with more powerful missiles that are mobile and therefore far
more difficult to take aim at.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials do not know how many such missiles the Chinese
plan to field. But even limited U.S. defenses could reduce China's
confidence that it could mount an effective counterattack in case
of war. So China may feel that it needs a relatively larger force,
perhaps including missiles that carry multiple warheads, to
maintain its stature as a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Sha, in Wednesday's article and other speeches, does not mention
such hard-nosed strategic concerns, only alluding darkly to a
hastened arms race. In the article Wednesday, he also said an
American missile defense would ``undermine the conditions necessary
for nuclear disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   And without the promise of superpower arms reductions, he said,
``who can guarantee that other non-nuclear states will not go
nuclear?''

`TOY STORY' TOYS' STORY BEGINS WITH A GIANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Every action figure, toothbrush holder and
pencil topper tied to ``Toy Story 2'' has its own story, and many
of those stories took place in an obscure Southern California
facility called Gentle Giant Studios Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although children will never see its name on ``Toy Story 2''
merchandise, Burbank-based Gentle Giant designed many of the Buzz
Lightyear and Woody products that will grace toy store shelves this
season. The 30-employee company sculpted about 200 ``Toy Story 2''
pieces in all, capping off the best year in its five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as big as anything we've ever done,'' said Karl
Meyer, founder, president and sole owner of Gentle Giant. ``Woody
and Buzz Lightyear are as recognizable to kids as any other
character out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer credited close ties to Pixar and the Walt Disney Co. for
its ``Toy Story 2'' contracts with industry powerhouses such as
Mattel and Thinkway Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Toy industry analyst Sean McGowan of New York-based Gerard
Klauer Mattison, estimated ``Toy Story 2'' merchandise will pull in
$100 million in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that `Toy Story 2' will be very big, very
quickly,'' he said. ``I think there is going to be a lot of
merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Toy Story 2'' contracts are no fluke for Gentle Giant, a
little company with a long list of clients.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently produced 250 pieces for ``Star Wars _
Episode One: The Phantom Menace,'' including action figures and
cup-toppers. Gentle Giant also sculpted many of the Pokemon toys
that fast-food chain Burger King Corp. hopes will help it close the
gap with McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle Giant's work is at the core of the merchandising process,
giving toys the proportion and detail they need to be believable
replicas of the genuine article. The company's artists use both
traditional and high-tech tools, everything from clay sculpting to
advanced 3-D imaging that can make a perfect digital replica of a
human, or non-human, face.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-D technology used by Gentle Giant and others has boosted
the toy industry by creating a new generation of toys that actually
look like the characters they represent, said McGowan, the toy
industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Digital technology also speeds up the sculpting process. Instead
of creating clay models from scratch, Gentle Giant artists can
often import 3-D digital animation data and use that information to
change a character's pose or size.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using printers that produce 3-D models, artists can
quickly create prototypes that are later reproduced in wax and
hand-finished.
</P>
<P>
   John Barton, director of marketing for Thinkway Toys, said his
company chose Gentle Giant for ``Toy Story 2'' design work because
of the company's technological innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves an incredible amount of time,'' Barton said. ``On top
of that, you get a great looking product.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a former aspiring rock star, said he made the move to
digital design and computer graphic work about 2{ years ago, ``when
I realized where the industry was headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off. Since starting the company in his garage five
years ago, Meyer has nabbed contracts for scores of projects with
about 150 different clients, including a contract for some products
tied to the original ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   When he moved the operation from his garage to a Burbank office,
Meyer dubbed his company Gentle Giant, a name that he said reminded
him of Eric ``Hoss'' Cartwright from ``Bonanza,'' a television
series set in the old West.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss was the biggest and brawniest of the Cartwright brothers,
but he also was the most gentle, Meyer explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoss was able to bend a horseshoe in one hand and hold a
butterfly in the other,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle Giant has a similar philosophy, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to handle hard things and still have finesse,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   True to its roots, the company remains self-contained, with its
own machine shop, paint room, and even a backyard basketball court.
Artists work on advanced computers or simple clay amid a forest of
action figures, posters and other toys.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its core toy prototype business, Gentle Giant
also does 3-D scanning, computer assisted drafting and video game
work, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to keep the office humming, but Meyer said it
pales in comparison to the company's early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three years of business, I worked seven days a
weeks, 16 to 20 hours a day,'' Meyer said.

again,'' he said. ``It has been a blur.'' &QL;

 Robert Tracy, a former ballet dancer, is the author of ``Goddess:
Martha Graham's Dancers Remember.''  
 By ROBERT TRACY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that Judith Jamison is already celebrating
her 10th anniversary as artistic director of the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater. Next month, she will receive a Kennedy
Center Honor for her contribution to 20th-century dance. At the
same time, working within the Ailey tradition, Ms. Jamison has
envisioned the direction the company will take in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to constantly feed the repertory with people who are on
the cusp and ready to put their feet into the future,'' Ms. Jamison
said a decade ago. ``I want to also pay loyal respect to our
choreographers Talley Beatty, Donny McKayle, John Butler, Geoffrey
Holder and Louis Johnson, who were Alvin's contemporaries. Those
people made it possible for us to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   As arguably the most popular modern-dance company in the world
prepares for its monthlong season, Wednesday (the 10th anniversary
of Ailey's death) through Jan. 2 at City Center, Ailey's mission to
keep modern dance alive through an eclectic repertory by a variety
of choreographers has been largely accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Ailey democratized dance by providing a showcase for the wealth
and diversity of vernacular dance that already existed in America.
He thought these dances should belong to the whole world. To
accomplish this, he blended styles in his repertory, borrowing
ideas from Lester Horton, Katherine Dunham, Jack Cole and Jose
Limon and incorporating the theatricality of Denishawn.
</P>
<P>
   He was also indebted to the modern-dance pioneers Martha Graham,
Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Anna Sokolow. According to Joe
Nash, the African-American dance historian, ``Alvin's goal from the
very beginning was for his dancers to be able to move from one
style to another with ease, grace, passion and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   That ideal is achieved in the current season in which there are
21 ballets by 12 choreographers. These include three world
premieres: ``Danger Run,'' choreographed by Donald McKayle; ``C
Sharp Street _ B Flat Avenue,'' by Urban Bush Women's Jawole Willa
Jo Zollar, and ``Grace,'' by Ronald K. Brown. There will also be
three revivals: Ms. Jamison's ``Divining,'' John Butler's ``After
Eden'' and a revisitation of Bill T. Jones' ``Fever Swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently 10 choreographers whose work will be danced by the
Ailey company this year and next discussed how Ailey inspired them
personally and artistically.
</P>
<P>
   Ailey danced in the company of Donald McKayle for a few years
before he started his own in 1958. ``Alvin spoke to me a lot,''
says McKayle, who is 69. ``He asked a ton of questions because he
was a curious, inquisitive, brilliant man. We had a marvelous
exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   McKayle observes that the Ailey repertory was based on Alvin's
own works, which revealed his personal style yet was strongly
influenced from the time he apprenticed under Horton in the early
'50s. He says the technique of the company has changed over the
years and thinks that if you can't dance every style, you aren't
valuable to the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Run'' is McKayle's seventh work for the Ailey company
and is set to folk material by the radical contemporary American
composer Frederic Rzewski, with costumes by the Nigerian Omatayo
Wunni Olaiya. Although the dance is not locked into a time frame,
it depicts the odyssey of Africa's Middle Passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ailey dancers are so giving to me,'' says McKayle. ``It is
important for us as choreographers, but also for the company. It's
a very grounding experience, and the statements we are making
together are unique because, you see, it is very important for us
to realize our identity.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, 48, first saw the Ailey company in
the early '70s she was impressed by the individuality of the
artists, particularly Ms. Jamison, John Parks and Sylvia Waters
(who has directed the junior company, Ailey II, for 25 years).
After seeing an all-Ulysses Dove program danced by the Ailey
company last year, and although she adores Dove's choreography, she
found his dances tense, she said.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a contrast, Ms. Zollar went on to choreograph a
light-hearted dance for 15 Ailey dancers, ``C Sharp Street _ B Flat
Avenue,'' set to a jazz score by Michael Wemberly and David Murray.
Inspired by a line from a Ntozake Shange poem, ``I live on C-Sharp
Street and my friend lives on B Flat Avenue,'' Ms. Zollar says, ``I
fell in love in that moment _ the funkiness of living in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zollar points out that theatergoing habits have changed for
African-Americans. ``What we are interested in, what our mission
is, is to make the work more accessible to black audiences,'' she
says. ``What we have found is that the majority of our audiences
are white, which is great. But we want to try and get our work to
the people who don't have the tradition of going to the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Many black choreographers didn't have a home for their dances,
and that was something Ailey was able to provide. ``Certainly,
having my choreography danced by Ailey, the top modern-dance
company, is exciting,'' says Ms. Zollar. ``I'm having my work seen
from Germany to Iowa City.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald K. Brown, who is 33 and directs his own company,
Evidence, says it is a special honor for someone who never belonged
to the Ailey troupe to be choreographing for the Ailey dancers. He
didn't attend the Ailey school, so his first interaction with Ailey
was in the late '80s, at a rehearsal with Barry Martin's company,
for which he was making a work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin turned to me and said, `Are you one of mine?''' recalls
Brown. ``I felt immediately that he had this large heart, and that
he would have a company that would be bigger than himself.'' Brown
immersed himself in what Ailey was creating and strove to do his
work following the lead, instructions and lessons that artists like
Ailey and McKayle set down. ``It is kind of an acceptance or
approval by them to have my work danced in the repertory with
theirs,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's ``Grace'' is set to Duke Ellington's ``Come Sunday,''
juxtaposed with contemporary dance music by Roy Davis and Afro-pop
by the Nigerian composer Fela Anikulapo Kuti. In the piece, the
dancers take the audience on a vicarious physical and spiritual
journey to the ``grace'' that surrounds individual existence.
</P>
<P>
   Ailey always wanted to give his dancers the opportunity to
experience the process of choreographing. Exceptional members of
his company like George Faison, Hope Clarke, Kelvin Kotardier, John
Parks and Milton Myers began by choreographing solos for Judith
Jamison, the Ailey icon, now 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a challenge because of the type-casting of myself
as goddess, earth mother, bold, strong, forceful woman,'' Ms.
Jamison recalls. ``Those specific choreographic dancers knew me
very well and were able to go past that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a dancer I don't ever remember being interested in or eager
to choreograph,'' Ms. Jamison continues. ``Alvin pulled me out of
the Connecticut woods to create my first piece, `Divining,' for the
company in 1984. I'm very happy to recreate it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Troy Powell, 30, a current Ailey dancer, was encouraged
by Ms. Jamison to create his first piece, ``Ascension,'' last year
to the music of Michael Wemberly. Powell is already at work on his
second ballet. Somehow it all seems connected to Ailey's legacy.
``As far as being a choreographer, of being a black man in dance,
I've always identified with Alvin,'' says Powell. ``It is what
Alvin started out and Judy is continuing: opening the doors up for
a lot of people. She has done a wonderful job in keeping Alvin
alive, true and honest-Aileyfied.''
</P>
<P>
   John Butler, who died at 74 in 1993, spoke in the early '90s
about his collaborations with Ailey. He recalled Ailey's saying,
``Any piece of yours that you want I will take, because I would
like to have John Butler's repertory danced by the Ailey company.''
Ailey eventually took six of Butler's dances because he felt that
Butler had never received proper recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generosity of the man, of one choreographer to another,
was truly amazing,'' said Butler. ``Naturally I would kill myself
for him. Alvin was someone who gave me respect, freedom,
encouragement and belief.'' Butler's ``After Eden,'' about Adam and
Eve's expulsion from the biblical garden, to the music of Lee
Hoiby, was initially recreated for the Ailey company in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Bill T. Jones, 47, the downtown choreographer, had a different
scenario with his first collaboration, ``Fever Swamp,'' with Ailey.
Everyone used to say to Jones, ``Why don't you let Ailey polish
you?'' At the time, Jones was totally against what he considered
``classical modern dance.'' ``When I met Alvin I was in awe of
him,'' says Jones. ``He had this astounding persona as a black
person, black artist, black man. I said, `What do you think of the
postmodern choreographers?' And he said, `I like them when they
dance.' That was our first exchange. I was prepared for him not to
like me and not to like what I do, but it was just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Ailey then went out of his way to give visibility to the
avant-garde choreographer by putting ``Fever Swamp,'' on a
television special documenting the Ailey company. Jones thinks
Ailey's triumph is that he created a significantly integrated
audience. ``At this point I feel Alvin was way ahead of any racial
discourse,'' Jones says. ``Ailey claimed all styles and traditions
of dance to be his own as an American citizen. That is a pretty big
claim and part of his great contribution to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Holder, 69, a peer of Ailey's, revived his ``Prodigal
Prince,'' about Hector Hyppolite, the father of Haitian folk art,
in 1998 after 30 years. It had its premiere with the Ailey company
in 1968. ``I'm glad Judy asked me to redo it,'' says Holder. ``I
did it really as a salute to the incredible artistry of Miguel
Godreau,'' the original Hector Hyppolite. ``He was a gem who could
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Ailey company went to the USSR in the early '70s, the
Soviets asked them to cover the men in ``Prodigal Prince'' because
they thought they were too naked. Of course, they weren't nude;
they wore loin cloths. ``I'm not afraid of exposing the beautiful
black derriere,'' says Holder. ``We never tell the Russians, `Don't
bring your ballet here where a man is trying to have sex with a
swan in three acts.' My ballet is set in Africa. The Africans are
naked, and they don't wear tights when they dance.'' (Ultimately he
suugested that Ailey take another ballet.)
</P>
<P>
   Holder says that Ailey was very clever in creating a repertory
company because it gave ``Alvin time to work on and develop his own
choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen de Lavallade, 68, the golden American beauty who also
happens to be Holder's wife, remembers the early influences that
enlarged Ailey's choreographic statements and vision. It was, after
all, Ms. de Lavallade who inspired Ailey to dance in the first
place. And for Ailey the choreographer, Ms. de Lavallade was his
first muse. ``We were in Lester Horton's mixed-race company, which
was unheard of in the early '50s,'' she recalls. ``In Los Angeles
during the conservative McCarthy period we were artists of all
races dancing together. That was truly Hollyweird, but quite
courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Lavallade thinks that, because of working with Horton,
Ailey had the will to kick off his extraordinary success with the
1960 masterpiece, ``Revelations,'' only his 10th ballet. After this
enormous triumph, Ailey was able to create a gigantic repertory
with all the choreographers whom he valued and admired. For the
2000 season, Ms. de Lavallade has been commissioned by Ms. Jamison
to create her first ballet for Ailey's main company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancers are attracted to the Ailey repertory beyond Alvin's
spirituality, because it is so diverse,'' says Dwight Rhoden, 36,
who directs the Ailey-inspired company Complexions with the former
Ailey star, Desmond Richardson, 30. ``One has to be versed in all
dance techniques and at the same time have some sense of
theatricality,'' Rhoden says. ``Particularly in Alvin's work you
have to be mature enough to bring something to it, because he gives
you a lot of room as an individual artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamison commissioned Rhoden's ``Frames,'' while he was
dancing with Ailey in 1992. He will also choreograph a new work for
the company next year. Rhoden thinks Ms. Jamison's eclecticism is
different from Ailey's, but still within the same spirit of
diversity and adventure in terms of taking chances. ``Alvin was
never safe,'' Rhoden says. ``Judy is sharp and intelligent when it
comes to selecting choreographers. She is not taking the secure
route, which is part of the appeal of the company. The reality is,
people who come to see the Ailey company perform will, in one way
or another, be entertained and provoked beyond the edge.''

<P>
   NITZANA, Israel _ Standing at the edge of the Negev, overlooking
a border crossing into Egypt, Lova Eliav swept a hand across the
expanse and summoned up his vision of a new Israeli city in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here there will be high-tech industries, here desert research
centers, over there residential areas, desert agriculture, and out
there an airport,'' he said on a recent clear morning, the air
scrubbed clean by an overnight rain.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous 77-year-old who looks younger, Eliav _ a former
regional developer, a secret emissary, a peace advocate, a member
of parliament and an inveterate visionary _ has reinvented himself
at the place that he considers Israel's new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negev is the future of Israel,'' he said of the wide
spaces of the desolate southern region, an area that makes up more
than half of Israel's territory but where just 5 percent of the
population lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate is excellent, the soil is excellent,'' Eliav said.
``There won't be any of that intolerable overcrowding of the
central part of the country. Nitzana can be a bridge of peace into
the Arab world and Israel's calling card in science and research. I
don't think it's entirely imaginary.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliav's vision is a new version of the largely ignored call of
David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, to settle the
Negev. Although Ben-Gurion saw pioneer farmers sweating to make the
desert bloom, Eliav sees high-technology industry and agriculture
sprouting up, backed by research centers that investigate the
desert and offer solutions to combat desertification and to promote
arid-zone farming and the use of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   At Nitzana, Eliav envisions a ``peace city'' of 50,000 built
around the border crossing, a hub of regional development at a
historical crossroads linked by highways leading to Egypt and
central Israel, the West Bank, Jordan and Syria. The area would be
self-sufficient in water, he said, drawing on a large aquifer of
salt water that is already being used for irrigation and can be
desalted for home use.
</P>
<P>
   The core of a community is already here. With the help of the
Jewish Agency and foreign Jewish contributors, Eliav founded a
live-in educational center at Nitzana 12 years ago. Israeli high
school students and Jewish youth groups from abroad learn about the
Negev, and immigrants study Hebrew and prepare to enter Israeli
universities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Through trips to the dunes and hills, and on bicycle rides along
the border, the teenagers are taught about desert ecology and
experience life along a peaceful border. They take part in
experimental projects that grow crops and trees irrigated with salt
water pumped from underground.
</P>
<P>
   At neighboring Tel Nitzana, students have helped excavate
ancient Nabatean and Byzantine cities that straddled a crossroads
of caravan routes linking Africa and the Fertile Crescent and the
Red Sea with the Mediterranean. Eliav hopes that the site will
become a national park that would draw tourists to what he believes
should be Israel's most rapidly developing area.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he is still trying to persuade the government to adopt
his plan _ considered by the Housing Ministry three years ago but
largely neglected since _ Eliav has a track record of improbable
accomplishments that suggests that his dream could become reality.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Russia and brought by his parents to British-ruled
Palestine in 1924, his personal history mirrors Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s he commanded ships packed with illegal Jewish
immigrants from Europe that ran British blockades on Palestine's
shore. Under his direction, the town of Kiryat Gat and dozens of
agricultural communities were built in southern Israel in the
1950s, settling a flood of immigrants across a wide area that had
been previously unpopulated by Israelis. In the 1960s, he directed
the planning and construction of the desert town of Arad,
overlooking the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
   As an emissary of the Mossad, the overseas intelligence service,
in the late 1950s and '60s, he built a network of covert ties with
Jews in the Soviet Union and led a secret mission to Morocco to
assist in regional development and another mission to northern Iraq
to help a rebel Kurdish leader. In the 1956 Arab-Israeli war, he
led an air and sea operation to remove Jews from Port Said, Egypt,
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, his strong advocacy of a Palestinian state as the
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict led him to break with the
Labor Party, where he had risen to secretary-general. He held
meetings abroad with representatives of the Palestine Liberation
Organization when such contacts were banned, founded a dovish
political party with other peace advocates and mediated a prisoner
exchange between Israel and the PLO in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After years of estrangement from the Labor Party because of his
views, Eliav conceded that he had some sense of vindication now
that the government was negotiating with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, about a possible Palestinian state. But he said
precious time and many lives had been lost to arrive at what he
advocated more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Weary, he is investing his energy in Nitzana. In his mind's eye
he sees a city surrounded by dozens of smaller communities and
farms, rekindling an idealism that seems to have faded under the
consumer culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the political desert, and I've paid a price for
my opinions,'' he said. ``What I've done here is an antithesis to
the superegoism and materialism that are so rampant. We want to
show that things can be different. The future of the country, of
the people, is here.''

ONLY EIGHT CLIPPERS ABLE TO PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By RANDY HILL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Today's potential struggle between the calendar
and sporting clich has been preempted by Clippers coach Chris Ford,
who has quit worrying about what his players bring to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, whose team has managed to win three of its last four
games, simply is thankful when his players actually (ital) make it
(end ital) to the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much you can do with eight guys,'' he said,
referring to the number of able bodies suited up for Wednesday's
practice, the same number of players Ford used in Tuesday's 100-95
victory over the similarly depleted New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Before knocking off early to participate in the team's annual
charitable distribution of food and clothing at St. Joseph's Center
in Venice, the Clippers went to work with several employees on the
mend.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor (foot sprain), who has missed the last five
games, didn't participate and will sit out Friday's game at
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson (concussion) scored 23 points Tuesday in his
return from a three-game rest for cobweb removal, but absorbed a
few more big hits from the Knicks. He had Wednesday off, as did
power forward Brian Skinner (various aches and pains) and Keith
Closs (excused absence for personal business).
</P>
<P>
   For a little irony on the menu, it should be noted that point
guard Eric Murdock (sore right knee) didn't play against New York,
but did participate in Wednesday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is good at stabilizing and settling down the offense,''
Ford said of Murdock, who had several important contributions
during last week's five-game trip. ``He's a calming influence.''
</P>
<P>
   That calm might have come in handy Tuesday, when his young
teammates helped the Knicks kill their 28-point, first-half lead by
unloading 31 3-pointers, including a 3-for-16 performance in the
second half. Ford said the Knicks fell in love with the standard
double-team tactic against Lamar Odom. With Odom under
surveillance, many subsequent 3-point opportunities for his pals
seemed worthy and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after you've missed that many, a light bulb has to go
on,'' Ford said. ``During every timeout, we told 'em to start
taking the ball to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Wednesday's crowded list of wounded preventing any
offensive upgrades, the Clippers worked on ``closing out,'' a
defensive maneuver used to prevent an open shooter from being open
for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Improvement in that area would come in handy vs. the
SuperSonics, who led by the top gunning of sub Vernon Maxwell (29
points) - defeated the Clippers, 104-92, in the season-opener at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) Kandi not dandy
</P>
<P>
   Center Michael Olowokandi spent another night in frequent-fouler
oblivion, picking up two personals in the first 30 seconds of
Tuesday's victory over the Knicks. He was on the floor for a
not-so-grand total of 16 minutes 60 seconds more than Olowokandi
clocked in last Friday's flop at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, because I want to be out there
contributing,'' said the capable Olowokandi, who posted
double-doubles (points, rebounds) at Vancouver and Minnesota. ``You
can't let it get you down. But with the new rules, there has to be
some consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ford: ``Everybody's playing with the same rules. He's got
to work his way out of that. I'm not blowing the whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Olowokandi, in something miles short of a revelation, said
leniency for the NBA's star players means the rules may not be the
same for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would be consistent, then I'd be happy,'' he said.

THEME PARK LOOKS AT WAYS TO END LONG LINES FOR RIDES

   LOS ANGELES -- Universal Studios Hollywood is considering a
program that would eliminate long waits for its most popular rides.
</P>
<P>
   No timetable has been set for going ahead with the plan, which
could resemble Disneyland's week-old FastPass system. Universal
spokesman Jim Yeager said the rollout of FastPass was unrelated to
Universal's current consideration of a system that would give
customers pre-assigned times for attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly looking for ways to make the guest
experience more efficient,'' said Yeager, who noted that the studio
tour's tram ride has offered guests a ``pre-board'' option with an
assigned time for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's most popular ride is Terminator 2: 3D, based on the
Arnold Schwarzenegger film. Other major off-tram attractions
include Jurassic Park: the Ride, The E.T. Adventure and the Back to
the Future virtual-reality ride.
</P>
<P>
   The studio tour, which costs $39 for adults, draws an estimated
5.1 million visitors annually while the adjacent CityWalk
entertainment complex attracts close to 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland's FastPass, which has also been instituted at Walt
Disney World in Florida, went into operation on Nov. 19 at the It's
a Small World holiday-themed attraction and then was expanded to
Space Mountain on Wednesday. Splash Mountain will be included on
Dec. 10 and Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin on Dec. 17.

THE ROCKET IS RECLAIMING HIS BIRTHRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Originally skedded as FBN-COWBOYS-MANDELA)

 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It was a joyous mood recently in the Dallas locker room
because the Cowboys had once again toppled the rival Washington
Redskins. It was also a regal room because Nelson Mandela, the
South African social and political icon, and Prince Bandar of Saudi
Arabia were in the Cowboys' midst.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, the Dallas owner, rushed to an area near the
showers where Raghib Ismail and Deion Sanders were standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones said, `Deion, Rocket, come here!''' Ismail recalled in a
recent interview. ```I want you to meet Nelson Mandela and Prince
Bandar!' Nelson Mandela? I thought he must have meant Willie
Nelson. What would Nelson Mandela be doing at a Cowboys game? But I
went over and there was the prince. Deion already knew him. Mandela
was talking to a young boy and then he turned around. We said hello
and took a picture. To be totally honest with you, I was in such
shock that I can't remember what I said or what he said. I couldn't
focus. Wow, I hope he didn't say anything too important.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans used to shudder the same way upon meeting Ismail when he
was a college football star at Notre Dame before leaving in 1991.
Ismail was a spellbinding kick returner and an elusive, fleet
receiver, runner and marvel. Rocket became his universal identity.
People often became shocked and speechless in his presence. Mothers
often approached asking him to help raise their children. Others
would beg him to autograph their programs, or their shirts, nearly
fainting at simply the touch of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven years that followed Notre Dame became a
circuitous, complex, disheartening odyssey for Ismail. He left
Notre Dame after his junior year for two seasons in the Canadian
Football League and, thus, became obscure in the United States. He
then joined the Oakland Raiders for three nondescript seasons
during which he never caught more than 34 passes in any season and
scored a total of nine touchdowns. That was followed by two woeful
seasons with the Carolina Panthers, where he labored with injuries
and internal struggles over his spirituality and the recognition
that he missed stardom, the football success he once possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last year with the Panthers, Ismail enjoyed a breakout
National Football League season.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Cowboys (5-5), Ismail continues his climb back to
what the calls his birthright. He does so Thursday in a
Thanksgiving Day battle with the Miami Dolphins (8-2), a
circus-like game where the controversial former Dallas Coach Jimmy
Johnson, now the Miami coach, makes a blustery return to Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can have something all of your life, take it for
granted and not see it as a gift,'' Ismail said. ``In high school,
college and Canada, I saw my gift as a burden. If there was a big
play, I was always in the picture. I used to think of this as a
curse. It was not what I desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before I was traded by the Raiders to Carolina, something
in me wanted me to be recognized as a ballplayer again. It was like
I had given up my birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reminded of the biblical story of Esau and Jacob. I
asked the Lord if it was too late to get it back. He said no,
because I didn't give it up knowingly. I repented. I wanted to get
back to where I knew I should be. But every time over my first two
years in Carolina when I thought I was able to handle being a
special player, I got knocked on my rear. I wanted my birthright
back, but I was being molded, shaped, renewed so that when I did
get it back, I'd be able to handle it in the proper way. Like going
through the fire.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His first two season in Carolina were full of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first year there, my attitude was garbage,'' Ismail
said. ``I came into a team meeting once and I was rushing, nearly
late. So, I had my boxers on and my pants and shoes in my hands. I
was hustling to my seat and I planned to put them on there. One of
the coaches leading the meeting was furious. He cursed at me in
front of everyone. I saw red. I literally could have jumped up and
bit his throat off. I was enraged and talked back. Stuff like that
was going on the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up having to apologize to the entire staff. It showed
me I was not anywhere close to being where I wanted to be as a man
of God. The Lord showed me to trust in him. Once I would find that
out, I wouldn't let go. I learned to trust him through the fire. I
kept apologizing to everybody my second year, had a great minicamp
and then injured my knee. My confidence, out of the blue, was
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was riding home and my mind began to map out how
much money I had in the bank and if I could just move to an island
and live there until the money ran out. And then I would get a job
shoveling sand if I had to. And then the Lord spoke to me and said,
look around you. And I looked up and there was a billboard with my
face on it smiling. And it said: `Rocket Ismail believes in the
Lord.' I cried all the way to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season in Carolina, he finally caught fire. He caught 69
balls and scored eight touchdowns. He signed with Dallas as a free
agent this year and now has become a focal point of the Cowboys'
offense. Through 10 games, he leads the Cowboys in receptions and
is second in touchdowns scored. He has caught 52 passes for 749
yards and scored four touchdowns. He has rushed nine times for 83
yards. He turned 30 last Thursday, yet maintains superior speed and
skills. He is a tougher receiver. His peers say that now he takes
more hits with his 5-foot-11-inch, 175-pound frame and then readily
returns for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always circumstances that surround each player
you're interested in acquiring and we try not to put people in a
box and say this is only him,'' Cowboys Coach Chan Gailey said.
``You can talk yourself out of anybody. We thought he would be a
big part of us becoming a championship team. Rocket has tangibles
and intangibles. The tangibles are his speed, quickness and ability
to run after the catch. The intangibles are he is a very
high-character person who will do what it takes to help us to win.
We want diversity in our offense. But he is going to have a very
big year and be a big part of our season. The players here respect
who he is and respect him as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail used to fear injury, fear that his teammates and coaches
thought he was dogging it, fear that trainers might prescribe him
the wrong treatment. His wife, Melani, and three children _ Raghib,
3, Imani, 1, and Kianna, 3 months _ have helped him to clear his
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had come to Dallas right after Notre Dame, I probably
would have been overwhelmed by the football stuff and life here
because I wasn't grounded spiritually,'' Ismail said. ``I might
have been good football-wise but off the field I could have been
smashed. People might have seen me as an upstanding guy who could
handle a lot, but they were judging me by man's standard and not by
God's standard.''

USC'S WIN PAYS DOUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, there were plenty of the top recruits in Southern
California sitting in the Coliseum stands last Saturday, watching
USC end eight years of frustration with a victory over UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   None of them burst into the victorious locker room and gave USC
coach Paul Hackett an oral commitment. But, the win as well as the
frantic postgame celebration on the Coliseum turf was certainly a
nice recruiting tool for the Trojan coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passion and energy level that existed after the game was
wonderful for the team,'' Hackett said. ``And it didn't hurt that
we had 25 recruits there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the USC locker room after the game included
offensive linemen Blair Jones of Newport Harbor, Travis Watkins of
San Diego Helix and Joe McGuire of Servite; defensive linemen
Nathan Goodson of Temescal Canyon, Steve Nevarrez of San Fernando
and Traison Lewis of Rancho Cucamonga; linebackers Amon Gordon of
San Diego Mira Mesa and A.J. Single of Bonita Vista; quarterback
Matt Cassell of Chatsworth;, running back Chris Howard of Banning,
and Brookside Christian teammates Willie Dixon and Jason Girley,
who are both receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game began, recruiting coordinator Larry Petroff took
Howard onto the field for a short conversation with Hackett. A few
of the Trojan players also stopped by to talk to Howard, who is a
recent USC commitment. Other commitments among the locker room
visitors were Lewis, McGuire, Cassell and Single.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance was former Los Alamitos defensive lineman
Sagan Atuatasi, a 1998 Trojan commitment, who is spending the
semester at Cypress College taking care of academic deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Southern California's most desired recruits Teyo
Johnson, Alex Holmes and Travis Johnson weren't at the game, but
each is slated to visit USC on Dec.3.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, a tight end from Harvard-Westlake, and Travis Johnson, a
defensive end from Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, were on a visit to
Michigan to watch a rivalry game of different stripes when the
Wolverines played Ohio State. And, San Diego Mira Mesa
football-basketball standout Teyo Johnson was in Palo Alto watching
his brother, Riall, and the Stanford Cardinal clinch a Rose Bowl
berth with a victory over Cal.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) The recruiting trail
</P>
<P>
   Former Capistrano Valley quarterback Austin Moherman is leaving
Ohio State after three seasons. Moherman, who began the season
fighting for the starting spot, could end up at Division I-AA
Northern Arizona. ... Arizona and Arizona State will battle on the
field next week with a bowl bid on the line. The teams also battled
for the services of offensive lineman Ralph Zarate, and the
Wildcats won. Zarate, a 6-foot-5, 305-pounder from Scottsdale
Community College, had committed to Arizona State out of high
school but changed his mind following two junior college seasons.
... Florida State could have another dependable kicker on the way
with the commitment of Tampa's Brett Cimorelli. The 6-foot-4,
220-pound Cimorelli, who is similar to current Seminole kicker
Sebastain Janikowski in size, has three kicks of 50 yards or longer
this season, and will also play baseball in college.

WARNER BROS. STUDIO SETS TO GRACE LAS VEGAS EATERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK -- In an offbeat use of its well-known name,
entertainment giant Warner Bros. is allowing the re-creation of
four studio sets in a restaurant that will open in Las Vegas in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The WB Stage 16 eatery will open at the Venetian casino, which
rolled out earlier this year, with a menu aimed at movie buffs and
upscale diners. The facility will include backdrops based on
soundstages for ``Gold Diggers of 1933,'' ``Casablanca,'' ``Ocean's
11'' and ``Batman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sets create a dramatic backdrop for an amazing dining
experience,'' said John Baydale, director of operations for the
restaurant, which will serve lobster and wild mushroom strudel
along with healthy doses of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, under which the studio has licensed its logo to
European sports/entertainment concern ENIC, gives Warner a low-risk
opportunity to try out the dining concept at one of the most
prominent new casinos in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is the first project to emerge from an alliance
announced in April 1998 between the studio and ENIC, under which
Warner sold an 80percent interest in its 10 Warner Studio Stores in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes three months after Warner announced a joint
marketing agreement with General Motors giving the automaker broad
access to the studio's properties, leading to a GM minivan bearing
WB and Bugs Bunny logos. It also said last week that it was
considering closing down some of the under-performing locations
among its 140 Studio Stores in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Batman'' section will include sound and lighting effects;
the ``Gold Diggers'' set will re-create the ``We're in the Money''
interior; the ``Casablanca'' set includes Rick's Cafe American; and
the ``Ocean's 11'' component will offer a re-creation of the lounge
of the Sands Hotel, which was blown up to make way for the
Venetian.
</P>
<P>
   Warner rival Walt Disney Co. experimented with a pair of themed
fast-food outlets in the early 1990s that closed after a few years.
Industry trackers believe its fledgling chain of themed ESPN Zone
restaurants has potential.

WHIRLWIND OF FACIAL SURGERY BY FOREIGN CHARITY LEAVES CHINESE
UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL with REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ ``I am the father of Patient 088, and I'd like to
express my gratitude but also say I am very dissatisfied,'' wrote
Zhao Kang in a letter to the Plastic Surgery Hospital in Beijing.
Instead of fixing his son's disfiguring cleft lip, as he had
wanted, the surgeons fixed the son's cleft palate, which had not
affected his speech and was not visible.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not Chinese surgeons the farmer was complaining
about. It was a team from the American charity Operation Smile, who
had raised the hopes of many parents like Zhao by bringing in
doctors and offering free surgery for children with cleft palates
and lips.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's son was among the 245 patients to be chosen, a great
stroke of fortune for a poor farmer who could never afford elective
surgery like this. Most emerged with the normal smile that is
promised by Operation Smile's name. But Zhao's son was among those
whose experience has raised serious questions, in China and in the
United States, about the program's practices.
</P>
<P>
   For the Zhao boy, the problem was the wrong operation; his lip
was only repaired, by Chinese doctors, after the Operation Smile
team left China. But there were many other and often more serious
problems when the 45 volunteers ended six frantic days of surgery,
in which they operated on 188 of the selected children. The
problems included heavy bleeding, repairs that split open, and even
the death of a patient that might have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that the operations were crude and hasty and the
surgical skill was _ dare I say _ below that of the surgeons
here,'' said Dr. Li Senkai, vice president of the hospital, China's
pre-eminent plastic surgery hospital, who was in charge of hosting
the group. The high-volume, ``assembly-line'' approach so worried
the hospital's honorary director, Song Ruyao, a well-known expert
on cleft lip and palate surgery, that he refused to come to work
after the first day of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admire and want to work with Dr. Magee and a project whose
spirit is so full of love and good will,'' said Li. ``But people
still have complaints and we have many ideas of how to improve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Magee, the plastic surgeon who founded Operation
Smile and serves as its chairman, said in a telephone interview in
Norfolk, Va., where the charity has its headquarters, that he had
no knowledge of the case involving Zhao's son. He said the charity
had not discussed the other problems with the Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Magee defended the quality of the care being provided. ``It is
not an assembly-line product,'' he said. ``It never has been.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Chinese doctors, when Operation Smile
departed, it volunteers left a famous but poor hospital with large
new debts, and its doctors with the task of following up
complications, redoing faulty operations, and calming some angry
families.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of the Plastic Surgery Hospital, an affiliate of
the Chinese Academy of Medicine, prompted the Ministry of Health to
convene a conference of directors from all six hospitals in China
that had hosted the charity over a decade, only to discover that
many had similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors agreed that Chinese hospitals should continue
working with Operation Smile and accepting its charity; one mission
went to Yunnan province earlier this month. But the meeting also
concluded that the charity should coordinate more with local
surgeons and be far more closely supervised by the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ensure the quality of treatment, the level of Operation
Smile's scientific knowledge and expertise should be improved,''
said a 1998 report by Chinese doctors who worked with Operation
Smile. ``Responsibility to the patient should come first. The
quality of the treatment should not be sacrificed to
self-promotion,'' said the report, which was made available to The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile said it had not seen the report. ``We have a
long, long history in China in many, many sites,'' said Magee, who
said he had not heard of any Health Ministry meeting or about any
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Cleft lips and palate deformities are relatively common in
China, especially in the countryside, where the condition may
result from marriage of close relatives as well as pollution, say
doctors. Having a cleft lip or palate is rarely life-threatening,
and corrective surgery is generally considered an elective
procedure _ although one that can greatly improve a child's
appearance and speech.
</P>
<P>
   Risks associated with the surgery are low, although they exist.
``In the United States it's extremely uncommon to lose a child, for
a child to die, from cleft lip or palate surgery,'' said Dr.
Marilyn Jones, the president of the American Cleft Palate and
Craniofacial Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Operation Smile has had 16 deaths during its history, three
of them in China. In Beijing a child died just after anesthesia was
induced, without proper monitoring. In the mid-'90s, two children
died during an Operation Smile mission in Shantou in southern
China, said Dr. Li Yu, a surgeon at the university hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   The Plastic Surgery Hospital in Beijing had never had a child
die during cleft lip or palate surgery until Operation Smile,
doctors there said. The hospital's staff was shaken by an egregious
error: Although the hospital possesses and requires the use of
modern equipment to monitor anesthesia during surgery, Operation
Smile decided not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw American-trained anesthesiologists using these
primitive methods, our impression was that they must have developed
these methods for use in remote rural areas,'' said the hospital's
professor of anesthesia. ``We would never use them here, and my
guess is that they would never be used at an American hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor said it is still not clear what killed the
3-year-old adopted boy, from rural Shaanxi Province, although he
said the child's heart was normal and that he suspected an
anesthesia overdose. He added that whatever the cause, a modern
monitoring system would have detected the problem long before the
child went into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, who was infertile and recently married for the
second time, had taken the extremely rare step in China of adopting
a handicapped child. She was devastated by his death, doctors said,
and, like several other patients, wanted to sue. Operation Smile
offered her the equivalent of about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said he did not know about any offer from the group but
said any gesture was well-meaning. ``Any distortion of that is
ludicrous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the death, the hospital directors shut down the Operation
Smile program for a day and then reluctantly allowed the charity to
re-start surgery, once full monitoring was assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is tragic,'' said Magee. Operation
Smile took several measures to improve safety after the Beijing
mission, as it does after all of its missions. ``We are constantly
improving the services we give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our respect for life and dignity is paramount,'' Magee said.
</P>
<P>
   But death in surgery can be unpredictable, and it is the high
rate of complications of Operation Smile in Beijing that stands
out.
</P>
<P>
   Always thinking big, Operation Smile had planned so many
surgeries during its brief stay in Beijing, that the Plastic
Surgery Hospital decided to provide its own staff for two of the
nine operating rooms to accommodate the overflow. Over five days,
Operation Smile did 188 operations in rooms 1 through 7; Chinese
doctors did 61 operations in rooms 8 and 9. The results were very
different.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study done at the hospital, of the 61 operations
with Chinese surgeons, only two caused any post-operative problems,
in both cases minor bleeding. But over 40 patients under the care
of Operation Smile had serious complications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the death, more than 30 children's palates split
open; suffered tissue death, or had other problems healing. Of
these, two children went into shock from massive bleeding and, in
the case of 6-month-old Wang Qing, nurses had to donate their own
blood for transfusions, since blood typing had not been performed.
The nurses were universal donors, and the girl was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical textbooks have never recorded such a high complication
rate for this surgery'' said Li of the Plastic Surgery Hospital.
``It is unacceptable from the perspective of both medicine and
modern society.'' And at the meeting called by the Health Ministry,
other hospitals, like the one in Zhaoqing, reported rates that were
higher still.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese doctors also complained that surgeons and
anesthesiologists from Operation Smile rarely saw their young
patients or the parents of the patients outside of the operating
room, creating a situation that led to mishaps like the wrong
surgery being performed on Zhao's son, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child has an examination by a surgeon before,'' said
Magee.
</P>
<P>
   Many surgeons at the hospital felt that Operation Smile failed
to deliver on important promises.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Plastic Surgery Hospital gladly emptied 6 normally
teeming wards to accommodate the program, scheduling little surgery
of their own during the visit. It seemed a worthy cause and an
opportunity to learn from foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. charity had promised the hospital professional and
highly qualified plastic surgeons. Instead the seven doctors it
sent proved to be mostly young, inexperienced and non-American,
according to the report the hospital compiled on the mission. In
addition to the two American surgeons, there was one each from
Colombia, Singapore, the Philippines, China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, hospital officials have calculated that its
association with the well-financed U.S. charity cost it over
$200,000 _ a small fortune to a struggling state hospital which,
despite modern equipment, still houses patients on metal cots in
crumbling wards.
</P>
<P>
   To complete more than 200 operations in such a short time, the
hospital had to call in its own staff to work overtime. After the
volunteers left, it was left to Chinese doctors to take care of the
patients and to re-operate on those like Zhao's son, who had
botched or unsatisfactory operations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated requests for more money, Operation Smile
reimbursed the hospital about $25,000. The hospital failed to meet
the next month's payroll. China's hospitals have lost much of their
state subsidies and have to rely on patient charges to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said he did not know about the specifics of the finances.
``We were there with hard-earned fund-raising dollars,'' he said,
and the vast majority of children were given a chance at a new
life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hospital's dozens of trained plastic surgeons hope
to collaborate again with Operation Smile, but on very different
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of delegation of 45, which included many
non-professionals, they would like to see a small team of experts,
who would teach their Chinese counterparts new techniques.
</P>
<P>
   They would also like some help with equipment purchases and
financial support for developing a permanent home-grown team of
Chinese surgeons who could offer free surgery themselves. They note
that the hospital surgeons already perform hundreds of cleft lips
and palate surgeries a year on paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Operation Smile can bring us information on
contemporary medical science and examples of good surgeons,'' Li
said, adding with characteristic Chinese politeness: ``To an
extent, our Chinese surgeons are also qualified to do such work.''

   ``A Century of Country: An Illustrated History of Country
Music''
</P>
<P>
   by Robert K. Oermann
</P>
<P>
   TV Books, by HarperCollins publishers
</P>
<P>
   320 pages, 200 color and black-and-white photos.
</P>
<P>
   $39.95 hardback
</P>
<P>
   Robert K. Oermann, veteran Nashville music journalist and
industry observer, is that rarest of all songbirds currently
nesting on Music Row: an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   More or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like more things than I don't,'' Oermann said during a
recent stopover in Arlington to promote his new book, ``A Century
of Country: An Illustrated History of Country Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually look forward to the millennium to see what's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be in direct contrast to the Chicken Little,
sky-is-falling mode currently gripping Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think country is going through an identity crisis right
now,'' he allowed, adding that the innovative artists who came up
10 years ago, such as Clint Black, Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson,
Vince Gill and Travis Tritt, have all peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of the Dixie Chicks and Shania, nobody's shining the
light on where to go next,'' he said. ``They're pursuing the
13-year-old market, and that's very short-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Oermann's coffee-table creation is, of course, a
Nashville-centric view of the genre, but he does deal with the
Texas and Oklahoma-led western swing and progressive country
movements.
</P>
<P>
   And he gives Milton Brown as much ink as Bob Wills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of goes from alpha to omega, with everything in
between,'' Oermann said.
</P>
<P>
   He includes topics such as the history of country songwriting
(no, it doesn't begin and end with Hank Williams) and country music
on television and in the movies (that's where you'll find Bob
Wills).
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly, he says, a collection of personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have packaged or invented a Jimmy Dickens or a
Willie Nelson,'' he said. ``That's the downfall of Music Row today:
They're trying to package that.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to Nashville 22 years ago, ``when it was still a small
town and country music was still a cottage industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Oermann said he was thrilled with the look of the book, which
includes rare photos from his collection and oddball artifacts such
as a Roy Acuff flour-sack doll, a Gene Autry picture puzzle, even a
Brooks &AMP; Dunn cornflakes box.
</P>
<P>
   The pop culture aspect ``didn't all start with Clint and
Garth,'' Oermann said. He traces modern country's origins to
vaudeville and Wild West shows, which, he pointed out, have always
been commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always try to give the culture the dignity it
deserves,'' he said. ``It's such a rich culture. I think if you
look at the richness of the culture, you don't get so depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He worries about young fans, who he says should be seeking out
the earlier country stars to gain ``a sense of rootedness. They
don't know who Lefty Frizzell was, or who Ray Price is.''
</P>
<P>
   Oermann's personal favorites are the Jimmie Rodgers-Carter
Family era of the '20s and early '30s, and Dolly Parton as an
interview (''to greet each day with such wit, grace and candor,
after 35 years,'' he enthuses).
</P>
<P>
   His personal quest? To find a 1923 silent newsreel of Fiddlin'
John Carson that was supposedly so compelling as to convince one
music industry pioneer that he should record him.
</P>
<P>
   Oermann will argue all day with those who question country music
as an art form, he said, because of the inherent musical honesty of
the artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what you get,'' he said. ``That's why these
people are artists. They say, `Here I am. I hope you like it.' An
entertainer says, `What do you want me to do, and I'll do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the higher profile of the business and recent corporate
takeovers of record company structure, there is less individual
vision now, he says, ``and then it becomes harder to turn the
Titanic around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's confused,'' Oermann said. ``Fans listen to the
radio and think, `That's not country.' It's very easy to get lost
in the moment and not see that those 20 records are not all that is
being produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Cajun, western swing, bluegrass and cowboy music are all popular
subgenres in their own right, Oermann says, and that will help save
country's soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a very diverse format, and it's still
diverse,'' he said. ``I have yet to meet the person who can't be
seduced by Jimmie Rodgers, or the person who can listen to Bob
Wills and not get it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Oermann chose to start the book with the first printed
use of the term ``hillbilly'' to denote country music (April 23,
1900, ``The New York Journal),'' a debatable jumping-off point but
a Nashville-friendly one.
</P>
<P>
   He concludes at the same spot, with a blunt Marty Stuart
observation that ``at the end of the day, we're (all) hillbilly
pickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not Shania.

EGYPTAIR INVESTIGATORS EXPLAIN WHY THEY SUSPECT RELIEF PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also AIRCRASH-PILOT)  
(js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators were drawn to Gameel el-Batouty, the
relief pilot they suspect of crashing EgyptAir Flight 990, not just
because of the reference to God that he made shortly before the
plane began its fatal dive but also because of the abrupt way he
took the co-pilot's seat a few minutes earlier, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty boarded the plane, a Boeing 757 with 217 people aboard,
as one of two relief pilots who were supposed to fly the plane much
later in the long flight from New York to Cairo, Egypt. Such crew
members normally spend the early part of a flight relaxing or
napping in the first-class section of the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   But a few minutes before the crash, Batouty replaced the
co-pilot by ``pulling rank'' on him, one investigator said. The
co-pilot was Adel Anwar, 36; Batouty, 59, was a more senior
aviator.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was in Arabic and three U.S. officials who
described it said they were relying on the translations and on the
tone of voice. ``He was using his stature,'' said one official, who
described Batouty as being ``very assertive.'' The official said
aviation investigators in the United States were surprised by the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official said that ``very insistent'' was a better
description than assertive.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the co-pilot switched places with Batouty,
investigators believe that the pilot, Ahmed el-Habashy, left the
cockpit, which left Batouty alone.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, which began with someone switching off the auto-pilot
and apparently putting the plane into a steep dive, came perhaps
five minutes after the Batouty switched places with the co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was neither the reference to God nor the
unusual change of seats that was the basis of their suspicion.
Rather, they said, it was those things plus their failure to find
any indication of a mechanical problem in the information on the
flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity. The
National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of the
investigation, has released limited information about the contents
of the tape.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the board has been taciturn is to avoid compromising
the inquiry. Investigators said release of the information about
Batouty has made it difficult to interview his family. And if past
accidents are any guide, officials said, they are still short of
some details and may find that some facts now in hand might be
wrong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators have not established, for example, at what point
in the flight the change in cabin crews was supposed to occur.
</P>
<P>
   They also have not established whether the captain and the
co-pilot were scheduled to be relieved at the same time, as is the
case for most U.S. carriers, or whether they would be replaced one
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The time of such a replacement is generally established at a
briefing before the crew boards the plane, according to aviation
experts, and any disagreement about the subject in flight is
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty also used a common Muslim phrase repeatedly in the
course of the dive, ``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' which can be translated
as ``I put my faith in God,'' or ``I entrust myself to God,'' but
Egyptian officials have objected to characterizing the utterance as
a prayer and say it need not indicate any intention.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators have characterized Batouty's action in
pushing his way into the co-pilot's seat as suspicious, safety
officials said they still did not have a complete picture of what
had happened or why. He could have waited until it was his turn to
fly and made the plane crash then, said one investigator, and at
that point might have been over deeper water and out of radar
range, which would have made finding the wreckage far more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a half hour out of New York's Kennedy
International Airport at the time of the crash and only about 60
miles from Nantucket Island, over less than 300 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   And the method of descent, pushing the nose down, may not have
been the fastest way to crash the plane, officials said; someone
bent on crashing from 33,000 feet could easily have banked the
plane until the wings were at a 90-degree angle to the horizon,
eliminating lift.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Egyptian official suggested in Cairo Wednesday that
an explosion, possibly in the tail section, caused the crash,
according to The Associated Press. U.S. investigators said no
evidence supports that theory.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term status of the tape from the cockpit voice recorder
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the safety board to release a transcript of the
recorder on the day it opens hearings. If no hearing is held, the
transcript would be released with the other information. But if the
safety board passed the case on to the FBI, as it has discussed,
then it would not release the transcript, although the FBI might.

HOLIDAY TRAFFIC IS EXPECTED TO SET A RECORD THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Those who helped people Wednesday get home
for the Thanksgiving holiday will have earned their dinner today.
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Association estimates that 33.8 million
people will travel over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, setting a
record _ with about 200,000 more travelers than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday normally is the busiest travel day of the Thanksgiving
weekend, and Kansas City International Airport was no exception.
Despite the bustle, airport and airline officials reported that
flight schedules generally stayed on time.
</P>
<P>
   Fog on the East Coast early Wednesday had only a minimal effect
on flights out of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terminals are pretty crazy with the big crowds, but the
weather's been great,'' said Erica Hupp, a spokeswoman for the
Kansas City Aviation Department. ``There were a few in the morning
for flights going to Newark, but that was earlier (Wednesday
morning). Everything else has been running pretty smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The most activity at KCI took place at the ticket counter and
gates of Southwest Airlines, which has the most daily departures of
all the carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our highest bookings ever in Kansas City'' on
Wednesday, said Jill Raines, Southwest's marketing manager. ``But
we have staffed accordingly, and the lines have moved quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines said Southwest had one fog-related delay at KCI on
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Airlines, which has the second-most flights at the
airport, also had a busy day. Rocky Spane, the carrier's president
and chief executive officer, even spent some time talking to
customers and checking in bags, said Rana Walker, a Vanguard
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had high levels of traffic, but everything seems to be
running smoothly,'' she said. ``We haven't seen a lot of delays.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's airports were busy, the majority of travelers
will get to their destination on the road. AAA estimates that 27.8
million people, or 82 percent of this weekend's travelers, will
travel using a personal vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking to the road will have to pay more for gasoline than
they did last year, according to a AAA survey. In Kansas City, the
average price of gasoline is $1.16 a gallon, up 28 cents from last
year's holiday period.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, higher prices have not deterred the nation's
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices are higher than last year, but you're still looking
at gasoline prices slightly lower than in 1996,'' said Mike Right,
a spokesman for AAA in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also noted that generally milder weather throughout
the country had prompted more people to drive to their destinations
this year.

UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INSTITUTE FORM ALLIANCE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The University of Kansas and the Midwest
Research Institute have formed an alliance to promote joint
research projects and other collaborative efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The KUMRI Alliance will focus on pharmaceuticals, biomedical
engineering and information technology, officials with the two
institutions said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given KU's strength in basic and clinical research and MRI's
expertise in applied research, this partnership is a great fit,''
KU Chancellor Robert Hemenway said in a news release. ``KUMRI will
be financially beneficial to both institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   James Spigarelli, MRI's chief operating officer, said the
alliance would break new ground in cooperative research between the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City-based Midwest Research Institute is an
independent, nonprofit organization that performs contract research
for business, industry and government.
</P>
<P>
   The KU-MRI collaboration is occurring amid heightened interest
in research and joint research projects in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that heightened interest has been generated by the
Stowers Institute for Medical Research, which is to begin work
about a year from now. Area leaders are looking to the Stowers
Institute as a catalyst to turn Kansas City into one of the
nation's top 10 biomedical research and development sites.
</P>
<P>
   KU and the University of Missouri-Kansas City recently announced
a joint initiative in life sciences research and education.
</P>
<P>
   KU and MRI have collaborated on clinical research projects
related to smoking cessation, cancer prevention, chemotherapy and
anti-estrogen drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the alliance include:
</P>
<P>
   - Promoting joint research projects and other collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   - Establishing a database of common capabilities for KU and MRI
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   - Coordinating seminars and other activities that promote
collaborations and the exchange of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   - Creating mechanisms to allow sharing of equipment and
services.
</P>
<P>
   - Creating joint appointments, internships and postdoctoral
fellowships.

ISRAEL EASES SECRECY OVER NUCLEAR WHISTLE-BLOWER'S TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government Wednesday allowed a newspaper
to publish censored excerpts from the classified transcript of a
treason trial of 12 years ago. They provided the first glimpse ever
into the courtroom where Mordechai Vanunu was convicted for blowing
the whistle on Israel's secret nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpts, published by the newspaper Yediot Ahronot,
contained no earth-shattering revelations about an infamous case
with a spy novel plot. But their release signaled the government's
increasing awareness that it can no longer maintain absolute
silence on whether it has nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney, avoiding a court challenge, pre-emptively
released more than 1,200 pages of censored testimony to the
newspaper, which had been fighting to obtain the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed since the trial, and it was decided by
defense officials that anything that will not harm the security of
the country will now be published,'' said Devora Hen, a lawyer for
the state attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Israel refuses to confirm or deny reports on its
nuclear weapons program, maintaining a long-held policy of what it
calls ``deliberate ambiguity'' about its offensive capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, citing what it said was a
classified U.S. Department of Energy study, said this fall that
Israel has the sixth-largest nuclear arsenal in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is an evolving understanding that a
long-term policy of complete secrecy is untenable and creates
whistle-blowers like Vanunu,'' said Avner Cohen, an Israeli scholar
whose book, ``Israel and the Bomb,'' was published last year in New
York. ``There is stuff that really should be classified, but not
the fact of the nuclear policy itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Cohen's study was initially banned in Israel, it was
recently approved for publication in Hebrew in Israel, another sign
of a relaxation of the government's strict secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Yediot Ahronot devoted almost 10 pages of its newspaper
Wednesday to the case, and it dominated the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed that Vanunu, a former nuclear technician,
testified in his closed-door trial that he had exposed Israel's
nuclear arms in an effort to force the government to acknowledge
its existence and accept international supervision of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to confirm what everyone knows,'' he said about the
information he sold to the Sunday Times of London in 1986. ``I
wanted to put the matter under proper supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanunu further testified that as a result of his revelations,
Shimon Peres, who was prime minister at the time the article was
published, could not ``keep lying to Reagan and telling him that we
do not have nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1986, the Sunday Times published Vanunu's claim
that Israel had stockpiled roughly 100 nuclear weapons. Vanunu, a
Moroccan-born Jew who grew up in a religious home, had worked at
the Dimona nuclear reactor for nine years before emigrating to
Australia and converting to Christianity. The newspaper paid him to
fly to London and collaborate on the story about Israel's nuclear
capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that Vanunu was in danger,'' Peter Hunam,
an English journalist for the Sunday Times, testified, according to
the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to move to another hotel, but I realized he was
exceedingly nervous and was talking about leaving London or the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   After his interviews with the newspaper, but before the story
was published, Vanunu was lured from London to Rome by a blond
female Mossad agent called ``Cindy.'' There he was kidnapped and
flown to Israel to stand trial as a spy and a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if they were going to shoot me or kill me,'' he
said about his abduction during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that the prosecution believed that it had the
authority to sentence Vanunu to death but refrained from requesting
this. In 1988, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison, where he has
served 13 years, mostly in solitary confinement. Only recently has
the government allowed even a photograph of him in jail to be
published.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, who is credited with organizing Israel's nuclear program
as a young aide to David Ben-Gurion, Wednesday denounced the
release of the transcripts for bringing to the surface a subject
that is best left suppressed.

   ``The public knows that there are certain things it does not
want to know,'' he said in an interview with Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, on Israel radio, Peres said, ``The whole
Vanunu affair makes my blood boil. One day a man gets up in the
morning and he decides what is good for the country. Does he carry
the responsibility?''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Yediot Ahronot reported, Peres said that he
believed that the revelations in the Sunday Times had injured
Israel, increasing ``beyond what is desirable, suspicions and
reservations about Israel.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vanunu's detailed allegations about the scope and sophistication
of Israel's nuclear weapons program have never been challenged by
Israeli officials or by knowledgeable Israeli civilian defense
experts. Independent assessments by international arms-monitoring
organizations have also concluded that Israel's nuclear stockpile
is exceeded only by those of the United States, Russia, China,
France and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Israelis have long maintained that Vanunu's
revelations accelerated Arab nuclear projects. ``I do not believe
this,'' he said, ``even though in my opinion Vanunu had a serious
effect on the Arab press and attention to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not Mordechai Vanunu who caused the Iraqi nuclear
program to move fast,'' Cohen continued. ``It was an Iraqi decision
following Israel's bombing of its nuclear reactor in 1981.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Moshe Dayan, then the defense minister, said publicly
that Israel had no active ``atomic bombs'' but had the capacity to
assemble weapons for attack in short order.

Wednesday. It's going to be a long vacation. She quit.

   She was at a point where she neither wanted nor needed to work
full-time any more. She would have relished working part-time, but
the budget didn't have a slot for that.
</P>
<P>
   On the day her departure notice went on the office bulletin
board, the November-December newsletter came from the Association
of Part-Time Professionals. It had related news about the struggle
to balance personal priorities and work.

<P>
   The organization, established 20 years ago ``to promote and
facilitate part-time and related flexible work alternatives,'' is
closing its doors at the end of the year.

   The national association, based in Falls Church, Va., tried
unsuccessfully to find another group to assume the Part-Time

TO COUNTER CRITICS, CIA RELEASES REPORTS FROM END OF THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ After enduring a decade of
second-guessing over whether it failed to detect communism's
impending demise, the CIA is still a bit defensive about its
performance in the waning years of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But when the desire to set the historical record straight led
the agency to co-sponsor a conference on the subject with the
George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&AMP;M
University last weekend, the agency tried hard to produce a
celebration of an intelligence victory. It even declassified 24
intelligence reports from the years 1988 to 1991 as proof that its
assessments were more accurate than the critics have said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conference could not ignore the harsh truth that some
criticism of the CIA's Cold War reporting was well founded. In
fact, its forecasts in the late '70s and early '80s were sometimes
far off.
</P>
<P>
   Although the CIA began to detect signs of stagnation in the late
'70s, it continued for years to overstate significantly the size
and growth rate of the Soviet economy. The agency also badly
understated the burden that military spending was placing on the
Soviet economy and refused for years to accept evidence that Soviet
production of nuclear missiles was not growing as rapidly as
Washington had expected.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, for example, an outside panel of economists found that
although the agency believed that the Soviet economy was about half
the size of the U.S. economy, the gross domestic product was no
more than 30 percent of the U.S. output.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wolf, an economist at the RAND Corp. who was on the
panel, recalled that the agency's estimates of the Soviet Union's
annual economic growth were also significantly overstated, while
its estimates of the economic burden of military spending were too
low.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas MacEachin, who headed the office of Soviet analysis in
the '80s, acknowledged that the agency had moved too slowly to
adjust its projections of military and strategic forces to reflect
the worsening economic conditions. The projections of large
increases in producing ballistic missiles, MacEachin said, were
consistently too high until the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gates, a former director of Central Intelligence, agreed,
saying, ``During the mid-'80s, our projections of Soviet strategic
forces were clearly too high.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the overly hawkish forecasts of the missile buildup in
the early '80s represented a bureaucratic response to intense
pressure from the Reagan administration, which had called the
Soviet Union an ``evil empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the estimates also stemmed from a natural inclination among
experts to expect the Soviets to continue to act as they had in the
past. The Soviets built up their strategic forces more quickly than
the CIA had anticipated in the late '60s and early '70s, and the
agency expected that rapid pace to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA did report accurately the growing signs of an economic
slowdown in the late '70s and early '80s. But such reports were not
welcome at the White House, said former intelligence officials who
were at the conference. Some current and former intelligence
officials recalled how the Reagan administration was furious with
one report suggesting that Soviet military spending had turned flat
in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw it as challenging the central thrust of their policy,
a big U.S. defense buildup,'' recalled one former intelligence
official who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '80s, the CIA did accurately portray the growing
instability in the Soviet Union, and it did so earlier and more
clearly than the critics have suggested, a review of the newly
declassified intelligence reports shows.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1988, a national intelligence estimate,
``Gorbachev's Economic Problems: The Challenges Ahead,'' said that
Soviet President Mikhail ``Gorbachev's efforts at reviving the
Soviet economy will produce no substantial improvement over the
next five years, although his efforts to raise consumer welfare
could achieve some modest results. Soviet attempts to raise
technology levels will not narrow the gap with the West in most
sectors during the remainder of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1989, two months before the fall of the Berlin
Wall, an intelligence assessment by the office of Soviet analysis
at the CIA predicted: ``The unrest that has punctuated Gorbachev's
rule is not a transient phenomenon. Conditions are likely to lead
in the foreseeable future to continuing crises and instability on
an even larger scale in the form of mass demonstrations, strikes,
violence and, perhaps, even the localized emergence of parallel
centers of power.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1991, months before the unsuccessful coup against
Gorbachev in August, an agency paper, ``The Soviet Cauldron,''
warned that ``explosive events have become increasingly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On the espionage front, the record was also mixed until the
final years of the Cold War. The fears of the agency's longtime
counterintelligence chief, James Jesus Angleton, who believed that
every Soviet defector was a double agent, paralyzed operations
until the 70's, when the agency finally began to recruit important
agents in the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries.

SPRINT SCRAPS PLAN FOR ITS OWN DIGITAL-AGE TELEPHONE SWITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Sprint Corp. has scrapped a pioneering project to
develop its own digital-age telephone switches, part of a $500
million initiative to revamp its network and replace the
100-year-old technology that it uses to route long-distance voice
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Employees on the project, who asked not to be identified because
of future employment prospects, said they were frustrated by the
move. They think it represents the first casualty of the company's
planned merger with MCI WorldCom, a move that could presage the
loss of the company's culture of technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors who worked on parts of the project also expressed
disappointment and said they would carry on their work despite
Sprint's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain confident that next-generation switching ... will be
the vehicle by which carriers migrate from today's circuit-switched
world to a new public network,'' said Brian Jackman, president of
global products and technologies at Tellabs Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint officials say the company simply had lost its early lead
in developing the technology and plans to buy packet switches from
vendors instead of developing its own.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to license the proprietary technology it
developed during the project to vendors such as Cisco Systems. Most
employees will be reassigned, the company said, and the contractors
involved will have the chance to work on other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, a team of 120 Sprint employees and contractors
working in conjunction with at least two vendors _ Cisco and
Tellabs _ had spent the better part of three years developing the
telephone switch, the JCS 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Named after the engineer who developed the idea, Joe Christie's
System 2000 was designed to route voice calls over the company's
fiberoptic network in the same fashion as data _ in bursts of
fixed-length digital cells, or packets _ using a technology known
as asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Packet switching, which allows many calls to share the same
path, uses network capacity far more efficiently than traditional
circuit switching, which opens up a dedicated circuit between
callers for the duration of a call.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint made much ado about the JCS 2000 when announcing its
Integrated On-Demand Network in June 1998. The company boasted that
``packetized'' voice traffic would allow it to generate almost
unlimited capacity in its network; eliminate its reliance on older,
overpriced circuit switches; and reduce the cost of carrying a
long-distance call by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, it downplayed the significance of the switch in its
plans and said there were other solutions that would allow it to
accomplish the same goals.
</P>
<P>
   They also stressed that the decision to abandon the JCS 2000
would not delay the deployment of the Integrated On-Demand Network,
a service that will bundle local, long-distance and data on the
same connection to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going back to the old model,'' said Russ Robinson, a
Sprint spokesman, ``but we are abandoning this development
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Migrating to a purely packet-switched network is still Sprint's
plan, Robinson said. Indeed, all carriers have such plans as they
cope with exploding amounts of data traffic generated by the
Internet and try to deliver integrated communications services to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But given an anticipated surge in voice traffic next year,
Sprint will continue to rely on and buy the workhorse circuit
switches it has traditionally used from Nortel Networks, known as
the DMS 250.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're projecting a pretty significant increase in voice
traffic next year,'' Robinson said. ``Nortel switches will be in
place longer than we thought because of the growth in voice
traffic. We need the DMS 250. The data switches weren't there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the decision made sense in light of the merger
with MCI WorldCom, as it would be easier to meld networks with
similar architectures than one based on packet switching and
another on circuit switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that if you look down the road, this could make our
network more compatible with theirs, but this was not a merger
decision,'' Robinson said. ``We're not at the point of merging
networks yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the move would not involve any write-offs, as much
of the technology developed in JCS 2000 would ultimately be
deployed in the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a marketing tragedy than an engineering
tragedy,'' said Maribel Lopez, an analyst with Forrester Research.
``They spent so long pushing the ION vision'' with their own
switches.

MAYOR OF MISSOURI TOWN PLEADS GUILTY IN SEX, BRIBERY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and ED FLETCHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The 68-year-old mayor of tiny Reeds Spring,
Mo., pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to bringing a
15-year-old girl across state lines for illegal sex and then paying
thousands of dollars in bribes to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in prison blaze orange, but without his trademark
toupee, Joe Dan Dwyer confessed to nine felony counts that stemmed
from a sexual encounter he had with a Manhattan, Kan., girl in a
St. Louis motel room in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he provided money and paid for a shopping trip to
Neiman Marcus as a reward to the girl and his 25-year-old friend
who drove the girl from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guilty, sir,'' Dwyer told U.S. District Judge Ortrie
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers have agreed to ask Smith to
sentence Dwyer to seven years in prison. Smith, who is not bound by
that recommendation, set Dwyer's sentencing for April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Laird, the woman who drove the girl from Kansas, pleaded
guilty earlier this week to accepting more than $20,000 from Dwyer
in exchange for a promise to testify falsely on his behalf
regarding the sex case.
</P>
<P>
   Following Dwyer's hearing, a second woman, Dorothy Shipley,
pleaded guilty to helping him find other women whom he offered
thousands of dollars to testify on his behalf after his initial
indictment on the sex charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley acknowledged setting up a meeting just after Dwyer was
indicted in the sex case in January 1999 at which he discussed the
need to find witnesses willing to give false statements and
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Dwyer said he needed help and that he would take care of
people to get that help,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Katharine
Fincham, summarizing the government's case. ``He said he needed
adults to testify on his behalf since most of the witnesses against
him at the time were juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fincham urged Smith to accept the guilty pleas. She noted that
if Dwyer went to trial, she would call several girls to testify,
and the prosecutor wanted to avoid subjecting them to that
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As word of their mayor's guilty plea trickled back to Reeds
Spring, a town of 411 about 30 miles south of Springfield, reaction
varied from disbelief to a realization the town needs to make new
plans for its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is time to find a new mayor if he is guilty of this
stuff,'' said Doug Patrick, co-owner of Bass Pro Shop. ``We can't
have a mayor who's a convicted felon.''
</P>
<P>
   City Clerk Kacee Anderson, who has managed the city's day-to-day
business in the mayor's absence, was saddened and shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pled guilty to these things?'' she asked. ``Are you sure he
wasn't coerced into pleading guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   During his hearing, Dwyer assured the judge that no one had
coerced or threatened him to plead guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Meeker, owner of the Spring House doll shop, said attempts
by Dwyer's lawyers in pretrial hearings to suppress evidence
gradually convinced her there might be some truth behind the
accusations. Still, she said, people there wanted to believe that
someone who did a lot for Reeds Spring was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong hearing, Dwyer spoke in a firm, courtly
voice and praised his defense lawyers _ James Wyrsch, Charles
Rogers and David Kelly. They fought to bar prosecutors from using
tape recordings of phone calls in which Dwyer offered witnesses
money for favorable testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are the most outstanding attorneys in all of
America,'' Dwyer said. ``They're perfect. I'm very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Dwyer's behavior first surfaced in August 1998
when authorities raided his home and carted off several cases
filled with sexually explicit videotapes and sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted Dwyer and Laird in January on the
sex case, and he was released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a second grand jury issued a new indictment that
accused Dwyer and Shipley of obstruction of justice, including
offering money to the 15-year-old victim and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   A magistrate then revoked Dwyer's bond, putting him in federal
custody pending trial.

CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG IS LOSING MORE BATTLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Md., Va., Ala.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It may not be as bad as the winter of 1865, but this
year has not been kind to the Sons of Confederate Veterans and
their desperate defense of their ancestors' most beloved emblems.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
Statehouse has been under renewed siege for months, this time by
the combined forces of the NAACP and the state Chamber of Commerce.
A portrait of Robert E. Lee was removed from Richmond's centerpiece
Canal Walk in June after a black councilman objected. Virginia and
Tennessee refused to allow the Sons' logo, which includes the
battle flag, on personalized license plates, and Oklahoma would not
fly the flag on a history plaza in Oklahoma City. A character in a
new Tom Clancy novel, of all places, equates the group with the Ku
Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   But what may have been the most piercing blow of all came
earlier this month, when the Adam's Mark hotel chain told the Sons
of Confederate Veterans not to schedule any more meetings at its
hotels, which rise above 12 Southern cities. The company's chief
executive said the Sons' displays of the Confederate battle flag
were excessive, and offensive to the largely black service staff at
the hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear the flag on their T-shirts, and they put it in their
windows,'' said Fred Kummer, chief executive of the 21-hotel chain
and of its parent, HBE Corp., based in St. Louis. ``They tried to
get us to fly it on our flagpole. You know, we operate mostly in
urban areas, and we have a large number of Afro-Americans who work
in our hotels. For them, it's like waving a red cloth in front of a
bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Kummer's decision has infuriated the Sons, many of whom resent
any notion that the very existence of a group like theirs is a
belligerent tribute to the era of slavery. Leaders of the
organization, which has about 27,000 members around the country,
say their intention is to honor their fallen ancestors and preserve
a memory of Confederate gallantry. But they admit to a certain
weariness at their many fallen ramparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like things are really stepping up against us,''
said Collin G. Pulley Jr., a furniture salesman in Courtland, Va.,
who leads the organization's Heritage Defense Committee. ``These
groups like the NAACP want to destroy everything Confederate, from
the flags to the monuments on courthouse lawns. I guess it's
because the lot of black people in this country has improved so
much in the last 30 years that now they need something else to keep
themselves occupied, and keep their organizations in the
forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulley, who is in charge of keeping track of what the group
calls ``heritage violations,'' has been busy maintaining lists of
insults to the battle flag and the Confederacy's reputation and
posting them on the Sons' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes any number of instances in which schools have
disciplined students for wearing Confederate insignia; an order by
Coast Guard officials in Elizabeth City, N.C., that employees
remove Confederate decals and bumper stickers from their cars, and
one incident described as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``The SCV camp in Tazewell, Va., recently placed a wreath and a
small flag at the Confederate monument by the courthouse, but the
circuit court judge took it upon himself to remove the decorations.
The Virginia Division heritage coordinator is currently
investigating the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which says its membership tends to grow with each
such incident, is planning a large march around the South Carolina
Statehouse on Jan. 8 and has organized a postcard protest campaign
directed at Penguin Putnam, the publishers of the Tom Clancy novel,
``Hidden Agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also obtained the help of the Rutherford Institute, a
conservative advocacy group, in a drive to change the decision on
the Virginia license tags. (Similar efforts were successful in
Maryland and North Carolina.) Of course it is telling its members
not to spend a dime at any Adam's Mark hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't appreciate being painted as a troublesome
organization,'' said the group's commander in chief, Patrick J.
Griffin III, a general contractor in Darnstown, Md. ``The symbols
we use are well known, and it's unfortunate there are racist groups
out there that misuse them. We are not anti-African-American or
anything like that. But we do honor the people who suffered and
died under that banner for what they believed, which was Southern
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kummer, of Adam's Mark, said he made his decision after some 500
members of the group's Alabama chapter met in September in Mobile,
the third time the Sons had gathered at any of the company's
hotels. There were so many displays of the battle flag, he said,
that many hotel employees refused to serve the group, and some
called in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the environment was respectful of our
employees,'' he said. ``They didn't feel they could provide service
to the guests. So we had managers all over the hotel making beds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while there were some minor confrontations during
the meeting, it was the overall atmosphere that led to his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who attended the Mobile meeting, said his group was a
victim of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that those employees work in a service
industry, and if they don't find everything to their personal
liking, they should just take a deep breath and carry on,'' he
said. ``There was nothing that occurred in Mobile that would have
caused any employee any concern. But I guess Kummer has a problem
with any group his employees don't like. Things must be different
with the politically-correct crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Sons say, there are plenty of other hotels
where they can meet, and they will continue trying to eke out small
victories. The credit card used by the members _ which was at first
mistakenly printed with the American flag _ now sports the Rebel
banner. The town of Rosa, Ala., population 149, has agreed to fly
the battle flag three times a year. Two weeks ago, after months of
hand-wringing and debate, the Richmond City Council voted to
restore Lee's portrait to the Canal Walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe they went after Robert E. Lee?'' Pulley said
with a sigh of exasperation. ``Well, at least we've got him back.''

   Soraya had always been one of the beautiful people. The kind
with money, who had nothing to worry about in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Iranian Revolution of 1979 racked her land, and she
found herself in the United States _ broke, ashamed and hurting.
</P>
<P>
   But she found Jesus, and now none of those material things
matters to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of problems and difficulties in my life, but I am
truly happy,'' said Soraya, whose full name has not been used for
privacy reasons. ``I really feel like my desires have changed
completely. I'm not interested in the way I had. I put everything
on his shoulders and let him show me the way ... because I failed
in whatever I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her 17-year-old son are the only members of her family
who believe in Christ. But she said that while growing up she had
always received positive messages about Christians, even in a
country that preached a negative message about Christianity. Her
father always talked highly about Christians, and it planted a seed
in her heart, she said. Before her father died in 1982, he told
Soraya he was no longer a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Soraya's journey to Christianity began with the Iranian
Revolution. Until then her family, born into Islam, had not been
devout. But after the revolution, Islam became a more dominant
force in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Soraya says she didn't like the way she saw women being treated,
and she didn't see compassion or love in the traditions. It was
inconsistent with the God she had been taught about.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is fair for Christian people,'' she said. ``They are
equal, but in Muslim world, God discriminates against people.''
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing Iran and briefly living in England, Soraya moved
in 1985 to Rockwall, Texas, where she lived with a sister. While
she was there, a woman from Church on the Rock knocked on Soraya's
door one day, inviting her to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, she was at Bible study. As she studied the
Bible, she said, she began to see a new way. Immediately she saw
changes in herself. She discovered sins she hadn't known were sins,
and she began to live to serve God, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult aspect of becoming a Christian has been
accepting Jesus as her savior, she said. As a Muslim, she believed
that Jesus was a prophet. But the more she read the Bible and the
more she attended church, the more she opened her heart to the
concept of Jesus as her savior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But other things have been difficult, as well. There was a time
when Soraya's mother refused to have a relationship with her
because of her conversion. Her mother visited in 1996, but for two
months would not talk to her, Soraya said. But then, while Soraya's
mother was in the hospital awaiting a difficult surgery, Soraya's
constant prayers broke down the barrier. Soraya said she begged her
mother to accept Christ. Her mother never made that leap, but she
did accept her daughter into her life again.
</P>
<P>
   And Soraya, a Dallas loan officer, says she feels fortunate
because her husband has not discouraged her in her faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees the changes, but he's so stubborn he doesn't want to
admit they come from Christianity,'' she said. ``Because of those
changes, he doesn't want to stop me from going.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 10 years after accepting Jesus, Soraya has never
regretted her conversion. She attends an Iranian Church in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy. Every day, that's my first thing when I open my
eyes,'' she said. ``I'm glad that I know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she only wishes she could spread the Gospel in her
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of wishes for my country when the door opens,''
she said. ``They are really hungry. This is the best time for
Iranian people to hear the Gospel, because they really are hungry,
thirsty and ready for the Gospel.''

SPREWELL IS FINED $10,000 BY THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Clarifies reference to Sprewell being unable to appeal) 
(jt)

<P>
   The National Basketball Association all but ordered Latrell
Sprewell to wash his mouth out with soap by fining him $10,000
Wednesday for directing profanity toward fans during his emotional
return to Golden State in Oakland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was traveling to New York from Los Angeles on Wednesday
with the Knicks after their five-game road trip and was unavailable
for comment. Because the fine was less than $25,000, Sprewell will
not be able to appeal On Tuesday Sprewell said he was surprised by
a morning phone call from a league security official asking him
about the obscenities he shouted toward his hecklers at the Arena
in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have dialogue with the fans,'' Sprewell said,
explaining his actions. ``I think because it was Golden State,
there was the hype about me and P.J. Carlesimo and a bigger focus
on the game. That made it more of an issue. But I like talking to
the fans. I'm not the type to back down from that. Frankly, I think
the fans like that back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, the league's vice president of basketball operations,
reviewed Sprewell's conduct during the game and determined that the
Knicks' impulsive guard went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game even began, Sprewell confronted a detractor and
used profanity to tell the man to ``shut up.'' During the game,
when three men sitting in corner court-side seats were chiding
Sprewell for his attack on Carlesimo, then his coach, two years
ago, Sprewell used more obscene language to address them. Near the
end of the game, Sprewell could be seen shouting profanities into
the air as he left the court during a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really recall saying that much, except to the three
guys in the corner,'' Sprewell said. When asked what the league's
intentions were in investigating the incident, Sprewell, who was
suspended by Commissioner David Stern after choking Carlesimo, said
if he was being used as an example, ``it wouldn't be the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sprewell is not the first player to be fined $10,000 for
directing profanity at fans, which is a violation of the league's
code of conduct. In April 1998, Houston's Charles Barkley was fined
the same amount for directing obscene gestures and profanity at a
Utah fan in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Sprewell has been financially punished on
several occasions. In 1997, he lost $6 million because of his
four-month suspension after choking Carlesimo. Last season, after
critical comments made by his agent, he was fined $25,000 by the
Knicks, although that fine was later rescinded by the team.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the team fined him $130,000, which included a
penalty for missing training camp and a one-game suspension for the
first game of the preseason. Throughout this past week, Coach Jeff
Van Gundy has defended Sprewell's response during the Golden State
game and blamed the escalated tension on unruly fans.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks General Manager Scott Layden issued a statement
Wednesday, saying: ``The league investigated the situation and felt
it necessary to fine Latrell. The league is objective; it made a
decision that should bring closure to an emotional situation.''

FAMILY THAT LOST CHILD TO ASTHMA FOUND OUT ABOUT HELP TOO LATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARTELLARO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ Pupils at Benton Elementary School in
Independence are approaching the holidays with an empty space in
their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a space that once was filled by the second-grader her
teacher called ``the perfect student'' _ the bright, happy little
girl who was always willing to help and never complained about the
chronic disease that eventually took her life.
</P>
<P>
   Joslynne Clark, 8, died this month of asthma, leaving her family
and friends in sorrow, shock and pain. Her hard work in school and
at home, her uncomplaining nature and the devotion to others that
made her ``everybody's best friend'' showed that Joslynne was
anything but typical.
</P>
<P>
   But as a child from an urban family that has struggled
financially, she was in a sense a typical victim of asthma _ a
disease that does not subscribe to the belief that all children are
created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma rates are highest in low-income urban neighborhoods,
experts in the field agree. Many suspect that urban neighborhoods
present the greatest exposure to substances that can trigger the
disease _ dust, smoke, air pollutants and latex particles from car
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Joslynne and her mother, Michelle Clark, were uninsured. They
had been on Medicaid intermittently for years, but lately the
family had been taking in just enough money to prevent qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The family was able to get medical care for Joslynne through a
public hospital, and she had a breathing machine that administered
medication at home. But in the early morning hours of Nov. 10, as
Joslynne struggled for breath, asthma claimed another life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went into an attack, and she just went,'' Clark said. ``I
called 911, but I think she was gone by the time they got here. Her
lips were blue. They said she died at the hospital but....''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the child's death that Clark learned about the
additional help for asthma patients available through the Greater
Kansas City chapter of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The local chapter of the asthma foundation has programs designed
to help disadvantaged patients get the medications and equipment
they need, said Noel Albert, executive director of the chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prescription assistance programs. We have free
breathing machines,'' Albert said. ``It breaks my heart when I hear
that people don't know that we have these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wald, a physician and asthma allergy specialist, serves
on the national and local chapter boards of directors of the asthma
foundation. He said that 7 percent to 10 percent of the Greater
Kansas City population suffers asthma, which causes about 50 local
deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often don't know the resources that exist in the
community that they can turn to,'' Wald said. ``Most pharmaceutical
companies have a program under which they provide free medications
to the poor, and doctors know how to access that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wald said the most important sign for asthmatics to watch for
was the time period of relief given by a bronchodilator drug, such
as albuterol. If a dose does not provide four full hours of relief,
he said, it is a sign that the disease is in a severe stage, and
the patient should see a doctor or visit an emergency room right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 5,000 deaths (nationally) a year from
asthma,'' Wald said. ``The deaths are increasing despite more and
better medications for asthma.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of those deaths is leaving a very large mark at Benton
Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Deena Graham, Joslynne's second-grade teacher, said the little
girl was impressive in the way she handled her illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even know she was sick, because she wouldn't
complain,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always was willing to help her peers,'' said Graham, who
often asked Joslynne to help explain concepts to other pupils.
``She could be a peer who could give a peer's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everybody would say she was their best friend.
Everybody loved her. ... Life is not the same around here for our
class.''

SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS QUESTION SAFETY OF LEADING ANTI-AIDS DRUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Stirring a furor among doctors and
researchers who treat patients infected with the virus that causes
AIDS, government officials here have been questioning the safety of
the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT, saying they suspect it may be too
dangerous to justify its use.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week to the National Assembly, Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said that the drug might be toxic and
cause some forms of cancer. ``This is a very serious finding,'' she
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments echoed the concerns of President Thabo Mbeki, who
last month requested a safety review of the drug, which has been
approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in the United
States and by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a large volume of scientific literature alleging
that, among other things, the toxicity of this drug is such that it
is in fact a danger to health,'' Mbeki said in a speech to
provincial leaders. ``These are matters of great concern to the
government as it would be irresponsible for us not to heed the dire
warnings which medical researchers have been making.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements have touched off a flurry of protests from
doctors and groups and individuals concerned about AIDS in this
country, which has one of the world's highest rates of infection
with HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS experts say concerns about the safety of AZT, particularly
for children, have been raised in the United States. One study, for
instance, found that pregnant mice treated with AZT gave birth to
babies with tumors. The relevance for humans is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing the mouse studies and others like it, the
National Institutes of Health determined in 1997 that the benefits
of the drug far outweigh the potential side effects.
</P>
<P>
   AZT is used to treat people infected with HIV and has been
particularly effective in reducing the transmission of the virus
from pregnant women to their unborn babies. One two-year study
found that a short course of AZT treatment administered to women
who did not breast-feed their babies reduced transmission of the
virus by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is toxicity, but this is not a sweet, this is a drug,''
said Dr. Joseph Perriens, who heads the care and support program of
the U.N.'s AIDS program in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``To combat a fatal disease, it is perfectly acceptable to use
drugs slightly more toxic than an aspirin,'' he said. ``AZT is a
valuable therapeutic drug. Its efficacy is a very important
consideration and needs to be taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, advocates for AIDS patients and executives from the
drug company that produces AZT, Glaxo Wellcome, have urged the
government to review the scientific literature. The government,
which has vowed to battle AIDS aggressively, has promised that it
will make such a review.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tshabalala-Msimang said even if AZT proves to be safe,
it is too expensive to distribute. An estimated 3.6 million of
South Afric's 44 million people are infected with HIV. Treating all
those people with AZT would cost the government 10 times what it
currently spends on health care for the nation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the government is also looking into a new anti-AIDS
drug, which researchers say is less costly and markedly more
effective than AZT in reducing mother-to-child transmission. The
cost for two doses of the new drug, nevirapine, is about $4,
compared with $268 for the AZT regimen now used in developing
countries and $815 for the much longer and more complicated course
used in the United States and other developed countries.

SHOPPING CENTER PREPARES TO USHER IN HOLIDAY SEASON WITH CEREMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In November 1929, the country was reeling
from the recent stock market crash and President Herbert Hoover was
trying to assure Americans that prosperity was just around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   But on the fledgling Country Club Plaza, things already were
looking a little brighter. For the first time, merchants lighted
every Spanish tower and balcony with sparkling colored lights. A
year later the first formal ceremony was held.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the 70th Plaza lighting ceremony is expected to
draw more than 250,000 people and be seen around the world on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   George and Leslie Brett, along with their children, will flip
the switch at 7:30 p.m., turning on 200,000 jewel-colored lights.
The lights will glow nightly until mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, the Plaza had only five buildings. Now more than 75
miles of lights are strung on the Plaza's 14 city blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting ceremony kicks off the holiday season for many area
residents. During the seasonal boomlet of consumer spending, the
Plaza lights offer an extra attraction for area businesses and a
public relations windfall for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds to the stature of the city; it gives a cosmopolitan
feel,'' said Ken McCormack, vice president of Halls. ``What the
arch is to St. Louis, the bridge is to San Francisco, the Plaza
lights are to Kansas City. It is something that is noted
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of the Plaza lights are in virtually every publication
about Kansas City, said Pete Levi, president of the Greater Kansas
City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an image of being very alive and different from
other cities,'' Levi said. ``Shoppers come from all over the
Midwest, if not the country, boosting the economy of Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddad Restaurant Group said the fourth quarter was always the
strongest for the company's Plaza restaurants, which include Plaza
III and Fedora Cafe &AMP; Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see double-digit increases,'' said Bruce Campbell, director
of marketing and purchasing for Haddad. ``More and more people are
coming down _ large groups of families, business cocktail parties,
holiday parties. The lights definitely bring people down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the lighting ceremony, Campbell said,
families often come down for dinner and then head out for holiday
shopping. Every year, one group of 15 or so women meets for
cocktails at Fedora and draws names for gifts. Each woman then
spends an hour buying a gift for the friend she picked and returns
to Fedora for dinner and the gift exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Raphael Hotel also has its best month of the year in
December, about 20 percent higher in revenue than other months.
Almost every one of the 123 rooms are booked. Some customers have
made the lighting ceremony an annual event for more than 25 years,
and they book rooms a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum continues through the holidays; it continues as
long as the lights are on,'' said Beth Morrison, executive director
of the Plaza Merchants Association. ``All the hotels fill up.
People are dining, shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pottery Barn notes a large increase in evening shoppers
during December as people come to enjoy the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hoffman, co-owner of Panache Chocolatier, said her Plaza
shop did one-third of its annual business during December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights are a real draw for people from all over the city
and from a five-state area,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza lights also give Kansas City two distinct tourist
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to have the summer and the holidays, and a
pivotal part of that is the Plaza,'' said Maxine Odell of the
Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Kansas City. ``We get
6,000 motor coach tours a year, and a good portion of those come in
December.''

EGYPTAIR INVESTIGATORS EXPLAIN WHY THEY SUSPECT RELIEF PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2nd graf to correct Boeing 757 to Boeing 767)  
 (See also AIRCRASH-PILOT)  
(js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators were drawn to Gameel el-Batouty, the
relief pilot they suspect of crashing EgyptAir Flight 990, not just
because of the reference to God that he made shortly before the
plane began its fatal dive but also because of the abrupt way he
took the co-pilot's seat a few minutes earlier, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty boarded the plane, a Boeing 767 with 217 people aboard,
as one of two relief pilots who were supposed to fly the plane much
later in the long flight from New York to Cairo, Egypt. Such crew
members normally spend the early part of a flight relaxing or
napping in the first-class section of the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   But a few minutes before the crash, Batouty replaced the
co-pilot by ``pulling rank'' on him, one investigator said. The
co-pilot was Adel Anwar, 36; Batouty, 59, was a more senior
aviator.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was in Arabic and three U.S. officials who
described it said they were relying on the translations and on the
tone of voice. ``He was using his stature,'' said one official, who
described Batouty as being ``very assertive.'' The official said
aviation investigators in the United States were surprised by the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official said that ``very insistent'' was a better
description than assertive.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the co-pilot switched places with Batouty,
investigators believe that the pilot, Ahmed el-Habashy, left the
cockpit, which left Batouty alone.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, which began with someone switching off the auto-pilot
and apparently putting the plane into a steep dive, came perhaps
five minutes after the Batouty switched places with the co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was neither the reference to God nor the
unusual change of seats that was the basis of their suspicion.
Rather, they said, it was those things plus their failure to find
any indication of a mechanical problem in the information on the
flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity. The
National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of the
investigation, has released limited information about the contents
of the tape.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the board has been taciturn is to avoid compromising
the inquiry. Investigators said release of the information about
Batouty has made it difficult to interview his family. And if past
accidents are any guide, officials said, they are still short of
some details and may find that some facts now in hand might be
wrong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators have not established, for example, at what point
in the flight the change in cabin crews was supposed to occur.
</P>
<P>
   They also have not established whether the captain and the
co-pilot were scheduled to be relieved at the same time, as is the
case for most U.S. carriers, or whether they would be replaced one
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The time of such a replacement is generally established at a
briefing before the crew boards the plane, according to aviation
experts, and any disagreement about the subject in flight is
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty also used a common Muslim phrase repeatedly in the
course of the dive, ``Tawakilt ala Allah,'' which can be translated
as ``I put my faith in God,'' or ``I entrust myself to God,'' but
Egyptian officials have objected to characterizing the utterance as
a prayer and say it need not indicate any intention.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators have characterized Batouty's action in
pushing his way into the co-pilot's seat as suspicious, safety
officials said they still did not have a complete picture of what
had happened or why. He could have waited until it was his turn to
fly and made the plane crash then, said one investigator, and at
that point might have been over deeper water and out of radar
range, which would have made finding the wreckage far more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was a half hour out of New York's Kennedy
International Airport at the time of the crash and only about 60
miles from Nantucket Island, over less than 300 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   And the method of descent, pushing the nose down, may not have
been the fastest way to crash the plane, officials said; someone
bent on crashing from 33,000 feet could easily have banked the
plane until the wings were at a 90-degree angle to the horizon,
eliminating lift.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Egyptian official suggested in Cairo Wednesday that
an explosion, possibly in the tail section, caused the crash,
according to The Associated Press. U.S. investigators said no
evidence supports that theory.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term status of the tape from the cockpit voice recorder
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the safety board to release a transcript of the
recorder on the day it opens hearings. If no hearing is held, the
transcript would be released with the other information. But if the
safety board passed the case on to the FBI, as it has discussed,
then it would not release the transcript, although the FBI might.

SHOPPING CENTER PREPARES TO USHER IN HOLIDAY SEASON WITH CEREMONY

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...those come in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Motor coaches carry an average of 35 to 40 persons, spending an
estimated $130 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Several tours now offer a package trip to Branson in December,
with a stopover in Kansas City to see the Plaza lights and the
mayor's Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1925 that Charles S. Pitrat, head of maintenance for
the J.C. Nichols Co., first hung a humble string of 16 colored
bulbs on the Suydam Building on the northwest corner of 47th Street
and J.C. Nichols Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants in the other Plaza buildings, all north of 47th
Street, added to Pitrat's lights by putting Christmas trees along
the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Pitrat extended a string of lights from those buildings
across 47th Street to the theater building. The extended lights
were an unusual step for the times and one that caused much
comment.
</P>
<P>
   More lights were added each year as new buildings went up.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 70 years, the lights have gone out only during World
War II and for two weeks in 1973, when President Richard Nixon
asked Americans to conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the wiring is at least 35 years old. The 10-foot
papier-mache replica of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, with
lighted nose and moving tail, hasn't survived, but the 8-foot stars
are still mainstays.
</P>
<P>
   One year the Plaza tried all blue lights, but the concept failed
because the lights couldn't be seen well.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the lights begins in the spring, when Broadway
Electrical Construction Inc. starts inspecting miles of streamers
in a storage room.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, the crew climbs the roofs of the Plaza to inspect
fuse boxes and streamer feeders. They begin hanging lights in
September.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 workhours later, the crew puts the finishing
touches on the project on Thanksgiving Day, working right up to
show time at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A timer turns on the lights at 5 p.m. every day and turns them
off at 3 a.m. during the holiday season. On darker days a switch
can be flipped to turn the lights on earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The lights will be on until Jan. 16. Workers will then start
taking the lights down, a project that will be completed in March,
weather permitting. The lights can't be left up through the summer
because the high temperatures would cause them to deteriorate much
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Hendrickson, who has worked on the lights for more than
three decades and is project foreman, will retire this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other shopping districts are picking up on the public relations
and economic boost that holiday lights bring.
</P>
<P>
   Omaha, Neb., plans to turn on 1 million lights around the Gene
Leahy Mall during its Millennium Lights celebration on New Year's
Eve. Although the Greater Omaha Convention and Visitors Bureau
isn't expecting much tourist traffic for the event, it does expect
Omaha residents in outlying areas to book hotel rooms near the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas millionaire recently donated 2 million Christmas
lights to Graceland in Memphis, Tenn., including a 40-foot wall of
lights with 100 angels and 20 lighted trees. One 120-foot tree is
topped by a 12-foot replica of Elvis with a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Graceland traditionally boasts a blue-lighted driveway, Nativity
scene and reindeer display from the day after Thanksgiving until
Elvis' Jan. 8 birthday. The new lights will be divided between a
pasture behind Graceland and the large souvenir shopping center
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``November through February is the slowest time of year for
us,'' said Todd Morgan, spokesman for Graceland. ``We expect the
new lights to jolt our visitorship a little bit, but by how much we
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   New York also has expanded its holiday events to continue to
draw bus tours and day-trippers from the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has become the place to be on the holidays,'' said
Nell Barrett, spokeswoman for NYC &AMP; Co., the Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau. ``We do $2 billion in the winter months, and most of that
is in December. It's a festive, happy climate that is so good for
attracting visitors and so great for a city's image.''

BOY SCOUTS IN DETROIT IN DRIVE FOR FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ohio, Ind.)  (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In this city of more than a million people, there are
just 20,000 boy scouts. But there is an unusual, $17 million effort
afoot to increase that number.
</P>
<P>
   With an executive at General Motors who was an eagle scout
leading the charge, the Detroit Area Council of the Boy Scouts of
America has begun a drive to raise $10 million for inner-city Scout
troops and another $7 million to build a new camp for Cub Scouts
and make improvements on a Boy Scout camp in nearby Metamora, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising drive is notable not only for its size, but
also because it would earmark most of the money for long-term
goals. If successful, the campaign would create a $10 million trust
fund for inner-city troops. Interest and investment income from the
fund would pay for costs like camping gear and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy experts say the drive is ambitious. ``For scouts in
Detroit, that's a lot of money,'' said Stacy E. Palmer, editor of
The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit groups are increasingly taking advantage of the strong
economy to build nest eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is figuring out that this is the smartest way to
raise money and not have to keep going back to your donors,'' Ms.
Palmer said. ``The general prosperity is making people think of the
long term.''
</P>
<P>
   People, as well as money, are being solicited as part of the
drive to increase the number of inner-city scouts here. Detroit's
1,200 Baptist churches and its 73 Roman Catholic parishes have
pledged to use scouting as part of their youth ministries. And the
Detroit branch is looking for up to 500 volunteers from businesses
and community groups to serve as assistant troop leaders, said
Chuck J. Lang, senior director of development for the Detroit Area
Council.
</P>
<P>
   While Lang knew of no larger initiative targeting inner-city
youths for Boy Scout membership, and a national spokesman for the
Scouts was unable to provide any information about fund-raising
drives in other cities, Detroit's is not the only
multimillion-dollar drive for donations. Scouting organizations in
Houston, Cincinnati and Indianapolis have held large fund-raising
drives in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There are slightly more than 100,000 scouts in the Detroit
metropolitan area, with about 80,000 in the suburbs and 20,000 in
the inner city, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses have been receptive so far. General Motors has
pledged $1 million toward the $17 million goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who are involved in scouting get exposed to skills and
values in scouting,'' said John F. Smith, general manager of GM's
Cadillac division and a former eagle scout, who is one of the
organizers of the drive. ``Lots of surveys indicate they are
changed and changed for the better by that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added: ``If you are a business interest, you could
selfishly look at this as early-on training for employees. We know
it makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are likely to pledge money later, when the
fund-raising effort gets into full swing next month.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler ``definitely will participate, but right now we
are still considering the contribution amount,'' said a
spokeswoman, Curtrise Garner, who added that the company had given
$50,000 to the Scouts in Detroit so far this year. A spokeswoman
for the Ford Motor Co., Gwynne Irvin, said that ``news from Ford
may be forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some billboard owners have donated advertising space on
billboards along some of Detroit's highways, and the advertising
agency D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles has designed the
advertisements without charge.

 Many physicians resisting Blue Cross and Blue Shield contracts  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In a rare show of protest, at least 1,000
area physicians have declined to sign or delayed signing Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Kansas City contracts that they say unfairly
restrict their medical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials confirmed this week that about one-third of
the 3,200 physicians had not signed contracts by the Nov. 19
deadline. Physicians who haven't signed will receive termination
notices on Dec. 1, which will become effective in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to the contracts reflects actions taken around
the nation as physicians increasingly protest the control wielded
by the managed-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues involve who defines when care is medically necessary,
how physicians are reimbursed for treating patients and the
liability insurers owe to a physician's patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever seen doctors in the Kansas
City area show this much concern over contracts,'' said Rebecca
Gaughan, an Olathe, Kan., ear, nose and throat specialist who is
chairwoman of the carrier relations task force for the Medical
Society of Johnson and Wyandotte Counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hottest issue in the nation. Doctors are fed up,''
said Gaughan, who has yet to sign her contract with Blue Cross and
is negotiating changes.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Blue Cross contracts could influence how
doctors respond to contracts with other area insurance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials, who spent this week meeting with
influential physicians, say they are not worried yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly acknowledge the frustrations of physicians, and
we're grateful for their willingness to work with us as much as
they have,'' said Tom Bowser, executive vice president and chief
operating officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing an impasse, Kansas Insurance Commissioner Kathleen
Sebelius has offered to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater
Kansas City, Sebelius said she was concerned that the situation
might affect ``the ability of consumers in the Kansas City area to
receive the health care they need and have purchased in their
insurance contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical officials also took their complaints to Missouri
Insurance Commissioner Keith Wenzel and Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan.
State insurance officials have limited regulatory powers, but they
can take action to prevent a disruption of services.
</P>
<P>
   Disruption might occur if Blue Cross cannot meet its obligations
to employers and consumers to build a network of health-care
providers for a wide variety of specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians who don't sign could lose considerable income,
because Blue Cross is the biggest area health insurer. And patients
could be forced to find new physicians if their caregivers leave
Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Activism has grown in the last year as physicians _ prevented by
antitrust laws from organizing to protest insurance contracts _
have shared their complaints over the Internet. Feelings have run
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been burned by these contracts,'' said Kansas City
surgeon Charles W. Van Way III.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City hired
attorneys to dissect insurance contracts, then posted the critiques
on a special Web page, metromedkc.org.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Jantsch, president of the organization, said:
``Traditionally, doctors just signed any managed care contract that
came across their desks. It looked like a bunch of legalese, and
they didn't delve into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as physicians studied... MORE

<P>
   PRESEVO, Yugoslavia _ Serbian customs officials have held up the
European Union's first effort to donate heating fuel to Serbian
towns controlled by the political opposition, impounding the 14
fuel trucks overnight at this border town.
</P>
<P>
   The oil tankers are headed for the southern Serbian towns of Nis
and Pirot as part of a program called Fuel for Democracy, which is
intended to provide help directly to the Serbian people and the
democratic opposition, bypassing the government of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia while keeping sanctions in place
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials implied in recent weeks that the shipments
would not be hindered, but Wednesday customs officials delayed the
trucks for about seven hours, before finally postponing a decision
on whether to let them pass until the following day.
</P>
<P>
   They kept four senior European diplomats, and the two mayors of
Nis and Pirot, waiting in near-freezing temperatures at the border,
forcing them to seek shelter in a small truckers cafe down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only express surprise and disappointment,'' said Michael
Graham, the head of the European Commission's delegation in
Belgrade, who is organizing the program. ``I see no reason why
anybody should wish to delay heating fuel for the citizens of Nis
and Pirot.''
</P>
<P>
   Nis Mayor Zoran Zivkovic, who is vice president of the
opposition Democratic Party, said the customs officials had allowed
the trucks into Serbia from neighboring Macedonia but were throwing
up bureaucratic obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that the government will let the shipment into
Yugoslavia, since blocking would be unpopular with a population
already suffering with extensive power cuts because NATO's bombing
of Yugoslavia last spring damaged the power grid, and sanctions
have sliced shipments of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's fuel, even if it only goes to certain
towns, will ease the national energy crisis Serbia is facing. For
the 15 European Union nations, which had to amend the oil embargo
placed upon Serbia in order to make the shipment, its humanitarian
benefits and message to Serbs that they are not being punished for
the faults of their government outweigh any immediate effects it
will have on Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the European Union cares for the people of
Serbia,'' said Hannu Mantyvaara, the ambassador of Finland, which
now holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. ``Heating
is one of the basic needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Zivkovic, and Mayor Tomislav Panajotovic of Pirot heralded
Wednesday's developments as Serbia's chance to open itself up to
Europe and to begin to end its isolation. They are pinning much on
the success of the first shipments of fuel oil to their towns. The
European Union is looking to extend the program to other towns in
Serbia if the pilot program, worth about $4 million, is successful.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...didn't delve into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as physicians studied their contracts more closely, she
said, they became irate because insurers _ and not physicians _ had
the discretion to decide what constituted medically necessary care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant the plan medical director or an administrator was
making a decision about what is medically necessary,'' Jantsch
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since their role is to save on costs, it's a conflict of
interest for them to say what's medically necessary and then to say
whether they'll pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Patzman, an attorney for the medical society, said
physicians were seeking ``to make the Blues think twice about
shoving a printed contract under their nose for a signature without
any input from doctors _ without any chance to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross' Bowser contends that a lot of the friction stems
from the size and complexity of the new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 contracts were sent to 3,200 physicians,
covering three health maintenance organizations, two preferred
provider organizations and fee-for-service programs. A physician
who wants to be in every plan must wade through 92 pages.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Blue Cross contracted with physicians separately on
each of its plans. This year, contracts were all sent out at once,
largely to comply with state and federal laws, Bowser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are requirements that apply to all carriers, not just
Blue Cross Blue Shield,'' Bowser said.
</P>
<P>
   But physicians say the contracts give Blue Cross and other
insurers too much control over medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question but that doctors are resisting more,''
said Richard Hellman, president-elect of the Metropolitan Medical
Society of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the debate over who should decide medical necessity,
physicians are rankled by other requirements.
</P>
<P>
   They bristle that contracts give insurers the right to set and
then change reimbursement fees whenever they want but do not
guarantee prompt payment to physicians for care given.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that ``hold harmless'' clauses exempt insurance
companies, but not physicians, from liability if an insurer's
decision to withhold care results in injuries to a patient.
</P>
<P>
   And they criticize a policy that allows Blue Cross to lease its
network to other insurance companies, obligating a physician to
care for patients of the other insurance company, even if it goes
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians say adherence to the bottom line forces them to be
more loyal to insurance companies than to their Hippocratic oath,
treating larger volumes of patients but for lower rates of
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's like Wal-Mart,'' Gaughan said. ``I can't see
more patients in an hour without spending less time with each
patient, and I don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is often not enough time to explore all of a patient's
symptoms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross is seeking to respond to these concerns, Bowser said.
``This medical necessity issue is one that is of great concern to
physicians and patients and the health insurance industry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a very good track record in working with
physicians on this front. We will continue to look at it to make it
as acceptable as it can be in the months ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians say that whatever happens with Blue Cross will
greatly influence their relations with other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Dillard, a spokeswoman for HealthNet, said her company
had modified its reimbursement formula in response to physicians'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (doctors) an important part of our structure, and
their input is essential on this and other operational matters,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser said Blue Cross planned to meet further with physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very frustrating times for physicians,'' he said.

LAST SPRING'S INSPIRATION IS BUT A MEMORY FOR KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team that ended up being loathed by parts of middle America
last season for its brazen arrogance and outlaw roster has emerged
this season with an identity as indistinguishable as a blade of
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the New York Knicks stands out. No character
traits separate them. The same Knicks who finished last year with a
dynamic personality have fallen back into the kind of mediocre
state that nearly ruined them before they awoke for an electric
springtime playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly despondent, the Knicks shrugged their shoulders as to why
they have reverted to their bad habits and shuffled out of the
Staples Center in Los Angeles embarrassed on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the defending Eastern Conference champions, trailing
by 28 points before losing, 100-95, to the Clippers, of all teams.
A mystified Coach Jeff Van Gundy warned that he would have to
``make changes and do something'' to break a pattern that left the
Knicks 2-3 on their road trip and 6-7 on the season. He didn't say
what changes _ lineup moves, a trade or a four-hour practice _ but
Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell suggested that the only
alterations necessary were from within each player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all saying the right things, but it's just lip
service,'' Sprewell said. ``You'd think we would learn from last
year. We've gone through this type thing already, so we should be
beyond that. We definitely don't want to wait until the All-Star
break, half the season, before it finally hits home. We're much
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Knicks aren't as good as they think. It's too early to
flip on a red alert _ particularly after the team just finished its
most difficult 13-game stretch of its season _ but there are
troubling issues. While there have been devastating injuries to the
front line, leaving the team without Marcus Camby, Larry Johnson
and Patrick Ewing on Tuesday night, the future is uncertain for all
of them. How much tendinitis can Camby withstand? How long before
Johnson's back pain eases? What will Ewing look like upon his
return?
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck and a lot of passion, the Knicks survived
each critical injury and thrived last season on their way to the
finals. They trumped reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think we're still living off last year,''
Houston said. ``In reality, the eighth seed doesn't make it. We got
hot and got on a roll, and I think a lot of us are living off last
year. This is a whole new year. We have to do the things it took to
get us to where we were last year. We're not doing it. We're not
working.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem Van Gundy can trace back to August. Very few
Knicks came into the team's practice facility to work out in
preparation for training camp. Once camp began, Sprewell chose to
go on a cross-country drive instead of hustling to join the team.
When the preseason began, the Knicks hardly showed urgency and
finished 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove preseason meant nothing, the Knicks popped out to
a 3-0 record before losing seven out of their last 10 games. During
the last two weeks, there has been little practice time because of
a crammed schedule, but on days off, only a handful of Knicks have
come in for extra work.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration has been difficult to come by. Along the way, the
Knicks have lost their rebounding edge, their desire to dive for
loose balls and their intensity on defense. Players from the
Western Conference have fattened their statistics by running right
by the hustle-challenged Knicks, who have been atrocious in
transition. That was glaringly evident against a Clippers team that
scored 39 points on the Knicks in the first quarter and shot 54.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, for one, was embarrassed by Lamar Odom and then Derek
Anderson during the team's miserable start. ``I wasn't ready,''
said Sprewell, who made up for his initial laziness on defense with
a 32-point finish. ``I wasn't into the game early. I think that's
why I'm really upset right now. In that first quarter, it just
wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   A blank look has replaced the defiant stare the Knicks once had.
In the 99 days between Game 5 of the finals and the beginning of
training camp, the Knicks have been searching for something to
provoke them. After falling behind teams like Utah, Boston, Phoenix
and the Clippers by double digits in the first quarter, their pride
has kicked in but only closed the gap so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can get into the game once you've been humiliated,''
Van Gundy said. ``It's no coincidence that all of our road wins
have been when we've jumped out to good starts.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those starts came against Golden State. Now that
emotionally-charged game motivated them. And yet, playing the Miami
Heat a week earlier did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fired up,'' said a struggling Chris Childs, who was
0 for 3 against the Clippers and is shooting about 31 percent on
the season. ``If someone makes a good play, it's like, OK,
whatever. Being a team means when someone makes a play, it's a team
play. You go and slap the guy on the back, give him a high five and
let him know that you're with him. We're not doing that. It's like
playing is a chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a personality. We've got to get mean and nasty
again. That's the way this team has always been. Right now, it's
not even close.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He looks devastated. But then Ralph Fiennes always
looks as if he is caught between deep melancholy and outright
despair. It must be something about the roles he takes, or the way
his mouth turns down at the corners, because his demeanor, while
not exactly jaunty, is certainly sporting.
</P>
<P>
   Told that a mix-up at the restaurant in his Manhattan hotel, The
Four Seasons, means he'll have to wait a good half-hour at the bar
before a table becomes available in the dining room, he says
mildly: ``You mean they are not going to clear the restaurant? Oh
dear, what is the world coming to?''
</P>
<P>
   This very private actor, who turns 37 this month, has earned a
reputation for being somewhat insular and aloof since his
astonishing debut in 1983 as the brutal Nazi concentration camp
director in Steven Spielberg's ``Schindler's List,'' for which he
was nominated for best supporting actor. But after being swamped by
acclaim following his next two films, ``Quiz Show'' and ``The
English Patient,'' the latter earning him a second Oscar nomination
for best supporting actor, and being mobbed by fans for the entire
sold-out run of ``Hamlet'' on Broadway in 1995, who could blame him
for feeling a trifle antisocial? Besides, by Hollywood standards,
just his refusal to move from London to Los Angeles would qualify
him as remote.
</P>
<P>
   In person, he merely seems shy. He makes several tentative stabs
at polite conversation, stammering sentences that open promisingly
and end up trailing off doubtfully. But he is unfailingly cordial,
inquiring if the seating arrangement is acceptable and worrying
that the bar area is too noisy. When he orders wine before lunch,
he insists a reporter join him.
</P>
<P>
   Over a glass of pinot noir, the famously intense leading man
appears marginally more at ease than he did upon arriving, when his
pale, angular face and blue-gray eyes were filled with dread of the
coming ordeal. He leans back into the deep leather armchair, his
loose-fitting olive linen shirt unbuttoned at the neck and his
graceful hands _ which spring to life when he is telling an
anecdote _ clasped in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks so softly it is necessary to lean in close to catch
his words. ``I think it's rather nice to have an atmosphere to play
off of, don't you?'' he says, surveying the bustling lounge with a
stage actor's fondness for mise-en-scene, a ghost of a smile on his
lips.
</P>
<P>
   So much of his new movie, ``The End of the Affair,'' which opens
on Friday, takes place in crowded cafes that it is impossible not
to be reminded of Maurice Bendrix, the brooding, disaffected 1940s
intellectual he plays in the film. ``The End of The Affair'' is
based on the Graham Greene novel of the same name and was arguably
the author's most autobiographical work, drawing on his illicit
love affair with a married American named Catherine Walston.
</P>
<P>
   The book is dedicated to her. The film, adapted and directed by
Neil Jordan, focuses on the irrational, destructive forces that
undermine the relationship, as the obsessed Bendrix succumbs to
jealousy. Fiennes gives a controlled performance as the embittered
novelist, whose simmering sexuality and self-contempt are barely
contained by his elegant manners and stiff upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sense of understatement was the most defining thing,''
says Jordan, the Irishman whose films include ``The Crying Game''
and ``Michael Collins.'' ``It's very English, you know, and it's
very Graham Greene.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan says Fiennes was an obvious choice to portray the
isolated, introspective novelist. ``He has those eyes,'' Jordan
says, adding that the casting of the film was a miracle of
chemistry, with Julianne Moore playing the ardent Catherine and
Stephen Rea (a favorite of the director) as her buttoned-down
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greene said that there was a splinter of ice in the heart of
every novelist, so that even in the middle of their own tragedy or
somebody else's, they were always taking notes,'' Jordan says.
``It's the aspect of Greene's character I most wanted in the film,
and Ralph played Bendrix like it was his destiny to watch and
follow the events to their grave conclusion. There was something
heroic in his refusal to take solace in anything. It was more
touching in the end than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was apparently not the first person to recognize that the
role of Greene's haunted literary hero was tailor made for Fiennes.
What was very peculiar, as Fiennes tells it, was that during the
summer of 1998 several close friends independently suggested that
he consider playing Bendrix. One of them was Jonathan Kent, who had
directed Fiennes in ``Hamlet'' and who advised him to read the
novel, saying, ``That's a part for you.'' Fiennes had only just
gotten around to reading the book when, by coincidence, Jordan
called him up and offered him the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those rare occasions when everything just came
together,'' Fiennes says. ``I had always wanted to play a Graham
Greene character like Scoby in `The Heart of the Matter.' I just
loved his compassion for human fallibility and self-deception and
duplicity. His compassion for human weakness. I find that so
moving, and I think it goes hand in hand with his faith,'' he says,
referring to Greene's Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his own faith, Fiennes' is terse. ``My mother
was Catholic, I am not,'' he says, showing a glimmer of the fierce
emotion he has famously demonstrated on screen. He bristles at the
notion that he should necessarily resemble the wounded characters
he has chosen to play in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But over a hearty English lunch of beef and potatoes, and more
wine, he concedes that with his next three films, he further
expands his repertory of dark, romantic heroes. In addition to
``The End of the Affair,'' there is ``Onegin,'' which also opens
next month, in which he gives a wrenching, Byronic performance as
Evgeny Onegin, a jaded bachelor who learns how to love too late;
the film is based on the epic 19th-century Russian verse novel by
Alexander Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
   And in Istvan Szabo's ``Sunshine,'' to be released in the
spring, he goes for broke, playing not one but three generations of
a Jewish Hungarian family _ a grandfather, father and son _ bound
by the same hopes, secrets and tragic betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph wants to learn the human problem,'' Szabo says. ``He is
a very intelligent person, and he is choosing roles that allow him
to wrestle with moral problems, the real questions of character,
and carry that message to the audience. He is someone who wants to
say something. He is truly an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Fiennes, the actor's younger sister, who directed
``Onegin,'' is somewhat amused by the public's fascination
(particularly young women) with her brother's penchant for playing
tormented types. ``Really, I think Ralph is quite well adjusted,''
she says, sounding delighted at the opportunity to tweak her
celebrated sibling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph is not Onegin,'' she continues, in a more serious tone,
``but he is attracted to certain types of characters, and he is
interested in the dynamics of human behavior. I think what drew him
to the story is that here is a man made conscious. And while there
is tragedy in the missed opportunity, there is something great in
the pain of that rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Onegin'' is particularly close to Fiennes' heart. ``It's
funny, because as one critic commented, Onegin is the story in
which nothing happens twice,'' he says. ``But actually that's what
I love about it, the nothing happening and the expectancy of
(italics)something.''(end italics) Closing his eyes for a moment,
he recalls shooting the breathtaking opening scene, filmed in St.
Petersburg, in which Onegin's horse-drawn sleigh flies across the
vast frozen Neva. ``I loved it,'' he says. ``It's just one of those
things, you feel so lucky afterwards that it happened in your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He first read Pushkin's verse novel in the early 1990s and was
immediately struck by the cold, enigmatic figure of Onegin, who
rejects the passionate overture of Tatyana, a spirited young girl
played by Liv Tyler, and later pays a terrible price for his
cynicism. The story stayed with him, and he gave a copy of the book
to his sister, a director of commercials and music videos, making
an offhand observation about the poem's cinematic potential.
</P>
<P>
   From that casual comment sprang a film, seven years in the
making, that Fiennes has championed, from the first crude
storyboards he drew while on the set of a BBC film to the battle to
find a distributor, an issue resolved only this fall. (It will be
released by Samuel Goldwyn Films.)
</P>
<P>
   He pushes away a double espresso that has gone cold. ``I
honestly don't know why it has been so hard,'' he says. ``Whether
it sounds like, `Oh, there's Ralph Fiennes playing another tortured
soul.' I don't know. My sense is, initially some people thought it
was an indulgent, home-grown thing _ a rarefied family venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes is part of an increasingly famous family of artists,
writers and actors. He is the oldest of six children (a seventh was
adopted), and four of his siblings work in the film industry,
including his youngest brother, Joseph, who starred in
``Shakespeare in Love.'' His mother, Jini, was a painter and
novelist who wrote under the pseudonym Jennifer Lash.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was prone to wild mood swings _ she was once
hospitalized as a young girl for hysteria _ she was extraordinarily
loving and inspiring to her children. After her death from cancer
in 1993, Fiennes arranged for her last novel, ``Blood Ties,'' to be
published posthumously. His father, whom he describes as a
steadying influence, was a farmer who later became a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their childhood, money was scarce, and Fiennes
clearly recalls his mother's struggle to bring up her children and
find the peace and solitude she required to write. When they lacked
the funds to send him to school, she educated him at home. It was
his mother who first read ``Hamlet'' to Fiennes when he was 8, and
gave him a recording of the play featuring Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   He was not immediately drawn to acting. As his interest in the
arts grew, he thought of becoming a painter. He enrolled in the
Chelsea College of Art and Design in London, but in the middle of
the year he suddenly decided he wanted to become an actor. In 1982,
he auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Before long,
he was making a name for himself at the National Theater in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just suddenly came to me very clearly,'' he says of his
abrupt change of course. ``It's not something I can rationalize
even now.'' But his mother saw it long before he did. He recalls
that after a high school play _ perhaps a performance of ``Love's
Labour's Lost'' _ she turned to him on the walk home and said,
``You know, if you want to, Ralph, you could be an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't like a stage mother,'' says Fiennes. ``It wasn't
that she wanted to see her boys shine on the stage and get the
applause. I think she wanted us to be party to making those plays
happen _ with Shakespeare at the forefront _ and to field those
emotions and ideas for an audience. It was always the ideas in the
play that would really excite her.''
</P>
<P>
   Her influence is apparent in the rather unorthodox career path
he has charted in recent years, shunning traditional leading man
roles in big Hollywood movies in favor of roles in smaller films
and in the theater. Fiennes, who has spent the last few months
preparing for his return to the London stage in a Shakespearean
double bill of ``Richard II'' and ``Coriolanus,'' admits that he
felt quite buffeted by all the attention he received following
``Schindler's List.'' His doubts crystallized the night he attended
Tina Brown's lavish party (with the theme ``The New Yorker Goes to
the Movies'') in Los Angeles, just before the Oscar ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at this table, and someone came up behind me and
tapped me on the shoulder and I turned, and he said, `When you're
hot ... ,'' recalls Fiennes, twisting in his seat for dramatic
effect. ``Then he just walked away. I don't know who it was, but it
was quite aggressive,'' he says, flopping angrily back in his
chair. ``I was so shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during those alarming days, before he had adjusted to his
overnight popularity, that his 12-year relationship with the
actress Alex Kingston came unraveled. They have since divorced, and
she now lives in Los Angeles and appears in the television series
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, he has been involved with Francesca
Annis, a noted British stage actress 17 years his senior, who
played Gertrude to his Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the spotlight of the Hollywood film industry first turns
itself on you, it is quite tantalizing,'' he says. ``You can do no
wrong, the whole world, everything, is yours. You're fed
information, you're supported, surrounded by voices and noises that
are encouraging. You know, it's all quite rosy.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and gives a slight shrug, happy to have left it all
behind. He has no idea what he will do after touring with the
plays, but says, ``I think recently I feel calmer about the way I
want to choose things.''

 Kindness of strangers helps ease sorrow and hardship  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At first, the question stunned Raymonette
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   David Brown and his wife, Brenda, wanted to know if Cole's son
could live with them for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Not forever, they said, just long enough to give him a little
``tough love.'' Maybe it would help.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Cole, then 12, was beginning to have problems. He
wouldn't do his homework. He was skipping classes. And he was
fighting classmates on a daily basis. His mother felt helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that someone would offer to do that,''
recalls Cole, a single mother of three children.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe she shouldn't have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Most stories of kindness pass unnoticed, invisible in a world
full of trauma and despair. But ordinary people do extraordinary
things every day. People like the Browns. Or a nurse named Zahra
Raki, who helped a family thousands of miles away. Or Kansas City
firefighters who saved one family's lifetime of memories.
</P>
<P>
   For Raymonette Cole, the Browns were an answer to a mother's
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   She knew her bright little boy was losing his way. The Browns
knew it, too. They are youth coordinators at the Coles' church.
David is a security officer at Marcus' school, Southeast K-8 Zoo
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns liked Marcus. Perhaps a strong male presence in his
life would turn him around.
</P>
<P>
   Cole rejoiced at their offer. Her son's problems at school were
making life too hard for her and her other two children at home.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   It was late March when Marcus moved in with the Browns. Their
first priority was for him to learn some rules: Do your chores
before you play outside; do your homework before you play outside,
too. They also gave him a library card and took him to the library.
</P>
<P>
   And they challenged him to raise his grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know all those book reports you haven't done, Marcus?
They're going to be finished now,'' they told him.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus had to show them his homework before he could play. They
showed him what he did wrong and what he did right. But Marcus
admits that he tried to fool them _ especially when it came to
those book reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I copied the stuff at the back of the book without
reading it,'' he says. ``But David is smart. He caught me, and made
me read the book and do it again. I couldn't get away with
nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote 25 book reports in one month. And his grade point
average zoomed from a 1.1 to a 3.0. He made the honor roll and was
in the 95 percent attendance club.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of May, he moved back home _ changed now from a boy
into a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Marcus, now 13, is on the student council, in a
leadership class and plays football for the Marauders, an
after-school league. He's the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like science now,'' he says, ``and, oh yeah, I haven't got
in one fight this year....David is still guiding me. If he left the
school, I don't know what I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole smiles as her son tells his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my child,'' she says. ``He wanted to change
and he had an opportunity to do it. Tell all those single parents
out there not to give up on their children. God brings people to
you that can help. I believe the Browns were our gift from God.
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   Zahra Raki looked at the face of the comatose young man in
critical condition at Overland Park (Kan.) Regional Medical
Center's intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, a car crash almost took his life. Now, medical
science was giving him a little more time on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A ventilator raised and lowered his chest for breath. A cranial
catheter was in his skull relieving pressure on his brain. Four
chest tubes snaked out of his bandaged chest, with more tubes
tethered to his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   He is so handsome and so young, she thought sadly. Raki, an
intensive care nurse at Baptist Medical Center since 1985, knew
from experience that this patient would die.
</P>
<P>
   She learned about him after reading an article in the newspaper.
It was a brief story about a car crash of a 19-year-old with an
Iranian name: Amirarash Mofidi.
</P>
<P>
   His name leapt out at Raki, who was born in Iran. If Mofidi was
Iranian, she thought, perhaps I could help him.
</P>
<P>
   Raki went to the hospital. She learned that Mofidi was a student
at Johnson County Community College from Iran. His parents could
not travel here.
</P>
<P>
   But in the waiting room was an aunt from Texas, and uncles from
Canada and London. All three, however, spoke little English. Raki
immediately stepped in, explaining complicated medical procedures
to them in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Mofidi was in a coma.... MORE

   WAR-ZONE-FILM (New York) _ Tim Roth sits at a table in a sleek
SoHo hotel looking oddly battle-ready. ``I'm prepared for
anything,'' he says after a sip of bottled water. Actually, he's an
actor preparing for the opening, on Dec. 10, of his directorial
debut, ``The War Zone.'' And he has reason to be wary. Based on the
British writer Alexander Stuart's novel about a family destroyed by
incest, the film is an unflinching adaptation of a disturbing story
that has already provoked sharply divided reactions. By David Bahr.

his latest work, ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' to the press. It was the
first time in his 40-year career, he said, that he had completed a
film that had not been immediately shelved by the authorities. His
previous work, ``My Friend Ivan Lapshin,'' spent four years in
limbo before its release in 1985, when it became a celebrated film
of the perestroika era. ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' which on Friday
opens FilmFest, a series of recent films from Russia and the former
Soviet republics at the Museum of Modern Art, is set in 1953,

Composition and Atonality.'' But a lot of its readers may not have
known that Perle is himself a fine composer, or that paradoxically,
his creative work stands distinctly aside from many of the
practices detailed in his book. Opportunities to hear his music
arrive in anticipation of his 85th birthday, next May. On Tuesday
evening at Cooper Union in New York City, the Da Capo Chamber
Players will present a concert of songs as well as chamber works.

   BACH-RECITALS (subslug) (New York) _ With a fascinating concert
season well underway in New York, as one institution after another
tries intently if belatedly to come to terms with music of the 20th
century, it is easy for the moment to forget dreary, predictable
seasons of a year or two ago. It is also easy to assume that all is
well under the surface. But two recent Bach recitals suggest
otherwise, showing devastating anomalies in the way young
performers are fed into the system, or are not. By James R.

   KEITH-JARRETT-ALBUM (Undated) _ Keith Jarrett's new solo album,
``The Melody at Night, With You,'' begs a listener to think about
the relationship between music and mortality. Jarrett, the Proust
of jazz, had chronic fatigue syndrome recently; for a while the
Internet was bubbling with rumors of his imminent demise that
gained credence after he canceled several concerts. The album is
dedicated to his wife, Rose Anne, and if one reads the song titles
_ ``I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ``Somebody to Watch Over
Me,'' ``Don't Ever Leave Me'' _ it can be surmised that she has
been an integral part of making Jarrett healthy again. By Peter
Watrous. (Moved).

   CARDBOARD-ARCHITECT (Undated) _ Shigeru Ban, an architect who
lives in Tokyo, in the last five years has responded to the news of
earthquakes and other disasters as if to a call of conscience.
After the Kobe quake in 1994, Ban designed units of cardboard and
plastic housing for the thousands who had been driven from their
homes. The following year, he established the Volunteer Architects
Network, a nongovernmental agency of the United Nations. This year,
under the aegis of that agency, he has coordinated the production
and shipment of cardboard housing units for refugees in Turkey. By

   FACES-CENTURY-PHOTOGS (London) _ Photography in this century has
brought contemporary history, national and international, as close
as coffee spoons while at the same time keeping it at the safe
distance of reduced and isolated representations. ``Faces of the
Century: A Sainsbury's Photographic Exhibition,'' currently at the
National Portrait Gallery in London (through Jan. 30), points this
up quite cleverly. (Sainsbury's is a private arts sponsorship
program set up by grocery chain money in 1981 to deliver, as the
accompanying catalogue explains, ``high quality, imaginative and
dynamic arts sponsorships involving as many people as possible in
the communities where we trade.'') In restricting the century to
faces, and British faces at that _ you had best look elsewhere for
anyone important, like Stalin and Mao. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN-BODY-PHOTOGS (Lisbon, Portugal) _ In strictly Darwinian
terms, the evolution of the human body may be slow, yet in this
century perception of the body has changed beyond recognition.
Photography is a major reason for this. More democratic, accessible
and unforgiving than painting or drawing, it has shaped how we look
at each other _ and ourselves. It has also redefined our notion of
the body in everything from entertainment, sports and fashion to
wars, famine and medicine. This, at least, is the premise behind
``The Century of the Body: Photoworks 1900 to 1999,'' an ambitious
photographic exhibition that runs through Dec. 19 at a cultural
center in Lisbon. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

   JULIE-TAYMOR-ART (Columbus, Ohio) _ Can dramas that have been
stripped of their actors and actions, stripped of everything but
their props, costumes and sets, still be dramatic? The exhibition
``Playing with Fire,'' a survey of the artifacts of Julie Taymor's
25-year career as a director and designer of operas, musicals,
movies and plays, is a perfect test case. The exhibition is being
held at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. It will
be at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York in March. By Sarah

   TV-AMERICAN-HOLLOW (Undated) _ Rory Kennedy's glowing face and
great smile stand out in the family photograph. Next to her is the
matriarch, who has 13 children and grandchildren galore. Most live
near her and all return regularly en masse for holidays and other
family gatherings. There are the young men, some of whom have had
problems with drinking, drugs or romance. The mentally retarded
sister is not there; she lives elsewhere. Not long ago, one of the
sons was arrested and jailed. The whole family united to support
him but couldn't come up with the $2,500 bail. That's right, it's
the Bowling family of Mudlick Hollow, Ky., the subjects of Ms.
Kennedy's HBO documentary ``American Hollow,'' which has its
television premiere Monday night. If many things about the Bowlings
seem similar to the huge Irish-American clan that Ms. Kennedy comes
from _ and she acknowledges that she found it easy to identify with
them, despite the obvious differences _ that just makes her point
about the value of documentary filmmaking. By Anita Gates. (Moved).

<P>
   BOOKWORM-RADIO (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ In the world of serious
poetry and fiction, where text and technique are more important
than conventional book tour prattle or even plot, ``Bookworm'' is
considered something of a national resource, a sanctuary from
lightweight pop fiction and/or the canonization of well-known
authors. Although run on a shoestring and distributed free to a
shaky network of 50 or so public radio stations, the program has
run for 10 years and attracted heavyweights like Tom Wolfe, Scott
Turow, E.L. Doctorow, John Irving, Norman Mailer, Richard Ford,
Joan Didion, Toni Morrison, Paul Theroux, Joyce Carol Oates, Salman
Rushdie, Amy Tan, Gore Vidal, Ann Beattie and Nicholson Baker. The
creator, producer and host, Michael Silverblatt, a tall, roundfaced
man in his 40s, welcomed them all in a tiny basement recording
studio at KCRW, a local public radio station. By Andy Meisler.

 Kindness of strangers helps ease sorrow and hardship  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...she didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Mofidi was in a coma. As a nurse, Raki thinks comatose patients
can still hear. Amid the whirr of monitors and the foosh of
ventilators, she spoke Farsi to him, too. Sometimes joking with
him. Sometimes telling him stories.
</P>
<P>
   She invited his aunt and uncles to her Overland Park home and
cooked dinners for them. More than once she sat with them in the
waiting room, including one all-night vigil when Mofidi was not
expected to survive.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 days she tried to prepare the family for the inevitable,
but ``they were in complete denial,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That troubled her.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim custom for the dead is that burial must occur
quickly, within 24 hours. No embalming is permitted. How much more
pain would this family endure if their loved one could not be
buried at home? Raki thought. A plan emerged.
</P>
<P>
   She worked the telephone, calling officials in Washington and
Iran. Then 11 days after his crash, Mofidi died on the morning of
his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   His family was stunned. Across the miles, Mofidi's mother and
father were devastated at losing their only child. Added to their
grief was that they could not give him a Muslim burial.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Raki gave them her precious gift: ``It's all taken
care of,'' she told them. ``His body will be there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Raki, who had never known Mofidi, had pre-paid the numerous
expenses and arranged for his body to be shipped home. It cost her
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mofidi died two years ago, Raki is still good friends
with his family, planning to attend his aunt's wedding this summer.
A scholarship was also set up in his name at the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did is something anyone else would do for another,''
she says, embarrassed. ``I would have paid for him to get home even
if they never paid me back. I didn't care about that. ICU nurses go
out of their way to treat the families of patients like their own.
We do it on a daily basis. It's why I wanted to be a nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his death, she dreamed she was at a party. There, a
healthy, smiling Amirarash Mofidi approached her, joked with her
and thanked her.

   Brett Henne, 33, always considered himself an animal person. He
once stopped a car driving down the street because a bunch of
children were hanging a kitten out the side window. Almost every
pet he had as a boy was a dog or cat adopted from an animal
shelter. In fact, there wasn't a time in his life when he didn't
have a pet.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Raytown man read a story about a no-kill animal
shelter in Savannah, Mo., named M'Shoogy's, that rescues hundreds
of stray and abused pets; pets that sometimes don't have legs or
eyes or ears. After reading the story, he called his mother, Sharon
Henne, to make sure she had read it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great what those people are doing for animals,'' he told
her. ``I'd really like to help them somehow. Maybe volunteer
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brett Henne never got that chance.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later he complained of chest pains to his girlfriend
and lay down. His dog, Sandy, was acting even more friendly than
usual, refusing to leave his side, even when Brett's girlfriend
called to her.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Henne died.
</P>
<P>
   As his grieving family arranged for his funeral and obituary,
his mother remembered her conversation with her son about
M'Shoogy's. She decided to ask people to send a donation to
M'Shoogy's in lieu of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after Brett Henne's funeral, Sharon and Kenneth Henne
drove to Savannah. They met M'Shoogy's founders, Gary and Lisa
Silverglat, and handed them more than $850 in donations from Brett
Henne's family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers are nice,'' Sharon Henne says, ``but this is something
that will do a lot more good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Brett really did get to help them after all.''
</P>

<P>
   Nov. 30, 1998, was Judy and Bill Hidy's 40th wedding
anniversary. To celebrate, they went out to a nice restaurant for
dinner. Then came the phone call: ``Your house is on fire!''
</P>
<P>
   As the Hidys neared their Kansas City home, they could see smoke
curling skyward. Their street was blocked with fire trucks and
police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Their front door was broken in. Glass was shattering. Smoke and
fire alarms were shrieking. Inside, an eerie glow flickered.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Hidys didn't care about the house's contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cry for people, not things,'' Judy Hidy says. They were
more worried about their pet schnauzer, Sybil, whom they'd left in
the basement.
</P>
<P>
   When they saw her in the arms of their neighbor, they sighed
with relief. But then new worries emerged: Where will we sleep?
What about food? Our clothes? All our Christmas decorations?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before a Red Cross volunteer handed them a check
for a week's worth of food. A neighbor offered to house them for
``as long as it took to rebuild.'' Their church organized delivery
of homecooked meals for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People made this easier,'' Judy Hidy says. ``They shared our
burdens. You could feel the prayers for us. Whenever we saw
something sad, we'd see something positive and it helped us get
past it. The average person has no idea what it means to suffer
through a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The full reality didn't hit until dawn. Daylight illuminated a
surrealistic scene. Every step in the house meant wading through
knee-deep charred muck. Even part of Judy Hidy's car had melted in
the blaze. Blackened wood beams hung from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the shock wears off, you think about the familiar
furniture, antique lamps and clocks,'' Hidy says. ``Then you think
about all the stuff you used to have and all the photos.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vincent Jones cannot forget the first time he saw the
homeless man, so skinny he was ``holding up his pants with one hand
and holding onto the wall with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A police officer was rousting the man from his regular square of
sidewalk on 39th Street near Seventh Avenue. And Jones walked past
as he had walked past so many men like him over the years, drinking
and drugging themselves into the grave in the dismal orbit of the
Port Authority bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But something _ Jones still finds it hard to explain _ drew him
back. ``The look on that man's face,'' he says now.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Raymond Lawrence, asked Jones for a quarter. Jones gave
him two. He bought him a cup of coffee and a bacon-and-egg
sandwich. He asked the man _ please _ not to spend his money on
alcohol, and then he walked away, sure that he would never see him
again.
</P>
<P>
   That was three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Jones pulled his battered gray minivan up to a
tiny white, shingled house in Portsmouth, Va., where he stepped out
and then Lawrence stepped out and then Lawrence's 73-year-old
mother, Alberta, walked slowly onto the lawn with her arms in the
air, crying.
</P>
<P>
   It had been three years since she had heard from her son, and,
despite her prayers and those of every parishioner in two Virginia
Baptist churches during that time, she had given him up for dead.
</P>
<P>
   The act of charity that brought about the reunion that October
evening was unlikely enough. But in its details, the story of the
bond that developed between a stocky, easy-going 56-year-old
Garment District delivery man from Queens Village and a troubled,
51-year-old alcoholic becomes even more so.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the chance encounter on 39th Street, Jones
began to slowly and doggedly work his way into Lawrence's life and
discovered several things: that the homeless man who usually had
trouble opening a bottle of Thunderbird had once been an
accomplished jazz pianist and attended the Berklee College of Music
in Boston. That one of Lawrence's sisters worked in midtown
Manhattan and regularly took the bus in from New Jersey to the Port
Authority, never knowing that her lost brother was usually lying on
the sidewalk one block away.
</P>
<P>
   And that Lawrence's mother, still working as a nurse, lived only
5 miles from where Jones himself had been born and raised, in
segregation-era Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   To Jones, a deeply religious man, few of these things were
particularly surprising and none were coincidences. ``I truly
believe that God led me to Raymond,'' he says. ``Sometimes I would
even say to him, `Lord, why do I keep running into this man?'''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with his faith and scriptures at the ready, even Jones
finds it hard to believe that today, the same Raymond Lawrence he
knew on the streets of New York will sit down with his mother, and
his nephew's family in Newport News, for his first Thanksgiving
dinner in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' Jones said, ``there were times when I said to
myself: I am going to watch this man die out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, the story of what the handtruck delivery
man did for the homeless man has spread slowly through the Garment
District like a kind of urban legend. Lawrence has taken on the
dimensions of a samaritan too good to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McDonald, a homeless outreach worker who had struggled to
help Lawrence for three years, said, ``I was suspicious at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center
Business Improvement District _ who heard about it from the
agency's security guards and later mentioned it to a newspaper
editor _ said she had decided that Jones must be ``totally crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was a fixture in this district for so long, and he
was not just a nuisance; he was offensive,'' she said of Lawrence,
who was often covered in urine and feces, bellowing at passersby
when he was drunk. Ms. Randall added: ``We were always kind of
hoping that something would happen to him. We didn't think it would
be anything good.''
</P>
<P>
   But when people stop Jones to marvel at what he did he will
usually only pause for a moment and concede: ``I guess it is a
little unusual, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, even this never seemed to occur to
him. At first, he would seek the homeless man out in the middle of
his fabric deliveries and offer a dollar here and there and food
whenever he asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   On a couple of occasions, when he could not stand to see
Lawrence shaking so uncontrollably, Jones would break down and buy
him a bottle of cheap wine. But he soon vowed never to do it again.
And he stopped giving money altogether, because he knew it would
end up in the cash register of the Athens Liquor Store on 40th
Street near the Port Authority. (By all accounts, Lawrence never
used drugs.)
</P>
<P>
   But alcohol was all Lawrence wanted, and it was often not easy
for Jones to refuse him when he saw the frail man _ Lawrence is
5-foot-9 but weighed only 125 pounds; he is 51 but looks 70 _
beaten by fellow homeless men or crying because they had robbed him
in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's shoes were stolen so often that through the winters,
the toes on his left foot became unbearably painful and one night
in 1998, he said, ``I guess I dialed 911 because I couldn't walk no
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons amputated all of the toes on his left foot and the
little toe on his right foot. For several months, he stayed in a
nursing home in the Bronx, but then, as he always did, he made his
way back to his old haunt, rolling down Seventh Avenue and calling
out to Jones from a shiny new wheelchair. It was stolen within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Jones knew Lawrence, he said, the more he would try
to keep track of him, enlisting Fashion Center security guards to
let him know when they spotted the homeless man. He also began
slowly trying to pry loose some of Lawrence's past, which usually
came out confused or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, the outreach worker for the Partnership for the
Homeless, said that over his three years' acquaintance with
Lawrence _ even as he helped place him in several detoxification
programs and get him medical care _ he could never win his trust.
``Every time I saw him _ every time,'' said McDonald, ``he would
act like he didn't remember my name.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But where McDonald and others failed to get through to him,
Jones became like a kind of older brother, at times protective and
compassionate, and at other times argumentative and overbearing
like an older brother can be.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With incredible patience, Jones began to piece together a
picture of a lost life. Lawrence had been in the Navy, serving in
San Diego during the Vietnam War; at some point, it seemed, he had
been court-martialed for being AWOL and drunk; he had moved to
Boston and in the 1970s had auditioned for the Berklee College of
Music, playing a jazz piece and a Bach prelude; he was accepted and
lasted for a year before the drinking destroyed his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades, he bounced almost everywhere _ Alaska,
Arizona, New York, California, the Carolinas and back to New York _
but he can now summon few memories of those years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in early October, Jones extracted the details he
needed: Lawrence had a sister, Mary Helen, somewhere in New Jersey;
a mother somewhere in Virginia and another sister near Boston. In
May 1996, the last time anyone in his family had heard his voice,
he had called that sister to wish her happy Mother's Day. And
somehow, he still remembered her number.
</P>
<P>
   It was with this scrap of the past _ 10 digits _ that Jones' set
himself in motion.
</P>
<P>
   He called Lawrence's sister Cathaleen, who got him in touch with
their mother. On a morning soon after, Jones held a cell phone up
to the homeless man's ear and told him his mother was on the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence looked at the phone and then said into it, tears
welling in his eyes: ``Is this really my mother?''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of a woman, crying, shot back: ``On October 3, 1948,
they handed me a baby and told me it was you, so I guess it's your
mother, Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   In a life that had seemed on an unswerving trajectory toward
death, that was the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lawrence said she was asked by friends later: ``How long
have you known this Vincent fellow? And I said, `I've never met the
man before in my life!' They asked what he wanted, and I said, `He
doesn't want anything. He won't take anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was so excited that he wanted to drive Lawrence to
Virginia the next day, but was persuaded to wait until he had gone
though a five-day detoxification program. And so on the afternoon
of Oct. 20, Jones picked up his trembling charge from a midtown
office of the Partnerghip for the Homeless and drove him back to
his own cramped house in Queens Village, which Jones shares with
his longtime girlfriend, Lillie Whitmore.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the least, an unusual scene, but Ms. Whitmore was
not exactly surprised. Once, several years earlier, Jones had taken
off time to care for an elderly neighbor in Sullivan County, where
he often goes with friends to hunt. Over the years he knew
Lawrence, he would often come home and tell her how worried he was
about the man. And Jones tried to act on the advice his mother had
given him just before she died: ``Never look down on a person
unless you are picking them up.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge differences between Jones and Lawrence, Ms.
Whitmore could also see the similarities between the two men. They
both grew up essentially without fathers and both had principled,
strong-willed mothers. And when Lawrence was not drinking, he was
as humble and hard-working as Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That night, they all dined on baked chicken, corn, peas and
potatoes. Jones asked his girlfriend's son, Brent Whitmore _ a hair
stylist who goes by the monicker Sharnteek, and who has worked for
Mike Tyson, Puff Daddy and Johnnie Cochran _ to come over and see
what he could do about Lawrence's matted hair and beard. Whitmore
pulled out his clippers, took off most of the hair and left
Lawrence with a small, stylish mustache. ``I reconstructed his
whole look,'' he recalled the other day, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence slept in the spare bedroom. And the next morning,
Lawrence and Jones and Jones' howling Walker hound, Max, piled into
the van for a 10-hour drive to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Whitmore watched them leave that morning, she looked at
her beaming boyfriend, whom everyone in his family calls Butch, and
she thought to herself: ``That's Butch, bless his heart. He will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But before it was all over that day, one final thing happened to
reassure Jones once again that there are no coincidences: half an
hour after they arrived in Portsmouth from their long road trip,
Lawrence suffered a grand mal seizure, brought on by his withdrawal
from alcohol. His mother, a nurse, knew exactly what to do before
he was taken to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three weeks in a veterans' hospital. He is now back
home with his mother and has an appetite for the first time in a
year. He has not had a drink in more than a month. But those around
him say they know he wants one, and worry that he will try to get
back to the sidewalks where Jones found him.
</P>
<P>
   He says he thinks often about Jones and is not sure how to feel:
``I don't know why he did that for me,'' he says. ``Maybe I remind
him of somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence has begun to find a new sense of purpose in playing the
piano at his mother's church, the Noble Street Baptist Church in
Portsmouth, where the parishioners had prayed for him for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, he found himself sitting in a clean, grey
thrift-store suit at the other church that prayed for his return,
the Life-Line Full Gospel Baptist Church in Newport News, where his
nephew is the music minister.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had traveled down with a reporter once again to visit the
Lawrence family and check up on his friend Raymond. Before the
service began, he pulled Lawrence close to him and held on to his
thin arm like an older brother. ``Raymond,'' he said, ``you can't
come back to New York City. It's not the same up there, man.
Giuliani is putting all the homeless people in jail. You stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pews began to fill, he made another request. Would
Lawrence and the choir play his favorite hymn, ``Pass Me Not, Oh
Gentle Savior''?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the service, Lawrence sat almost hidden behind the
black baby grand piano. Closing his eyes tightly shut and placing
his shaking fingers above the keys, he began to play. The voices of
Mrs. Lawrence and her daughter, Mary Helen Hollins, rose and joined
with the choir and filled the church with sound.
</P>
<P>
   The song ended. Jones rose and smiled and said to no one in
particular: ``That's my buddy Raymond.''

 Kindness of strangers helps ease sorrow and hardship  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...and all the photos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the fire destroyed the main sections of the house,
oddly, a hall closet seemed almost untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Hidy opened its door and peered inside. A brown tarp was draped
over something. She lifted it up and saw her daughter's baby
picture staring back.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, stacked neatly and very deliberately was every family
photo and album that the Hidys thought were lost forever. Somehow,
firefighters in the midst of battling the blaze had removed every
photo on every wall, dresser and desk in the house.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Judy Hidy sat down and cried _ tears of joy for the
kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   She cried once more, too, when Floyd Dupree, battalion chief of
Fire Station 35 in Kansas City, arrived with a book for fire
victims.
</P>
<P>
   On its second page was this quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall pass through this way but once; if, therefore, there
can be any kindness I can show or any good thing that I can do, let
me do it now...for I shall never pass this way again....''
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, a spring storm had pummeled Susan Hall's Raytown
patio. She knew her son's gravestone would need cleaning today.
</P>
<P>
   Her 19-year-old son, Isreal Houk, died in a car crash a week
after Mother's Day 1994. Hall visits his grave often. It gives her
peace.
</P>
<P>
   At his grave she reconnects with Isreal just a little, she says.
Sometimes she talks to him. Sometimes she places flowers there.
Sometimes, she just washes away grass and mud from his headstone.
She's even placed cheery pinwheels at his grave that twirl with
each zippy breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Pinwheels are silly, she said, just like he was.
</P>
<P>
   No one asks her anymore if she still misses him. She still cries
for him when she's alone, remembering and thinking about what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else can know what I feel,'' she says. ``Oh, I don't
blame anyone. I mean, it has been five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Society tends to give time limits on grief, she says.
</P>
<P>
   But to a grieving mother, the loss of a child hurts as if it
were yesterday, especially so on May 15, the anniversary of her
child's death.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular May afternoon, with the anniversary still a
few days away, Hall visited his grave once more. That's when she
saw it _ a note, fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned beneath one whirling pinwheel was a crumpled piece of
blue paper. Rain-soaked and dirty, the handwriting was still
legible. As she read it, Hall began to cry:
</P>
<P>
   I have watched the flowers change here for five years. I have
also changed my daughter's for five years. She died May 8, 1994, a
few days before Isreal....My prayers are with you this week. _
Anita Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   Hall read, re-read, then read once more the note, whispering
each word out loud. Somewhere, a stranger and also a mother _ in
fact, a grieving mother _ had taken the time to write her a note.
And somewhere this stranger was praying for her.
</P>
<P>
   Hall stood up, now smiling, holding the message as if it were
precious gold.
</P>
<P>
   She found the gravesite of Anita Huffman's daughter, placed a
pinwheel there, ``one with feminine colors,'' she says, and a
reciprocal note for Huffman. The two mothers finally met one summer
day, when both were at the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hall keeps the note in a corner drawer of her
grandmother's oak dresser, sandwiched inside special greeting cards
from friends and family. The three-by-five inch paper is wrinkled,
with dirt smearing over a few words. Its corners curl where a hole
was once punched through it. But it's still legible. And very
precious.
</P>
<P>
   (BREAK)
</P>
<P>
   Missy Hetland's car quit on Missouri 7 near Garden City.
</P>
<P>
   Hetland, a freshman at College of the Ozarks near Branson, was
on her way to visit family in Kansas. But her car, a lemon yellow
1978 Ford Festiva, wasn't up to it.
</P>
<P>
   She walked to the nearest house, the home of Paul and Rennie
Statham, and asked to call some friends. Paul Statham, who works on
cars, thought maybe he could help. Hetland reminded him of his
grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her friends arrived, James and Mary Taylor of
Harrisonville. But the Taylors, grandparents of her college
roommate, knew nothing about repairing cars.
</P>
<P>
   Statham stepped in. He recharged the car's battery, but it
promptly sputtered out a few feet down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the alternator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went back to his house and returned, driving his tractor to
tow her car to his garage. Then he went to the auto parts store,
bought an alternator and installed it.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, Hetland was on her way again. But
again, the car died.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I know it's the voltage regulator,'' he told them. But the
auto parts store had now closed, so Hetland spent the night with
the Taylors in Harrisonville. They would meet Statham at the auto
store at 8 a.m. the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Statham just knew he had a spare voltage regulator in
his barn loft. He rummaged through his box of car parts. At
midnight, he found it and worked on the car before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   This time the car hummed.
</P>
<P>
   He drove it to a nearby parking lot, then drove his own car to
the parts store. As the Taylors and Hetland drove up, he met them,
grinning wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already fixed,'' he told them. Statham wouldn't accept
any money for his work, but he did ask Hetland to promise not to
set out driving on a long trip without checking out her car first.
</P>
<P>
   As Hetland slid into the driver's seat, a note was on the
steering wheel: God Bless and good-luck.
</P>
<P>
   Statham says he helped Hetland to pay back a personal debt he
owed a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance to return a favor that someone once did for
me,'' he says. ``It used to be a nicer world...Maybe it still is,
sometimes.''

WORLD BANK'S CHIEF ECONOMIST IS RESIGNING  
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joseph E. Stiglitz said Wednesday that he would
resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position
for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the
effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz, who joined the World Bank in February 1997 after
serving as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisers, said he would leave the bank at the end of the year and
would soon return to his academic post at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   His departure will remove from Washington perhaps the most
outspoken voice in the debate over how rich countries can best aid
economic development in poor and crisis-afflicted nations. Over the
last two years in particular, Stiglitz had antagonized officials at
the International Monetary Fund and within the Clinton
administration by criticizing their response to the financial
crisis in Asia and their strategy for encouraging the development
of democratic capitalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz said the decision to leave had been his. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers praised Stiglitz as a ``major creative
and intellectual force,'' and administration officials said the
United States had not sought Stiglitz's removal. Caroline Anstey, a
spokeswoman for the World Bank, said Stiglitz had ``absolutely
not'' been forced out, and the bank's president, James D.
Wolfensohn, praised Stiglitz for having helped to move the
institution ``away from the so-called Washington consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wolfensohn has suggested in the past that Stiglitz was too
quick to second-guess the international aid agencies and the big
industrial nations that control them. ``I think that his recent
things about Russia, in my judgment, are not wholly correct,''
Wolfensohn said during the bank's annual meeting this autumn. ``I
think to stand back later and say, `If you'd done it my way
everything would have been different,' is a little generous to
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz made no secret Wednesday of feeling constrained in his
ability to speak out as freely as he wished. He said he was looking
forward to the unfettered freedom of expression afforded by his
return to the academic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're in an organization there are some pressures,''
Stiglitz said in an interview. ``I felt that it was important for
my intellectual integrity to be able to express myself as
forcefully as I thought was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal with a strong belief that governments and institutions
have a significant role to play in economic development and that
market forces cannot be counted on to deal with every problem,
Stiglitz challenged the prevailing orthodoxy among policy makers in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the monetary fund went overboard in Asia in
demanding that the countries ensnared in the financial crisis cut
their budgets, arguing that fiscal austerity sometimes extracted
too high a price from poor people without generating a
corresponding improvement in international economic confidence.
</P>
<P>
   He took issue with the view held by the fund and the U.S.
government that controls on the international flow of capital were
counterproductive or impractical, saying that in some cases it was
justified to restrict short-term flows of money in and out of a
developing economy. He said industrialized countries sometimes
pushed developing nations too fast to deregulate their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the United States and the monetary fund had
failed to acknowledge that their prescription for Russia _ quick
privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight
of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to
the rest of the world _ had not produced the intended results and
indeed had left many people worse off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the
excluded, and he's been one of the best things in the World Bank in
the last decade,'' said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, which
promotes poverty-fighting policies. ``He's also been very pointed
and insightful in discussing the role of the IMF. We're not used to
that kind of candor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at
the Treasury Department and the monetary fund. But his message was
greeted enthusiastically in poor countries, and he said he was
leaving the bank feeling that he had helped to stimulate a more
vigorous debate about the policy prescriptions that wealthy nations
impose on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some of the specific issues, there has emerged really a
broad consensus behind the views I took,'' Stiglitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a recognition that policies in East Asia were
excessively contractionary on the fiscal side,'' he continued.
``There's a recognition that capital market liberalization, in the
absence of adequate regulatory structures, exposes countries to
much higher risks. And on the debate about economies in transition,
there's a general consensus that the issues I've been raising are
the right issues, and that while no one has the answers, we're not
going to get answers until we're willing to ask the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz had told friends recently that he intended to leave,
and he informed Wolfensohn Wednesday morning of his decision.
Wolfensohn said Stiglitz would continue to act as an adviser to him
and Stiglitz would lead the search for a new chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anstey, the bank's spokeswoman, said that asking Stiglitz to
head the search committee was a signal of the institution's
``intention to select someone who will continue the
Wolfensohn-Stiglitz agenda'' of focusing more on the needs of poor
countries and less on more orthodox policies developed in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz said his approach was built around two basic themes:
giving more of a voice to poor nations in setting policy and
recognizing the crucial role that government must play in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rebalancing our thinking about the role of the state,''
Stiglitz said. ``Some of the failures, like in East Asia, involve
cases where government did too little, like in financial
regulation, rather than too much.''

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: GORE, RUNNING IN IOWA, RUNS HARD FROM CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Pa.)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa _ As Vice President Al Gore tries to sell
himself as his own man, unencumbered by President Clinton and his
scandals, it is hardly a surprise that he plays down his ties to
the politician he hopes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore may be taking things to an extreme. He has has
practically banned the dreaded ``C word'' from his vocabulary. In a
campaign swing on Monday and Tuesday that brought him before
several partisan audiences in southeastern and western Iowa and in
a quick flight to Chicago for a fund-raising dinner, Gore mentioned
the president only once _ and only because he did not have much
choice.
</P>
<P>
   At the event in Chicago, he was listing the administrations that
had advocated a nuclear test ban treaty _ ``Clinton, Carter, Bush
and Reagan administrations'' _ so he could not easily have excluded
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Gore goes through verbal contortions to avoid
mentioning Clinton. At an open meeting of undecided Democratic
voters Tuesday in this town on the western border of Iowa, one
person stood up and asked Gore to describe the best thing that has
happen to this country in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's instinct was to blow the Clinton administration's horn _
and his own. But that was no easy trick given that he did not dare
mention the president.
</P>
<P>
   So, using fractured sentences and odd tenses, the vice president
cited the administration's economic accomplishments but did not
cite the administration. It was as if he took his old talking
points and excised any mention of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have the strongest economy in the history of the
United States,'' Gore said, citing the ``end of the recession of
the Reagan-Bush years'' and ``having 20 million new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pretend-Clinton-does-not-exist approach seemed to work. Gore
received a hearty applause.
</P>
<P>
   A Chairman on a Tightrope
</P>
<P>
   When Mayor Edward Rendell of Philadelphia was installed as
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee several weeks
ago, some who back Gore's rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, groused that Rendell had been a bit too friendly with the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The concern was that Rendell's past relationship with Gore would
interfere with the custom that a party chairman is supposed to be
neutral in a contested primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's backers would not have been heartened when Rendell
introduced the vice president on Monday at a lavish fund-raising
dinner in Chicago that raised about $700,000 for the national
party.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Rendell was even-handed. ``We have two candidates who
could both stand up and be president of the United States today,''
he said. ``And they are right on the issues!''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Rendell edged toward the Gore camp: ``We also
have, as I said, two good candidates _ but one who has served this
country in a way that I think is unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell went on to recall that he had once described Gore as the
best vice president in history. But then, not wanting to be accused
of hyperbole, he scaled back his praise a bit, saying that ``no
question about it,'' he was the best No. 2 ``in our lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pop Quiz on Football
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hansen, a retired civilian employee for the military,
ambled up to Gore at the open meeting here and announced, ``I have
a pop quiz for you, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president visibly winced before managing a meek,
``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? After Gov. George W. Bush of Texas flunked
a pop quiz on foreign leaders earlier this month from a Boston
television reporter, politicians are on the lookout.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Gore, Hansen was only teasing. He asked him which
team he favored for the national college football championship:
Florida State, Nebraska or Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a stumper. When Hansen mentioned Nebraska, he
stomped his foot. And Nebraska, of course, borders Iowa, so it was
no surprise which team is the favorite in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   It was an easy pander for the vice president. ``Nebraska's
looking good,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bridge to Local Issues
</P>
<P>
   Except when he steps off the stairs from Air Force Two, it is
easy to forget these days that Al Gore is the understudy to the
leader of the free world. On trips, he eschews the
vice-presidential seal. And he eschews a tie (except at big-money
fund-raisers like the one in Chicago).
</P>
<P>
   But Gore may have gotten carried away with his
I'm-just-a-man-of-the-people theme when he addressed members of a
senior citizens center in Fort Madison, in the southeast corner of
Iowa. He sounded like Mayor Gore when he mentioned how he and the
local congressman, Leonard Boswell, had been chatting about repairs
needed on a nearby bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidentally, Leonard's been talking to me about this
bridge,'' Gore said. After describing how the lanes curved, Gore
asked his audience, ``Does that need to be changed?''
</P>
<P>
   By tailoring his remarks for the locals, the vice president may
have won some converts. But he also gave more fodder to Bradley,
who likes to portray himself as the purveyor of big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   An Absent Star Next Door
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising dinner on Monday at the sprawling home of Lou
and Ruth Weisbach in the Chicago suburbs was a success.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore was a big draw, several of the Weisbach's guests
seemed more interested in the man who lives next door: Michael
Jordan, the basketball star. In case there was any doubt, the gate
to the star's driveway was decorated with a huge number 23, the
number on his Chicago Bulls uniform. (No one could spot a basket in
the driveway, though.)
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely that Jordan was invited. He has already given
money to his fellow veteran of the NBA, the former senator from New
Jersey.

FLY-ANGLING FROM SHORE TAKES OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENAVISTA, Mexico _ In Baja California Sur, where the East Cape
is fabled for its big-game angling, billfish get top billing.
</P>
<P>
   So how can surf-fishing possibly compete in a region known for
its bountiful open waters?
</P>
<P>
   Very well, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   For the fly-angler bent on feisty inshore quarry in a remarkable
array of sizes and varieties, marlin and sailfish may soon be
merely afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of very interesting and challenging fish that
live within 50 yards, 75 yards of the beach,'' said Dave Cooper, a
Castle Rock, Colo., market research analyst who fly-fishes
exclusively and makes an annual pilgrimage to Baja's southeastern
tip. ``The most-difficult-to-catch fish are the fish that are just
right along the coastline.''
</P>
<P>
   Pargo renowned for their canny ability to race for the rocks
once hooked and break off the line. Roosterfish _ once thought
impossible to fool on artificial lures, let alone flies _ to 50
pounds or more within a dozen feet of shore. Ladyfish, a smaller
cousin of the tarpon and worthy of its lineage. Sierra mackerel
with teeth sharp enough to cut off about every third line they pick
up.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about diversity; there are 850 species that swim in
Southern Baja and it seems like most can be hooked while your feet
are planted in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the angler is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beach is far more interactive than fishing on a boat,''
explained Gary Graham, who two years ago added surf-fishing to the
Baja on the Fly guide service he formed with his wife, Yvonne, in
1992. ``You go offshore... and you're kind of left to the
discretion of the captain; where he goes, you go, so on and so
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   What allows anglers to be so in control are the four-wheeled
motorbikes _ all-terrain vehicle better known as ATVs _ Graham
employs. Indeed, if you can kick the gears, thumb the throttle and
grip the brakes, you can determine where and when to fish. Even if
you aren't able to operate the machine, you can bark out your
desires from the back of the bike when someone else is driving;
anglers often ride in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do this kind of fishing, you have the opportunity of
saying, `Aha, there's a fish, I want to stop,' and stop and fish
for it,'' said Graham, 58, who guides out of Hotel Buenavista Beach
Resort, immediately northeast of La Capilla _ his home 200 to 260
days of the year. Back stateside, his company is based in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is so unique about the beach is that you can
travel up and down on the shore on the ATVs and it's an interactive
exercise. You make the decision to get off the bike, back on the
bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is something entirely thrilling about the wind
blowing through your hair at sunup riding atop a smooth machine
equipped with an 8-weight rod and a stripping basket. On the bow of
a boat, one may feel the ocean's spray; the closest you'll get to
that sensation on an ATV is a splash of sand in your face when you
get too close to the vehicle in front.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop came when Graham spotted the distinct comb of a
roosterfish after a precipitous decline on the bikes. I never saw
it, but he assured me the rooster was there. While the consequent
casts did not yield our target, Graham did hook up on a ladyfish.
</P>
<P>
   After landing the specimen and letting Cocci _ his West
Highlands terrier mix and constant companion _ inspect the prize,
Graham made several in a series of insights and suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to use a fast, two-handed strip on the retrieve to
entice fish to the baitfish imitations. When there is a strike,
don't lift the rod like a trout angler might do; instead, pull on
the line in a maneuver known as a strip set. These are not delicate
fish that are best fought with the flexible top section of the rod
_ which is primarily used for casting. No, these are hardy,
tough-lipped critters that can only be landed after a jarring
hook-set and a fight using the bottom half of the rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember when you are fighting a fish to keep the
rod relatively flat, like at a 30-degree angle off of center, so
that you're allowing the rod to bend more in the base part, where
it has more strength,'' explained Graham, author of ``Guide to Fly
Fishing Southern Baja'' (David Communications; $18.95) and a member
of the exclusive Catalina Island Tuna Club.
</P>
<P>
   From that spot of sand, a ride of 10 minutes or so brought us
within view of shorebirds crashing into the surf, which indicated a
mess of baitfish on the surface, which indicated a mess of game
fish below pushing up their prey.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I was into the first of 10 jack crevalle _
2- to 3-pound bundles of energy that would easily pull trout of
similar size backward, if tied tail-to-tail.
</P>
<P>
   The morning was awesome and the sights supreme. Immediately
inshore, egrets and osprey called brackish lagoons home. Beyond,
thunderheads dissipated as quickly as they formed over the Sierra
de la Laguna mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon was spent aboard a pontoon, a vehicle Graham uses
to exploit nearshore waters. I cast over several fish but only
managed to boat a single needlefish, albeit a very spirited one. If
it's offshore tuna, dorado and billfish you're after, Graham also
can accommodate. But the shore is his bread and butter, attracting
many anglers who tire of the waiting game that is billfishing or
are prone to seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only after some trepidation he ``opened up the
beach'' to the 250 to 600 clients that Graham and his guides _ up
to 10 at a time _ cater to each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beach up until two years ago used to be my own little,
private fishery, then I started it off and without a doubt it is
the most popular,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Back in Kafr el-Dabusi, a farming community set
against the lush fields and irrigation canals of the Nile delta,
the villagers still remember the dashing young airman who would
circle in his small plane, scaring the pigeons from their roosts
and sending the women trilling in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 1960s, an era of great national pride, when the
1952 revolution that toppled King Farouk and Gamal Abdel Nasser's
1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal still fueled a contagious
headiness. The airman, Gameel el-Batouty, was a kind of local hero,
the youngest son of the village's most prominent family, seen as
part of a new generation coming of age in Egypt, eager to explore
new horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget how proud we all were of him,'' said a
brother, Fakhri el-Batouty, 70.
</P>
<P>
   There was reason for that pride to endure. Batouty went on to
serve in the military during a time of war with Israel. He was a
flight instructor, and many of the pilots he trained, like him,
later joined one of Egypt's national companies, EgyptAir, assuming
a place in that great state-run enclave of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of modern Egypt, friends, relatives and other
associates said, Batouty over the course of his life seemed to
embody stability _ as a good Muslim, a devoted family man who kept
in touch with his rural roots to the point that he had promised to
finance the construction of a new village mosque back in Kafr
el-Dabusi.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all of Egypt knows about Batouty, but it is an awful
prominence he has suddenly gained, one that has nothing to do with
his life of accomplishment and modest hometown stardom. Batouty was
among 217 people who plunged to their deaths aboard EgyptAir Flight
990 on Oct. 31, and U.S. investigators, in their best theory of
what happened at 33,000 feet, suspect that Batouty may have caused
the crash deliberately, by pointing the Boeing 767 and everyone
aboard on a fatal path toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, who have come to no formal conclusions, have
based their working theory of the crash on several facts: there is
no evidence of mechanical trouble before the plane began its
descent; the cockpit voice recorder appears to show that Batouty,
who was not scheduled to fly the plane until later in the flight,
was in fact in command of the plane when, after the pilot had
briefly left his seat, several fatal actions were taken, starting
with the autopilot being disengaged and the plane's nose being
pushed down in a steep dive. Those actions, the investigators
believe, are hard to explain other than by attributing them to an
intentional desire to doom the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, including agents with the FBI, have only recently
begun a meticulous examination of Batouty's life, and there is no
way to forecast what, if anything, they might find in the way of
evidence or explanations to support or discredit their suspicions.
And no one, investigators included, has offered anything
approaching a rationale for why Batouty might have crashed the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Egyptian authorities have made available no
detailed information about Batouty, who was a relief pilot aboard
the flight and died at the age of 59, just months away from
retirement. They have said only that they know of nothing unusual
in his personal and medical background.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture painted of Batouty by those who knew him best
seems, absent a secret life yet to be uncovered, starkly at odds
with any notion of someone who might have done what the U.S.
investigators suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Batouty remember him as a generous friend
untouched by greed. He moved easily, they said, between two worlds
_ the familiar one of Egypt and the new frontier of the United
States, his regular destination as a co-pilot. He regularly piloted
the plane himself on the prestigious Cairo-New York-Los Angeles
route.
</P>
<P>
   On long layovers in America, he arranged first-class medical
treatment for his ailing youngest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   From his salary, and by selling land inherited from his father,
Batouty also managed to acquire the badges of prosperity of Egypt's
urban upper middle-class. He owned a late-model car and three
residences, including a villa on the sea and another outside Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud that Captain Gameel is from this village,'' said
Said Harb, a farmer in Kafr el-Dubusi.

 &UR; CAIRO, Egypt: Kafr el-Dubusi. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Batouty was born March 4, 1940, the seventh and last child of a
prosperous landowning family in Kafr el-Dabusi, not far from the
provincial capital of Mansoura, near the eastern branch of the
Nile. Even today, the village has no telephone service and only one
paved road.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, and as head of the dominant family, his father, Hamed
Batouty, was something of a feudal lord, overseeing the local
villagers who grew corn, bananas, rice and other crops on the
family's 60 acres of farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty attended the Lycee in Mansoura, an elite school where
classes were taught in both French and Arabic, living there with an
elder sister and her husband. A cousin, Dr. Fathi Batouty, who
attended the school with him, remembered Gameel as a happy-go-lucky
but good student, who was handsome and not averse to chasing after
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Like other family members of his generation, Batouty saw his
future in Cairo, where two of his three older brothers, one of them
Fakhri, had already gravitated in pursuit of university degrees and
professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to Cairo, we liked it,'' said Fakhri el-Batouty,
a retired executive in Egypt's state-owned Hotel Tourism Company.
``We did not want to return to the village because there were no
careers for us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Such individual journeys from countryside to city had already
begun to transform post-revolutionary Egypt. Leaders like Anwar
el-Sadat and Hosni Mubarak made their way from the black-earthed
farmland of the Nile delta.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those men and their closest associates, Batouty did
not enter the army or air force. Instead, he moved in with another
sister in Cairo and persuaded his father to pay for his training in
a civilian career.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty would become a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   When Batouty did move to the air force in the mid-1960s, friends
said, it was not by choice. With tension building again between
Israel and its Arab neighbors, Nasser had embarked on a
pilot-training program, part of a military buildup that preceded
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty was assigned to the air force academy, where Mubarak,
the fighter pilot who would later become president, was the
commandant. But as an instructor, Batouty had no place among the
combat aviators and their Russian-made MiG jets; his job was with
students, in single-engine propeller planes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as an air force major, Batouty continued to work at a
civilian aviation institute. He returned there full time as a
senior flight instructor in 1983. In one way or another, his
colleagues estimate, he served as teacher to men who make up fully
half of EgyptAir's 533 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some of those former students persuaded Batouty that
he ought to seize an opportunity to see the world. At their urging,
and at the age of 47, he joined EgyptAir in 1987 as a first
officer. He would eventually earn a salary of more than $6,000 a
month _ more than 40 times the average salary in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty also became eligible for a wide range of benefits, the
kinds of hidden luxuries that Egypt's state-run institutions have
historically provided to high-ranking employees to substitute for
generally substandard pay _ free flights for family members and
free medical care at the company's own hospital.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, he was winning assignments flying the Boeing 767-300,
whose long range had only that year enabled EgyptAir to begin
nonstop service between Cairo and New York. Still, Batouty remained
a first officer, outranked and outpaid by younger men who had
joined EgyptAir earlier in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Batouty's friends, including Mark Abdelazim, a concierge
in a Manhattan apartment building who knew Batouty for 10 years,
said that he had been disappointed not to have been promoted. But
Walid Murad, head of the EgyptAir pilots' association, said that,
because of his relatively advanced age and limited airline
experience, Batouty had never expected to become a full pilot and
had never taken the airline pilots' test required to secure
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his colleagues say, Batouty was respected and treated as
an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called him captain,'' said Hamza Emeira, a fellow EgyptAir
pilot. ``Always.''
</P>
<P>
   As a husband and a father, Batouty straddled several worlds, his
friends and neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people like him come to the city, they keep their good,
conservative rural traditions and mingle with city life, and
mostly, they are the best,'' said Sawsan Kamal, a close family
friend who is the wife of an EgyptAir pilot.
</P>
<P>
   An observant Muslim, Batouty prayed five times a day, in
accordance with Islamic teachings, his relatives said. He made a
pilgrimage last winter to Mecca, accompanied by his wife, Umayma
Dahi, whom he had married in 1965 and is the mother of the couple's
five children.
</P>
<P>
   Only occasionally did he return to his home village, but he
usually did so during Ramadan, when he would distribute cash to the
poor in accordance with Islamic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, using money from the sale of his inherited hometown
property, he put aside funds to help smooth the Batouty children's
way into marriage; he bought apartments for the two eldest, Amr,
now 29, and Sally, 27, after they found spouses.
</P>
<P>
   In his religious beliefs, Batouty showed no sign of extremism,
his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, he blocked his son Mohammed's choice of a bride,
exercising traditional veto power. But he relented earlier this
year, and gave an engagement party for his son, now 22 and a recent
graduate of Egypt's police academy.
</P>
<P>
   But the trials he experienced with his youngest child, Aya, who
was born in 1990, may have presented Batouty with his biggest
personal test.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, whom he called ``my blessing,'' was diagnosed at
the age of 5 with skin cancer. She was treated with chemotherapy by
Egyptian doctors, lost her hair and good humor, and still showed no
sign of getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Not until three years later, when Batouty, in despair, brought
his daughter with him to the United States, did he learn that Aya
had been misdiagnosed. She was suffering not from cancer but lupus,
an immune system disorder that cannot be cured but responds
favorably to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After an intervention by Hamdi el-Tahan, a friend and member of
the Egyptian parliament, EgyptAir's chairman, Mohammed Fahim Rayan,
approved a loan of about $6,000 for Batouty to help pay for Aya's
medical treatment in the United States. Batouty nevertheless felt
compelled to sell more land to cover the medical bills, Tahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that he was in financial trouble was disputed by Dr.
Mohsen Hamza, a Beverly Hills neurologist who is married to
Batouty's niece and who helped arrange the daughter's treatment at
the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. Hamza
insisted that the treatment had not imposed a financial burden on
Batouty, and that the girl had recently been pronounced well on her
way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Cairo on what would be his final flight, Batouty
seemed to have been busily preparing himself for retirement, which
would have become mandatory in March.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Batouty told friends, he intended to spend time with
his family. And knowing that free trips to the United States would
soon become a thing of the past, he had promised to take his wife
to New York with him in December, to celebrate their 35th wedding
anniversary. They had been hoping for the celebration to be on New
Year's Eve.

RIORDAN CRITICIZES CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Offering a sharp rebuke of Congress, Mayor Richard
Riordan said the nation needs an agenda of offering health care to
the poor and improving the educational system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the question, `What can we do to help the poor
people of this country?', the politicians in Washington don't have
the foggiest idea of what to do,'' Riordan said Wednesday during
his monthly ``Ask the Mayor'' show on radio station KFWB (980 AM).
</P>
<P>
   ``They give speeches and talk about this, but they know nothing.
Health care and education should be our top priorities. Our
national agenda should be to give the tools to compete in society
to the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime advocate of education reform _ the mayor helped
finance the campaign of four school board members this year to take
over the Los Angeles Unified School District _ Riordan said he
believes school systems need tough managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education can only be solved at the local level and you need
people to manage the district who are willing to fire people who
fail children,'' Riordan said. ``It's not enough to put computers
in classrooms and have smaller class sizes if they aren't being
taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan also questioned the effectiveness of making the Internet
available to school children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 99 percent of the cases, it's a waste of time where they
are playing games or in chat rooms,'' said Riordan, who has been an
advocate and whose charitable foundation has paid to put computers
in classrooms. ``The kids are better off being taught to read and
write and do arithmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   On health care, the mayor pointed to the program he put together
two years ago to try to make sure children eligible for Medicare
are receiving medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is a county responsibility, but we in the city
have to do all we can to make sure they get as much money as
possible,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are over 300,000 kids in L.A. who are eligible for
Medicare and aren't getting it. That's what we're trying to do with
our Program Healthy Start.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said such a program could be administered through the
school district, but would require the county to provide the money.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan also was questioned about the ongoing Los Angeles Police
Department corruption investigation at Rampart Division and he
continued to offer his support of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this was the result of a more than year-long
investigation by the Police Department,'' Riordan said. ``Any time
you have a 10,000-person organization, you are going to have 1 or 2
percent who are bad apples. Bernie Parks is doing all he can to get
those out of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan also was quizzed on improving traffic _ ``We have to do
more to convince people to get out of their cars or share them'' _
as well as his plans for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to watch some football and eat turkey,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   And, even after being prodded to follow the example of President
Clinton and spare a turkey for the holiday, Riordan demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like turkey,'' the mayor said. ``I'm going to eat a turkey
dinner.''

MEXICO GROUNDS ENTIRE FLEET OF AIRLINE INVOLVED IN CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Texas)   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Citing safety concerns about aircraft operated by
Mexico's third-largest airline, known as Taesa, aviation
authorities have ordered the airline to ground its fleet and
suspend operations.
</P>
<P>
   The government order came late Tuesday, two weeks after a Taesa
commuter plane crashed west of Mexico City, killing all 18
passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The order grounded the 27 aircraft operated by Transportes
Aereos Ejecutivos SA, a low-cost operator founded in 1988, and left
thousands of passengers scrambling to exchange Taesa tickets for
seats on aircraft run by Mexico's two larger airlines, Aeromexico
and Mexicana.
</P>
<P>
   Taesa flights were suspended between several Mexican cities and
three U.S. destinations: Oakland, Calif.; Chicago; and Laredo,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Taesa is heavily in debt and has been trying a financial
restructuring. The intervention raised questions about whether the
airline could survive financially, even if the government
inspectors who were swarming over the carrier's aircraft and books
Wednesday were eventually to recertify the company to operate new
flights.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by Mexican officials, with participation by
U.S. technicians, is continuing into the causes of the Nov. 9 crash
of a Taesa DC9-31. After the crash, Mexican inspectors also stepped
up inspections of all Taesa aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``A series of anomalies and incidents have come to light, which
the airline has been correcting but have occurred repeatedly,''
Aaron Dychter Poltarek, Mexico's deputy secretary of communications
and transport, told reporters as he announced his suspension order.
``This measure will let us verify all the airline's systems and
procedures, in its business and in its aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.7 million passengers flew on Taesa flights in the
first three quarters of 1999, Dychter said. The company has
controlled about 10 percent of Mexico's air passenger market,
specializing in destinations between Mexico City and Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Taesa considers safety to be the No. 1 priority, it will
abide by this decision, gladly collaborating with authorities so
that all these doubts can be cleared up,'' the company said in a
statement faxed to news organizations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taesa has 3,000 employees, 300 of whom are flight attendants.
Some of the flight attendants have been trying to decertify their
union, which is allied with Mexico's governing party, and to
affiliate with a more aggressive independent union. After the Nov.
9 crash, Alejandra Barrales, the leader of the independent union,
accused Taesa of filing deceptive maintenance logs about several of
its aircraft to cover up what she called recurring mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A Lear jet operated by Taesa on a charter flight crashed in June
1994 at Dulles International Airport, killing all 10 passengers and
two crew members. The National Transportation Safety Board reported
after an investigation that the probable causes of the accident
were ``poor decision making, poor airmanship and relative
inexperience of the captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Orders to ground an airline's entire fleet for safety reasons
are rare. John Macdonald, a partner at Aviation Management
Services, a company in Miami that services Latin America's airline
industry, said he could not recall any other time when the entire
fleet of an airline in the region had been grounded for safety
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aviation regulators temporarily grounded Valujet Airlines
on concerns about safety after one of its jets crashed in the
Everglades in May 1996, killing all 110 people aboard. That airline
subsequently renamed itself Airtran Airways.

EAST CAPE'S TACKLE MAN A REEL CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENAVISTA, Mexico _ Rent tackle in this isolated East Cape
mecca for saltwater anglers and you'll encounter Steve Chism.
</P>
<P>
   And when you do you may well think to yourself, like I did,
``I'll bet you there's a real character.''
</P>
<P>
   Chism is the first to agree: ``I'm sure some people come away
with that notion, and some of them know it's for a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of wry humor one can expect from a man who spends
his workday in a sparse, fenced-in hut that resembles a cage. But
the tiny facility is as close to paradise as the owner of the
tackle concession at the 60-room Hotel Buenavista Beach Resort has
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different way of life; it's not just a job,''
Chism said in a frail voice that emits drawn-out words. ``There is
not a whole lot of pressure or anything. The guys come through,
they get the tackle, you talk to the people a little bit, then
they're gone and you do whatever else there you have to do for the
day. Maybe go do something else (errands) you want to do and be
back in time to pick (the tackle) up.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay Area native first became enamored with the
East Cape during a fishing trip in 1976. Soon he was overcome by
the draw of angling and the quaint, docile community _ so much so
that by 1981 he up and quit his job gunsmithing and selling
firearms and fishing tackle in Oakland and moved down. Shortly
afterward he was offered a job by the hotel's owner, ``Chuy''
Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time there were 13 rooms, so (my duties included)
anything that was necessary _ from doing the payroll to washing the
dishes,'' the 57-year-old Chism explained. ``Whatever, you name it;
if it had to be done, somebody did it and a lot of times it was
me.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1985 he was able to purchase property and a home two miles up
the highway. Today his sole income is derived from the tackle
concession, which also rents kayaks and snorkel gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough that I can do pretty much what I want to do,'' he
said. ``All the toys are mine. I don't owe anybody money or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   From hired hand to business owner, Chism is somewhat of an
institution in these parts. ``He's like the old man,'' said the
hotel's manager Axel Valdez, 26, son of the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't get a hint of the respect he garners from the title
or job description on Chism's business card; he doesn't have one.
Heck, his rental operation isn't even named.
</P>
<P>
   However, one can't miss that inimitable beard, which only
further belies his reverence. Blond on the outside, salt and pepper
in the middle, the wiry, largely unkempt affair hasn't been trimmed
since Christmas Eve 1997. ``Nobody confuses me with Santa Claus,''
Chism clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Yet image is of little concern in Southern Baja California, as
one can tell by his broken shoes and a watchband that has seen much
better days. ``You don't have to keep up with the Joneses or
anything like that,'' he said. ``I probably haven't bought a hat or
a T-shirt since I've been here; (visitors) are always giving you
hats or something. And I just keep the raggedy shoes around till
they fall off.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Chism gets ribbed about his appearance _ and his
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He observes things in a different manner,'' Axel Valdez said.
``When he sees something's wrong, he'll be sure to tell you it's
wrong, but he won't tell you how to fix it, so that's a big help.''

PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES CLOSE TO CASH DEAL TO BUY WEST COAST
INVESTMENT BANK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   By PATRICK McGEEHAN with LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The brokerage unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America is in the final stages of negotiations to buy Volpe Brown
Whelan &AMP; Co., one of the last independent investment banks on the
West Coast, people close to the talks said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities, the nation's fifth-largest securities
firm, is expected to announce the cash acquisition soon, possibly
next week, these people said. Executives of the two firms are
expected to continue discussions this weekend, but as with any
deal, talks could still fall apart until an agreement is signed.
The purchase price, which Prudential does not plan to disclose,
could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Volpe, a private firm, would give Prudential a bigger
presence in the hottest investment sector, emerging technology
companies. It would also mark the end of an era, of sorts. After
commercial banks gobbled up its competitors, Volpe is the last of a
breed of San Francisco-based investment banking boutiques that
specialized in financing young companies in Silicon Valley and the
San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal that was announced last month, Chase Manhattan is
buying one of Volpe's larger local competitors, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,
for $1.35 billion. Chase hopes to complete that transaction before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Volpe was chief executive of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist before he
founded Volpe in 1986. Volpe could not be reached for comment; a
spokesman for Volpe declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Prudential Securities also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential, which has about 6,500 brokers nationwide, has been
trying to raise its profile as a stock underwriter. In June, it
paid an undisclosed amount to acquire Vector Securities
International, a small investment bank that specializes in health
care financing. Vector's founder, D. Theodore Berghorst, was named
Prudential's top health care banker
</P>
<P>
   Prudential has been looking for somebody to head its technology
banking business since last month when David Weild left that
position to run Prudential Securities.com, the firm's online
operations. Weild's successor would most likely come from Volpe if
a deal is completed, said one person inside Prudential.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition by Prudential would end an alliance between Volpe
and another Wall Street firm, Credit Suisse First Boston. Since
March 1997, Credit Suisse First Boston has owned 25 percent of
Volpe through a venture that was intended to give it an entry into
the technology industry on the West Coast. At the time, Credit
Suisse First Boston and other big Wall Street firms were struggling
to make inroads in Silicon Valley, which has been the prime
breeding ground for the most popular stocks in the long bull market
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, First Boston has spent huge sums to hire two teams
of investment bankers and research analysts that have made the
alliance with Volpe much less important to the firm. Early this
year, Credit Suisse First Boston hired the entire technology
banking team away from Deutsche Bank, the giant German bank. In
July, Credit Suisse First Boston followed up by hiring about 35
members of Deutsche Bank's health care investment banking team.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves have helped Credit Suisse First Boston establish
itself as a major underwriter of first-time stock offerings this
year. Last quarter, no investment bank underwrote more initial
offerings than Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, which has operated largely independent of First Boston,
has played a smaller and less lucrative role in the Internet stock
boom. This year, it has been the lead underwriter of a few initial
offerings and a co-manager of many others, including one this month
for Next Level Communications.

WOUNDED MOTHER WON'T TALK TO POLICE ABOUT SONS' SLAYINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KRYSTN SHRIEVE WITH LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORPARK, Calif. -- The mother of three boys fatally shot in
their hilltop mansion was recovering from a bullet wound to the
head but declined to talk to investigators, who said no arrest was
expected for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies by the Ventura County coroner determined that each of
the youngsters died from a single gunshot wound to the head.
Officials refused to divulge the caliber of the gun used or whether
the bullets recovered during the autopsies could have matched a
handgun found in the victims' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we collect the bullets we have to ship them to
forensics,'' sheriff's Deputy Eric Nishimoto said. ``It's not a
15-minute test. Those tests will take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys' father, Dr. Xavier J. Caro, a prominent rheumatologist
with a practice in suburban Los Angeles, called 911 about 11:20
p.m. Monday to report the shootings in his Presilla Drive home.
When emergency personnel arrived at his home, he answered the door
holding his infant son, who was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Caro spent most of Tuesday being questioned by police and
remained in seclusion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County sheriff's investigators continued to gather
evidence in the slayings of Xavier ``Joey'' Caro Jr., 11, who was
found dead in his bedroom, and Michael Anthony Caro, 8, and
Christopher Laurence Caro, 5, who were killed in the room they
shared.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Socorro ``Cora'' Caro, was found in another room
with a gunshot wound to the upper right side of her head. She
underwent surgery at Los Robles Regional Medical Center, and her
condition was upgraded Wednesday from critical to serious, said
spokeswoman Kris Carraway-Bowman. She also was taken off a
ventilator that had helped her to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tried to interview Cora Caro but she ``chose not to
speak with them,'' Nishimoto said. A lack of a statement from Cora
Caro would force authorities to rely more heavily on the physical
evidence and slow down the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three bodies here,'' sheriff's Sgt. Steve Bourke
said. ``Conceivably, the investigation could take three times as
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials refused again to identify any suspects in the case,
but reiterated earlier statements they are not focusing on anyone
outside the Caro home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all the different alternatives still,''
Nishimoto said Wednesday. ``Yesterday we did the gathering and
today we're doing the sifting. We have hundreds of statements to go
out and validate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora Caro's mother and husband had called the hospital Tuesday
to check on her progress, and she received calls from friends and
her family priest on Wednesday, Carraway-Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Helmstedter, principal at Santa Rosa Elementary School,
where all three slain boys attended classes, released a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Caro volunteered in each of the boys' classrooms.
Teachers described her as eager and ready to help,'' the statement
said. ``She was willing to do what it takes from running off papers
to listening to students read. She stopped first thing each time
she came in to hug Joey. She was positive and helpful to the
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 50 or 60 parents at the school _ where the boys
were in kindergarten, second and fifth grades _ attended a meeting
Wednesday with district psychologist Candra Shiney-Norris, who
talked with them about how to address their child's emotional
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were mostly concerned about how how to talk with their
children about the shootings, and wanted to know how much to reveal
about the incident. Some parents said their children had trouble
sleeping Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have complete knowledge of who did this, so some
children were worried that there was someone out there who might
attack their house,'' Shiny-Norris said. ``They need to be
reassured that they are safe. What to say depends on the age of the
child. Kids are going to have a lot of questions and their parents
are a good resource and should listen and take the cue from their
child.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dr. Caro's office on Wednesday, workers fielded calls from
concerned patients who mostly offered their sympathy, said an
employee who did not identify herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of calls expressing sympathy,'' the
employee said. ``He's a great doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The employee recalled how Caro would sometimes spend time in the
office with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always laughing with them, always cheerful with the
kids when they'd stop by sometimes with their mom or
grandparents,'' the employee said.

KEEP THE FISH FRESH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY BRIGHTENBURG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ OK, so you've made your catch, and it's a keeper.
What's the best way to prepare and preserve it to ensure the best
quality at the kitchen table?
</P>
<P>
   Bleed the fish _ especially tuna, bonito and yellowtail _ to
minimize foul taste by clipping the gill or making an incision
around the base of the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Then ice the fish, if possible; private boaters have the
advantage here. If ice is not available, keep the fish cool by
stashing it in the shade and periodically wetting the gunnysack.
</P>
<P>
   Determine who will fillet the fish. You can take the fish home
and do it yourself; private boaters can fillet it on board. Party
boaters can pay crew members to perform the task.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, make certain the fillet is placed into a plastic,
zip-fastened bag and nearly sealed close. Then dip the entire bag
into water _ the baitwell in many cases _ to release all air and
reduce the risk of freezer burn. Air is the culprit and must be
kept clear of the meal if it is to be frozen.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternate to filleting, some landings _ frequently those
that cater to multiday and long-range passengers _ offer canning or
smoking services. Determine those options before embarking on the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, release anything that is more than you can use or give
away. &QL;

   Saltwater fishing tips are offered occasionally by San Diego

Brightenburg. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

CANNON STILL BRINGING IMAGES OF BAJA TO LIFE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some called Ray Cannon the pied piper of Baja
California, drawing American anglers to a Mexican bounty of game
fish in the land he came to love and glorify through his writings.
He drew a faithful readership penning weekly columns in Western
Outdoors News for nearly a quarter century and by way of his
renowned 1966 book ``The Sea of Cortez.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his legacy _ and the social and economic growth of the
region he helped to popularize _ has survived long after his death
in 1977 at age 84, it has received a major boost from Gene S.
Kira's ``The Unforgettable Sea of Cortez: Baja California's Golden
Age 1947-1977 _ The Life and Writings of Ray Cannon'' (Cortez
Publications, $39.95).
</P>
<P>
   Much more than a simple rehash of Cannon's musings, the 362-page
title by the co-author of the fishing and travel guidebook ``The
Baja Catch'' (Apples &AMP; Oranges Publishers) blends more than 400
classic photos by Cannon and others with Kira's insightful text to
revitalize the man's observations.
</P>
<P>
   Together they represent a definitive history of Baja destined to
grace the bookshelves of anyone who shares Cannon's passion for
this promised land of angling. &QL;

EBAY IS TOLD THAT IT SELLS NAZI MEMORABILIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   The online auction service eBay Inc. has come under fire
previously for letting people bid on pornography and firearms.
Wednesday, it encountered more problems when a group that monitors
anti-Semitism complained about the sale of Nazi memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   A letter sent to the company by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles said items that ``glorify Nazism'' were being auctioned
and noted that the sale of such items was illegal in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal here is not to get eBay indicted,'' said Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, associate dean of the center. ``My goal is to keep eBay
from selling Nazi memorabilia in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for eBay, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said
that the company already prohibited the sale of such items in
Germany because they are outlawed there. But he said it generally
polices the sales of banned items only after receiving complaints
from users. In addition, the spokesman said, the service expects
users in Germany not to violate their country's laws and thus would
not technologically block such sales.

   Last week, Amazon.com said it would stop selling Hitler's ``Mein
Kampf'' to customers in Germany, citing German laws prohibiting
sales of hate literature. The move came after the Wiesenthal Center
filed legal complaints against Amazon and other Internet
booksellers in August.

<P>
   Unlike Amazon, eBay does not handle or ship the items sold on
its site.

   A search for listings containing the word ``Nazi'' on eBay on
Wednesday returned nearly 3,000 items. They included a Nuremberg
rally postcard for $24, items described as ``Five Beautiful Large
Nazi Death Notices!!'' for $40, and a Nuremberg rally flag for
$550. &QL;

HOLOCAUST INSURANCE SETTLEMENT REPORTED

 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the first settlement of litigation over unpaid
Holocaust-era life insurance policies, the Italian insurer
Assicurazioni Generali has agreed to pay the descendants of one
Nazi victim $1.25 million to resolve a single case, according to
people knowledgeable about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the settlement in Stern vs. Generali were supposed to
remain confidential, but an official with the California insurance
commissioner's office revealed the sum in the agreement, which was
disclosed to a judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Peter Simshauser, a
lawyer for Generali, said the settlement was in line with the
company's policy of trying to resolve outstanding Holocaust-era
claims but declined comment on the size of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Claims resolved on a fast-track basis through an international
commission led by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger,
have averaged $8,000, said Neal Sher, the chief of staff for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under California law, the family could seek punitive damages
from the insurer if it was found in court to have acted in bad
faith.

DODGERS COACHES TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _When the season ended, Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said he wanted the coaching staff to return intact, and he
got that wish. The Dodgers announced Wednesday there would be no
changes in the major-league staff.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question was whether pitching coach Claude Osteen,
who replaced the fired Charlie Hough on May 26, would be given the
opportunity to work a full year with the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claude's great,'' Johnson said. ``He's a great guy and has a
great relationship with the pitchers. I'm confident with Claude. I
think it's a very talented staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Tracy (bench), Rick Down (hitting) and Rick Dempsey will
return for their second seasons. Glenn Hoffman (third base) and
John Shelby (first base), who joined the Dodgers' major-league
staff during the 1998 season, will remain with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the club signed infielder Craig Counsell to a one-year
contract and the lefty-hitting second baseman accepted an outright
assignment to Triple-A Albuquerque. Infielder Tripp Cromer,
outrighted a week ago to the minor leagues, elected to become a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Ricky Stone and Luke Prokopec and infielder Adam Riggs,
all recently removed from the club's protected 40-man roster, each
accepted minor assignments. &QL;

FIRST TALKS ARE SCHEDULED BY MEDIATOR IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government and Microsoft have been summoned to Chicago on
Tuesday for their first round of settlement talks under Richard
Posner, the federal appeals court judge who has been selected as a
mediator, according to a person close to the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The mediation talks themselves, under court rules, are secret
deliberations. Besides Posner, who is chief judge of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, the meeting will include
lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19
states suing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, regarded as both an antitrust expert and a brilliant
jurist, is expected to quickly assess the chances of any settlement
between the two sharply divided sides.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting last Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial
judge for the Microsoft case, told lawyers for the two sides that
he had asked Posner to mediate. At the time, Jackson noted, ``I
don't think he is going to be prepared to waste a whole lot of time
if it looks from the outset that it's not promising.''
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is reached, it will most likely happen in the
next two months or not at all, according to another person close to
the case. ``By the end of January, or it won't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Posner is serving as a mediator, not an arbiter, for the
settlement talks. There have been sporadic settlement talks between
Microsoft and the government stretching back to before the suit was
filed in May 1998. Yet the previous efforts stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts expect that Posner will try to deliver a
sobering helping of reality to both sides. They predict he will
tell the government and states that their hand is as strong as it
will ever be, while telling Microsoft to settle before it is hit
with a final ruling that it violated the law, which could sharply
increase its vulnerability to class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Final oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22
before Jackson at U.S. District Court in Washington.

quietly, pensively, in his Jersey City apartment, supposedly a
convenient ride to where he was receiving treatment for the cancer
that so rudely had rerouted his life. ``It's Thanksgiving,'' he
said recently. ``And when I look back to where I was at this time
last year, I know I have so much to be thankful for.'' (David

KENTUCKY'S MUMME HAS THEM TALKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Louisiana State, Tulsa, Houston and North Carolina
State have all fired their coaches, even though the coaching
carousel really won't get busy until December.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many schools fire their coaches, the hottest
name will not be available, even though the average fan has never
heard of him, or probably is unimpressed with his results.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky coach Hal Mumme, whose Wildcats went 6-5 this season,
just received a two-year extension that gives him a six-year deal
worth $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Kentucky show Mumme money more suitable for someone
running its basketball program?
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director C.M. Newton said that he had not been
contacted by anyone about talking to Mumme, but that the head coach
had been approached by so-called ``headhunters'' for other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mumme confirmed it this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say `An unknown institution wants to hire you, are you
interested?' said Mumme, who said he did speak to one headhunter
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they couldn't afford me. They said try us. I said,
`Double what I make now.' They just coughed and hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   Offers are likely to keep pouring in for the innovative Mumme,
who is best known for coaching quarterback Tim Couch, but also
legendary for his disdain for punting or practicing in pads.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is a Mumme fan. Apparently ex-LSU coach Gerry
DiNardo got tired of hearing about Mumme as his possible
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, in an interview after his firing, DiNardo
criticized Mumme for running a fake punt in the fourth quarter of
Kentucky's 31-5 rout of the Tigers last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said a word publicly, but what I told my team on
Sunday was that you may think that's cool and a lot of the world
sees this running it up and this humiliating other people as
cool,'' said DiNardo, ``but I can tell you, and I don't care about
the polls or anything else, I would never do that to somebody else.
I just would not do that. I don't think it's sportsmanlike.''
</P>
<P>
   Vote of confidence? Former North Carolina State coach Mike
O'Cain knew he was in trouble after he met with school chancellor
Marye Anne Fox on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't positive,'' O'Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   Happy with Huskies: The Holiday Bowl breathed a sigh of relief
when 7-4 Washington was eliminated from Rose Bowl contention and
eligible for the Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the Pac-10 was going this year, we were fearful of
getting a dog _ no pun intended,'' Holiday Bowl executive director
John Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Louisiana: A Web site that covers LSU sports is titled
Geaux.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mr.Excuses: Miami coach Butch Davis has come under fire in the
past week by all three local newspapers and talk-radio shows for
making excuses for disappointing showings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   After every loss this year Davis has mentioned Miami (6-4) lost
31 scholarships due to self- and NCAA-imposed sanctions and still
doesn't have 85 scholarship players, they've had eight players
leave early for the NFL over the last four years, they only start
four seniors and have had injury problems.
</P>
<P>
   Miami fans can accept that after losses to Florida State (five
times), but not Virginia Tech (five times), East Carolina (twice)
or Pittsburgh (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Three times in a four-day period that concluded Tuesday, Davis
added, ``That's not an excuse,'' after bemoaning his team's fate in
some manner.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium damage: Notre Dame's disappointing season is taking a
toll on visiting stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   After Pitt Stadium's last game, a 37-27 victory over Notre Dame
on Nov. 13, it was apparently more than the 75-year-old facility
could take.
</P>
<P>
   Fans wanting souvenirs of the stadium and the victory tore up
the artificial turf so badly that the Panthers, who planned to
practice at Pitt Stadium this week in preparation for Saturday's
game at West Virginia, retired the place a week early.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing about the turf problem last week, fans began
returning sections they had taken after the game. Pittsburgh
athletic director Steve Pederson called the gesture ``something
very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Boston College officials noticed one of their
goalposts leaning to one side. Apparently, a group of students
tried to take it down after the Eagles' victory over Notre Dame
last week but gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Bad November Bears: This was Cal's third season under Tom Holmoe
(who has a five-year deal), and all three have ended with losing
records. In fact, in games played after Nov. 1, Holmoe's record is
0-9.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl drought: Oregon State's bowl appearance will end the
fourth-longest Division I-A drought. The top three: North Texas
(1959), New Mexico State (1960) and Rice (1961). &QL;

DISPUTE DELAYS THE TRINIDAD-REID BOUT 
TUA'S STATUS IN DISPUTE 
GRANT GAINS FROM FIGHT 
INDICTMENT WON'T STOP PAYMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bout between Felix Trinidad and David Reid, the WBA
superwelterweight champion, has been postponed because the WBC has
mandated that Trinidad defend the welterweight championship against
the No. 1 contender Derrell Coley within 90 days or vacate the
title.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen of America Presents, promoter for both Coley and
Reid, said Wednesday that Coley had been offered ``a substantial
amount'' of money to step aside and allow the Trinidad-Reid match
to take place on March 4. But Coley did not want the money; he
wanted to fight Trinidad for the WBC welterweight title instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had an oral agreement with our fighters and all the
parties were satisfied, we were prepared to go forward with the
fight between David and Trinidad,'' Goossen said. ``We did the
right thing with Coley with the step aside, but at the end of the
day he wanted to fight for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Trinidad did not want to give up the WBC welterweight
title, which he won from Oscar De La Hoya on Sept. 18 in a split
decision in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   When the Trinidad-Reid fight was announced two weeks ago,
Trinidad laid out an ambitious strategy to fight for titles in
weight classes from welterweight to middleweight next year. He had
no clear-cut plan for holding on to all the titles in the various
weight classes because in most cases a fighter must give up a world
title in one weight class once he wins one in another.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said he did not know when the Reid-Trinidad bout would
happen, but said that Trinidad-Coley would be held within the next
90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, HBO/TVKO had informed Goossen that under its
contract with Reid, it had a right to bid on the Reid-Trinidad
bout, despite the fact that Don King, the co-promoter for the bout
had said it would be broadcast on pay-per-view by Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tua's Status in Dispute
</P>
<P>
   David Tua, the No. 1 ranked heavyweight in the IB F, could be
trying to change management and promoters just as his chances of
fighting Lennox Lewis for the undisputed heavyweight championship
have heated up.
</P>
<P>
   Tua is currently managed by Shelly Finkel and promoted by Main
Events, but there is a disagreement over whether Tua's contract
with both has expired. Tua believes it has. Finkel doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick English, a lawyer for Main Events, said Tua was still
under contract with his promotion company, but English would not
say how much time was remaining on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said there were extensions in his contract with Tua for
time taken off because of injury and inactivity. Finkel said Tua
had elbow surgery two years ago and took four months off to
recuperate. To Finkel's way of thinking that has extended Tua's
contract by four months.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Finkel said he was trying to work on a new contract
with Tua.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Gains From Fight
</P>
<P>
   Don Turner, the trainer of Michael Grant, said that Grant's
knockout victory against Andrew Golota last Saturday night could be
worth as much as two or three fights' worth of experience for the
young heavyweight. But the major benefits for Turner is that the
two first-round knockdowns Golota scored against Grant will instill
a greater sense of urgency in Grant, who is a slow starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future he'll work harder to dispatch his guys much
sooner,'' Turner said. ``And now maybe it will be much easier for
me to reach him in the gym. Michael's been doing everything in his
whole life at 80 percent. He had to give 100 percent to get out of
this fight. From now on, he'll know he has to give 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indictment Won't Stop Payments
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Lee, Sr., president of the IBF, said he does not
foresee any problems collecting the sanctioning fees for the Dec. 5
bout between Fernando Vargas, the IBF junior-middleweight champion,
and Winky Wright. Lee and three other executives of the
organization are under federal indictment on conspiracy and
racketeering charges and federal prosecutors are trying to freeze
two IBF bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum withheld the $450,000 sanctioning fee for the
Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad bout, and has placed it in an
escrow account. The promoters for Lennox Lewis tried to put the
$300,000 sanctioning fee in escrow to keep from paying it directly
to the IBF, but later relented and paid the fee to the nonprofit
arm of the organization, so Lewis could get the IBF championship
belt.
</P>
<P>
   English, the lawyer for Main Events, one of Lewis' promoters and
also Vargas' promoter, said they would pay the $20,000 sanctioning
fee to the IBF nonprofit entity for the Vargas fight. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The actress Dolores Chaplin was talking about the
making of ``The Ice Rink,'' a film about the making of a film that
was made last year and will open in New York next year.
Specifically, she was talking about how she got her part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lied,'' she said. ``Of course I said I could ice skate.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned to skate by learning in-line skating. ``I was
Rollerblading on parking lots'' in France, where the film was shot,
she said. ``I didn't have to do any crazy acrobatic tricks. I only
fell once, the last day. I got carried away, overconfident. I was
wearing this overlong red dress, which got tangled up in my
skates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Rink'' is scheduled to open in New York on a double
bill with ``Modern Times,'' the 1936 classic that starred her
grandfather, Charlie Chaplin. This prompted the question: How many
times has she seen ``Modern Times''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't count,'' she said. ``There are many reels of his films
I've never seen, but I still enjoy `Modern Times.' I'll probably
stay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A NAME ISN'T WORTH A FIGHT FOR THIS IRISH BAND
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gregory Grene, who plays the button-key accordian in
an Irish folk band called the Prodigals, was ambitious _ he wanted
his own record label. ``We have a CD coming out,'' he said. ``So we
set up West Side Music as the publishing end of the band.'' The
name ``West Side Music'' had personal significance _ ``I live in
Chelsea on the West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where the Bronx is up and the Battery's down, the
names of neighborhoods have long since been copyrighted, registered
as trademarks or claimed as service marks. Grene soon received a
letter from a lawyer for Leonard Bernstein's estate, who said that
the name ``West Side Music'' infringed on Bernstein's rights to the
phrase ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement could have turned into a David-and-Goliath
clash, except that Grene decided not to play David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the finances of a band that, touch wood, is going in the
right direction but is still pretty young versus the established
power of Leonard Bernstein's law firm,'' he said, ``we couldn't
afford the legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bernstein estate, it registered ``West Side Story''
as a service mark years ago. ``We just felt that `West Side Music'
was too close,'' said Craig Urquhart, a spokesman. ``That's that.
We're trying to keep people from getting confused.'' Referring to
Grene and the Prodigals, he added, ``We're grateful they changed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   They became Grab Entertainment, using an acronym from their
names.

MESA COPS GET NAKED FOR STINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - At least twice in the past six months, undercover
Mesa police officers have gotten naked to convince massage parlor
prostitution suspects that they aren't really cops.
</P>
<P>
   And in both cases, officers allowed the suspects to touch their
genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's unwritten policy giving officers the go-ahead to disrobe
and allow themselves to be touched, short of sex, goes further than
any law enforcement agency in the Phoenix area, and most agencies
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no sex acts,'' said Lt. Ron Kirby, who runs the
special investigations unit that goes after prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to do an illegal act to get these people. But
we are going to throw things out there to get them to bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers had the option to take their clothes off in each of the
department's 15 massage parlor prostitution arrests in the past
year, but police refused to say how far officers went in each case.
</P>
<P>
   But in response a public records request by The Arizona
Republic, the department released two reports where officers felt
it necessary to get naked.
</P>
<P>
   In the delicate dance between police and prostitutes, law
enforcement agencies across the nation have wrestled with how far
undercover officers can go behind massage parlor doors to disguise
the fact that they are cops.
</P>
<P>
   Most seasoned escorts or prostitutes masquerading as massage
therapists won't even discuss a sex act unless the customer is
nude; and for some, the threshold is contact with the genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Glendale and Maricopa County are
among the police agencies that have made it clear to their vice
officers that disrobing beyond a towel or underwear is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Justice studies Professor Jon Kavanagh said completely disrobing
is unnecessary to prostitution stings, and that's why most police
departments around the country don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clever cop can get an offer for sex for money without
exposing himself,'' said Kavanagh, who retired from the New York
police force in 1993 and now leads the justice studies department
at Scottsdale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run into big problems ethically and procedurally when you
allow police officers to disrobe,'' he said. ``It's obscene and
immoral and could open up an officer to allegations that he's
acting for his own pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Police Chief Jan Strauss said the policy has been in effect
for about six years, but the public has known little about it
because nearly all of the massage parlor prostitution arrests have
been plea-bargained before trial.
</P>
<P>
   She said the recent scandal involving officers having sex with
each other on duty had nothing to do with her department's
reluctance to release the massage parlor policy.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss said her concern was that releasing details of
investigative techniques could jeopardize future investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how far will Mesa cops go? Officers wouldn't say, only
that the line is somewhere between nudity and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she would say to taxpayers who had a problem with
police going this far, Strauss said, ``These are the same people
who would be shocked at what is going on in massage parlors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Kirby said that his detectives will not disrobe if they can
avoid it, and that his detectives get regular training on how to
conduct themselves during massage parlor stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something these guys enjoy doing,'' Kirby said.
``And I don't force anybody to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added police Cmdr. Rodney Johnston, ``You have to evolve with
the nature of the crime. . . . You have to do certain things to rid
the community of a certain element.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police report of the November investigation of the
O.K. Garden Spa at 1911 W. Broadway Road, the proprietor, Frances
Chong, never gave the undercover Mesa detective the option of
covering up with a towel.
</P>
<P>
   After paying $50 for a massage, the officer was led into a room
and told, ``Take your clothes off.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer wrote in the report that Chong touched his genitals
while giving him a bath.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing massage, Chong exposed herself and offered to
perform a sex act, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer declined, but then discussed prices to have sex with
Chong. She said she would have sex for $100 and then grabbed the
officer's hand and placed it on her breast, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The officer made an excuse to leave before the massage
progressed any further. Chong has been indicted on two felony
counts: operating a house of prostitution and receiving earnings of
a prostitute. She is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa police were met with a similar situation nine days later
when the investigated Spa Nouveau at 706 W. Southern Ave.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, part of a continuing investigation, the officer
wrote in his report that he paid $50 for a massage and was given a
robe to wear after taking off his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspect told the officer to take off the robe when it
came time for the massage and gave him nothing else to cover
himself.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing the appropriate amount for a ``tip'' to pay for
a sex act, she reportedly told the officer he must first place her
hand on his genitals ``to prove that you're not a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I then took her hand and placed it on my upper thigh and she
said it was not good enough, so I placed it low on my stomach,
which seemed to satisfy her suspicions of my being an officer as
she moved her hand onto my penis,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Again the officer made an excuse to leave before completing a
sex act.
</P>
<P>
   Other police agencies say Mesa is venturing into an area they
will not go.
</P>
<P>
   ``By our policy, completely disrobing is strictly prohibited,''
said Lt. Larry Jacobs, head of the Phoenix Police Department's vice
enforcement unit. &QL;

A BULLET RICOCHETS OFF A CELL PHONE AND AN OFFICER IS ONLY GRAZED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A plainclothes officer who was shot at during an
undercover drug operation in the Bronx late Tuesday night escaped
serious injury when a bullet ricocheted off his cellular telephone
and grazed his stomach, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Sgt. Robert Delamey, 38, was wounded when three men
tried to rob him and another officer during an undercover sale of
cocaine that the police had hoped would help build a case against a
drug organization, officials said. Delamey was listed in stable
condition at Jacobi Medical Center last night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were arrested on attempted murder and attempted
robbery charges, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at about 11:50 p.m. in an apartment in the
South Bronx. Police officials said that three suspected drug
dealers began firing in an apparent attempt to rob the two
officers.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet that probably would have struck Delamey in the stomach
bounced off his cellular telephone and only grazed him, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said outside the hospital Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant's partner, Wilbert Morales, 32, was struck over the
head with a pistol, but was able to fire eight shots with his
9-millimeter handgun, striking one of the assailants, officials
said. Delamey fired two rounds from his Glock handgun before backup
officers arrived and arrested the suspects, officials added.
Investigators said it was unclear Wednesday who shot Delamey.
</P>
<P>
   The three Bronx men who were arrested were identified by the
police as Shane Palmer, 28; Raymond Thomas, 22; and Shawn Howell,
21, who was shot in the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Howell was in stable condition at Lincoln Hospital, officials
added. Investigators said that a 9-millimeter handgun and a knife
were found at the scene.

IN SPOTLIGHT, TEXAS BAND JUGGLES THRILL AND FEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among the hundreds of performers in the crowded
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Trinity Valley Community
College marching band and dance team would probably not have drawn
an extraordinary amount of attention, except perhaps in its
hometown of Athens, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But a glaring spotlight turned on that small town last week
after one of its natives, Nicole Barrett, was struck down with a
brick in a random attack on a midtown Manhattan street. Eight years
ago, Ms. Barrett had the time of her life in the Thanksgiving
parade as a member of the school's Cardettes dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's 118 band members and dancers had been anticipating
that same sort of once-in-a-lifetime excitement before Ms.
Barrett's attack. And Wednesday, many said they were still thrilled
to represent their college in a national tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But, for some, there was also concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared us that she was attacked, but that could have
happened anywhere, even in our small town,'' said Misty Mosley, 20
a dancer from New Waverly, Texas, who has watched the Macy's parade
on television since she was 3 years old. ``I was so excited about
coming to New York that no way was I having second thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the incident will not be far from their minds. The band
members will pin purple ribbons _ Ms. Barrett's favorite color _ to
their red-and-white uniforms and dedicate their performance to Ms.
Barrett, who is recovering at Bellevue Hospital Center. She has
improved in recent days, and the hospital listed her in serious but
stable condition Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know her, but it still hurts,'' said Stephen Estes,
19, a bass drum player in the band. ``Her being from Athens and
being so close, you would never think that something like that will
happen, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although several students acknowledged, like Estes, that the
attack on Ms. Barrett was a random act, they said they were more
concerned about their safety because of it. A few refused to leave
their hotel, the Milford Plaza in Times Square, after dark when
they arrived on Tuesday, and Wednesday others said they would
venture out only with a group of people during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they have been careful not to look at strangers or
talk to them. ``It's different,'' said Crystal Martin, 20, a drum
major from Eustace, Texas. ``We come from a small town so we
usually talk to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one student said that she was so excited to be in
the city that she rushed out at midnight Tuesday to take in the
night life in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw all these lights, I almost lost my concentration,'' said
the student, Starr Brown, 21, a flute player from Athens who is
mostly blind. ``It was just as crowded as it was at 5 in the
afternoon. I come from this Podunk town where the restaurants close
at 8 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Baker, who directs the dance team, said the Trinity
Valley students had applied for a coveted spot in the Macy's parade
last spring. They sent in videotapes and photographs, and after
being picked, they sold raffle tickets to raise money for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   After all that hard work, Ms. Baker said, there was never any
question of canceling the trip after the attack on Ms. Barrett.
``Nikki had such a great time, she would have hated to think that
we missed out on this because of something that happened to her,''
said Ms. Baker, who said she cried when she visited her former
student in the hospital Tuesday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The students, who are accompanied by 28 faculty members and
parents, will stay through Saturday. On Wednesday, 20 band members
played jazz on Liberty Island and at South Street Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   For other students, the highlight of the trip will be Thursday's
parade. Ms. Mosley said it was important for her to march _ not
just for herself but also for Ms. Barrett. ``I feel like she's part
of me because she did this before me,'' she said. ``This is out of
respect for her.''

   BOSTON _ In cities, buildings are constructed and gutted and
torn down and rebuilt all the time. Rarely does a single structure
come to embody for one group of people both a moment of indignity
and defeat, and one of pride and possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the story of the yellow brick building at 515 Blue
Hill Ave., once a city welfare office and now, through the
determination of three nuns and two volunteer fund-raisers, the
Mother Caroline Academy and Education Center.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story building where generations of women once waited
for their checks and were made to feel that they would never amount
to anything is now a Roman Catholic middle school that strives to
make 60 girls from poor families _ African-American, Hispanic,
Haitian and Cape Verdean _ believe that their futures are
limitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``A life is not defined by circumstance,'' said the executive
director, Sister Mary Dooley. ``It's defined by hope.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall Maria Montefusco, 14, whose family was homeless when
she was in the third grade, has been telling everyone, ``I'm going
to Harvard.'' Dulce DePina, 13, whose mother is a hospital aide, is
talking about becoming a doctor. Lisa Barbosa, 12, has declared her
intention to become a historian.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lisa has been grilling her social studies teacher,
Manon Beaudrie, about ancient Rome: ``What did they dress like?
What did they eat? What about the government? How did it work? Who
were all the people in it? Why did they blame Cleopatra for the
fall of Rome?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask a lot of questions,'' said Lisa, whose persistent
curiosity was rewarded last semester with an A-plus in social
studies.
</P>
<P>
   With only 14 people in her class _ all the classes at the school
are small _ Ms. Beaudrie has plenty of time to answer Lisa's
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa's school day is 12 hours long, but Ms. Beaudrie, who left
her job as a bookstore manager for Mother Caroline, stays longer.
She and her nine fellow teachers, all in their 20s, are volunteers.
With room and board provided by Mother Caroline, they live at the
school, on the fourth floor.
</P>
<P>
   In its former incarnation, the building, which opened in 1952 at
the center of an African-American community, in the Dorchester
neighborhood, was a place where the caseworkers were the ones who
asked the questions. Sharon Cox, 54, was 14 and a new mother when
she walked inside to apply for welfare. ``Everyone said you were a
loser just to be there,'' recalled Ms. Cox, who went on to become a
writer and wrote a poem about the building for the school's
opening. ``They didn't expect you to have anything to offer. You
needed the help, you were grateful for the help, but you paid for
it in humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1967, resentments and hostilities inside the building
spilled over into a race riot. By 1983, the welfare office had
moved and the building was boarded up, an ugly symbol of a past
that made no one proud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sister Mary, Sister Frances and Sister Barbara Dewey,
from the School Sisters of Notre Dame, opened Mother Caroline
Academy for 30 girls in a rented convent in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But the school needed more space, and in 1994 the nuns looked
inside the old welfare office. ``We walked through and there was
garbage everywhere,'' Sister Mary recalled. ``The hallways were
flooded. There were no lights. It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she returned with an architect, Tom McGrath. ``He said
the building had great potential, wonderful possibilities, a strong
foundation,'' Sister Mary said. ``Those were the same words as we
use for the girls. I said, `You know, I think we're being
called.'''
</P>
<P>
   The nuns bought the building from the city for $1 but they
needed more than $2 million to renovate it.
</P>
<P>
   And, Sister Mary said, ``We had no major donors.'' Nor did
Mother Caroline Academy receive any money from the archdiocese, or
from the Sisters of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary asked two women who had been volunteering at the
school, Beth Floor and Barrie Landry, if they would lead a capital
campaign. ``We both said, `No, we can't ask for money,''' Ms. Floor
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But they raised $2.6 million in 14 months. The new Mother
Caroline school opened in June 1998, adding to a growing revival of
its neighborhood. Tuition is only $100 a year, and the school also
helps puts its graduates through private high schools. In addition,
it offered classes in computers, reading and English as a second
language to adults and children in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who once waited for checks in the old welfare
office are now taking classes at Mother Caroline. One, Lois Lee, is
a member of the board of the school. The women also come back to
meet the girls and to talk with Sister Mary and Sister Frances, the
principal, about the power of one building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is vindication to me,'' Ms. Cox said. ``There are young
people in this community who have what it takes to deal with a
rigorous academic program. No matter where the girls come from,
they bring something to the building. Just like me, they have
something to offer.''

CONTRACTOR WHERE BUILDING FELL IS SAID TO VIOLATE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after an accident killed a worker at a Brooklyn
building site, local and federal investigators said Wednesday that
the contractor had a history of safety problems and violations at
its projects.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that both the Brooklyn district attorney's office
and the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn were examining whether
criminal charges would be warranted in the accident, which sent
several construction workers falling three stories. The workers
were pouring concrete at 50 Middleton Avenue in Williamsburg when
the upper floors of the structure collapsed, apparently because of
shoddy construction.
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant laborer, Daniel Eduardo, 23, was crushed by
concrete blocks; three other workers remained in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that the accident
and the history of the contractor, Industrial Enterprise Ltd., were
a case study of why city guidelines regulating contractors are
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   As several agencies pursued investigations into the collapse,
the contracting firm's chairman and owner, Chaim Ostreicher, had
apparently left for Israel, making it much harder for investigators
to question him about the accident, according to two law
enforcement officials who cited comments by his wife as well as
other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The firm appears to have a troubled history. The federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration has documented at
least seven previous violations by the company for such problems as
faulty wiring that could lead to fires and failure to protect
workers at job sites, according OSHA spokesman Randy Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   And at one residence the contractor built, the city's Buildings
Department ordered part of the structure vacated _ even though it
was already inhabited _ because it did not have enough fire exits,
said department spokesman Paul Wein.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Industrial Enterprises, Jeffrey Buss, said he could
not comment on the accident until his client had further
investigated it, but he said another company was responsible for
pouring the cement Tuesday. He would not comment on Ostreicher's
whereabouts, or the company's history of violations, but he said,
``my client wants to express his sympathy to the families and the
people that were injured.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have been hampered in their inquiry
because the contractor involved has operated under different names.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's accident, Eduardo plunged to his death after the
unfinished fourth level of the structure collapsed while workers
were pouring concrete on top of it. Acting Buildings Commissioner
Richard Visconti said the collapse was apparently caused by
improper bracing on a joist supporting the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that if either poor construction
or violations of workplace regulations are found to have
contributed to the accident, and thereby the death of Eduardo, the
company, or individual managers, could face separate state and
federal homicide charges.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that preliminary indications are that the
builder's failure to follow the approved plans, something they had
been cited for at other sites, may have contributed to the
accident. Builders must submit such plans to the city, which detail
essential components of construction, and then are generally
required to adhere to them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal investigators are also probing whether Ostreicher paid
workers the appropriate ``prevailing'' union wage, and federal
officials said that they are continuing to explore whether the
company used illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators focused on the contractor, the city itself
was coming under scrutiny for its oversight of such projects.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings Department officials Wednesday sought to deflect
criticism from labor advocates that they had mishandled a similar
accident Aug. 10 at a separate building on the same site. After a
collapse that day, inspectors received amended building plans and
did not return to inspect the site before allowing work to resume.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that city guidelines did not require them to
return to the site, an issue that has raised concern among some
legislators who say the city's rules governing such inspections are
too lax.

 RenderMan to the Rescue: Software Is Real Hero of Animation  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
When people hear ``Pixar,'' Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Flik and a host
of other likable characters from the company's bubbly animated
films inevitably spring to mind.
<P>
   But there's another name in the animation house's repertoire
that will never rescue a kidnapped toy or lead an ant colony's
rebellion, although ``he'' plays a key role in all of Pixar's
movies and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar, the Point Richmond film production company behind '``Toy
Story,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and now ``Toy Story 2,'' is also the
proud parent of RenderMan, an Academy Award-winning piece of
software that helps thousands of animators and special effects
wizards worldwide put the finishing touches on computer-generated
images for commercials, TV shows and movies.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``render'' refers to the process whereby a computer
takes all of the calculations embedded in a single frame's digital
models &LR;  and draws a complete picture, literally fleshing out a
bare-bones representation with texture and lighting. Without
rendering, viewers would see wire-frame models, the Erector
set-like representations that tell the computer what each object
looks like.
</P>
<P>
   In films like ``The Matrix,'' RenderMan helped fuse
computer-generated elements and live action. In the entirely
digital ``A Bug's Life,'' it created a wholly believable insect
world with the sheen of a classic illustrator's brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``RenderMan has been a key part of getting dazzling, realistic
images on the screen,'' said Darwyn Peachey, Pixar vice president
of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does 450-employee Pixar use RenderMan in all of its
films, it licenses the technology to the likes of Sony Pictures
Imageworks (the force behind the upcoming ``Stuart Little'' movie)
and George Lucas' special effects powerhouse, Industrial Light &AMP;
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Other animation firms like ILM often develop their own in-house
software, but it's unusual for one company to develop, sell,
support and use its own tools.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 11 years it's been on the market, RenderMan has
become a steady part of Pixar's business, Peachey said, though in
its financial filings, the company admits its focus on feature
films hasn't let it dedicate the resources to boost RenderMan sales
even more.
</P>
<P>
   As a percentage of overall revenues, RenderMan varies widely, as
do the company's sales, which tend to skyrocket after a movie
release then subside as interest in the film wanes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of this year, Pixar earned $39.6
million on revenues of $96.2 million _ much of it due to ``A Bug's
Life'' _ compared with $7.9 million in earnings on $14.3 million of
revenue for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of RENDER25 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Software sales, mainly from RenderMan, totaled $4.6 million in
the first nine months of this year, a 70 percent jump over the $2.7
million posted for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That increase reflects an industrywide trend. Snader &AMP;
Associates, a San Rafael reseller of hardware and software for
graphic artists, says the digital effects industry is in the middle
of an upswing after a sluggish 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good amount of demand (for software and hardware) in
the Bay Area and all over right now,'' said Dennis Payne, an
account executive at Snader. ``There's a lot of content creation in
film, the Web and on the games side of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an increase in projects using computer-generated
effects, RenderMan's success derives from clients' love of the
product. San Rafael's ILM used RenderMan on ``Terminator 2,''
``Jurassic Park'' and ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of features (in RenderMan) sustains a quality
level .. that is unsurpassed,'' said Christian Rouet, senior
technology officer at ILM.
</P>
<P>
   Rouet and others say the $5,000 (per license) RenderMan stands
apart from other rendering tools, which usually come as part of
broader animation and modeling software from companies such as
Softimage and Alias/Wavefront. Alias's Maya Complete, the company's
entry-level 3-D modeling, animation and rendering software, costs
about $7,500; and Softimage 3D, with roughly equivalent
capabilities, costs approximately $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rouet emphasizes that those products aren't substandard. It's
simply that RenderMan is mature _ in 11 years, Pixar has worked out
the bugs _ and it can handle a massive amount of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to create something that's photo-realistic,
you need a lot of detail ... and rendering really means creating
something that's extremely detailed,'' Rouet said. ``If the
renderer can't take it because of memory (limitations), it becomes
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At $5,000 a pop just for a renderer, RenderMan is a little
pricey for the self-employed digital artist. But even tiny firms
say the software is worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very small studio and we couldn't do special effects
if we didn't use RenderMan, in terms of the quality of images we
can put out, the speed with which we can put them out,'' said
Annabella Serra, creative director of Rainsound Inc., a Seattle
visual effects company that has seven RenderMan licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Rainsound faced a major challenge several years ago on the
action-adventure flick ``Anaconda.'' Its artists needed to create
snake skin that wouldn't distort when the beast slithered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have the textures stretch,'' she said. ``With
RenderMan, we had no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Anaconda,'' as in other movies that use computer-generated
visuals, technicians started with a model. Modeling software
(separate from RenderMan) lets an artist create a virtual
doppelganger of a snake, person, tree, etc. Then the artists
manipulate the model to create the illusion of movement and
expression, or animation. Finally, they layer on cues for texture,
shading and other details that add dimension and realism.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the complexity of the image and the power of the
computer, rendering software will take anywhere from 1 to 50 hours
to spitting &LR;  out a final image that incorporates all of that data.
Pixar uses a network of computers called a ``render farm'' to speed
up the process) &LR; . But a team of about a dozen RenderMan developers
has dedicated themselves to further shrinking that time with each
RenderMan release _ version 3.9 is the latest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance of the renderer and the ability to deal with
complex shots has improved a lot,'' said Peachey. ``We can do
scenes with an enormous amount of material.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Buster,'' a dog in ``Toy Story 2,'' has 4 million
hairs on his body, and each has to be textured and lit. Such
minutiae ``wouldn't have been possible with the renderer we used
for `Toy Story,''' said Peachey.
</P>
<P>
   And forget the company's earliest rendering tools, developed in
the mid-1980s when it was still the Computer Division of Lucasfilm
Ltd. Thirteen years ago, Steve Jobs bought the unit for $10 million
and incorporated it as Pixar. At the time, the company revolved
around the Pixar Image Computer, an early workstation for graphics
professionals. But even then, a faction of frustrated filmmakers
was branching out.
</P>
<P>
   As Pixar began producing shorts, it shifted away from hardware
and software development, but the core RenderMan technology
remained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pixar decided to sell the software commercially, in
part to establish an industrywide standard, ``to give people a way
to build on each other's work,'' Peachey said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite RenderMan's success over the past decade, Peachey says
there are no plans to spin it out into a separate company. The
software is simply too entwined with Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nice thing about having the in-house film
production (at Pixar), is that they integrate things they need for
themselves into the software,'' Rainsound's Serra said. Other firms
making graphics software ``don't have the people in-house who push
the software; they don't live it day to day.''

<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh (10-1) at Hofstra (10-1), Saturday
</P>
<P>
   Get to Long Island for this tremendous first-round match up in
the NCAA Division I-AA championship. The two quarterbacks _
Giovanni Carmazzi of Hofstra and Phil Stambaugh of Lehigh _ are
genuine National Football League prospects and have had scouts
measuring them all year. So perhaps is Lehigh's tiny running back,
5-4 Ronald Jean. A heart-rendering success story in his own right,
Jean has gained 1,358 yards and scored 23 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi (7-3) at Mississippi State (8-2), 8 p.m. ET, ESPN
</P>
<P>
   In-state bragging rights are more important than where these two
bowl-bound teams end up spending their holiday season: either
Atlanta and the Peach for the winner, or Florida and the Outback
for the loser.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   Texas (9-2) at Texas A&AMP;M (7-3), 11 a.m. ET, ABC
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the most emotional game of the college season
after A&AMP;M's bonfire collapse, in which 12 students died. The
Longhorns have already sewn up a spot in the Big XII Championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (9-1) at Colorado (6-4), 2:30 p.m. ET, ABC
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1990 have the Cornhuskers lost to the Buffalos. The
streak needs to continue if Nebraska is to keep its slim national
title hopes alive. If they lose, Kansas State plays Texas in the
Big XII title game.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (8-2) at Virginia Tech (10-0), 2:30 p.m. ET, CBS
</P>
<P>
   The Golden's Eagles surprising season is just what the Hokies
needed to boost their strength of schedule in the Bowl Championship
Series rankings. A Virginia Tech victory caps a remarkable season;
if the Hokies pound BC, it shouldn't matter how Nebraska finishes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   On television, there are a couple of entertaining matchups that
really don't mean much:
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (7-3) at Georgia Tech (7-3), 1 p.m. ET, ABC
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton won't win the Heisman Trophy, but
you will witness why he will make the trip to New York as a
finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (5-6) at Stanford (7-3), 8 p.m. ET, ABC
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal are in the Rose Bowl. This is the Fighting Irish's
bowl game.

   REVISED GROWTH ESTIMATE SHOWS ECONOMY IN TOP GEAR
</P>
<P>
   With employment, incomes, confidence and major stock market
gauges at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its
estimate of U.S. economic growth from July to September to an
annual pace of 5.5 percent from 4.8 percent, surpassing nearly all
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The figures indicate that the economy is poised to set a record
for longevity with the arrival of the year 2000. But unless growth
slows drastically, analysts fear the Federal Reserve could be
forced to raise interest rates again and dampen the expansion,
which is now eight and a half years old.

   COKE BID FOR ORANGINA IS REJECTED
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year struggle with French regulators, Coca-Cola was
rejected for a second time in its bid to buy the Orangina soft
drink brand from Pernod Ricard, and a spokesman for Coca-Cola said
the company regarded the decision as final. The French finance
minister said the terms of the revised $733 million bid, in which
Coca-Cola offered to exclude the distribution of Orangina in
restaurants and other public places, did not do enough to allay
concerns about market dominance.

   EXECUTIVE SAYS MURDOCH MISSPOKE
</P>
<P>
   A suggestion by New Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch that NBC had
been offered for sale to Time Warner was ``a bit of a mistake,'' an
executive close to Murdoch said. The executive also sought to
counter any criticism that, with his remarks, Murdoch had been
seeking to affect the price of Time Warner stock. Instead, the
executive said, Mr. Murdoch had simply reacted to a television
interviewer's unexpected question by repeating reports he had heard
about Time Warner vice chairman Ted Turner's interest in acquiring
NBC from General Electric. ``Rupert misspoke,'' the executive said.

IOC ANNOUNCES 50-POINT REFORM CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With less than a month before a crucial meeting of its members,
the International Olympic Committee Wednesday released 50
recommendations that will form the centerpiece of the beleaguered
Swiss-based organization's reform campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms suggested by the IOC 2000 Commission focus on
changing the IOC structure, the selection of host cities for future
Olympics and financial reporting are to be submitted when the full
membership meets in Lausanne from Dec. 11-12.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the scandal involving the awarding of the
2002 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City _ which led to the expulsion
or resignation of 10 IOC members _ the committee has pointed to
next month's meeting as the ultimate proof of its desire to reform
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reforms we advertised are the ones we will deliver,'' said
Richard Pound, an IOC vice president who served on the commission.
``I hope it reflects our desire to be as open as we can in all
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC released its slate of reform in a report that said,
loftily: ``The IOC 2000 Commission supported the notion that the
IOC should be the moral authority for world sport. To obtain even
greater credit, the IOC must now be more representative of the
sports world.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the retirement age of new members from 80 to 70, and
establishing eight-year, renewable term limits. The age limit had
been raised several years ago to 80 to accommodate the wishes of
the longtime president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who is to retire
next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establishing an eight-year term limit for future presidents
but with the possibility of re-election to an additional four or
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Setting a limit of 115 members, including 15 active athletes,
15 international federation presidents, 15 national Olympic
committee presidents, and 70 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   _ The elimination of IOC member visits to bid cities and of
visits to members by representatives of the cities. Olympic
candidate cities would be evaluated by a small commission, which
would include members of the IOC, international federations and
national Olympic committees as well as outside experts. A vigorous
campaign of gift-giving by Salt Lake City Olympic organizers to
visiting IOC members and their families animated the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sports that do not subscribe to the IOC's anti-doping code and
do not perform out-of-competition testing in accord with the
organization's new World Anti-Doping Agency will be excluded from
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   _ The World Anti-Doping Agency will require that each athlete
hold a ``passport'' that contains all the information needed to
carry out efficient doping controls and monitoring of the athlete's
health.
</P>
<P>
   _ The publication of financial reports that explicitly outline
the use of IOC funds, including the allocation of money to national
Olympic committees and international federations.

PLAN TO MONITOR HARTFORD POLICE IS HAILED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ Longtime critics of the local police are hailing a
plan to hire a civilian monitor and resurrect a moribund police
review board to investigate all police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford City Council approved both measures Tuesday in an
effort to temper the racial tension that has simmered for years and
has increased in the seven months since Aquan Salmon, an unarmed
14-year-old black youth, was fatally shot in the back by a white
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Lauded by both sides as a huge step toward a more accountable
police force, the Council's unanimous vote does not break any new
ground: it essentially reaffirms the city's commitment to the terms
of a 1973 federal consent decree that required, among other things,
that the Police Department adopt strict rules governing its
officers' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it was seen as a major sign of a commitment to holding the
police accountable. In recent years, local Hispanic and black
groups have accused the city of failing to adhere to the goals of
that decree, and the April shooting of Salmon, now the subject of a
state investigation, has only heightened distrust of the city's
mostly white police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is in desperate need of new leadership; they
know there has to be a change,'' said Nicholas R. Carbone, a city
councilman in 1973 and the current president of the Connecticut
Institute for Municipal Studies, a nonprofit group that helped
pressure Hartford officials to approve the measure. ``The
department is now going to reach for a higher degree of
professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The outside police monitor, or ``special master,'' will probably
be someone from outside the city government and will not have any
authority over the Police Department, said the city manager,
Saundra Kee Borges. Rather, the monitor will act as the eyes of
U.S. District Court in New Haven, which issued the 1973 decree, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Council vote, approving the monitor and a reconstituted
seven-member Board of Inquiry for police shootings, should create
``a more customer friendly Police Department,'' Ms. Kee Borges
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good resolution,'' she said. ``It was a good
opportunity for all sides to come together and come to some
agreement on how we move forward.'' But she stressed that the
Council resolution did not admit that the city had failed to adhere
to the 1973 federal order.
</P>
<P>
   But to most people who live here, including the 14 groups that
pressured Tuesday's resolution, problems within the police seem
deeply entrenched. Weeks after Salmon's death, for instance, Police
Chief Joseph F. Croughwell Jr., who is white, said publicly that
his department was riven with racism.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, police officials said they were encouraged by the
action. ``It's going to make us, hopefully, be a better police
department,'' said Assistant Police Chief James Berry.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 decree was the result of a settlement between city
officials and Le Casa de Puerto Rico, an influential community
group that filed a civil rights suit in 1969 to force the police to
end abusive methods.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, which imposed a code of ethics governing how the
police interacted with citizens, required officers to give their
names and badge numbers to anyone who asked and forbade the use of
pepper spray on children. It also prohibited the shooting of
unarmed youths under 16, unarmed criminal suspects and anyone
fleeing the police, unless there was a deadly threat.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also established a Use of Firearms Board of
Inquiry, staffed mostly by police officials. The board, which often
went ignored over the years, will now get a new mandate, Berry
said. ``It's going to deem that we definitely start reviewing all
firearms discharges in the department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file police officers were not as enthusiastic about
Tuesday's Council vote. Sgt. Michael R. Wood, president of the
Hartford Police Union, which represents the city's 480 officers,
said he believed the community groups who pressured the city to
reconsider its commitment to the 1973 consent decree were ``taking
advantage'' of the Salmon shooting to gain more leverage over the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we are out of compliance with the consent
decree,'' Wood said Wednesday. ``I don't think there's any need for
an overseer. Senior management of this department is able to
determine if there is compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution agreed to Tuesday took months to forge. Though
Salmon's death in April prompted some Council members to press the
city manager to do something about the Police Department,
negotiations became more serious once a coalition of 14 community
groups here filed a suit in federal court seeking to have Hartford
held in contempt of court for ignoring the 1973 decree.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, more than two dozen black ministers, and
hundreds of their followers, flooded City Council chambers to press
city officials to adhere to the terms of the consent decree,
Carbone said.

open positions of short sales on the market edged up 1.4 percent,
the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the
market, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered short sales in all 4,728 Nasdaq securities totaled 2.3
billion shares in the month that ended Nov. 15, compared with 4,725
securities and 2.28 billion shares in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   A rise in uncovered short sales _ essentially a bet that stock
prices will fall _ is often an indicator of investors' skepticism
of the market. But the monthly rise came during a period when the
Nasdaq composite index rose 14.7 percent. Wednesday, the index set
a closing high of 3,420.50 points, up 2.3 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage
firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and
make a profit. If the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces
a loss. Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are
those shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered
by repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   While large short interest positions can be a bearish indicator,
they can also be a reflection of complex trading strategies
involving options, futures and other stock-related derivatives.

LEE SHAW, 86, LAWYER, DIES; HELPED DEVELOP LABOR LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee C. Shaw, who helped draw much of the road map for modern
labor law and then used it to help corporations negotiate with
unions, died of a heart attack on Nov. 15 at his home in San Diego.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw helped draft the nation's guide to employer-employee
negotiations, the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, also
known as the Taft-Hartley Act. He was named to the drafting panel
after serving on the National War Labor Board, which was
responsible for monitoring labor issues in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to become an advocate in the new field of labor law,
an area previously handled almost entirely by lawyers within
corporations. As such, he represented Las Vegas casinos in
negotiations with workers in the buoyant 1960s. He also represented
California fruit and vegetable growers in their dealings with the
United Farmworkers Union led by Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   His expertise was such that several labor unions offered to hire
him after facing him in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``His word was his word,'' said Andrew R. Laidlaw, the managing
partner in the law firm that Shaw helped found in 1945, Seyfarth,
Shaw, Fairweather &AMP; Geraldson. ``He was respected. He was a giant
in the labor relations world.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was born in Red Wing, Minn., and played football with
Gerald R. Ford, the future president, at the University of
Michigan. He graduated from the University of Chicago Law School in
1938 and went to work for a Chicago law firm, Pope &AMP; Ballard, which
is now defunct.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage in 1935 of the Wagner Act, which established
the rights of workers to bargain collectively and became the matrix
of U.S. labor law, the firm set out to create a specialty in the
field, concentrating on representing management interests in labor
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, Shaw and two colleagues, Henry Seyfarth and Owen
Fairweather, left Pope &AMP; Ballard to start their own firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm eventually represented more than 200 of the
nation's 500 largest corporations. Shaw was particularly
influential in expanding Seyfarth, Shaw beyond Chicago to Los
Angeles, Washington and New York; it now also has offices in
Atlanta, Boston, Houston, Sacramento, San Francisco and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is survived by his wife Lorraine; a son, Charles; two
daughters, Linda Lee Smith and Candace Peterson; and six
grandchildren.

 STANLEY FRANKEL, 80, WRITER AND CORPORATE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Frankel, a journalist, corporate executive
and speechwriter for Democratic presidential candidates, including
Adlai Stevenson, Robert F. Kennedy, Hubert H. Humphrey, George
McGovern and Walter Mondale, died on Nov. 12 in a New York City
hospital. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who lived in Scarsdale, died from complications from a
cerebral aneurysm, said his son Stephen Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Long active in the Democratic Party, Frankel started by working
in Stevenson's campaign for Illinois governor in 1948, and later
worked on his unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Frankel won a Peabody Award as executive producer of
the television series ``Adlai Stevenson Reports,'' a network
television program.
</P>
<P>
   He then wrote speeches and recruited leading scholars to help
write speeches for other Democratic presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Dec. 8, 1918, in Dayton, Ohio, Frankel attended
Northwestern University, graduating in 1940 as valedictorian.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the 37th Infantry Division in the Pacific in World
War II, Frankel took part in the liberation of Manila and of about
2,000 U.S. prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to civilian life, Frankel worked for Esquire, Coronet
and This Week magazines before becoming a vice president of
McCall's magazine. He later spent 27 years as vice president for
Ogden Corp., an industrial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Stephen of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.,
Frankel is survived by his wife, Irene Baskin Frankel; two other
children, Thomas, of Manhattan, and Nancy Joselson of Mamaroneck,
N.Y., and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel gleefully took credit for a stroke of political
gamesmanship at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City
in 1964. After a team of Republicans set up a billboard outside the
convention hall picturing their candidate, Barry Goldwater, with
the legend ``In Your Heart, You Know He's Right,'' Frankel and a
few fellow Democrats put up a huge sign directly under it reading,
``Yes _ Extreme Right.'' &QL;

CHARLES SCHAEFER JR. DIES AT 85; BUSINESSMAN AND PHILANTHROPIST

<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles V. Schaefer Jr., a New Jersey businessman who became a
major benefactor of Stevens Institute of Technology and chairman of
its board, died on Nov. 18 at the North Ridge Medical Center in
Oakland Park, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Saddle River, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens, where he
went to public schools. He received a degree in mechanical
engineering in 1936 from Stevens, in Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   After being a plant manager for DeLaval Steam Turbine Co. in
Trenton, he went on to become an owner of several manufacturing
companies with headquarters in New Jersey and was also chairman of
Schaefer Associates, an investment firm in River Edge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the Stevens board in 1996 when it voted to
name the college's new school of engineering in his honor. The
announcement came at the end of Stevens' four-year $102 million
capital campaign, of which he had been a co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   His support for Stevens also included founding the Charles V.
Schaefer Jr. Fund for Excellence and the Stevens Parent Association
and paying for the building of the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. Athletic
and Recreation Center.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' president, Hal Raveche, recalled that Schaefer used to
telephone him to ask whether he was sleeping and exercising enough
and taking vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He married Lillian A. Meyer in 1938. She died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Stephanie Tactikos; a
son, Charles Schaefer III of Franklin Lakes, N.J.; a daughter, Lynn
Schaefer Bovenizer of Pennington, N.J.; six grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.

MONTANA GOVERNOR PLEDGES TO ADDRESS LIBBY HEALTH CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ As a child, the governor of Montana played in the
piles of asbestos-contaminated vermiculite ore that some residents
in this small mining community say have caused death and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Racicot lived about 12 blocks from the buildings where the
W.R. Grace Co. stored and shipped the vermiculite, which was called
Zonolite. The company also experimented with the raw ore and the
tremolite asbestos it contained.
</P>
<P>
   No one in his family has had any lung diseases, he said
Wednesday, but admitted ``it's been a while'' since he's had a
chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   While Racicot may not be concerned about his health, he makes it
clear that that he's unhappy about the possibility that the state
dropped the ball when it came to Libby's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated and extremely worried about the situation,''
Racicot said. ``We have an obligation as a government to protect
our citizens, a statutory obligation, an ethical obligation and
yes, a moral obligation. If we failed to do that, then something is
very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Racicot went up to the mine frequently, and
remembers the Zonolite being all over town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I played in the piles,'' the governor said. ``We weren't
supposed to, but all the kids played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in our house. I can remember bringing the bags home
and putting it in as insulation in the roof and the walls,'' he
recalled. ``It was in the garden. It was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his favorite ice-fishing spot, down by the conveyor
that carried the ore over the Kootenai River to the railroad cars.
``We were down there quite a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle Post-Intelligencer investigation published last week
found that at least 192 miners and their family members have died
from the tremolite asbestos which contaminated the mine's
vermiculite ore. The newspaper found that another 375 people had
been diagnosed with fatal diseases caused by the fibers.
Information in hundreds of e-mails and telephone calls received by
the P-I indicate that the actual number of deaths and
asbestos-related diseases may be far higher.
</P>
<P>
   The question that is plaguing many residents is: Does a danger
still exist from what W.R. Grace left behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's obviously the first question that we're going to
address and we're starting now,'' said the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of inaction, there is almost a race to see who
can get to the truth first.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has had an emergency
response team in town for most of the week. They've set up
air-sampling monitors downtown and on the mountain where the mine
was. They're asking for residents who have Zonolite, the
vermiculite insulation, in their homes to allow the air to be
sampled. The EPA team is covering every corner of the community
with an urgency motivated by concern that rain and imminent heavy
snow will preclude meaningful testing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that investigators from the Montana Department
of Environmental Quality and the state health department are also
on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for W.R. Grace, which operated the mine from 1963
until it closed in 1990, said the company is extremely busy working
with the state and federal investigators, ``helping to provide
answers to the people of Libby.''
</P>
<P>
   Libby officials, including the mayor, told the P-I that state
agencies and the governor knew about the situation, and if anything
was wrong the governor would have told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not true,'' said Racicot. ``Not a single
official in Libby, Lincoln County nor the state had told me
anything, whatsoever, about the deaths, the amount of illness or
even the lawsuits in that community.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former Montana attorney general added, ``I should have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has ordered Montana department heads to determine
whether or not their agencies should have been involved in
protecting the public health in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to investigate that question thoroughly,'' he
said. ``We will determine whether or not that responsibility was
obviated for whatever reason, purposefully, knowingly or
negligently.''
</P>
<P>
   Racicot's grandfather arrived in Libby in 1917 to work as a
logging camp cook. Forty-nine years later, Racicot, then a
high-school senior, led the Libby team to its first and only state
basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Libby is a beautiful town that hasn't stooped to Western frills
to draw the tourists. The main street is dotted with gun and
antique shops, taxidermists, bookstores and espresso stands. You
can get a huge steak for $12 or gourmet duck with huckleberry
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 12,000 people or so that live in and near Libby are
feisty and independent, surrounded by the snow-capped Cabinet
Mountains, national forest land, fish-filled rivers and a waterfall
or two.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived the boom and bust of silver, gold and
vermiculite mines and of timber companies slashing their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 1950s, state inspectors were the first to
document that Grace workers were being contaminated with large
amounts of asbestos. But the reports were marked ``confidential''
and were given only to company management.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grace documents and interviews with workers, the
worldwide company never told its employees of the potential hazard
for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would never wash now,'' the governor said. ``It was
before OSHA, it was before the air quality act or the water quality
act. It was before public health became as prominent as it should
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things we take for granted today ... would be totally foreign
to people in those days,'' he said, adding that at the time,
regulators guaranteed the company confidentiality in order to get
public-health information.
</P>
<P>
   Racicot, a Republican, was elected Montana's 20th governor in
1992. He is now serving a second and final term. The governor is
helping run Texas Gov. George W. Bush's Republican presidential
campaign in the state. And some political types in the region say
he has his eye on a Cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his critics say Racicot is ``too nice to be real'' or
``too smooth,'' but none offered any specifics. He may be the only
governor in the nation who drives his own car and has his home
number listed in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the problems in Libby, his anger at the state's
inaction is barely concealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going fix what must be fixed and then we're going find
out how it happened,'' he said. ``We want people to see what we're
doing or see what we haven't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of this country and of this state understand that
human beings are fallible, but they will not tolerate or understand
human beings not being honest,'' he said.

L.A. OFFICIALS LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO CONTAMINATED SCHOOL
SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (EDITORS: Daily News Staff Writer Rick Orlov contributed to this

BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With the fate of the Belmont Learning Center
still unresolved, Mayor Richard Riordan and school board members
have focused on converting a hulking empty post office building
into a downtown high school.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the padlocked Terminal Annex post office has
risen above a slew of other possibilities to become the mayor's and
school board's favored site for a campus in the Belmont attendance
area, district and mayoral sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The 480,000-square-foot historical landmark would provide about
as much classroom space as Belmont, which sits partially completed
atop an oil field seeping potentially deadly and explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   The two properties are located less than five minutes away from
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been contacted by the mayor and members of the school
board, and they have expressed a significant interest in the
property,'' said Wayne Ratkovich, a partner in the development
consortium handling the complex for the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is likely that in the near future, we will be offering the
Terminal Annex building and the land on which it sits for sale or
lease. ... We have an agreement with the mayor that there will be
continuing discussions about the school district's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   While Riordan did not respond to specific questions from the
Daily News about the post office building, the mayor said on
Wednesday he believes the school district should begin looking at
another site for a downtown high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated issue,'' Riordan said of the Belmont
situation on his monthly ``Ask the Mayor'' radio show on KFWB-AM
(980).
</P>
<P>
   ``In a pure and simple world, I would say yes (to building on
the current site). But, with the politics of this and the
environmental studies, it could be another three to five years to
even begin construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means kids will be waiting three to five years for a
school they need now,'' the mayor said. ``I think we should look
for another solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the mayor confirmed he has been pushing the
idea of using the post office building as an alternative to
Belmont, along with scouting other locations around the city that
could be used as campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor supports the school board in considering all options
that will establish school sites sooner rather than later,''
spokeswoman Jessica Copen said.
</P>
<P>
   School board President Genethia Hayes referred to the Terminal
Annex building as a high priority option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been looking at that,'' Hayes said. ``It is definitely
a high priority proposal for the district in the event that we
decide not to go ahead with completing Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have many sites ready to go so the community around
Belmont gets a new school ASAP.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ratkovich, there has been a great deal of interest
in the Terminal Annex in recent weeks, including proposals from a
Pasadena arts college and several information technology companies.
Ratkovich would not disclose how much money the Postal Service is
seeking for the property.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Terminal Annex building, LAUSD administrators are
considering converting the district's downtown administrative
headquarters into a campus. There also is preliminary interest in
building schools where the Ambassador Hotel now stands and at the
site of the Pacific Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle in the way of converting the Terminal Annex
building into a school appears to be its landmark status. The
building's designation as a National Historic Place could prevent
the district from making significant renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed under the auspices of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's New Deal, the Terminal Annex building was declared a
landmark in 1995, shortly before it was padlocked. The complex
served as the city's main post office from 1940 to 1989, when a new
facility opened in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service continues to use a portion of the 18-acre
property as a distribution and retail center.
</P>
<P>
   According to two board members, who asked not to be named, the
board's decision last week to delay its vote on Belmont until next
month was partially designed to give the district added time to
compile information on the annex.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the school board has indicated they are leaning
toward abandoning Belmont, the nation's costliest high school. By
the board's unanimous decree, the construction site was to be
closed on Tuesday, with no work to resume at least until state
officials can complete environmental testing on the parcel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need to make some kind of decision on the
future of Belmont in early December,'' Hayes said.

  LOS ANGELES: December,'' Hayes said. 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But board member Victoria Castro, a vocal advocate of Belmont,
said she is seeking to put off a vote on the $282 million complex
until the district has worked out ``every last detail'' of building
another school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still support and believe we can construct the Belmont
Learning Center,'' Castro said. ``If the board decides not to go
forward, they cannot decouple that decision from the responsibility
of telling the community what the solution is. And it must be a
viable solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have an alternative site, there is no rush for a
decision on Belmont. There should be no more false promises to this
community,'' Castro said, referring to the district's failed
attempts to build a high school in the inner city for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Belmont, the five-story Terminal Annex building has been
given a clean bill of health by state environmental officials,
Ratkovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Methane and hydrogen sulfide contamination at Belmont would
require the district to install a $60 million system of vents,
vacuums, blowers and liners under the complex and playing fields to
make the property safe.
</P>
<P>
   A citizens commission narrowly advised the school board last
month to complete construction of the $282 million high school with
the costly technical fix. Muddling the recommendation, the
commission also concluded it would take at least five years to open
Belmont and determined another school could be built on safe ground
for the same price as completing the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the final vote on Belmont, the board is expected
to pursue up to two alternative sites for new schools in the
downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, has told the district
that the state would pick up as much as 80 percent of the tab to
convert the district's headquarters, located at 450 N. Grand Ave.,
into a campus.
</P>
<P>
   Similar funding would likely be available to convert the
Terminal Annex building into a campus.
</P>
<P>
   The state has refused to give the district any more money to
complete Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ambassador Hotel plan, the district would build a high
school on the rear portion of the abandoned historical landmark's
lot, and a private developer would build a movie theater and retail
shops along Wilshire Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   No details were immediately available with regard to the Pacific
Stock Exchange site, although that scenario is being championed by
state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, LAUSD Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller, a
real estate attorney, is guiding the board. Miller did not respond
to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky said all of the options to replace
Belmont ``sound like good places to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Terminal Annex looks like a quick solution to the
overcrowding problems,'' Tokofsky said. ``Ideally, we could put
about 2,500 kids at two schools, rather than all 5,000 in one place
like Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Any additional classroom space would help reduce massive
overcrowding in the Belmont attendance area and neighboring
inner-city communities. About 2,300 students who live near Belmont
are bused each school day to campuses more than 90 minutes away.

USC'S JUMPY LINE ALSO UNHEALTHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC is approaching its 12th game of the season,
but the offensive line remains full of issues heading into Friday's
contest with Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it isn't healthy. Starting center Eric Denmon is less
than 100 percent with a sprained ankle. Left tackle Brent McCaffrey
and left guard Donta Kendrick missed Wednesday's practice with the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, the line is coming off an atrocious
performance _ from a penalty standpoint _ that included eight false
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, our poise will be better in this game,'' offensive
line coach Steve Greatwood said. ``There was no excuse for it. The
thing that is disappointing is we did a nice job against Washington
State.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatwood was also disappointed because the line was often
fooled offsides by UCLA's voice signals along the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, we worked on that last week,'' Greatwood
said.
</P>
<P>
   Busy secondary: Freshman cornerbacks Darrell Rideaux and Kevin
Arbet should both start against Louisiana Tech because the Bulldogs
often use four or five wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that Arbet relishes, even with his
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to pick on me and Darrell,'' Arbet said. ``I
look forward to it. It's a challenge I'll meet head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbet did not allow any completions against UCLA, even though he
switched off defending Danny Farmer, Freddie Mitchell and Brad
Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   USC is also preparing to use cornerback Eric Reese and free
safety Troy Polamalu as reserves in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back: So far, USC coach Paul Hackett has been pleased
with the way the Trojans responded from their victory over UCLA,
and isn't overly concerned about a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practices have been really good,'' Hackett said. ``But now
you spend all the time with your family. All everybody will be
talking about is UCLA. A big part will be how we handle the next 24
hours. I thought we had really good focus and were zeroed in
(Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury's kicking: Hackett said sophomore David Newbury (11 for
19 this season) will kick against Louisiana Tech, although he has
split practice time with junior David Bell this week. But Hackett
also mentioned that the Trojans will have to consider whether to
recruit another kicker, and perhaps a punter, for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to study it real carefully,'' Hackett said. ``We
cannot go through another year with this inconsistency in the
kicking game.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele update: Outside linebacker Markus Steele (bruised stomach
muscle) practiced Wednesday and should be OK, although he will
split playing time with Darryl Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the quarterback: It's not enough that Louisiana Tech
quarterback Tim Rattay is the NCAA's second all-time leading passer
with 12,341 yards, but Bulldog quarterbacks have only been sacked
27 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can get enough pressure on them,'' Hackett
said. ``He doesn't stand there and throw the ball and they've got a
veteran offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight straight: USC has to deal with another eight-game winning
streak, and it has nothing to do with playing UCLA. Louisiana Tech
(8-2) has won eight straight games since season-opening losses to
No. 1-ranked Florida State (41-7) and No. 24 Texas A&AMP;M (37-17).
</P>
<P>
   It's the fourth-longest winning streak in the nation, and
includes a 29-28 victory over eighth-ranked Alabama.

<P>
   BEIJING _ ``I am the father of Patient 088, and I'd like to
express my gratitude but also say I am very dissatisfied,'' wrote
Zhao Kang in a letter to the Plastic Surgery Hospital in Beijing.
Instead of fixing his son's disfiguring cleft lip, as he had
wanted, the surgeons fixed the son's cleft palate, which had not
affected his speech and was not visible.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not Chinese surgeons the farmer was complaining
about. It was a team from the American charity Operation Smile, who
had raised the hopes of many parents like Zhao by bringing in
doctors and offering free surgery for children with cleft palates
and lips.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's son was among the 245 patients to be chosen, a great
stroke of fortune for a poor farmer who could never afford elective
surgery like this. Most emerged with the normal smile that is
promised by Operation Smile's name. But Zhao's son was among those
whose experience has raised serious questions, in China and in the
United States, about the program's practices.
</P>
<P>
   For the Zhao boy, the problem was the wrong operation; his lip
was only repaired, by Chinese doctors, after the Operation Smile
team left China. But there were many other and often more serious
problems when the 45 volunteers ended six frantic days of surgery,
in which they operated on 188 of the selected children. The
problems included heavy bleeding, repairs that split open, and even
the death of a patient that might have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that the operations were crude and hasty and the
surgical skill was _ dare I say _ below that of the surgeons
here,'' said Dr. Li Senkai, vice president of the hospital, China's
pre-eminent plastic surgery hospital, who was in charge of hosting
the group. The high-volume, ``assembly-line'' approach so worried
the hospital's honorary director, Song Ruyao, a well-known expert
on cleft lip and palate surgery, that he refused to come to work
after the first day of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admire and want to work with Dr. Magee and a project whose
spirit is so full of love and good will,'' said Li. ``But people
still have complaints and we have many ideas of how to improve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Magee, the plastic surgeon who founded Operation
Smile and serves as its chairman, said in a telephone interview in
Norfolk, Va., where the charity has its headquarters, that he had
no knowledge of the case involving Zhao's son. He said the charity
had not discussed the other problems with the Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Magee defended the quality of the care being provided. ``It is
not an assembly-line product,'' he said. ``It never has been.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Chinese doctors, when Operation Smile
departed, it volunteers left a famous but poor hospital with large
new debts, and its doctors with the task of following up
complications, redoing faulty operations, and calming some angry
families.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of the Plastic Surgery Hospital, an affiliate of
the Chinese Academy of Medicine, prompted the Ministry of Health to
convene a conference of directors from all six hospitals in China
that had hosted the charity over a decade, only to discover that
many had similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors agreed that Chinese hospitals could continue working
with Operation Smile and accepting its charity; one mission went to
Yunnan province earlier this month. But the meeting also concluded
that the charity should coordinate more with local surgeons and be
far more closely supervised by the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ensure the quality of treatment, the level of Operation
Smile's scientific knowledge and expertise should be improved,''
said a 1998 report by Chinese doctors who worked with Operation
Smile. ``Responsibility to the patient should come first. The
quality of the treatment should not be sacrificed to
self-promotion,'' said the report, which was made available to The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile said it had not seen the report. ``We have a
long, long history in China in many, many sites,'' said Magee, who
said he had not heard of any Health Ministry meeting or about any
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Cleft lips and palate deformities are relatively common in
China, especially in the countryside, where the condition may
result from marriage of close relatives as well as pollution, say
doctors. Having a cleft lip or palate is rarely life-threatening,
and corrective surgery is generally considered an elective
procedure _ although one that can greatly improve a child's
appearance and speech.
</P>
<P>
   Risks associated with the surgery are low, although they exist.
``In the United States it's extremely uncommon to lose a child, for
a child to die, from cleft lip or palate surgery,'' said Dr.
Marilyn Jones, the president of the American Cleft Palate and
Craniofacial Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Operation Smile has had 16 deaths during its history, three
of them in China. In Beijing a child died just after anesthesia was
induced, without proper monitoring. In the mid-'90s, two children
died during an Operation Smile mission in Shantou in southern
China, said Dr. Li Yu, a surgeon at the university hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   The Plastic Surgery Hospital in Beijing had never had a child
die during cleft lip or palate surgery until Operation Smile,
doctors there said. The hospital's staff was shaken by an egregious
error: Although the hospital possesses and requires the use of
modern equipment to monitor anesthesia during surgery, Operation
Smile decided not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw American-trained anesthesiologists using these
primitive methods, our impression was that they must have developed
these methods for use in remote rural areas,'' said the hospital's
professor of anesthesia. ``We would never use them here, and my
guess is that they would never be used at an American hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor said it is still not clear what killed the
3-year-old adopted boy, from rural Shaanxi Province, although he
said the child's heart was normal and that he suspected an
anesthesia overdose. He added that whatever the cause, a modern
monitoring system would have detected the problem long before the
child went into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, who was infertile and recently married for the
second time, had taken the extremely rare step in China of adopting
a handicapped child. She was devastated by his death, doctors said,
and, like several other patients, wanted to sue. Operation Smile
offered her the equivalent of about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said he did not know about any offer from the group but
said any gesture was well-meaning. ``Any distortion of that is
ludicrous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the death, the hospital directors shut down the Operation
Smile program for a day and then reluctantly allowed the charity to
re-start surgery, once full monitoring was assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is tragic,'' said Magee. He said
that Operation Smile took several measures to improve safety after
the Beijing mission, as it does after all of its missions. ``We are
constantly improving the services we give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our respect for life and dignity is paramount,'' Magee said.
</P>
<P>
   But death in surgery can be unpredictable, and it is the high
rate of complications of Operation Smile in Beijing that stands
out.
</P>
<P>
   Always thinking big, Operation Smile had planned so many
surgeries during its brief stay in Beijing, that the Plastic
Surgery Hospital decided to provide its own staff for two of the
nine operating rooms to accommodate the overflow. Over five days,
Operation Smile did 188 operations in rooms 1 through 7; Chinese
doctors did 61 operations in rooms 8 and 9. The results were very
different.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study done at the hospital, of the 61 operations
with Chinese surgeons, only two caused any post-operative problems,
in both cases minor bleeding. But over 40 patients under the care
of Operation Smile had serious complications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the death, more than 30 children's palates split
open; suffered tissue death, or had other problems healing. Of
these, two children went into shock from massive bleeding and, in
the case of 6-month-old Wang Qing, nurses had to donate their own
blood for transfusions, since blood typing had not been performed.
The nurses were universal donors, and the girl was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical textbooks have never recorded such a high complication
rate for this surgery'' said Li of the Plastic Surgery Hospital.
``It is unacceptable from the perspective of both medicine and
modern society.'' And at the meeting called by the Health Ministry,
other hospitals, like the one in Zhaoqing, reported rates that were
higher still.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese doctors also complained that surgeons and
anesthesiologists from Operation Smile rarely saw their young
patients or the parents of the patients outside of the operating
room, creating a situation that led to mishaps like the wrong
surgery being performed on Zhao's son, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child has an examination by a surgeon before,'' said
Magee.
</P>
<P>
   Many surgeons at the hospital felt that Operation Smile failed
to deliver on important promises.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Plastic Surgery Hospital gladly emptied 6 normally
teeming wards to accommodate the program, scheduling little surgery
of their own during the visit. It seemed a worthy cause and an
opportunity to learn from foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. charity had promised the hospital professional and
highly qualified plastic surgeons. Instead the seven doctors it
sent proved to be mostly young, inexperienced and non-American,
according to the report the hospital compiled on the mission. In
addition to the two American surgeons, there was one each from
Colombia, Singapore, the Philippines, China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, hospital officials have calculated that its
association with the well-financed U.S. charity cost it over
$200,000 _ a small fortune to a struggling state hospital which,
despite modern equipment, still houses patients on metal cots in
crumbling wards.
</P>
<P>
   To complete more than 200 operations in such a short time, the
hospital had to call in its own staff to work overtime. After the
volunteers left, it was left to Chinese doctors to take care of the
patients and to re-operate on those like Zhao's son, who had
botched or unsatisfactory operations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated requests for more money, Operation Smile
reimbursed the hospital about $25,000. The hospital failed to meet
the next month's payroll. China's hospitals have lost much of their
state subsidies and have to rely on patient charges to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said he did not know about the specifics of the finances.
``We were there with hard-earned fund-raising dollars,'' he said,
and the vast majority of children were given a chance at a new
life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hospital's dozens of trained plastic surgeons hope
to collaborate again with Operation Smile, but on very different
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of delegation of 45, which included many
non-professionals, they would like to see a small team of experts,
who would teach their Chinese counterparts new techniques.
</P>
<P>
   They would also like some help with equipment purchases and
financial support for developing a permanent home-grown team of
Chinese surgeons who could offer free surgery themselves. They note
that the hospital surgeons already perform hundreds of cleft lips
and palate surgeries a year on paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Operation Smile can bring us information on
contemporary medical science and examples of good surgeons,'' Li
said, adding with characteristic Chinese politeness: ``To an
extent, our Chinese surgeons are also qualified to do such work.''

RESIDENTS AND CIVIC LEADERS MEET TO CONFRONT REPORTS OF BIGOTRY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Conn. _ In church and in City Hall, leaders and
residents of this middle-class shoreline suburb halfway between New
Haven and Bridgeport have been gathering over the last two weeks to
discuss what has become a too-familiar concern in southern
Connecticut: reports of bigotry in their community.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people, including a panel of local elected
officials, clergy members and grade-school students, met Monday
night at City Hall to voice a variety of emotions stirred up by the
Nov. 11 arrest of a local white couple, who were charged with
making threats and racial slurs against their neighbors, a biracial
couple.
</P>
<P>
   The week before the arrest, a small group of men dressed in the
white robes of the Ku Klux Klan spent several days in town
disseminating literature about their white supremacist
organization, at one point, according to several accounts, stopping
outside the home of the biracial couple. While they broke no laws,
their presence added to a sense of menace here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot, will not tolerate bigotry,'' said Albert J. DeLuca,
minority leader of Milford's Board of Aldermen. He was among a
dozen officials who spoke at Monday night's forum, which was
organized by state Sen. Winthrop Smith Jr., a Republican, as a
chance for elected officials to express their feelings about the
incidents publicly. ``These actions made me angry,'' Smith said.
``This was not the town I was born and raised in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 16, the Board of Aldermen passed a resolution condemning
acts of bigotry. Two days earlier, an ecumenical service at the
Woodmont United Church of Christ drew almost 300 residents in a
show of support against hate crimes. And a task force is being
organized through the church to examine ways residents can prevent
such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt that it was important for the community to come
together and take a stand against hate and prejudice,'' said
Woodmont's pastor, the Rev. Paige Besse-Rankin, who organized the
church service. ``We do not want our city to be a place where the
Ku Klux Klan can recruit a single soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Frederick L. Lisman said that there was some touchiness in
Milford over racial issues, dating to 1995, when the federal
government, prompted by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, sued the city, alleging that it had
discriminated against minorities when it abandoned a plan to build
low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also lamented the vitriol that surfaced in several
local races during fall elections; though race was not an issue, he
said the campaigns had a hostile tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see our community end up like so many others,
where people are confrontational,'' he said. ``I want to see people
working to solve problems in a civil manner and treating people
with respect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two other shoreline cities, Norwalk and Stamford, have also had
recent brushes with bigotry. In August, a bag of medical waste with
a note carrying an anti-Semitic message was left outside a
synagogue in each city, the incidents coming within several days of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Norwalk has had three other incidents. In October, racist
graffiti was found outside a community center. On Halloween,
headstones at a Jewish cemetery were defaced with anti-Semitic
graffiti. And on Nov. 2, two men fled after a passer-by saw them
preparing to throw Molotov cocktails at the same synagogue where
the medical waste had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Norwalk's mayor, Frank J. Esposito, said that many civic
meetings had been held in response and that police officers had
been stationed around the clock at all synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Stamford, Dannel P. Malloy, said city officials had
taken a variety of steps, including meeting with concerned
citizens. The police are offering tips on security procedures for
any group that asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We react very seriously to this,'' Malloy said. But he and
others said they believed the incidents were unrelated and not part
of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Leikind, regional director of the Connecticut office of
the Anti-Defamation League, said that although recent incidents had
received wide notoriety, there was ``a steady drumbeat of incidents
that happen.'' He attributed these to a small minority that he said
nevertheless needed to be taken seriously. By and large, however,
he said a rough social consensus continued to make such acts
repellent to most.
</P>
<P>
   This year in Milford, all public school students are taking part
in a new, yearlong program about respecting differences in others.
</P>
<P>
   Savva Savvidis, 13, an eighth grader at East Shore Middle School
who joined in a poetry reading at Monday night's forum, said that
though racism was not an issue at his school, tolerating
differences sometimes was.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our schools,'' he said, ``there's a lot of kids making fun
of other kids because of the way they dress or the way they look,
and it's just dumb.''

THE BIG CITY COLUMN: BUMPER CROP OF BEDROOMS AND CLOSETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``It's a real blessing,'' Kathryn Sanders said more
than once as she conducted the tour of her new home. For 16 years,
Ms. Sanders, a special-education teacher at a public school in
Chelsea, had been living in a vintage Lower East Side tenement that
looked nothing like this place.
</P>
<P>
   She and her two children, 13 and 15, had been squeezed into a
railroad flat with one tiny bedroom that barely had room for Ms.
Sanders' bed. The children slept on bunk beds in the living room.
Their new home, a duplex apartment at 13th Street and Avenue A, has
1,300 square feet and three bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are so glad to be getting their own rooms,'' Ms.
Sanders said. ``They're teenagers. They need their space, and
sometimes I need them to have their space.'' She showed her
daughter's room on the first floor and stopped to admire the
closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old apartment there was only one closet for everyone _
one little closet,'' she said. ``When they built those tenements I
guess people had their one good dress and coat. I still can't get
used to all the space here. I walk around and have to pinch
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out the two bathrooms and the closet with the
washer-dryer _ ``No more schlepping to the corner for laundry'' _
and went on marveling at the kind of things that do not cause most
middle-class Americans to give thanks today. But it's easy for a
cramped New Yorker to understand her feelings, especially once you
hear another amazing feature of the apartment: it costs her less
than $1,300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanders was one of the 2,000 people in the lottery to buy
the 98 apartments in Del Este Village, a joint project of the city
and a nonprofit group, the New York City Housing Partnership, to
sell homes to people whose household income was less than $70,500
per year. Because the city donated the land and provided, together
with the state, a capital subsidy of $20,000 toward the
construction of her apartment, Ms. Sanders had to pay only $150,000
for it.
</P>
<P>
   As government housing programs go, this one is a bargain not
just for Ms. Sanders but for the city. A conservative might object
to the public subsidy, but it's a relatively cheap way to provide
affordable housing while also putting vacant lots back on the tax
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal might prefer devoting the money to housing for the
poor, but the result would be many fewer homes. And the
middle-class lottery winners are not the only beneficiaries,
because their old homes, like Ms. Sanders' tiny $500-a-month
rent-stabilized apartment, are freed for others.
</P>
<P>
   But building anything is never easy in New York, and this
project encountered fierce opposition because several community
gardens had to be bulldozed to make room for the apartments. The
neighborhood was plastered with posters showing pictures of an
earthworm and a real-estate developer under the question, ``Which
kind of worm would you rather have in the neighborhood?'' When the
developer, Donald Capoccia of BFC Partners, showed up at a public
hearing, he found his picture on signs emblazoned, ``Wanted for
Rape of Community Gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   The gardeners lost this fight, but they've been winning other
ones recently to keep vacant lots from being developed. The
green-versus-greed theme is good public relations, and there's some
truth to it: a well-maintained garden open to everyone is a
valuable communal good not always provided by the market. But many
community gardens are ramshackle lots, and many are essentially
personal fiefdoms of people who get free private yards during a
severe housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never understand some of the gardeners,'' said Capoccia,
who estimated it cost him $250,000 in legal fees to defeat them in
court. ``When it came time to clear the lots, they asked me if I
could delay a few weeks. They said they wanted to transplant some
specimens to their country homes. Their country homes! People with
country homes were fighting an affordable-housing project so they
could have a second garden in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The country squires may not have been representative of the
gardeners' side in the debate, but then, neither were the pictures
of developers representative of the other side. This dispute
ultimately wasn't a conflict between gardeners and developers. It
was a conflict between gardeners and people like the Sanders
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that living room,'' Ms. Sanders said at the end of the
tour. ``this year we'll finally have room for a Christmas tree.
It's funny, but our old apartment never felt like home. Even before
we've moved in, this one does. It's just a real blessing.''

Cowboys putting focus on winning, not Johnson
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson and Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones have been downplaying Johnson's return to Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They both say there is mutual admiration and a lack of animosity
between the two. Both want today's focus to be on the Thanksgiving
Day game _ a matchup that means so much for two teams hoping to win
their respective divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect him a lot, and he really is a great coach,'' Jones
said. ``But this is an important game for us because of the
situation we find ourselves in. We've got to bounce back after a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Johnson will meet his former boss since
he left in 1994. In 1996, the Dolphins faced the Cowboys in Miami,
a game Dallas won.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of current Cowboys who played under Johnson.
All agree the theme of the day won't revolve around Johnson's
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it makes for a great story about Jimmy's tenure here
and how it all ended, but we're not playing Jimmy,'' quarterback
Troy Aikman said. ``Jimmy is on the sidelines, and I don't pay a
whole lot of attention to any of the coaches, no matter who we are
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Johnson be using this game to motivate the Dolphins, who
at 8-2 are tied for the second-best record in the league?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably telling them this is one team I don't want to
lose to,'' Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith said. ``I can hear him
now. `The trap is set. They're no 5-5 team.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys are a 5-5 team, tied with the New York Giants in
the NFC East. Both teams trail the 6-4 Redskins for the division
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want, you could use it as a mental boost,'' Cowboys
defensive lineman Chad Hennings said. ``Do I? No. I've got enough
on my mind besides worrying about who the opposing coach is.''
</P>
<P>
   Like how they can turn around their season. They've won only one
of their last four games and two of their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm worried. Who wouldn't be worried?'' Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said. ``It's my job to worry. We are capable. We just
haven't done it yet. But I think we have a chance to be a very good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season, the Cowboys are admitting to a
sense of desperation. After all, this team has lost leads in five
games. They've had to pull off defensive stops at the end in a
couple of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely desperate,'' Hennings said. ``We're in dire
straits right now. That's the attitude we have to take, that we
have to finish off games. I think we've been leading at the half in
almost every game we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the focus won't be on coaches and owners once they step
on the field, it will most definitely be on two starting
quarterbacks who are expected to return from injuries. Aikman
missed the last two games and parts of the two previous after
suffering back-to-back concussions in Indianapolis and Minnesota.
The Cowboys went 1-1 with Jason Garrett as the starter and are 1-3
over that four-game span. Aikman hasn't experienced any headaches
or dizziness for more than a week. He was kept out of Sunday's loss
at Arizona as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins won't name their starting quarterback until just
before game time, but Dan Marino, who has had a pinched nerve in
his neck, has been throwing and analyzing game film for the first
time since getting injured Oct. 17 against New England. Damon
Huard, who suffered a deviated septum last week, led the Dolphins
to a 5-1 record while Marino was sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a pretty good chance,'' Marino said. ``I felt
pretty good. But to tell you that I felt like I have in the past
and at the level that I'm used to, I could say I'm not maybe quite
there yet. But I'm pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino doesn't know how his neck will react to a hit, and the
Cowboys are certain to dole some out. The Cowboys have had 27 sacks
this season, led by defensive end Greg Ellis' 6.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important whether (Dan is) hurt or not to keep him
healthy,'' guard Kevin Gogan said. ``He's our meal ticket for what
we're trying to get done. I think we're improving as an offensive
line, but it's not just the offensive line, it's the backs and the
tight ends, too. Everyone's got to come together, even if we have
to keep an extra guy in to block to keep our quarterback healthy.
If that's what we have to do, that's what we should do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense also ranks sixth against the pass and sixth
in total yards. Dallas has 16 interceptions this season, but the
secondary has been decimated by injuries. Cornerbacks Deion Sanders
(hamstring/groin) and Kevin Smith (hamstring), and safety George
Teague (shoulder) are all expected to play despite their injuries.
Cornerback Kevin Mathis (hamstring) is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could happen is that the Cowboys treat Dan like a young
quarterback and blitz him all the time and see if he can make the
throws he's normally capable of making,'' Miami receiver Oronde
Gadsden said. ``Until he beats them _ then they would probably back
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense is starting to look healthy again, though
they'll still be missing lineman Larry Allen (knee). The Cowboys
had the No. 1 rushing attack with a healthy Smith, but dropped to
fourth during his absence. Smith, who returned against Arizona less
than two weeks after surgery to repair a broken bone in his right
hand, missed most of two games with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me when Troy is out there, he's playing as well as
I've seen him play and, of course, Emmitt is still rushing for a
lot of yards,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor in this game could be the home-field
advantage. As Johnson knows, the Cowboys play well on their own
turf, good enough this year for a 4-0 record. They are 1-5 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is not far from putting it all together,'' Smith
said. ``If we can put it together for four quarters and do it on a
consistent basis, we can get on one heck of a run.''

MARY BERGMAN, ACTRESS, 38; VOICED PARTS ON `SOUTH PARK'  
 JOHN G. STEWART BOOK EXECUTIVE, 80   
 BERNARD KLATZKO, 73, JAZZ RECORD PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Mary Kay Bergman, whose many voices were heard on ``South Park''
and in other animated television shows and films, died on Nov. 11
at her home in Los Angeles. She was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said
Officer Charlotte Broughton of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergman was a sought-after voice-over actress for the last
two decades. She provided the voices of most of the female
characters on ``South Park,'' the irreverent hit television series
on Comedy Central. Because the show's characters are so sketchily
drawn, Ms. Bergman's voices were perhaps more important than usual
in an animation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergman was found dead in her bedroom in a home she shared
with her husband, Dino Andrade, in the Venice Beach area. She was
discovered by Andrade and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a complete surprise,'' her lawyer, Robert Harrison,
told The San Diego Union-Tribune, adding that there had been no
prior sign of depression. ``She did leave a note, a reason, but it
didn't make any sense,'' Harrison said. ``She was a victim of
mental illness, and no one knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergman's other credits included the movies ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``The Iron
Giant,'' ``Mulan,'' ``The Little Mermaid'' and ``Hercules.'' She
was also the official voice of Snow White and the character Daphne
Blake for several ``Scooby Doo'' videos and did voice-overs for
popular video games.
</P>
<P>
   After studying at UCLA from 1978 to 1981, Ms. Bergman worked
with an acting troupe called the Groundlings. She also taught the
technique of doing voice-overs for animation at the Kalmenson and
Kalmenson Studios in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, no survivors were immediately identified.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Stewart Book Executive, 80
</P>
<P>
   John G. Stewart, former manager of The New York Times Book
Division, died on Tuesday at his home in Rumson, N.J. He was 80. He
had a brief illness, his wife, Linda, said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was born in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., grew up there, graduated
from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and, in 1940, from Harvard
College. He was a pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II and
got a master's degree in 1947 from the Columbia School of
Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for what is now United Press International and This
Week magazine before becoming an editor for The New York Times
Sunday Magazine in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   He became the manager of The New York Times Book Division when
it was established in 1963. In its first three years, the division
issued more than 50 titles in collaboration with 25 publishers; it
became Times Books and was later sold to Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Later he held a variety of positions at The New York Times Co.
He retired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Helen Markel ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Linda, he is survived by a sister, Jane
Heckman of Lombard, Ill.; his son and daughter from his first
marriage, Mark, of Monmouth Hills, N.J., and Jennifer Stewart of
Studio City, Calif.; three stepchildren; and 12 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Klatzko, 73, Jazz Record Producer
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Klatzko, a researcher, author and record producer
specializing in acoustic blues and early jazz, died on Nov. 15 at
North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications following lymphoma, said Barbara
Dolan, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s Klatzko and the author Gayle Wardlow traveled
to the Mississippi Delta looking for people who knew blues singers
like Charley Patton, Son House and Skip James. His interviews and
his 78-r.p.m. recordings of early jazz and country blues became
source material for archival reissues from the Origin Jazz Library
and Yazoo records. His research was an important part of the
rediscovery of such musicians during the folk revival of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s Klatzko started his own label, Herwin Records,
to issue rare jazz and blues recordings from his own collection; he
even released a few recordings in the 78-rpm format by Willie Brown
and Skip James. Klatzko also wrote biographical articles on blues
and jazz musicians for magazines.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Joseph, of Deer Park, N.Y.; a daughter,
Rose Ferris of Canada; and four grandchildren.
