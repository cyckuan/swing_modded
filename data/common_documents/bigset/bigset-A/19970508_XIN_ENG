<HEADLINE> Britain to Start Constructive Talks on Lifting Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government has
indicated that it wants to work constructively to lift a year-old
European Union (EU) ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview today, Agriculture
Minister Jack Cunningham said, "Our urgent objective is an end to
the beef ban and we need to map out in a much more constructive
way how we believe that can be achieved in partnership with our
European colleagues."
</P>
<P>
"There's no good threatening beef wars, as we saw the last
administration did. That made a difficult situation much worse, and
if we can do this within the terms of the Florence agreement --
then fine," Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cunningham made it clear that progress would not be
easy and Prime Minister Tony Blair's intention that his government
should be positive in its dealings with Europe would help.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give the impression that I am a starry-eyed
optimist about it, but I think we will have a more constructive
dialogue and in doing so will improve the chances of getting more
of the kind of response we want to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef exports in
March 1996 after British scientists uncovered evidence that BSE or
mad cow disease could probably be transmitted to humans. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Colorful Activities to Mark HK Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 170 programs of
celebration will be staged here between late June and early July
to mark the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, which falls on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people can either catch a glimpse of the festivity on
the scene or watch various programs to be televised live on
circuit, said Raymond Wu, chairman of the committee for
celebrating Hong Kong's return to China -- a body specially
founded to organize and coordinate non-governmental activities of
celebration.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing today, Wu said the eve of the handover will
be highlighted by a carnival in Victoria Park, a spectacular
performance at the Happy Valley race course and a television
special at the Hong Kong Cultural Center in Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, hundreds of domestic and overseas musicians, singers
and film stars will perform at the Reunification Gala to be held
at the 25,000-seat Hong Kong Coliseum. At the same time, a
spectacular fireworks and laser display will light up the sky over
the Victoria Harbor, which links the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong
Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
A float parade will take place on the main streets on the Hong
Kong Island on July 2, also a public holiday. And on the following
day, a week-long music festival will begin, featuring a variety
of programs by local and international artists. Starting from
late June, a seven-day exhibition highlighting scientific
cooperation between China's inland areas and Hong Kong will be
opened at the City University.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan, vice-chairman of the committee, said: "Through all
these activities, we want to convey a message to Hong Kong
residents that reunification is a matter that needs participation
from all of us. We should make joint efforts to create a new era."
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure of these events would not exceed 80
million HK dollars (about 10 million U.S. dollars), which the
committee has already raised.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to End Occupation of Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel must stop all actions that
change the status of the city of Jerusalem, including
expropriation of land and properties, a Chinese international
issue expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Israel had no right to declare Jerusalem to be its capital,
said Yang Guang, Deputy Director General of Beijing's Institute
for West Asian and African Studies, at the United Nations Asian
Seminar and NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) Symposium on the
Question of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Palestinian people have the inalienable right
to return to their homes and properties from which they have been
displaced and uprooted.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the only way to solve the question of Palestine is to
fully respect the Palestinian people's inalienable rights.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians began to be displaced from their homeland in
the first Middle East war in 1948 and in 1967 when their
territories were occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies had estimated that about 1.1 million Palestinians
have become refugees as the direct results of the two wars, and
the number does not take into account the natural demographic
growth of the refugees. The refugees live in their neighboring
countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, held from may 5 to 7, is under the auspices of the
U.N. in cooperation with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Among the 200 participants of the seminar were representatives
from Asian countries and the United Nations, foreign ambassadors
to Indonesia and representatives from Indonesia's universities and
Asian NGOs.

<HEADLINE> World Drug Sale Growth Slows Down in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The pace of growth for drug sales in
the world's biggest markets slowed down slightly in the first two
months of this year compared with 1996, according to a market
researcher.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by IMS International, the specialist
pharmaceuticals market researchers, showed that sales in January
and February in the world's top 10 drug markets were 26.4 billion
US dollars, 6 percent up on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate for the whole of 1996 was 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that the growth was led by the US, the largest national
market, where sales grew 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Germany ranked the second and the third biggest
markets, with sales growing 1 percent to 6.3 billion US dollars
and falling 1 percent to 2.6 billion US dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sales by medical area showed sharp differences. Fastest growing
are sales of anti-infectives, which rose 13 percent to 3.2 billion
US dollars, making it the fourth biggest medical area.
</P>
<P>
Also growing quickly were sales of nervous system drugs, which
grew 10 percent to 3.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Digestive system drug sales grew far more slowly, which rose
only 4 percent to 4.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Heart drug sales were also hit by the expiry of patents,
growing only 4 percent to 5.2 billion US dollars, but they
remained the biggest selling medical area.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a seminar on the
Palestine issue, which ended here today, expressed support for the
middle east peace process and stressed the need for the full
implementation of the agreements reached between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
A final document, issued at the conclusion of the United
Nations Asian seminar and NGO (non-governmental organization)
symposium on the question of Palestine, called on the two sides to
fulfill their agreements, especially the Declaration of Principles
in September 1993 and the Interim Agreement of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, under the auspices of the Committee on
the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People,
was attended by about 200 representatives from Asia and other
regions, the United Nations, international organizations and NGOs.
</P>
<P>
The representatives and experts on the Middle East issue
emphasized the significance of the role that the countries of Asia
and Pacific had to play, and could continue to play, towards a
comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the question of
Palestine in accordance with the relevant United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their support for the struggle of the
Palestinian people to achieve their inalienable rights, including
the establishment of their state, with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The participants also expressed serious concern over the
current stalemate in the peace process, particularly as a result
of the Israeli policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
The final document said that the Israeli settlements in the
occupied territory, including Jerusalem, are illegal. It called on
all countries to make additional efforts and take collective
measures to end that policy.
</P>
<P>
The document emphasized that NGOs constitute an emerging force
in the changing landscape of international politics.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Asia-Pacific NGOs to continue to work for the
achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said here today that London has entered a new era in its relations
with European continental countries and will fully participate in
the process of European construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that although his country will continue to protect its
own "vital interests" such as independently running its own border
control, Britain's interests will be better served if "we don't
fight with the rest of Europe on every subject, as the
Conservatives did."
</P>
<P>
Cook, who held talks today with French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette, is on his first visit abroad since the establishment
of the new Labor government in Britain last week. He will go to
Germany later today to meet with his counterpart, Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
He chastised what he called the "sterile and negative" European
policy followed by the former Conservative government, and said
that Britain wishes to become "one of the three principal members
of the EU (European Union), working together to achieve the
realizations for the interests of our peoples."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the wish that the Intergovernmental
Conference on EU institutional reforms will be a success during
the EU summit to be held in mid-June in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed today to continue to work with France for adopting a
common position on the institutional reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook also met with French Socialist Party First Secretary
Lionel Jospin and said that the Labor Party will develop relations
with its brother party in France and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
France, Britain and Germany will also issue a common
declaration today in Bonn on the banning of anti-personnel land
mines.

MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his Security Council today approved a document on the future of
the country's national security at a meeting in the Kremlin,
reported Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The document states in four parts the threats to the country's
security, the government objectives and strategy in the field of
national security, a Security Council official told Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
The 30-page document stressed that domestic social instability
and sluggish economy are the biggest threat to Russia's security
at present and in the foreseeable future, with military threat
excluded, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The priorities at present are to strengthen social stability,
complete and develop the idea of statehood and federalism, as well
as to boost the economy, said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin admitted at the meeting that the planned
eastward expansion of NATO is one of the most serious problems
facing Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia would take action against any threat to its security
from the expansion, which will include some eastern European
countries of the former Warsaw Pact bloc, Yeltsin warned.

Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Rises at Fastest Rate in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The non-farm productivity in the
U.S. increased at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first three
months of this year, the fastest rate in more than three years,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. productivity increase in the quarter was nearly double
the 1.1 percent rate of the last quarter of 1996 and it was the
best since the 2.8 percent rate of the fourth quarter of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, the key measure of how fast living can rise,
measures output per hour of work. The sluggish growth since the
1970s in the U.S. is viewed as the root of many economic problems,
including relatively slow inflation-adjusted income growth.
</P>
<P>
It has averaged about a 1 percent gain a year for more than two
decades in the United States. But U.S. productivity increases
exceeded 3 percent a year in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that unit-labor costs -- a key ingredient in
pressures on product costs -- rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in
the first quarter. That was up from 2.5 percent in the fourth
quarter but below the 3.3 percent rate in the second and third
quarters of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Worker compensation, when adjusted for inflation, rose at a 2.3
percent annual rate, the highest in five years and three times the
0.7-percent gain in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The faster productivity can result in faster wages increases
without raising prices because workers are producing more with the
same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. economists believe that actual U.S. productivity
growth in recent years has been better than reported by the
government. That's because of the difficulty of measuring
efficiency gains in services.
</P>
<P>
They said that this would explain why economic growth has been
robust in the country, with unemployment near a 24-year low, while
inflation has been restrained at levels last seen in the 1960s.

JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad today became the first head of government to be awarded South

</P>
<P>
Mahathir became the 27th recipient since Mandela's inauguration in
1994, joining several heads of state such as Queen Elizabeth II,
French Presidents Francoise Mitterand and Jacques Chirac, Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and Samora Machel of Mozambique who received the
honour posthumously last October.

companies have shown interest and lined up as bidders to purchase
the mine whose infrastructure is still intact.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Confirms Rooivalk Helicopter Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad today confirmed for the first time that
his country will buy South African-made Rooivalk attack
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town after having been awarded
South Africa's highest honour, the Order of Good Hope, by
President Nelson Mandela, Mahathir said the Malaysian airforce
had evaluated the Rooivalk and "the chances are that we will
decide to purchase".
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, heading a large Malaysian business and Foreign
Ministry delegation, arrived in the country earlier in the day
from Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Defence Minister Joe Modise indicated
that he will visit Malaysia in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Malaysia is negotiating with South
Africa's leading arms manufacturer Denel to buy eight Rooivalks,
and the first two helicopters are expected to be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
During Mandela's state visit to Malaysia in March this year,
senior South African officials indicated that Mahathir had agreed
to go ahead with the Rooivalk deal.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from Denel, who has offices in the
Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, declined to confirmed the deal,
saying it is Mahathir's prerogative to make an announcement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Studies New Deputy Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
reviewed proposals for the number of deputies from ethnic
minorities to the next National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Participants at today's discussions of the 25th meeting of the
NPC Standing Committee said they believe that the proposal on the
number of deputies to be chosen from ethnic groups represents
equality among various ethnic groups in China, and conforms to the
realities of different locations.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Guizhou Province, people from various
ethnic groups account for 36.7 percent of the province's total
population and the number of deputies is 40 percent of the
province's total deputies, NPC Standing committee member Wang
Chaoyi said, noting that, "The proposal is reasonable and gives
priority to the minority ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
To accord with the stipulation that deputies from ethnic groups
be about 12 percent of all the country's deputies, 360 deputies
should be elected from China's 55 ethnic groups. Each of the 35
ethnic groups that has a small population will have a deputy, to
ensure that every minority ethnic group has at least one deputy.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee member Lin Liyun said that although the
total number of deputies to the next National People's Congress
is smaller than to the current National People's Congress, deputies
from Taiwan Province will remain the same. "This shows that the
central government places great importance on compariots from
Taiwan Province," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, many people of the Gaoshan
nationality in Taiwan who have visited the motherland have been
deeply impressed by the equality of people from various ethnic
groups, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the discussions also said they agree to the
proposal on the number of deputies at the provincial level. Yu
Xinglong, vice-chairman of the NPC Nationalities Committee, said
that the proposal is legal and reasonable. The number of deputies
is smaller but the quality is higher, Yu said, and this helps
improve efficiency and they will represent the wishes of the
people who elect them.

<HEADLINE> French Right-Left Support Rates Gap Continues to Narrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The gap of support rates between
France's ruling majority and the leftwing oppositions is
continuing to narrow, with 43 percent of the people wishing a
center-right victory in the legislative elections, and 41 percent
supporting the left.
</P>
<P>
A poll by the IFOP polling institute published today showed the
result three weeks from the holding of the first round of the
election on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen percent of the people polled refuse to give their
opinions, 12 points less than the previous poll conducted on April
24, while the support rate for the center-right increased by four
points, and that for the left by eight points since the last poll.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 40 percent of the people polled said that they have
a good impression of Socialist Party chief Lionel Jospin, and 33
percent said that they prefer Prime Minister Alain Juppe.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hong Kong Stock Index Keeps Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua Correspondent Li Huailin) -- The Hang
Seng Index (HSI), a key indicator for blue chips on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, rose 26 points to close at 13,605 today.
</P>
<P>
The HSI has risen by 1,004 points in the past six trading days
after it stayed at around 12,500 points for 35 trading days in
nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
The six consecutive trading days started from last Wednesday
when the HSI soared by 303 points and on Monday this week, it
jumped 317 points.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of December 1996, the HSI topped 13,000 points
for the first time and on January 20, it reached 13,868 points,
the highest for the year.
</P>
<P>
However, on March 12, it began to fall from the 13,000 level
due to the decline of the sub-index of properties, according to
local stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said it is only natural that the HSI experienced
some adjustment after it had remained on the 13,000 level for
about five months.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also contributed the decline of the index to the
Hong Kong government's measures to curb speculations on the local
property market and possible rises in U.S. interest rates in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
But, they said, after the adjustment, an upward trend was
re-emerging on the local bourse, mainly pushed by the good
performance of China-funded stocks in Hong Kong, the sub-index of
properties and overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Today's Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the
performance of the 25 Chinese state enterprises listed on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange, went up 32 points to 1,143, the highest
since it was launched by the HSI Services Limited in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The turnover in recent days was also on a high level, at 14.921
billion HK dollars (1.925 billion U.S. dollars) on Monday, 15.404
billion HK dollars (1.987 billion U.S. dollars) on Tuesday, and
14.763 billion HK dollars (1.904 billion U.S. dollars) today, much
higher than the average daily turnover of 9.102 million HK
dollars (1.174 million U.S. dollars) in April.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Review Administrative Control Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislators today
reviewed drafts of a law on supervision and a law on blood donations
at the 25th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The legislators agreed that the draft of the supervision law is
concrete and will play an important role in guaranteeing the
implementation of administrative policies and help build cleaner
government, and said that the law should be adopted.
</P>
<P>
They gave some advice on how to further improve the law,
pointing out that case study and court costs should be borne by
the state instead of by units being examined. Some suggested that
top state officials should also be subject to supervision at the
State Council level.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also reviewed a draft of a blood donation law
and made suggestions for possible amendments.
</P>
<P>
Qin Zhongda, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that
in past discussions there were differences among committee members
about whether a voluntary or an obligatory blood donation system
should be adopted, and said that personally he prefers "the latter
to the former, and that the law should provide regulations to give
the donor some monetary assistance and time off for rest."
</P>
<P>
Other top legislators also shared their comments on this law,
discussing suitable penalties for illegal blood trade, examining
blood quality, and how to use the donated blood.

<HEADLINE> UNICOM Appoints Agents for New Pager Service in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China United Telecom Corporation
(UNICOM), the second largest state-owned carrier in China, marked
the inclusion of Hong Kong in its nationwide paging network today
by appointing Hutchison Telecom Corporation (HK) Limited and Asia
Paging Company Limited to launch the service in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Li Huifen, president of the UNICOM, told a news briefing here
this afternoon that "we take our service as a treasurable gift to
the people of Hong Kong" at a moment when Hong Kong is soon to
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It makes communications between China's inland areas and Hong
Kong easier, faster and closer," Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The UNICOM, initiated by the Ministries of Electronic Industry,
 of Electronic Power and of Railways, was officially set up with
the approval of the State Council in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The UNICOM's paging network uses satellite technology to give
an extensive coverage, according to Hong Ming, general manager of
the corporation. He told reporters that only one access code --
191 for operator-assisted service and 192 for automatic paging
service -- is used throughout the network.
</P>
<P>
Apart from paging, the UNICOM is building a mobile telephone
network in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the UNICOM has already started the
construction of its GSM network in 74 cities and finished such
construction in 33 cities, Li said, adding that the UNICOM's
paging network has, since September 1996, linked up 10 major
cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and
netted nearly 200,000 subscribes.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that the paging network will extend to 100
cities with 700,000 customers by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Program in Zimbabwe to Focus on Aids, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said today its major priorities for future programs in
Zimbabwe's health sector will emphasise on Aids and malaria, which
are killing hundreds of thousands of people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The malaria death toll of 949 since the beginning of the year is
the highest in many years due to above average rains in the country
while Aids continues to kill people at an estimated rate
of 500 a week.
</P>
<P>
In a report released at a meeting to review its program of
cooperation with the Zimbabwe government between 1995 and the year
2000, UNICEF said other major priorities would be to reach high risk
groups in farming areas and religious groups that resisted modern
medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, it cited major constraints as the declining government
health funding, high staff turnover, particularly at provincial
level, low staff morale and impact of Hiv/Aids and uncertainty
regarding implementation of health reforms.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that due to current social and economic changes
in the country, women and children were facing more difficulties than
before.
</P>
<P>
The review meeting is held to assist the government and UNICEF
to improve their policies and programs benefiting children.

<HEADLINE> French Court Rejects British Airways Request on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A French court today rejected a
request by British Airways for a suspension of authorization
allowing Air Algerie to use a terminal of the Roissy-Charles de
Gaulle airport in Paris, where the British air company's check-in
desk is located.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Tribunal of Melun, southeast of Paris, said
that British Airways has failed to present evidence that it would
"irreversibly" suffer from serious consequences from a decision by
the Paris air traffic authority, the Aeroports de Paris, to place
Air Algerie in the same terminal.
</P>
<P>
Citing security concerns, British Airways has been refusing to
serve its customers at the same time when Air Algerie is serving
it since the Algerian air company resumed its flights from Algiers
to Paris on April 25, as the two companies share one baggage
conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
French authorities said they had taken enough security measures
to prevent terrorists from staging attacks, and that the check-in
desk of Air Algerie is closely watched by police.
</P>
<P>
The land used by the terminal in dispute belongs to the Commune
(township) of Mauregard, which is under the judicial
administration of Melun, a city southeast of Paris.

</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who arrived here for a brief visit, made the

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies US Press Report on Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel strongly denied today a
Washington Post report that the United States is investigating
whether Israeli spies have obtained highly classified materials
from U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S. secret service Federal
Bureau of Investigation was investigating whether Israeli agents
were spying on the U.S. through a senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
It said Israeli Ambassador to Washington Eliyahu Ben-Elissar
once asked Israeli agents to approach the code-named
U.S. official to get a copy of the secret letter of assurance
attached to the Hebron agreement sent by former U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher to Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Israeli Prime Minister's Office
denounced it as "absolutely baseless." David Bar-Illan, senior
adviser to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, said some
U.S. agencies that are not friendly to Israel were trying to
make the Jewish state "look bad."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy said Israeli diplomats around the
world had been given clear instructions and were never involved
in such activities. He expressed the hope that this dispute
would be over soon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Ben-Elissar categorically
denied the report as "false and baseless." "The whole story is
baseless, absolutely untrue," he said, adding it might be
released by some evil-intentioned people who tried to besmirch
and discredit Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is not involved in any covered intelligence
operations dealing with the U.S. classified materials, because
this would be against all rules of Israel's successive
governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report was published just ahead of the visit by
U.S. Mideast special peace envoy Dennis Ross, who is to arrive
here later today on another mediation mission to break the
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli analysts believed that the report was a move taken by
the U.S. to show its impartiality in its mediation, because
Arafat and other PNA officials have been accusing the U.S. of
leaning toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
This is not the only spy scandal between Israel and the
U.S. despite of their close alliance. Former Israeli spy Jonathan
Pollard is now serving life sentence in a U.S. prison, and the
U.S. government has so far refused to release him despite
Israel's repeated appeals.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Pizano said here today that in the coming weeks,
his country and Israel will start cooperation in the war against
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following his meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the president said that
Colombia and Israel will also set up joint technology research
centers.
</P>
<P>
However, the Colombian president refused to answer a question
on whether there were Israelis involved in the drug business in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Samper Pizano, who also serves as chairman of the Non-Aligned
Nations, arrived in Israel Monday and held a series of meetings
Tuesday with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president's visit to Israel is reportedly
arousing displeasure in the United States, which suspected him
of being linked to drug trafficking, and has forbidden his
entry.
</P>
<P>
Samper Pizano is suspected by the Clinton Administration of
having ties with drug barons, and Colombia's attorney-general
has accused him of financing his election campaign with funds
from drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. has not made any official statement to Israel
concerning the Colombian president's visit, Israel Radio reported
that last week a representative of the U.S. Embassy presented the
Israeli Foreign Ministry with a list of crimes Samper Pizano is
suspected of.
</P>
<P>
Every year since 1986, Colombia has been cited by the U.S.
State Department as a country involved in drug producing and
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Cannot Act Against Illegal Fishers, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government has no
authority to act against Namibian vessels found fishing illegally in
South African waters, a top official said in Windhoek today.
</P>
<P>
Shihaleni Ndjaba, Namibia's Acting Permanent Secretary for
Fisheries said that his ministry was aware some of the country's
vessels had been spotted in South African waters, but for the time
being no action could be taken against them.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the fact that current laws on sea fisheries did not
provide for punitive measures against such offenders, Southern
African Broadcasting Association quoted Ndjaba as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the Namibian official noted that new legislation was being
prepared under which Namibian vessels spotted in other countries'
territorial water would be fined or impounded. enditem

meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this morning in the
archeological city of Luxor, about 520 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel, who arrived here Tuesday, said Germany
tried to take a balanced approach to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We have good relations with Israel, but on the other hand we
have good and balanced relations with all Arab countries," he
said, adding that Germany is committed to support Israel when
security is concerned.
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed the necessity of a European participation in
jolting the ailing Mideast peace process from several weeks of
crisis following Israeli construction of a new Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Kinkel-Mubarak meeting also covered the Euro-Egyptian
partnership, bilateral ties, inter-Mediterranean relations and the
visit due to be paid by Mubarak to Germany later this month,
said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa who also attended the
two-hour talks.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries generally favor a European participation in the
Mideast peace process to balance the role of the U.S., a key
mediator in the region.

<HEADLINE> IUCN to Stay Off Debate on Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Conservation Union (IUCN) will
not intervene in the lobby by some African governments for lifting of
a ban in international trade in elephant products.
</P>
<P>
IUCN President Yolanda Kakabadse, who arrived in Zimbabwe
yesterday for a four-day visit, said here today that the union
would not take sides on issues involving
the down-listing of the elephant for fear of losing credibility as an
organisation whose members had different interests.
</P>
<P>
She said the IUCN, which has both governments and private sector
representatives as members, would only be able to supply concerned
African governments with technical information to enable them to make
decisions that would have interests of their people at heart.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''African elephant range states are the ones that will
have to face this situation, so we would only provide them with
technical information regarding the whole issue to enable them to
make wise decisions.''
</P>
<P>
''They will have to make sure that they take decisions on the
elephant issue after taking into consideration the available
technical information provided to them, but IUCN will not take any
pivotal role in this, even at the June cites meeting in Zimbabwe,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe in June will host a meeting of parties to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (COTES) with most southern
African countries expected to use the platform to lobby for the
down-listing of the elephant from appendix one to appendix two, which
allows controlled international trade.

<HEADLINE> Direct Shipping Across Taiwan Strait To Help Fujian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The newly-opened direct cargo linking
between two ports in southeast China's Fujian province and a port
in Taiwan province is certain to bring new opportunities to
Fujian's economy, according to government officials and scholars
in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the shipping link will serve not only
to boost cross-straits trade and help reduce costs and time in
transit, but will also be conducive to the overall economic
development of Fujian as well as neighbouring regions of Zhejiang,
Jiangxi, and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen are 165 and 240 nautical
miles respectively from Kaohsiung port in Taiwan. But that route
was closed for nearly half a century and, in fact, it was only in
the 1970s that transshipment through countries like Japan and the
Republic of Korea was available. But even that was a waste of time
and money.
</P>
<P>
With the rapidly increasing trade across Taiwan straits in
recent years, this wasted time and money became increasingly
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
"The experiment in direct shipping provided us with the
historical chance to increase cross-straits ties and to reach
common prosperity," according to Zhang Jiakun, vice governor of
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, in fact, has attached great importance to its economic
exchanges with Taiwan ever since the opening up and reforms
began.

<HEADLINE> Interview: SAARC's Top Priority: Poverty Eradication, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, Maldives, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Poverty eradication and
economic cooperation are the top priority of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), says Naeem Hasan,
the grouping's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
"There are two or three areas of major concern to SAARC in our
cooperation, one is the poverty eradication," Hasan told Xinhua in
an exclusive interview at the Bandos Island Resort near Male,
prior to the SAARC summit scheduled for May 12-14 in the Maldivian
capital.
</P>
<P>
There are almost 400 million people living below the poverty
line in the SAARC member countries which have a combined
population of one billion, Hasan said. "So we are making efforts
by each government, regionally and collectively to remove poverty
from our region."
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985 to promote regional cooperation
in economic, social, cultural and technological fields, groups
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the
Maldives.
</P>
<P>
"As the earlier (SAARC) summits had decided, we should do so by
the year 2002. We have five years left to meet this target, so we
are going to looking into the progress that has been made in this
very important area of our cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
At their last summit in New Delhi two years ago, the SAARC
leaders established a mechanism in the field of poverty
eradication, and two rounds of meetings had been held since then
and a number of recommendations and concrete ideas on exchanging
information in this field had been made, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the coming summit, decisions will be made on these
recommendations. "As part of our poverty eradication program, we
will also emphasize issues relating to women and children, because
we would like women to contribute equally to the development of
South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to many reasons, historical and cultural, the place of the
women is not what it should have been. That is why in our agenda,
the issues of women and children, education, health, medicine and
sanitation are very much emphasized," he said.
</P>
<P>
These issues, including the problem of malnutrition and the
high level of child mortality in South Asian countries, are going
to be discussed at the Male summit.
</P>
<P>
When asked if there are other obstacles standing in the way of
economic development in the region, Hasan insisted that the major
problem is poverty and the lack of resources. "The sheer size of
population in SAARC and the kind of conditions they live in is the
major challenge."
</P>
<P>
Besides poverty eradication and social issues, another major
area for regional cooperation in the last two years has been
economic and trade cooperation, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, SAARC put into effect SAPTA, the South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangement, pledging to create a free trade
zone -- the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) -- by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is ultimately to realize SAFTA hopefully by the
year 2000, but not later than 2005. Naturally, this summit will be
given a full report on what we have been doing in the economic and
trade fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations have been completed under
SAPTA and the member countries are now exchanging tariff
concessions on over 2,000 products. "Now we are preparing for the
third round of trade negotiations and we hope the summit will give
its approval to the talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also set up another important group which is going to
look into what are the steps required to move from SAPTA to SAFTA.
All the economic issues are being submitted to the summit through
the Committee on Economic Cooperation, which meets annually,"
Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
As a related effort, SAARC commerce ministers have met since
the New Delhi summit and the first SAARC trade fair was also held
in the Indian capital. The second commerce ministers' meeting and
the second trade fair will be held later this year in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to cooperation at the official level among the
SAARC countries, the private sector has also been involved, Hasan
said. "The idea is that in our economic cooperation, it is a
double effort. There will be government cooperation side by side
with the private sector cooperation, because in almost all
countries of SAARC, the trend is towards liberalization, the
market economy and deregulation."
</P>
<P>
There will be a comprehensive report before the summit on
economic and trade issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC also has close cooperation with other international and
regional organizations, including United Nations agencies and the
European Union, and a number of cooperation agreements have been
signed with them, Hasan said. This trend has been increased in the
last two years, he said, adding that the SAARC countries are also
coordinating their positions on major global economic and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very broad program of cooperation as we have 11
technical committees which deal with cooperation in the areas of
agriculture, science and technology, rural development, women
development and tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked what achievements could be made at the Male summit,
Hasan said, "Well, let the summit comment." But he quickly added
that all previous SAARC summits had come up with important
declarations and that he was confident the coming summit will
chart a new direction for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The trend in SAARC now is for a more action-oriented program.
In the first 10 years of SAARC's existence, we were talking in
general terms and now we are going into specific areas, specific
activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that intra-SAARC trade has been small -- about
three percent of their trade with the rest of the world. He
expected the percentage to grow to about 15 in three or four
years' time when the number of items for tariff concessions is
greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his views on recent signs of improved relations
between India and Pakistan, Hasan said they were a welcome
development.
</P>
<P>
"As secretary general, I do not follow the political and
bilateral developments between the member countries. But I can
certainly make a general comment that all these are very welcome
developments because the more there is peace, the more there is
stability in the region and the better bilateral relations.
Obviously it is going to have a very encouraging and soothing
effect on the development of SAARC," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are encouraging signs that will certainly help SAARC
also to develop faster and have increased peace and economic
cooperation and other cooperation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls Spanish King's Visit Landmark Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
hailed the just-concluded state visit to Russia by King Juan
Carlos I of Spain as an important step in the development of
Russian-Spanish relations.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
reporters today that during the visit the two heads of state
exchanged views on key aspects of bilateral relations and topical
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed that the treaty of friendship and
cooperation signed in 1994 allowed their nations to reach a high
level of political dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin and Juan Carlos I noted that trade and
economic relations between the two countries have a considerable
untapped potential.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover between Russia and Spain, which has
progressed successfully in recent years, amounted to nearly 1,870
million US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Russia mainly exported to Spain oil, petroleum products,
ferrous and nonferrous metal while importing from Spain meats,
vegetables, fruits and edible oil.
</P>
<P>
One of the main aims of the Spanish king's visit was to promote
investment and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have decided to sign an agreement on mutual
protection of investments, avoidance of double taxation and
cooperation in the judicial and legal sphere, during the official
visit of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin to Spain, due to take
place later this year.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Pump 2 Billion Dollars in Petrochemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is
planning to pump some 2 billion U.S. dollars into its
pretrochemical sector as part of the efforts to diversify its
oil-dominated economy.
</P>
<P>
Related projects will be commissioned before 1999 and based in
Abu Dhabi Emirate, one of the seven sheikdoms of the UAE,
according to a study report by the state-owned General Industry
Corp (GIC) published today on the Arabic-language daily Al-Khaleej.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a 15-year industrialisation drive involving
the total investment of around 2.4 billion dollars in chemicals
and other non-oil sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Abu Dhabi will spend about 8.7 billion dirhams (some 2.4
billion dollars) on 40 industrial projects expected to go on
stream by year 2009 and new petrochemical plants expected to be
completed by 1999 will account for some three quarters of the
total," said the GIC study.
</P>
<P>
Two of the related projects were approved earlier this year by
the state's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC). They will turn the
Gulf country into one of the top chemical producers in the Middle
East region.
</P>
<P>
One plant will produce 540,000 tons of ethylene di-chloride
and 420,000 tons of caustic soda per year. The complex in the
industrial area of Ruwais in Abu Dhabi will be owned by the Abu
Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).
</P>
<P>
The other project, jointly owned by ADNOC and Borealis, a
Finnish-Norwegian venture, will have an annual output capacity of
450,000 tonnes of polyethylene and 600,000 tonnes of
ethylene. The Abu Dhabi-based ethylene complex will be expanded
later to 750,000 tonnes per year.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is among the top seven oil producers in the world and
its proven crude oil reserves constitute about 10 percent of the
total global oil wealth which stands at nearly one trillion
barrels.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Urges Iraq to Implement Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations could never be
convinced before Iraq clears obstacles in implementing the UN
decision on dismantling weapons of mass destruction, a senior UN
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The UN Special Commission on Dismantling Weapons of Mass
Destruction of Iraq (UNSCOM) is facing difficulties in supervising
and implementing the decision made by the UN security council
after the 1991 Gulf war, Charles Duelfer, vice chairman of the
UNSCOM told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We (the UNSCOM) could never tell the UN security council
that Iraq is carrying out the council's decision on (destroying)
weapons of mass destruction unless these problems are settled,"
the UN official said before his departure for Bahrain after a
two-day visit to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the 1991 Gulf War along with
an UN economic sanction against Iraq and it provides that Iraq
must destroy all of the weapons of mass destruction and biological
and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, during the implementation of the decision, information
provided by Iraqi officials on biological weapons are not
"enough" and always "uncorrect" and in addition, the UN has
been informed that Iraqis are hidding tonnes of chemical materials
which are banned by the UN decision, the UN official said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that investigations on the number of missiles
in the Iraqis' hands could not be finished until now.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused the UN investigation officials to
enter places suspected of storing weapons of mass destruction
claiming that the entry would violate the sovereignty of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said that despite the difficulties, the UNSCOM will
continue its work of the supervision and implementation of the
decision. He also said that the recent change of the UNSCOM
chairmanship will not influence the work.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the Australian ambassador to the UN
was appointed on May 1 the new UNSCOM chairman to replaced
Rolf Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
"The change will not affect the continuation of our work
because the work is based on analyzing information and facts,
it was not a political work which will change with the
change of the chairmanship," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN official arrived here on Tuesday to brief the UAE
officials the latest developments of the implementation of the
UN decision. He denied that his tour is aimed at seeking
fund for the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNSCOM is receiving money from the
oil-for-food deal which was signed by the UN and Iraq in May,
1996 and came into effect at the end of last year. The agreement
provides that Iraq was allowed to sell 2 billion dollars of oil
every six months. Most of the income will be used for purchasing
food and medicines to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people
while the rest will be used to pay the UN and Kuwait which was
occupied by Iraq during the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Before the deal reached, some of the Gulf countries
subsidized the UNSCOM for the implementation of the UN decision
on dismantling weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM need to spend some one million dollars every
month, the UN officials said.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Admits Paying Pensions to Ex-SS War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bonn government today admitted that
Germany has been paying pensions to ex-SS war criminals and
stressed that about 60 billion U.S. dollars had been paid in
compensation for Nazi war crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to Friedrich Bohl, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of
staff, German law allows pensions to be paid to Waffen SS members
who had been injured in combat, however excluding SS-Death's Head
members, who could only receive pensions as "war-damaged
civilians."
</P>
<P>
"Some regulations regarding rights of German war victims are
very difficult to understand for survivors of the Holocaust," he
said, adding that the relevant law was set in early years of West
Germany and based on the view then accepted by all democratic
parties, that social security and criminal affairs issues should
be kept apart.
</P>
<P>
Bohl said this in a statement in response to criticism by the
American Jewish Committee (AJC), which is running an advertisement
in the New York Times, that Germany refuses to compensate between
15,000 and 20,000 Nazi victims in Eastern Europe while paying
pensions to SS members.
</P>
<P>
SS-Death's Head units were concentration guards and the nucleus
of the crack SS-Death's Head Tank Division. The postwar Nuremberg
Trials declared the SS guilty of organizing and carrying out the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Bohl stressed in the statement that the 240,000-head Waffen SS
consisted of not only volunteers but also large numbers of
conscripted Germans and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kohl's government and parliament would now be
searching ways to bar war criminals from receiving pensions.
</P>
<P>
Regarding AJC calls for more direct compensation to East
European Nazi victims, the statement noted that under a 1996
accord with the Jewish Claims Conference, no further financial
demands were to be lodged with the German government until 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bohl stressed that since the founding of West Germany in 1949,
Bonn has spent almost 100 billion marks (58 billion U.S. dollars)
in compensation for Nazi war crimes. In addition, an extra 3
billion marks has been made available to East European countries
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that much of the money will be spent in running
hospitals and nursing homes, not as direct compensation to Nazi
victims in Eastern Europe, which in many cases amount to a single
payment of 130 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that Bonn refuses to pay individual pensions
to Nazi victims in East European countries for fear of setting a
costly precedent that would add further burden to the government
budget.

BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today that London wished to start a new era of
cooperative relations between the leading members of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to draw a line under the sterile and negative
confrontation of the past," said Cook at a news conference after
talks with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It was the first foreign visit by Cook since he took office
last week. Before coming to Bonn, Cook had also paid a visit to
Paris.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Bonn that his visit to Paris and Bonn
itself was a signal that Britain wanted to show that it was taking
Europe seriously and wished to be taken seriously within Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It's our intention that Britain should from now on be one of
those leading members of Europe, not a country on the sideline,
seeking to be obstructive to the direction of Europe. We want to
be helping to shape the direction of Europe," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bumper Harvest of Cotton Predicted for Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A bumper harvest of 46,000
tons of cotton is predicted this year for Swaziland's cotton
farming industry for the first time in seven years, the South
African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest will be the highest yield since 1990 when a
long-lasting drought, which only ended last season, first gripped
the small land-locked mountain kingdom, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to Chief Executive of Swaziland Cotton Board Tom
Jele, the cotton farming industry only produced 14,000 tons of
cotton last year as it started to recover from the drought.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the second largest cotton producer in the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) after South Africa. The
total cotton crop of the SACU countries, also include Lesotho and
Botswana, is expected to be 190,000 bales of lint.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers who abandoned growing the crop during the
drought are reportedly returning to cotton cultivation throughout
the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General Praises China's Role in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, on the second day of his first official visit to
China, held a press conference here today, highly praising China's
rapid development and its major role in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Today, China is playing a major role in the United Nations and
has a major voice in the world. Its leadership and presence are
felt within the organization," Annan told those present at the
press conference, and that he is happy to be able to make this
trip to China so early in his term of office.
</P>
<P>
"I have had very useful talks with Chinese leaders already," he
said. Annan held talks with Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and met with President Jiang Zemin earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to continuing to have such talks with
Chinese leaders until the end of this visit," he said, explaining
that through these talks, he feels encouraged that China supports
the reform of the UN.
</P>
<P>
"With the full participation of all member countries, I'm sure
we will succeed in bringing effective and realistic reform to this
organization to which we are committed," he said.
</P>
<P>
His talks with the Chinese leaders involved a wide range of
issues, including UN reforms, disarmament, the return of Hong
Kong, and economic and social development. About the Hong Kong
issue, he said that time will prove that the concerns expressed by
people outside Hong Kong and China's inland areas have been
"misplaced."
</P>
<P>
He praised China's economic, cultural and technological
development as an example and something that is viewed with great
interest by the entire developing world.
</P>
<P>
"China has proved that it is possible for a developing country
to improve its situation in a relatively short period of time," he
said, and that, "The energy and enterprise of your people are
widely admired. I want to see something of this vast and
fascinating country."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on human rights, he said that all
governments, whether in the north or the south, will have to
decide on their own how to organize society to achieve their human
rights objectives, and that, "This is the essential part of the
world today."
</P>
<P>
Annan will leave Beijing for Xi'an and Shanghai Friday.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Launches Toughest Attack on Hanson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard mounted his fiercest attack tonight on anti-Asian
immigration MP Pauline Hanson, accusing her of "empty populism,
cheap sloganeering and bitter and divisive recriminations."
</P>
<P>
Howard branded as "wrong" Pauline Hanson's attacks on Asian
immigration and Aboriginal funding and said the Hanson cure to
Australia's problems would be "worse than the disease".
</P>
<P>
He told a private sector group aiming to build links with Asia
in Sydney that Hanson is wrong when she says that Australia is in
danger of being swamped by Asians and claims that Australia is
headed for a civil war.
</P>
<P>
Australia's links with Asia would be vital to the nation's
political and economic future, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Howard's address came within days of polls showing the
government at a two-year low, with Hanson's fledgling One Nation
party picking up disaffected coalition voters.
</P>
<P>
The government attack on Hanson has been stepped up not because
of the polls but because she has started her own party, the prime
minister was quoted by the Australian Association Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hanson's political campaign sought to exploit
fear and instability without offering solutions or hope.
</P>
<P>
Other senior cabinet members, including Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer also publicly
condemned Hanson last week, accusing her of crippling the nation
in its attempts to engage in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In an address to Australian diplomats to some Asian countries,
Downer said the government would fight and destroy Hanson's ideas,
which were based on fear and ignorance.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Opposes Setting Up North European Defense Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has reaffirmed its
opposition to setting up a defense alliance to provide security
for the three former Soviet republics in the Baltic region, which
are unlikely to get NATO membership in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Defense Minister Bjoern Von Sydow told reporters on
Tuesday that if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
refuses to accept Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, three tiny former
Soviet republics in the Baltic region, Sweden has no reason to
shoulder bigger responsibility for security in the region.
</P>
<P>
His remarks showed that Sweden again refused to accept the idea
of establishing a North European Defense Alliance or the so-called
Baltic Security Zone as proposed by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Sydow said that every country has its right to seek its own
security policy. Sweden will continue to pursue its policy of
non-alignment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is interested in cooperating with NATO, but it must
first take into consideration the result of negotiations between
NATO and the countries applying to join the alliance and the
result of negotiations between NATO and Russia, which has long
been opposed to NATO's eastward expansion, Sydow said.
</P>
<P>
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania applied for NATO membership after
the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. But their
applications were strongly opposed by Russia, which said it must
not let the alliance to expand to its border.
</P>
<P>
Given Russia's strong opposition, the United States and other
Western nations were not enthusiastic about the applications of
the three countries.
</P>
<P>
However, some U.S. and British politicians proposed that the
so-called Baltic Security Zone comprising Sweden, Finland,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania be set up to prevent the three
countries from falling into the hand of Russia again.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal met with immediate opposition from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson has said that Sweden
likes to cooperate with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in any field
except the military one.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has said that the European Union (EU) should accept the
three countries and then the EU, through NATO, can help them
in security affairs.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM to Meet Albright in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister, Ioannis
Kasoulides will meet with his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine
Albright in Washington on June 6, to discuss the Cyprus
problem and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency today, this was announced
by Kasoulides on his return from Athens Wednesday night, where
he had a meeting with Director for Southern European Affairs
at the U.S. State Department, Carey Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
Describing the timing of the meeting with Albright as
"important", Kasoulides said it coincides with the on-going
U.N.-led proximity talks between President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel is
conducting proximity talks through bi-weekly separate meetings
with Clerides and Denktash in a bid to prepare the ground
for face-to-face talks on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.N. Chief Kofi Annan will
invite the two communities' leaders to a direct negotiation by
the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said the U.S. official in the meeting expressed his
country's satisfaction with the Cyprus government decision to
suspend overflights of Greek military aircraft during a Greek
military exercise code-named "Toxotis", now under way.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh also welcomed steps taken by both sides in Cyprus
aimed to create the suitable climate for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official expressed his government's determination to
be actively involved in efforts toward a Cyprus settlement to
the benefit of stability and security in this part of the
Easter Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of an Athens-supported coup.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Supports China's Integration With World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Flemming Larsen, an official with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said in Shanghai today
that the belief of some developed countries that the economic
prosperity of China and other developing countries has been
achieved by large amount of exports and the loss of job
opportunities in developed countries is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
At an IMF meeting last week in Washington, a consensus was
reached that the real reason for the decline in the need for labor
in developed countries, especially European countries, is the
improved technology. Technological improvements, which make
industry more advanced and complex, have increased the demand for
skilled workers and in turn increased their salaries. Unskilled
workers, however, have fewer job opportunities and lower salaries,
Larsen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion has been backed up by economic theory and
statistics, he said. Therefore, developed countries should not
make trade tariffs for developing countries and should let them
have their due market share.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reforms so far have been successful, and the
rapid development of China's economy is encouraging, but the
country is facing two major challenges from inflation and the
reform of state-owned enterprises. Whether or not China will be
able to resolve the two problems resolutely and effectively has a
bearing on its long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China should accelerate the process of integration
with the world economy, he said, and that this not only includes
trade, but also direct and indirect investment, and extensive
cooperation in technology, information and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Larsen is heading an IMF delegation that arrived in Shanghai on
May 5. It has held talks with economic and financial experts.

<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China faces heavy unemployment
pressures and the situation will last for some time, Chinese
Vice-Minister of Labor Lin Yongsan said at a news conference
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 5.53 million registered
jobless persons, with unemployment standing at three
percent. Meanwhile, over 22 million employees in urban areas and
130 million in rural areas are regarded as surplus labor,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic development in China can still not guarantee
adequate job opportunities for local labor, but the government is
making every effort to tackle the problem by developing labor
markets and standardizing job-agencies, Lin said.

<HEADLINE> China Describes Desertification Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China today made public the results
of its first survey on desertification, showing that 17.6 percent
of its total land area is deserts or desertified land.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, Vice-Minister of Forestry, said at a press
conference that, over the past twenty years, the desertification
process spread at a speed of 2,460 sq km per year, and that, based
on the definition of a UN convention, the area of desertified land
in China will be 2.62 million sq km, 27.3 percent of the country's
total land area.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, most land suffering from
desertification is located in the "three north" region, meaning
the north, northwest, and northeast China. "As much as 80 percent
of the land in this region is currently suffering from
desertification," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that combating desertification has become an urgent
task, since the estimated economic loss from it reaches 54 billion
yuan (some 6.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country-wide survey on desertification, the first of its
kind in China, started in 1994, and involved nearly 10,000
technicians.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the results of the survey, which are
believed to be reliable, have officially been accepted by the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most critical environmental problems on earth,
one that expands at a speed of five to seven sq km per year
worldwide, desertification is believed to affect a third of the
earth's land area and a fifth of its population. The total yearly
economic loss from desertification is estimated at 42 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Urges Greater Egyptian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Colombian President Ernesto
Samper today called upon Egypt to play a more active role in
restoring trust between Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"Trust is still missing between the two parties... I asked
President Hosni Mubarak to lend more help to the peace process,"
said Samper after a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart in the
the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, some 220 kilometers
southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Samper, who is on a region tour, has held talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was received by President Mubarak in spite of a U.S. charge
that the Colombian leader had taken billions of dollars from the
Cali cartel, which is notorious for its drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"Despite existing differences, we understand the importance
of returning to the negotiating table and finding a solution to
this problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
Samper, current chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement(NAM), said
NAM's role in the Mideast peace process is to link member nations
and non-member nations to the process.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president said that he believed talks would be
resumed with the help of the international community, the spirit
of UN resolutions and the desire of both parties to reactivate the
process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the
NAM could play a role in the Mideast by "supporting the peace
process and land-for-peace principle and rejecting the settlement
policy."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been disrupted since
Israel decided to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem on March 18.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross has started another round of
shuttle visits between Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip today, in an
effort to restart the stalled Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Fuji to Make Film in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Fuji Photo Film Co. will begin
manufacturing film in the U.S. for the first time, making the
competition between the Japanese company and its rival Eastman
Kodak Co. more tense.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that Fuji will spend 200
million U.S. dollars on a facility to make film in Greenwood,
S.C., and to boost its existing papermaking capacity there. This
will bring its total investment there to about 1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fuji's ability to produce both film and paper in the U.S. will
make the company more aggressive in pricing and accelerate its
ability to fill U.S. orders, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Fuji first began manufacturing in the U.S. nine years ago. At
that time, it was only making printing plates for the graphic arts
industry. But since then it has invested heavily to accommodate
the production of photographic paper, single-use cameras and
videotape, among other products.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Fuji has imported all film sold in the U.S. from the
Netherlands and Japan, paying 3.7 percent tariffs. While it will
now rid itself of shipping and import costs, the company will also
forgo and benefit from foreign-currency fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Fuji's expansion comes as Fuji and Kodak fight a trade case
before the World Trade Organization, which is hearing Washington's
argument that barriers keep Kodak from the Japanese market. By
making film in the U.S., Fuji won't have to worry about tariffs or
possible repercussions in the U.S. from the WTO case, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> HK Banks Urged to Learn from Better Credit Risk Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's banks should maintain
their competitive advantage by practicing better risk management,
said a senior financial expert from the international professional
services firm Arthur Andersen.
</P>
<P>
Andy Cheung, senior manager of Arthur Andersen, a business unit
of the global multi-disciplinary professional services provider
Andersen Worldwide, told a press conference this afternoon that
"banks in Hong Kong are nowhere near crisis, remaining very sound
and well-capitalized."
</P>
<P>
But "it would be prudent and in the banks' interests to learn
from overseas experience and international best practice in credit
risk management, to maintain their competitive advantage," Cheung
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 26 of Hong Kong's largest locally
incorporated banks recorded charges for loan losses totaling 3.9
billion HK dollars (500 million U.S. dollars) in 1996, more than
double the total of 1.9 billion HK dollars (over 243 million
U.S. dollars) recorded in 1995 and nearly 3.5 times higher than
the 1.1 billion HK dollars (141 million U.S. dollars) recorded in
1994.
</P>
<P>
"This may sound alarming," Cheung said, noting that the Hong
Kong-based banks compare "very favorably" to banks in other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
He cited his firm's study as showing that banks in Hong Kong
incurred loan losses which amounted to 7.2 percent of profit
before tax in 1996, while British banks incurred 20.5 percent and
the largest banks in the United States recorded 20.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks in Hong Kong have low bad debt charges compared to many
banks in other countries, Cheung went on to say. "However, this
does not necessarily indicate that our bankers are better or worse
at managing credit risk, as they have traditionally been favored
by a healthy and growing economy, high savings rates, lucrative
interest margins and a strong property market," he added.

the nomination filing process for the local polls at many western
hilly villages.
</P>
<P>
Would-be candidates had failed to file their candidacy at over
40 villages in West Nepal due to death threats from a leftist
guerrilla movement in a boycott campaign, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The candidates who filed their nominations earlier at other
villages were reportedly withdrawing from the elections, scheduled
for May 17, as the radical guerrillas strengthened their threats
by killing a candidate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NC delegation, led by party secretary Taranath Ranabhat,
also urged the government to protect the life and property of
those who want to contest in the elections and ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
The NC party currently controls most of the country's over
4,000 local administration bodies at village, municipality and
district levels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With UN Secretary-General (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, meeting
with the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan here today,
said that actions that depreciate, weaken, or try to bypass the
role of the UN will not work and that many global issues can not
be settled without international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
As the world marches towards multi-polarization, Zhu said, it
needs a powerful UN and, the success of the UN depends on the
active co-operation and support of its member countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that great changes have taken place in the world
situation since the end of the cold war, providing opportunities
and tougher challenges for the UN. Any reform move of the UN
should reflect the changes and meet the demands of the time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that there has been sound co-operation between China
and the UN and that he hopes the Secretary-General's visit will
increase that co-operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that, in the present complicated and ever-changing
situation, the role played by the UN Secretary-General is unique,
and spoke highly of Annan's ability and rich diplomatic
experience. He said he believes the UN will gain more vigor
under Annan's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he is glad to have the chance to visit China and to
gain a better understanding of China's great achievements with
his own eyes.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the UN, which faces a heavy task of reform, is
working on deciding its responsibilities for the next twenty
years. The UN appreciates China's support and contributions in the
past and expects it to have a more active role in UN affairs in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Looks to Be Ready for French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- World women's top-ranked Martina
Hingis of switzerland says she expects to be fit for the French
Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Swiss star injured her knee falling off a horse
last month and has been forced to pull out of three tournaments
since suffering the injury on April 21.
</P>
<P>
Hingis told the French sports daily L'Equipe that she was
optimistic about making her return at the French Open starting May
26.
</P>
<P>
Hingis pulled out of last week's Rexona Cup in Hamburg, this
week's Italian Open and next week's German Open in Berlin. She
would enter the French Open without any tournament matches on clay
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Prior to her injury, Hingis had won six titles this year,
including the Australian Open. She earned more than 1.2 million
U.S. dollars this year and became the youngest No. 1 player in
history.

<HEADLINE> Moldova, Trans-Dnestr Sign Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Moldova and the
breakaway Trans-Dnestr region today signed a memorandum in the
Kremlin for the normalization of relations between them.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to develop relations "within the framework
of a common state, and within the borders of the former Soviet
republic of Moldova dating from January 1990," an Itar-Tass news
agency report said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed by Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi, Trans-Dnestr leader Igor Smirnov and three guarantors
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma and Niels Helveg Petersen, acting chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Trans-Dnestr is a sliver of land in eastern Moldova dominated
by the Russian-speaking population. But two-thirds of the
Moldovian population are ethnic Romanians. The nation was part of
Romania before World War II.
</P>
<P>
The fear of Moldova's reunification with Romania drove
Trans-Dnestr separatists to unilaterally declare independence in
1992, triggering an eight-month civil war against Moldovan
government forces.
</P>
<P>
The war, which left about 700 dead, ended when the 14th Russian
army based in Trans-Dnestr intervened. So far, some 6,500 Russian
troops are still stationed in Trans-Dnestr.
</P>
<P>
At today's signing ceremony, Lucinschi said, "we will think
that we have turned over a fresh page in history and are beginning
a negotiation process on how to normalize the situation."
</P>
<P>
Smirnov called the signing of the document "historic," saying
that both he and the Moldovan leaders want to work "to create, not
to destroy."
</P>
<P>
Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE also hailed the agreement as a
"move to strengthen the atmosphere of mutual trust, stability and
security throughout the region."

<HEADLINE> Rebels Surrender in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels surrendered today to the Philippine
Armed Forces Southern Command in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The group, including one commander and his 12 followers,
yielded some high-powered weapons, including two grenade
launchers, and other ammunition to the military, according to
Southern Command Information Officer Capt. Salih Indanan.
</P>
<P>
These rebels had been operating in Maluso town in Basilan
island.
</P>
<P>
Indanan said they will be processed and provided with
assistance under the National Unification and Development Program
(NUDP) of the government.
</P>
<P>
They will also receive cash for the guns they surrendered so as
to make a living while waiting for financial assistance for
livelihood projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Indanan, several groups of MILF rebels have
surrendered to the government forces during the past months due to
the government's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the Muslim extremist Abu Sayyaf are the only two
Muslim rebel groups still fighting the Philippine government
forces.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government force in
the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which refused to be included in the peace deal forged
last September between the MNLF and Manila, began its own peace
talks with the government this January. But Abu Sayyaf has shunned
peace talks with Manila.

China has successfully put its inflation under control while
the economy grows and the standard of living of its 1.2 billion
people has been improving, Annan said, which is a great
achievement that has caught the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
UN departments have co-operated well with China and have
completed many projects successfully, he said, and that the
cumulative experience will help the UN increase co-operation with
other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that, in spite of its achievements in economic
construction, China, which is the world's biggest developing
country, still faces challenges and that more than 58 million
Chinese haven't solved the problem of adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
However, China is full of confidence of its future, he said,
and expressed the conviction that as long as China sticks to its
reforms and opening up, it can keep the rate of growth high and
inflation low to the end of this century and into the next.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation between China and UN agencies has been sound,
Zhu said, and China's development has benefited from the
international co-operation and UN aid and that China hopes to
increase its co-operation with the UN in the future.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the world is colorful and diverse and that
countries differ not only in social systems, values, and ideology,
but also in historical traditions, religions, and cultural
backgrounds. If these differences are respected, he noted, all
countries will be able to co-exist peacefully, increase
communications, and expand co-operation.
</P>
<P>
It is important that all countries learn from each other, but
this can only be based on a principle of mutual respect, equality
and mutual benefits, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Call for Marine Exploration Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Qin Zhongda and Yang Zhenhuai,
members of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, said here today that China should formulate laws and
regulations on developing marine resources as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lawmakers noted that better use can be made of China's
marine resources by drafting laws and improving management.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive management system for co-ordinating rational
development and utilization of marine resources should be
established eventually to protect marine resources and China's
marine environment, they said at the on-going 25th plenary meeting
of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
China's marine output value has grown at a rate of 25 percent
annually since 1990, and was 287.7 billion yuan (34.6 billion US
dollars) last year, compared with 43.9 billion yuan in 1990, and
6.4 billion yuan in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the increase will be higher than that
for the national economy. Offshore oil exploration, tourism, the
marine chemical industry, and other new marine industries are
emerging as pillar industries in addition to marine fisheries,
salt, and ocean transportation. In 1996, China's offshore oil
output was 18 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Some hi-tech marine industries are expected to grow up in next
century, such as desalination of seawater, direct utilization of
seawater, a marine pharmaceutical industry, marine mining, and
utilization of sea energy.
</P>
<P>
"China should list offshore exploration as part of its
development strategy from now on so that it can have some
achievements in this field in next century," Qin said, pointing to
the fact that in recent years, many coastal countries have placed
great importance on exploring marine resources and developing
marine industries.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of the world's marine industries will
surpass 1.5 trillion US dollars early in the 21st century,
compared with 670 billion dollars in 1992, and 13 billion dollars
in 1969.

<P>
Other measures for rooting out poverty in this century that the
legislators discussed included investing more in education and
technology, and improving Party and government leadership in this
work.
</P>
<P>
Dong Naifang and Yang Haibo said that food, clothing, and
shelter are essential for destitute people but are by no means the
ultimate goal of the poverty alleviation efforts. Dong noted,
"They should be better educated and understand useful practical
technology to make themselves better off with their own hands,"
and it is the government's duty to invest more in education and
practical technological development in these areas.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee, said, Party heads in poor areas should be held directly
responsible for solving this problem.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoxiang, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, said
moreover that officials in poor areas should establish direct
contacts with poor families "so that they can understand the
people's problems." He also proposed that Party organization
departments send officials up for promotion to poor areas, to see
whether they are capable.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said that
the poverty eradication work must be understood as a key political
issue that is related to narrowing the gap between town and
country and consolidating unity among ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> African Economic Ministers Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd session of the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and 23rd meeting of the
Conference of Ministers Responsible for Economic and Social
Development and Planning today adopted a declaration, noting that
poverty which constitutes the most serious problem facing Africa
"can be reduced and eventually eradicated by sustained high rates
of economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The declaration and five resolutions have been adopted at the
end of the 32nd session of the ECA and the 23rd meeting of the
Conference of Ministers Responsible for Economic and Social
Development and Planning.
</P>
<P>
''The declaration on accelerating trade and investment in
Africa'' said that a sustained high rate of investment and
production ''requires considerable resources which can be
obtained mainly from an increased rate of domestic savings,
supplemented by official development finance and foreign
investment''.
</P>
<P>
the meeting is concerned about the long-term declining trend
of official developmemt assistance in spite of economic
restructuring efforts and continuing need of development
resources.
</P>
<P>
the declaration welcomed the debt reduction initiative for the
highly indebted poor countries recently proposed by the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, saying that ''This is a
first step in the right direction''.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that in order to achieve the goals of boosting
domestic savings and investment, attracting substantial private
foreign capital transfers, and expanding trade with the rest of
the world, african countries must accomplish such prerequisities
as improving information flow on developments in Africa,
modernizing, expanding and diversifying production, strengthening
international competitiveness and striving for genuine regional
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
It urged Africa's bilateral partners to continue to provide
direct financial support and to extend indirect support through
tax incentive to their national investors participating in
infrastrucutre development projects in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It also urged multilateral development finance institutions,
notably the African Development Bank, the African Export-Import
Bank and the World Bank, to continue to play an important role in
providing technical assistance to African countries.
</P>
<P>
A resolution on reform of the intergovernmental machinery of
the ECA decided that the Conference of African Ministers
Responsible for Economic and Social Development and Planning will
meet on biennial basis and the next meeting will be in 1999. The
Conference of African Ministers of Finance will be convened
biennially in alternate years to the meeting of the Conference of
African Ministers Responsible for Economic and Social Development
and Planning.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also approved the creation of the African Women's
Committee on Peace.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges U.N. to Approve Deals with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan intensified diplomatic
contacts with the United Nations Sanction Committee as the world
body repeatedly delayed to approve some of the contracts Jordan
signed with Iraq to supply the country with life necessities.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's permanent representative to the U.N. is discussing
with the concerned departments on the contracts that are still
undecided up to now, said Hani al Mulqi, Minister of Industry,
Trade and Supply, in an exclusive interview with local Arabic
newspaper Al-Rai, which published today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Jordanian minister was expected to get
a clarification from these departments no later than next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another senior government official, who declined to
be identified, said that the Jordan had to intensify contacts with
the U.N. for quick approval of the contracts, because the world
body's delay forced some of Jordan's contractors to stop
production or transaction and lose money day by day.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all together 13 contracts from 13 Jordanian
companies have received permission from the Sanction Committee to
supply Iraq with detergents, cooking oil and medicine worth more
than 35 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 Jordanian firms who signed contracts with Iraq are
still awaiting to receive the U.N. consent.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food accord, Iraq is allowed by the U.N. to
sell oil worth of 2 billion dollars, 1.3 billion of which will
be used to buy food and other life necessities for the country's
19 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has maintained its seven-year embargo on Iraq since
the Gulf war ended and the Iraqi troops were driven out of its
oil-rich neighbor Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Before and during the Gulf war, Jordan sided with Iraq. Later
after the war, it distanced itself from Iraq in order to improve
its relations with the Gulf nations and the western states.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Apply for Amnesty, Says ANC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela will apply for amnesty from the government-appointed
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said Acting Secretary-General
of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) Cheryl Carolus.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will apply for collective responsibility with the
party's leadership instead of applying as an individual, Southern
African Broadcasting Associaition quoted Carolus as reporting
today.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said Mandela had already served 27 years in prison for
his active role in the struggle against apartheid which had been
condemned globally as a crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
She said the ANC had decided that past and present members of
the party must apply for collective responsibility to cover acts,
omissions and offences resulting from the liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chaired by retired
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is hearing evidence from people
who committed crimes in the course of defending or fighting
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tutu announced May 10 as the deadline for people
seeking amnesty for crimes committed. He said anyone failing to
come forward to confess by the ultimatum would be liable to
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With UN Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, welcoming
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan this afternoon on his
first visit to China since taking office last December, said that
China's firm and unshakable state policy is not to practise
hegemonism nor seek external expansion.
</P>
<P>
China's stability and prosperity do not threaten any country,
but only serve as greater contributions to world peace and
development, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes Annan's visit will give him a deeper
understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was honored by being able to visit China as the
UN Secretary-General because he has an opportunity to thank the
Chinese government and people for their support and contributions
to the UN.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the UN is the most important large
international organization, and for the past 50 years, it has made
important contributions to safeguarding peace and prosperity in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that, as mankind moves toward a new century,
the UN can sum up the positive and negative lessons of the past
50-some years and act in strict keeping with the goals and
principles of the UN Charter, care more about economic and social
development, and make greater contributions to a more beautiful
world in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that an increasing number of countries have noticed
the great role the UN has played, and that in a number of major
international issues, like environmental protection, disarmament,
and the fight against drug trafficking, no country could do it on
its own. Only with joint efforts of all countries under the UN
banner, can these challenges be met in an effective way.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Annan that on April 25, China ratified the Chemical
Weapons Convention and became an original signatory country. He
added that China hopes all other countries, especially those with
chemical weapons, will approve the convention at an early date to
realize its goals of a complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of global chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he appreciates China's support for the convention,
and that relations between the UN and China have been good from
the very beginning and that bilateral cooperation has been
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The fine cooperation between the UN missions in China and
Chinese departments have set a good model for the international
community, he said, and believes that this relationship will
continue to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, as permanent member of the UN Security
Council, China is fully aware of its duties for world peace and
security, and "will, as always, use its independent foreign policy
of peace and will strive to develop friendship and co-operation
with various countries."
</P>
<P>
China opposes hegemonism and power politics even when its
economy is developed in the future, Jiang said. Some people are
spreading the "China Threat" rumor in the international arena, he
noted, but this is "totally groundless".
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed Annan to the Hong Kong handover ceremony on the
midnight of June 30, and said that the exercise of sovereignty
over the territory is an important event in modern Chinese history
and a major international event.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong returns to the motherland, he explained, China
will adopt the policy of "One country, two systems", "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong", and a high degree of autonomy, and
that Hong Kong, as a bridge to the rest of the world, will
maintain its prosperity and stability on a long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
This is in the fundamental interest of China and is a
contribution to the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he is glad that to have a chance to attend the
handover ceremony and that he has a firm belief that Hong Kong
will maintain its prosperity and stability in the future.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Ambassador Qin Huasun, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the UN; Tang Jiaxuan, Vice-Foreign
Minister of China; and UN Undersecretary-General Jin Yongjian.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Wednesday as guest of the Chinese
government.

<HEADLINE> Informal Contact Continues for Pak-India Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Informal contact is going
on to prepare for a meeting between the prime ministers of
Pakistan and India, which has been scheduled for May 12 on the
fringes of a summit of South Asian leaders here, a senior
Pakistani official said today.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad Ahmed, Pakistan's foreign secretary, told Xinhua that
he already had some kind of informal contact with his Indian
counterpart Salman Haidar, but they have yet to hold informal
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed is here attending the foreign secretaries' meeting of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which is
preparing the agenda and programs for the grouping's summit to be
held here on May 12-14.
</P>
<P>
"We are meeting with each other here during the course of these
meetings ... We are in informal contact to prepare for that (the
prime ministers') meeting," Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly have informal discussions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what is to be discussed at the Pakistani-Indian
summit, Ahmed said, "Our agenda is how we can address ourselves to
the whole range of outstanding issues between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The Kashmir issue is on the top agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Pakistani-Indian summit might be held in the
afternoon on May 12 instead of in the morning ahead of the opening
of the SAARC summit as had been scheduled. "There might be a
little readjustment because we are going to have an inauguration
(of the SAARC summit) in the morning, so it is most probable that
the bilateral meeting might take place in the afternoon."
</P>
<P>
There have been signs of improved relations between Pakistan
and India in the past few months. In late March, the two
countries' foreign secretaries resumed their talks after a gap of
three years and their foreign ministers also met last month.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign secretaries' meeting which opened on the Bandos
Island Resort today, Ahmed said they are reviewing the activities
of SAARC during the past year and preparing programs for the next
year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will also finalize the budget arrangements
for SAARC and determine a new line of directions for SAARC's
relations with international organizations, he said. SAARC has
reached a stage where there is a need to take stock of "what has
been able to be accomplished, what have been the problems and how
we should now look at the future."
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

efforts and develop better measures to bring a better life to its
remaining 58 million poverty-stricken people in the final years of
this century.
</P>
<P>
In response to the report by State Councillor Chen Junsheng, a
member of the NPC Standing Committee, Cai Cheng, said: "We must
clearly realize that the remaining number of poor people are a
real difficulty for our national poverty eradication plan, because
they live in extremely difficult and harsh conditions."
</P>
<P>
Other members, Chi Haibin and Xiong Qingquan agreed with Cai in
saying that China has been successful in recent years in helping
the poor, by significantly reducing the number of poor from a
fourth of the world's total, to a twentieth.
</P>
<P>
Chen's ideas about how to deal with this problem in the future
were applauded, but legislators pointed out that, in view of the
different problems in different areas, extra efforts should be
made.
</P>
<P>
Cai said that the government should spend more in villages
where living and production conditions are extremely poor, to
improve conditions necessary for survival and economic
development. Villages where conditions are impossible to alter
should be moved elsewhere and the government should work out
detailed migration plans for impoverished people across the
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
In villages where marriages within the same family are common
and life is made harder by the number of children born
handicapped, the public should be made more aware of relevant laws
and should comply with them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- At a plenary meeting this afternoon,
China's top legislature listened to a debate on sustainable
development, the ecology and environment, improving northwest
China, and protecting fluorite resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by vice-chairman Wu Jieping of
the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress
(NPC). Lin Zengtang, a NPC Standing Committee member, said that to
maintain growth with Chinese characteristics, China should not
only persist in its family planning policy to encourage families
to have fewer children, but should also strive to improve the
quality of its population.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yicheng, another lawmaker, proposed ways for increasing
water supplies for the desert areas of northwest China, such as
preserving precipitation, exploiting underground water more
carefully, diverting water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River, and making artificial rainfall.
</P>
<P>
"The water shortage has been the major obstruction to economic
development in northwest China," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qidong urged the state to reduce export quotas of
fluorite, a mineral that is vital to the metallurgy industry. He
said he also found the waste of this kind of strategic resource
"shocking".
</P>
<P>
Other legislators spoke on poverty relief and protection of
marine resources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Pledges More Cooperation With Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that China and Mozambique should make greater efforts to
find new ways for cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with his Mozambican counterpart, Pascoal
Manuel Mocumbi, Li said the two governments should encourage the
two countries' economically powerful enterprises with good
reputation to strengthen cooperation in compliance with
universally-accepted international practices and the law of
economy.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that there were many cooperative
opportunities for the two countries in the agricultural field,
saying that they will discuss setting up joint ventures in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said the international community, especially
developed countries, should make greater contributions to reducing
the debts of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi briefed Li on Mozambique's domestic situation. He said
Mozambique's society had generally been stable since peace
prevailed in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the country is facing the double task of
construction and reform, thus making it imperative for Mozambique
to enhance exchanges with China in this field.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's success had proved that political stability is
critical to reform. China has been attaching great importance to
properly addressing the relations among reform, development and
stability during the course of reform and construction, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li arrived here from Lusaka on Wednesday for a two-day
official good-will visit, the third leg of his seven-nation Africa
tour beginning from May 3. He has already visited Seychelles and
Zambia before arriving here and is expected to continue his visit
to Gabon, Cameroun, Nigeria and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspaper Criticizes Netanyahu's Policy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian official newspaper
"Al-Thawra" today criticized severely Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's statement on rejecting withdrawal from the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Netanyahu made the statement to the
Jewish settlements officials Wednesday, reiterating his rejection
of withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and his support for
confirming the Golan Annexation Law.
</P>
<P>
Israel snatched from Syria the Golan Heights during the June 5
War in 1967 and its Knesset (parliament) adopted law annexing the
1,200 square kilometer territory.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in a commentary that Netanyahu's statement
means a policy of "aggression and occupation" and "provocation and
intimidation" without caring about the fate of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu's statements," the newspaper added, "mean that he
wants to get out of the peace process and cancel all that has been
achieved in the past years."
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra called for an effective U.N. attitude to bring the
Israeli government back to its senses and put an end to its
revolt against the will of international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also appealed to the world powers, particularly
Europe, to undertake their responsibilities and to make further
efforts to save the Middle East peace process.

Eduardo Mulembwe.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day official goodwill
visit to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
After briefing Mulembwe on the role of the Chinese National
People's Congress (parliament), Premier Li said China holds that
every country should enjoy the right to choose its own political
system and the road of development according to its national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the parliaments of the two countries will further
strengthen exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also said he believes that the mutually

<P>
Mulembwe said that Li's visit to Mozambique is an important
event in relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Car Sales Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Passenger car sales in the
Philippines continued their downward trend as a total of 6,318
units were sold in April, down by 10.8 percent from 7,086 units in
March.
</P>
<P>
Data released today by the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers
of the Philippines Inc. showed 27,309 units were sold during the
first four months of this year, compared to 28,638 units during
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The chamber traced the decline to slow processing and selective
approval by some financing companies and institutions of retail
financing applications of prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the facilities of two assemblers -- Nissan
Motors Phils. Inc. and Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. -- last month
outside Metro Manila may have also adversely affected the
assemblers' productive outputs.
</P>
<P>
The slump could also be due to the fact that some buyers may be
waiting for new models to be introduced by some of the assemblers,
the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
According to the data, total industry sales, which comprise
cars, light commercial vehicles, Asian utility vehicles, trucks
and buses, reached 10,021 units in April from 10,822 in March.
</P>
<P>
Models sold by Mitsubishi Motor Phils, Corp. led the passenger
car market during the month, with 2,838 units sold, compared with
2,754 in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi was followed by Toyota Motors and Columbian Motors
Group with sales of 2,611 units from 3,090 units and 2,422 units
from 2,765 units, respectively, the data indicated.

CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained ground
today in response to stronger employment figures and Reserve Bank
of Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane's comments ruling out a
near-term cut in interest rates.

<P>
In a speech to a parliament committee, Macfarlane ruled out a

One trader said the short end of the yield curve suffered more

areas, where massacres of the refugees have reportedly taken place.
</P>
<P>
The talks were conducted in "an excellent atmosphere," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was "an occasion for the French as well as the
Americans to confirm that they are aiming the same objectives: a
political solution to the (Zairian) crisis, with a mechanism of
transition conducive to free elections with international
observers," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Set to Ease in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The generally overall inflation
rate will remain below 10 percent in Kenya this year following
the arrival of the long rains last month, the Daily Nation today
quoted a veteran economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, only a rise in real production could bring about an
economic boom in Kenya and curb the inflation rate at the
single-digit level in the election year of 1997, said Maurice
Kanga, the chief economist of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
The annualized month-on-month inflation rate went up in the
country to 16.1 percent in April from 15.6 percent in March and
11.9 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The annualized inflation rate between January and March
climbed from February's 14.7 percent to 35.6 percent in March,
the highest in the year, then declined to 32.5 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
The sharp surge in the first quarter was reportedly caused by
the failure of the short rains between October and December,
which brought drought to key growing areas and boosted the prices
of staple foods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some local economists believed Kanga's forecast
was too optimistic, saying investors suffering from election
jitters might defer major investment decisions to next year.
</P>
<P>
Showing the strong impact of drought on inflation, the
unweighted food price index for all income groups rose by 43
percent in the year to March 1997, they say.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 1996 gross domestic product (GDP) growth was
estimated at 4.6 percent, below the five percent target, they
note, projecting growth this year of six percent.
</P>
<P>
The eastern African country is still haunted by the gross
monetary mismanagement seen in last elections five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The growth in money supply level seen in that one year should
have taken six years to achieve with an average GDP growth rate
of five percent, said Kanga.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot visualize the CBK printing any money. Nobody, even
the bad guys, wants what happened in 1992 to repeat itself," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank's attempt to contain inflation to single
digits by strictly monitoring money supply, analysts said, has
also created a vicious cycle where it competes with banks for
deposits and pushes rates higher. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Wish to Save Local Rice Varieties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Many Kenyan farmers now wish to
have the lost traditional rice varieties re-introduced since the
use of new hybrid seeds has led to a rise in the use of chemical
fertilizer worsening environment extensively.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of hybrid rice has almost completely replaced
the traditional low-yielding rice varieties, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the wide use of chemical fertilizers, which are
necessary for high yield due to new hybrid seeds' weak
resistance to plant diseases, have caused extensive
environmental degradation, destroying flora and fauna through
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Tana River District is such an area where the use of new
varieties of rice has led to the extinction of about 16
varieties of crops, said Dan Kiambi, the International Plant
Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) Project Manager.
</P>
<P>
According to IPGRI officials, farmers in the Tana River Delta
used to grow over 60 traditional rice varieties.
</P>
<P>
The clearance of forests, overgrazing, outbreak of forest
fires and drought have all contributed to the loss of traditional
rice varieties in Tana District, Kiambi added.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have collected 220 farmer varieties of rice, we
have decided to regenerate the germ-plasm and conserve them in
the National Gene Bank", he said.
</P>
<P>
Under proper conditions, the different varieties of rice can
be stored for a maximum of 100 years.
</P>
<P>
His center now plans to re-introduce 11 different rice
varieties already extinct in parts of the Tana River Basin. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Faction Leader Calls for Iraqi Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Kurdish faction leader in northern
Iraq Jalal Talabani affirmed his opposition to attempts to split
the Kurdish area from Iraq and his support for national unity, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK),
arrived here Saturday night from Iran, weeks after a similar visit
by a delegation from the rival Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The PUK and the KDP share control of the autonomous Kurdish
enclave in northern Iraq and have been fighting attempts by
Baghdad to exert its authority over the area.
</P>
<P>
Talabani told MENA today that he discussed with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday the situation in Iraq and
assured him that Kurds in northern Iraq did not seek separation
from the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed readiness to negotiate with the Iraqi government,
saying that "a democratic united Iraq will realize the aspirations
of Kurds and Arabs alike in this country."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of Egypt's role in the realization of
national reconciliation in the Kurdish area of Iraq, Talabani said
he reached an understanding with Moussa on the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Dialog with the Iraqi government has reached a dead end since
1991, added Talabani, whose party seeks self-rule in northern Iraq
where 4 million Iraqi Kurds have limited autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted reports that the PUK received foreign
assistance from any country other than Syrian and some Palestinian
agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any aid from Israel or any Western
nation," he said, adding that the Iran-PUK relationship is based
on good neighborliness and non-interference.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Waives Extra U.S. Sugar Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
decided to waive any additional sugar quota to be given by the
United States for the fourth quarter of the 1996-1997 quota year.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. Agriculture Attache John Wade, Philippine
Sugar Regulatory Administrator Wilson Gamboa said that because of
limited sugar stocks, the country decided to waive whatever
additional U.S. sugar quota it may still have in quota year
1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
But Gamboa assured Wade that the Philippines will "fill up
completely" its regular quota of 250,000 tons for the quota year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Sugar Board today unanimously agreed to give up
any extra U.S. sugar quota after finding that the country's
remaining sugar stock is apparently inadequate to meet such a
quota, according to Gamboa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to announce next
week an increase in its sugar import for the fourth quarter on
account of low harvest in its sugar-producing states. The
increased amount will be allocated among several countries,
including the Philippines, under a quota system.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third largest quota holder under the
U.S. tariff rate quota system for sugar with a share of 13.5
percent, next only to the Dominican Republic and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Major Changes Likely for Nigeria's Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A major change to Nigeria's transition to
civil rule program was discussed on Wednesday by the National
Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) and five political
parties, the Vanguard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The suggested change is that the governorship election originally
set for the last quarter of this year will be postponed to the third
quarter of 1998, to be held on the same day with the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the national assembly election slated for the
second quarter of next year will be brought forward to the third
quarter of this year and be held on the same day as the state assembly
election.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, however, agreed that the October 1, 1998 hand-over
date will remain irreversibe, a source at the meeting was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the adjustment "is to forestall possible conflict in
the roles of civilian governors under a militray head of state as
wintessed in the ill-fated third republic," the source said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Confirms Arrest of U.S. Employee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan confirmed here today the
arrest of a local employee of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Agency
but denied the reports that the move was "a retaliatory measure."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said in a press release that the
employee, identified as Ayaz Baloch, had been arrested on charges
of involvement in drug trafficking and anti-state activities.
</P>
<P>
"There was no question of his arrest being a retaliatory
measure, as a U.S. newspaper has claimed," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized the Pakistani government's strong
commitment to anti-narcotics measures and readiness to cooperate
with all countries, including the United States, in this field.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed any likelihood of the Baloch case having an
impact on U.S.-Pakistani relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. daily The Washington Times alleged on Tuesday that
U.S. officials had described the arrest of Baloch by Pakistani
authorities as hostage taking, suggesting the case was related
with the recent arrest by the United States of a Pakistani Air
Force officer on charges of drug trafficking.

will "wrap up some work and perform several working visits" during
his two-month leave from May 19.

Mahathir said that during his leave his deputy Anwar Ibrahim

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Stresses Partnership For Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has underlined the need for governments, the private sector
and workers to work closely to achieve faster social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The president said this at the Southern Africa International
Dialogue (SAID'97), which was held in Kasane, Botswana on May 4-7
this year.
</P>
<P>
A State House statement on Wednesday quoted the president as
saying that all the three parties -- workers, the private sector and
the government -- had a common stake in partnership.
</P>
<P>
"It was in their interest to see economic growth, expansion and
diversification in production, trade and services.
</P>
<P>
"By these achievements, jobs are created, government revenues are
increased, social services funded, living wages achieved, profits
made, while savings and invesments are also made possible", the
statement further quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the principal task of the government was to
create an enabling environment, through good governance which
ensured security of life and property, as well as general stability
and immigration and licensing procedures.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa pointed out partnership could effectively be promoted by
establishing consultative mechanism between the government and the
private sector, such as national business councils and other fora.
</P>
<P>
Talking of divestiture of public firms, President Mkapa said that
the people ought to be convinced that the exercise was not a "sell
out" process.
</P>
<P>
The SAID'97 dialogue was also attended by presidents of South Africa,
Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda
and the deputy prime ministers of Swaziland and Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Leap From Appointment to Direct Election for Village Committees (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The ballot tickets were counted: Li
Zhenming, 964 votes, Xu Jianli, 261 votes.
</P>
<P>
Hearing this, 42-year-old Li Zhenming let out a long breath and
felt relieved. His dream of being director of the village
committee had come true.
</P>
<P>
The scene took place in mid-April in Dongxia Village of
Quanzhou City, in southeastern China's coastal Fujian Province. Li
Zhenming became a new director through direct election by local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The direct election for village committees, which normally
comprised of a director, two deputy directors, and about four
members in a medium-sized village, is held every three years and
has been widespread in China since 1987.
</P>
<P>
"Direct and democratic election is a key political reform in
China's basic-level rural areas, putting an end to village
officials being appointed by township governments," said Wang
Zhenyao, a senior official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Following elections for several times in the countryside, the
election procedures tend to become more standard and unified, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
The universal way is that dozens of villager representatives
are elected prior to the election of village committees.
Preliminary candidates of directors come from the nomination of
such representatives or joint nomination by five or more villagers.
</P>
<P>
And then the villager representative conference will decide the
formal candidates. No organization or individual is allowed to
designate a candidate.
</P>
<P>
In Lishu County of northeast China's Jilin Province, the
candidates are elected directly by all villagers.
</P>
<P>
In many places, the candidates of a village director are
required to give campaign speeches. As to village committee
members, there are more candidates than the actual number.
</P>
<P>
The final balloting is usually held in either a large square or
several separate balloting stations. Whatever the method, there
are secret balloting rooms to fend off the intervention of
others.

Fujian Province has been taking the lead in the country with
regard to the standard election methods in the rural areas. Such
elections began in the mid-1980s, and the sixth round of election
will have been completed by the end of November this year.
</P>
<P>
With 1,463 voters, Dongxia Village of Quanzhou City began
preparations for the election at the end of March. In accordance
with the law on electing village committees, 25 villager
representatives were elected.
</P>
<P>
Early in April, nominations by the representatives and groups
of villagers produced four preliminary candidates for directors,
together with 18 preliminary candidates for deputy directors and
village committee members.
</P>
<P>
In the following selection conference, the four preliminary
candidates of directors delivered their campaign speeches,
explaining to the public their detailed plans on managing village
affairs.
</P>
<P>
One of the candidates, who had several private businesses
including a furniture plant and a food store, was believed to be
an active person in the village. Because of this, the villagers
thought that he might spend too little energy handling village
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Being viewed as inexperienced and indecisive, another candidate
was not able to win the trust of most villagers. In this way, the
two persons were screened out after balloting at the villager
representative conference.
</P>
<P>
Both the remaining two formal candidates of directors had good
plans for village management. Li Zhenming used to run a crafts
factory and shoe-making plant, and he was enthusiastic about the
public affairs and ready to help others.
</P>
<P>
The other formal candidate, Xu Jianli, 33, also put forward his
plan to boost the village economy, and promised to make new
achievements for the villager's welfare and the village
environment.

HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains attacked Hong Kong
this morning, causing road flooding, landslide, traffic congestion
and suspension of classes.
</P>
<P>
At 10:25 am today, local observatory announced the first
rainstorm red warning so far this year, indicating that more than
50 millimeters of rain had fallen generally across Hong Kong over
the past hour.
</P>
<P>
The most severely stricken area was Tsuen Wan in the northwest
of the New Territories, where 150 millimeters of rainfall were
recorded during the two hours between nine and eleven o'clock in
the morning. In most parts of the Kowloon Peninsula rainfall
exceeded 100 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Rainstorms led to road flooding, land sinking, landslide and
traffic congestion in many places in Kowloon and the New
Territories. Five landslides were reported this morning, with four
in Tsuen Wan and one in Sai Kung in the northeast of the New
Territories, said the Government Information Service.
</P>
<P>
Kindergartens, primary and middle schools all suspended classes
this afternoon, employers were reminded of employees' safety in
workplace and their journey to and from work when a rainstorm
warning is in force, hotlines were opened for the public to report
any flooding to concerned government departments.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Observatory forecast continued heavy rain in the
next a few days when an unstable southerly air storm remains to
affect the South China coastal region.

<HEADLINE> Afforestation Helps Protect Ancient Great Wall (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- At the edge of the Mu Us desert,
northwest China, the Great Wall had long remained buried by sand
and wind.
</P>
<P>
With local farmers' effort to build a "green great wall," one
of the world's ecological wonders, however, the ancient Chinese
monument is miraculously growing "taller and taller". And a couple
meters are visible above the heavy yellow sand.
</P>
<P>
For the last couple of years, Bai Chunlan, a farmer from
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and her fellow
villagers have been working on reclaiming this area from the
desert, just like their ancestors who had constructed the Great
Wall with brick and clay in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
With their effort to plant forests and grass, the "green
great wall" has not only helped improve the ecology of the area,
but also helped effectively protect the ancient remains of the
Great Wall zigzaging through the vast desert.
</P>
<P>
In Shabianzi Village of Yanchi County, Ningxia, which literally
means "Desert's Edge," less than a score of households stayed on
because of the advancement of sand six years ago. Desert has not
only destroyed local people's homes, but also damaged ancient
cultural relics. Many villagers moved to other places seeking for
better life, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Cultural Relics, the
ancient remains of the Great Wall in nine provinces and autonomous
regions in north and northwest China have an aggregate length of
50,000 km, but the current length of the remains available only
totals about 10,000 km owing to the ravages of wind, rain, and
sand.
</P>
<P>
To combat the desert, Bai Chunlan shifted her home eight km
away from the village in a donkey-driven cart together with her
husband. Nothing was growing except an old elm tree. She was 30
years old then.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-April final election participated by all voters of
the village, Li Zhenming, who won a high percentage of votes, was
elected director of the village committee. The other members of
the committee were also chosen through multi-candidate election.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jianli lost the election and "felt something of pity," but
conceded that "the election reflected the wishes of the
villagers."
</P>
<P>
"I respect the villagers' choice, and I'll try to be elected
director next time," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Yapeng, an official with the Quanzhou City
Civil Affairs Bureau, four rounds of direct elections for village
committees have been conducted since 1987.
</P>
<P>
The elections were well organized, villagers had a high degree
of participation, and the elections became more and more standard,
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The building of rural democracy has made two leaps over the
past dozen years: one is from traditional appointment to election,
and the other is from indirect election to direct election, said
Zhang Xiaogan, a senior official with the Fujian Provincial Civil
Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the scope of the whole country, however, there
still exist some problems in one form or another. Some local
officials tend to put off such elections without cause. And in one
village, some villagers tear apart the list of candidates not to
their liking, according to a Civil Affairs Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a process of gradual improvement in grassroot
democracy. After all, China's villages have taken the key step on
the road to democracy," the official said.

The efforts to harness desert and sand proved a tough job, said
Bai. On the desert, people could hardly stand when a strong wind
blew. And the young trees just planted were often pulled out from
the root.
</P>
<P>
Bai and her husband got up early every day, replanted young
trees just pulled out, rescued young trees buried in the sand, and
irrigated them with water from a well some 15 km away.
</P>
<P>
Bai also planted on a trial basis 0.2 hectares of wheat, which
produced no grain at all after the wheat was buried in the sand.
</P>
<P>
"The government sent us grass seeds and saplings, and
dispatched scientific workers to help us as well," said Bai.
Saplings that take root in the drift sand dunes eventually grow
green leaves.
</P>
<P>
By now, Bai's family has grown 16,000 trees, and planted 83.3
hectares of sand-grown shrubs and grass. The trees earn the Bais
an annual income of 24,000 yuan. The family now live in a bungalow
house with four separate rooms. In the back courtyard, cattle and
sheep thrive.
</P>
<P>
Bai Chunlan, awarded "March 8" green medal and cited as a
national role model, was received by central government leaders at
the Great Hall of the People last year, to commend her
contributions to protecting the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
In view of the sand-harnessing efforts that have helped
protect the Great Wall, government departments decided to build a
farm around the forests Bai has planted.

is now not only a home to the farm, but also to a new village of
12 households, with birds singing merrily in the groves and sheep
grazing leisurely in the fenced pasture.
</P>
<P>
The administrative village of Shabianzi, now with more than 200
rural households, have planted 1,333 hectares of trees and grass
at the farm, and have reclaimed desert land to grow rice,
cultivate fish, and build sties for rearing livestocks, according

<HEADLINE> Afforestation Helps Protect Ancient Great Wall (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The effort of Bai and her friends have repaid. Dong Yaohui,
secretary-general of the China Great Wall Association, said that
the construction of the "green great wall" has helped effectively
protect the ancient Great Wall in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Dong quoted results of an official inspection as saying that
the 178-km Great Wall of the Ming Dynasty in Yanchi County,
Ningxia, has regained its past grandeur and is considered as one
of the best preserved sections of the Great Wall, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Xinmin, director of Lanzhou Desert Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China has planted trees and
grass on 9.15 million hectares of the country's desert border
regions, reducing wind speed of the respective regions by 70
percent and enormously controling the advancement of sand.
</P>
<P>
In Shapuotou, Zhongwei County of Ningxia, on the verge of
Tengger Desert where the Great Wall also passes through, farmers
with Gusha Forest Farm have built a 60-km-long green corridor over
the past 40 years, which has ensured safe operations of the
Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Line, the country's first desert railway
line.
</P>
<P>
The forest farm has thus been awarded a prize for best
environmental protection by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
As more trees are grown, animals that had long disappeared have
started to return to the forest farm.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Express Runs Soon (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A luxurious passenger train linking
Beijing with Kowloon will be in service from May 18, thus ending
the absence of direct trains between the Chinese capital and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Every other day, the 97/98 train will set out from the Beijing
West Railway Station to reach Kowloon in 29 hours and 40 minutes,
with stopovers at major cities such as Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou,
Xinyang, Wuchang, Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoguan and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The train, with all carriages being sleepers, will use the
newly-built 25K type passenger cars, which are considered the most
deluxe made in China.
</P>
<P>
The train is the first domestic run to have a deluxe carriage
of two-person soft-sleeper compartments, which have only been
available on international routes.
</P>
<P>
"The train, the result of cooperation between relevant
departments in inland areas and Hong Kong, will provide prompt
handling of exit and entry procedures and first-class service, an
official of the Beijing Railway Administration told a press
conference held today.
</P>
<P>
The team serving the train is made up of 250 carefully-selected
personnel who have received special training in service standards,
and in language skills in Mandarin, Guangdong dialect, and
English.

"The operation of the train before the handover of Hong Kong to
China on July 1 is of special significance to mark the event as
well as to facilitate the exchanges between inland areas and
Hong Kong," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We're very optimistic about the passenger sources", he added.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the newly-built landmark Beijing-Kowloon Railway,
China's longest, the express train will first be operated on the
old Beijing-Guangzhou railway.
</P>
<P>
"Since Beijing-Guangzhou Railway is among the four trunk lines
which underwent speed-upgrading from April 1, it will ensure the
speed of the express."
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the new Beijing-Kowloon line will be eventually used
to link with Hong Kong", he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Four kinds of commemorative tickets, in pure gold, silver,
gold-plated, silver-plated, will be issued by the
administration, it was announced.
</P>
<P>
The tickets -- 97 sets of gold and 97 sets of silver, plus 1997
gold-plated sets and 1997 silver-plated sets -- will be
auctioned by companies in Beijing and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Adopt International Maritime Travel Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Economic and
Development Authority has approved the adoption of the
international maritime travel rules to simplify documentary
requirements for ships engaged in international voyages.
</P>
<P>
The authority will start a formal evaluation of the country's
position which the Department of Foreign Affairs can use as a
basis for seeking a Senate ratification, the Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1965 International Conference on Facilitation of
Maritime Travel and Transport Convention, foreign ships are
required to submit only eight documents to gain clearance.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is presently requiring 13 documents from
vessels which travel abroad, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Once the convention is approved by the Senate, the country has
to reduce the number of required documents and revise some
sections in the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The sections require presentation of inward foreign manifest,
storage plan, bills of landing, clearance from last port of call
and the oath of master of entering vessel.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Ports Authority said the country will benefit
from the Senate's ratification of the convention despite the need
to change several policies.
</P>
<P>
The convention reduces the number of documents which public
authorities can demand of a ship and adopts standardized forms for
maritime travel.
</P>
<P>
The measure also seeks to avoid delays in shipment which have
been frequently cited as a costly burden by the maritime sector.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Proposed Health Fee for Foreigners Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A proposed bill by Kuwaiti
Health Ministry to impose an annual health fee on expatriates has
caused wide resentment among foreign workers here.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Times today quoted expatriates as describing the
proposed annual charge of 50 Kuwaiti dinars (165 U.S. dollars) as
"unjustified, unfair and unreasonable," saying it should not be
made mandatory.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports had said the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health was
currently negotiating with four local insurance companies to carry
out the mandatory health insurance scheme designed only for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Some expatriates said if the scheme was imposed, they would
leave the country for good, because the scheme would overburden
their strained finances.
</P>
<P>
A cleaning worker said "this 50 KD is too high for me since it
is more than my monthly income," adding that "If the draft law is
implemented, there will be no point of me staying here any
longer."
</P>
<P>
The bill is yet to be approved by the cabinet and the
National Assembly to become law.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Kuwait was in a drive to gradually
increase the rate of nationals in the whole labor force, and the
newly proposed health fee scheme was aimed at encouraging
employers to hire more Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
This move is also part of the efforts by the government to
solve the potential unemployment of the Gulf country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait currently has 1.25 million expatriates, almost double
the number of its own population of 710,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposed insurance fee is also said to help
increase the health ministry's income as well as to get rid of the
misuse of free health care.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Holds Talks With UN Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China will play a more active role
in and further improve the sound cooperative relations with the
United Nations, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said during
his talks with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan here today.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here for a five-day official visit to China on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Annan
said that he was glad to visit China for the first time as
Secretary-General. He also extended condolences on the passing
away of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Qian welcomed Annan on his first trip to China and thanked him
for his condolences.
</P>
<P>
Qian praised Annan for his persistent efforts to revitalize the
UN and strengthen its role. China believes that with the support
of all UN members, Annan will make further positive contributions
to maintaining world peace and security, promoting economic and
social development in all countries, and strengthening
international cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also vice-premier of the State Council, said that the
world situation is undergoing profound changes, which have not
only brought about rare opportunities for the UN, but also
enlarged its responsibilities and posed stern challenges to it.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that in the five decades after the Second World War
history has proved that the UN plays a role that cannot be
replaced by other international organizations. In the new
situation, resolution of many global problems needs the role of
the UN more than ever.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the success of the UN depends on the support
and cooperation of all members, he said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the UN will pay more attention to the issues
of economic and social development and make more efforts to
promote such development in the developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan agreed with China's view on the role of the UN and
thanked the Chinese government for its consistent and strong
support to the UN. He said that in the past years, China has made
significant contributions to the UN, especially by actively
participating in the UN's drive to promote economic and social
development and eliminate poverty. The UN expects that China will
play a bigger role in all fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that as UN Secretary-General, he will continue to
uphold the UN resolutions on the Taiwan issue and stick to the
"one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, China places importance on and supports that the UN
playing an active role in international affairs in accordance with
the aim and principles of its charter. China believes that it will
play a more active role in and further promote the sound
cooperative relations with the UN in the process of economic
development and further enhancement of national strength.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed gratitude to Annan for his adherence to the
principled stance of "one China" and the UN Charter and relevant
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reform of the UN, Qian said that China supports
that relevant organs of the UN will carry out reform in order to
suit the changing situation and meet the demands of the times.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the reform is to reinforce the UN's capability
of safeguarding peace and promoting development, so as to
guarantee a better service for its member countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan agreed with China's point that the reform of the UN
should focus on economic and social progress. To this end, he
said, the UN should establish a new mechanism to give full play to
the limited loans.
</P>
<P>
To intensify the "south-south co-operation" is significant to
the issue of development, and China's experience in this regard is
worth drawing on, he said.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on a broad range of international
issues, and reached common or similar views on many of them.

<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Wang Fengchao, deputy director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, met
here today with a delegation from the Business and Professionals
Federation of Hong Kong led by its Chairman Lo Hong-sui.
</P>
<P>
Wang said there are 54 days left before the return of Hong Kong
to the embrace of the motherland, and the general situation of
Hong Kong is very good, and the most of the people there wish for
a smooth transition and the prosperity and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
This is also the goal of the State Council, especially its Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the following 50-plus days, Wang said, "we will carry out
work for the maintenance of the stable transition and the smooth
transfer of power, so as to make Hong Kong more stable and
prosperous after 1997, and create good conditions for the
establishment of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region on July 1 and its effective work afterwards."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of how the people in the interior areas
get approval to go to Hong Kong, Wang said the Basic Law has made
clear stipulations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, people in other places of China must go through a
strict procedure of approval to enter the Hong Kong SAR, he said.
The number of the people to go there will be decided by the
relevant department of the central people's government after
consulting the SAR government, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
after 1997, we will implement a strict procedure of approval on
those in the interior areas to go to Hong Kong to see relatives,
to pay a visit, or to get settled there, in accordance with the
regulations, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Wang assured the people that there will not be the case of
large numbers of people in the interior areas moving to Hong Kong
after its return.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wang conferred with the guests on such issues as
the rights of permanent residency for the non-Chinese residents in
Hong Kong, and the participation of the Hong Kong business people
in the development of the central and western areas of China.
</P>
<P>
He also introduced the Hong Kong visitors on how the work goes
to negotiate with foreign countries on visa-free access for the
SAR passport holders.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Cypriot Children in Poor Fitness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Children in Cyprus are in poor
fitness standards with massive cholesterol and overweight problem,
according to a study on local children's health and diet,
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by Dr. Michalis Tornaritis who tested
800 children in the Nicosia area, the Cypriot capital, shows just
over half of them -- 52 percent -- have cholesterol levels above the
highest acceptable mark predisposing them to chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Girls were reported to be the plumper of the two sexes, with
57 percent of them overweight, compared to 39 percent of the boys
tested.
</P>
<P>
Poor dietary habits and lack of exercise are the cause of the
problem, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It adds that the children's physical state indicates very poor
fitness levels, with 54 percent of boys and 36 percent of girls
unable to meet acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
The report stresses that if these problems are not dealt with
now, these children will face serious health problems in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Parents are informed of their children's physical condition
and advised on how to improve their health standards.
</P>
<P>
According to Tornaritis, as part of the "Children's Health"
program launched by the health ministry, educational seminars are
now being held for parents and teachers to advise them on correct
dietary habits for their children as well as the importance of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The program will now be extended to all elementary schools
across the island, with over 11,000 sixth grade children being
tested. Follow-up tests will be carried out on the children after
three years.

<HEADLINE> Manila Likely Not to Import Yellow Corn: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Because of the time constraint in
completing the internal procedural requirements, the Philippines
may have no time to import 350,000 tons of yellow corn as
requested by the country's hog farmers, a senior food official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The National Food Authority (NFA) agreed last month to import
350,000 tons of yellow corn to meet a shortage in the domestic
market, NFA chief Joemari Gerochi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Gerochi said this planned importation has so far failed to
get approval of the Cabinet. The corn imports will also need to be
endorsed by President Fidel Ramos and finally the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Gerochi said if the internal procedural requirements could be
completed by the middle of this month, the country will still have
time to import yellow corn from the United States or its neighbor
China.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, the plan to import yellow corn will have to
be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
According to Gerochi, all the importation of the 350,000 tons
of yellow corn should be completed by June because the country's
corn harvest starts in July.
</P>
<P>
Due to increasing corn requirements of the livestock industry,
the Philippines will have to import about 500,000 to 800,000 tons
of corn this year to meet a corn shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The country imported some 120,000 metric tons of yellow corn
from China in February and over 20,000 tons of white corn from
another country last month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegation Arrives in Pusan for EAG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese athletes were required to
have their best forms for upcoming East Asian Games, according to
the Chinese delegation here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, which arrived here Thursday afternoon in
chilly winds and drizzles, were led by Olympic gold medalists lifters
Tang Lingsheng and Zhan Xugang.
</P>
<P>
Tang Lingsheng claimed the title in the 59kg category and Zhan
Xugang had the crown and set three world records in the 70kg division.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wen, spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation, told Xinhua that
all Chinese athletes were demanded to get everything ready in the
shortest time for the games.
</P>
<P>
"Chief-de-Mission Wu Shouzhang has asked all members to take part
in the games with their best forms," Wen Wen said.
</P>
<P>
At the first East Asian Games in Shanghai in 1993, China, with home
advantage, had 105 golds to lead the medal tally. Japan and South
Korea were second and third with 25 and 23 golds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Competing on road this time, China is also determined to finish
atop in the team standings.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach the goal, China has sent several Olympic gold
medal winners for the games, including women judoka Sun Fuming, who
took the first title for China in Atlanta last summer.
</P>
<P>
Another objective to patcipate in the games for China, according to
Wu Shaozhang, is to take the games as a warm-up for the Asian Games in
1998 and 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"Through East Asian Games, we should have a better understandings
of our rivals and ourselves," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Full of Hope: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
has described Africa as a continent full of hope, which has tided
over its most difficult times and embarked on the road of
revitalization.
</P>
<P>
"The development prospect of Africa is inspiring. Any ideas
suggesting to ignore Africa, to belittle Africa or to harbor
pessimistic view about Africa's economic development is entirely
groundless," said Li Peng at a banquet given in honor of him by
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano last night.
</P>
<P>
Africa as a whole is an important member of the international
community, Li said, adding the sustained development of the world
is inseparable from the progress of Africa while the development
of Africa will help make the international economy more
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century has been an "emancipation century" for
Africa, Li said, believing that the 21st would be a
"development century" for Africa in which the African people would
rid themselves of poverty and march towards prosperity.
</P>
<P>
This would add a new chapter in the annals of human history,
he stated.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years and more, the Sino-Mozambican friendly
and cooperative relations have stood the test of the time and
international turbulence and have been developing steadily. In
international affairs, the two countries have been sympathized with
and supported each other along with increasing cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the new international situation, China and Mozambique should
join their efforts to further enhance friendship politically, expand
cooperation areas so as to benefit the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In his toast, President Chissano described Li's "historic
mission" to his country as an important embodiment of renewing
the bilateral cooperation in line with new conditions of the two
countries. He also expressed his sincere thanks to China for its
enormous contribution to Mozambique's economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China is a great success of the Chinese
people, and it is also a typical example of resolving similar issues
through dialogue, Chissano said, adding that he believed the success
of the "one country, two systems" policy of the Chinese government
on the issue of Hong Kong would be conducive to the settlement of
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He shared Li's view for the establishment of a new, just and
equitable international economic order. Without the self-emancipation
economically, the African people would continue to rely on others
and they would still suffer from exploitation and slavery, Chissano
stressed.
</P>
<P>
What China and other Asian countries have gained in their
economic achievements has encouraged the African peoples in
building for themselves a more prosperous life, the president
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agrarian Reform Program Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) is heading for a
virtual collapse due to lack of support services, the official
Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only one-third of the total lands acquired by the
government under the reform program have been given support
services, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Support services are infrastructure items such as roads,
bridges, water sources, and ecologically balanced structures,
which assure the production and marketing of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1990s, the government began to implement the
agrarian reform program under which it purchases lands from
landlords and then apportions them to landless farmers.
</P>
<P>
As of January last year, the Department of Agrarian Reform
acquired some 2.5 million hectares of agricultural lands all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
But of the 2.5 million hectares of acquired lands, only about
33 percent got the needed support services, the agency said. The
rest is turning into "useless" agricultural lands because of lack
of support services, it added.

<HEADLINE> US Official Warns of More Violence in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior United States official
warned here today that any further delay in resuming peace
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians could lead to
more violence in the region, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The official, who is close to the visiting U.S. Middle East
Envoy Dennis Ross and speaking on condition of anonymity, made the
remarks as Ross' shuttle diplomacy between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides entered the second day.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Wednesday, hoping for a new U.S. initiative
that might break the two-month impasse in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Media reports said Ross brings proposals that include
tradeoffs such as an Israeli freeze on settlement construction
and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
resuming the sharing of intelligence information, which was cut
off in March.
</P>
<P>
Ross made no comment as he entered Israeli Prime Minister's
Office Wednesday night for talks with Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that the violent confrontation between
Israel and the Palestinians following the beginning of the
construction at Har Homa would return if there is no progress in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to meet with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today, after meetings with Israeli President Ezer Weizman,
Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between the two sides stalled in March
after Israel started to build a controversial new Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the southeastern
outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while Israel insists that the PNA crack
down on terror and reestablish full security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Senior Netanyahu aide David Bar-Ilan said Wednesday he
expected Ross's presence would lead to progress.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever Ross is here there is some movement in the peace
process and it is usually positive," Bar-Ilan said, while
cautioning against expecting a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Ross's visit comes a day after Weizman met with Arafat at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
After that meeting, Weizman said Arafat agreed to resume
contacts between senior security officials, but the Palestinians
conditioned this on the presence of U.S. officials at all
meetings.

BELGRADE -- Bosnian Serb army's Chief of General Staff Pero
Colic Wednesday accused Muslim forces of preparing a massive
attack on Serbian territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Colic said in an interview published by a Belgrade-based
evening newspaper that the reliable intelligence information had
suggested that the Muslim army now is making all-round
preparations for the attack on Serbs and the occupation of Serbian
territories in coming August.
</P>
<P>
ROME -- The United Nations should withdraw the Multinational
Protection Force (MPF) from Albania if the national reconciliation
government headed by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino falls, Italian
Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told the Lower House that if the Fino government fell,
normal life would no longer exist in the war-torn country. In this
case, the United Nations should reconsider the task or even
withdraw the Italian-led MPF. Italy and the other countries in the
mission were seeking to increase understanding between the
Albanian parties and enable elections to be held at the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
KIEV -- More than 180 lawmakers Wednesday formed an unofficial
group aimed at preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. The group,
called "Ukraine outside NATO", warned in a statement that joining
the Western alliance would "pull our country into a fratricidal
war with neighboring states".
</P>
<P>
There is broad opposition to NATO membership in Ukraine. The
group was formed on the day when visiting NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana handed to President Leonid Kuchma a draft document
outlining a special partnership with the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has pledged recently
in a letter to the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
that Russia will abide by the international treaty banning
chemical arms.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the main obstacle in the way to ratifying the
treaty was the problem of money needed to destroy the country's
chemical weapons. Russia is among the signatories of the Chemical
Weapons Convention, which came into effect on April 29, but the
Russian parliament has failed to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
LONDON -- Newly-elected members of the British parliament swore

</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The FBI of the United States is investigating
whether a senior U.S. government official has been providing
sensitive information to Israel, the Washington Post said on
Wednesday. The FBI launched the investigation in January after the
National Security Agency intercepted a secure communication
between a senior Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and a
superior in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW -- Russia hopes that Spain will take into account
Russia's position on NATO's eastward expansion plan during the
discussion of these issues in the Alliance, Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said on Wednesday at a joint press conference
with visiting Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes y Juan. He
also noted that Russia outlined its vision of the future European
security system.
</P>
<P>
BONN -- Visiting British new Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
here on Wednesday that London wished to start a new era of
cooperative relations between the leading members of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to draw a line under the sterile and negative
confrontation of the past," said Cook at a news conference after
talks with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, Wednesday

<HEADLINE> Chinese Businesses Asked to Develop Wariness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese foreign trade
official called for businesses in China to be more wary of risks
when they make investments abroad to avoid major losses.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the lack of knowledge of common practices, laws, and
regulations of foreign countries, and that of the investment
projects, foreign partners and competitors, many Chinese
businesses have been "badly deceived" in foreign markets, and some
of them have even been sued or sentenced to pay large sum of
money, or their parent companies were affected, said Liu
Xiangdong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He told a seminar on global risk management that in order to
sharpen their competitiveness and increase their self-protection,
Chinese enterprises should make correct decisions while investing
overseas by getting familiar with international common practices,
constantly collecting the latest information of relevant markets,
seeking reliable partners, and understanding local laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of China's reform and open-up, many Chinese
businesses have invested in foreign manufacturing and trade
enterprises and the futures market.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation will strengthen both management and service
for Chinese businesses' investment abroad.
</P>
<P>
At today's seminar, which was sponsored by the MOFTEC and the
Kroll Associates of the United States, experts from the latter
introduced techniques on how to gain knowledge of partners,
clients, competitors, and markets before the deal, how to avoid
the abnormal situations after the investment, and how to deal with
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1972, Kroll is one of the first-rated risk managment
and consultancy firms. It set up its Beijing office in March last
year, and it now has 21 offices across the world.

CHANGSHA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An example of permaculture, Cili
county in central China's Hunan province protects the environment
with forest preservation and water conservancy facilities, and
controls industrial pollution, while harnessing low-yield grain
fields.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, forest coverage reached 58 percent in Cili
county. The county also cultivated 65 square kilometers of
soil-eroded land. About 30 percent of the low-yield grain land was
transformed.
</P>
<P>
Eco-agriculture has increased agricultural output in Cili. In
the last three years, the grain output of Cili has increased by
five percent each year, and about 220,000 peasants have shaken off
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Japan Vies to Hold Second Spot in East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan is in no mood to step off from the
second spot at the medal tally while its closest rival South Korea is
to host the second East Asian Games here from May 10 to 19.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is set to retain the second place and will not surrender it
to the hosts South Korea," said Yoshiro Okai, Chef de Mission of the
Japanese delegation.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-games press conference here on Thursday, Yoshiro conceded
that Japan faces a tough road for its mission as bowling is penciled
up as a demonstration sport.
</P>
<P>
"The level of the games might be higher than the first Shanghai
East Asian Games and will certainly be very competitive, so we must
do
our best and want to gain more medals than the first games," said the
Chef de Mission.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural meet, Japan ranked only next to China with 25
golds, 37 silvers and 55 bronzes, beating South Korea to third at 23
golds, 28 silvers and 40 bronzes.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to bag home medals from the sports of athletics,
gymnastics, judo, soft tennis and the team games of soccer and
basketball," said Yoshiro.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we are to gain 26 golds but the pre-set goal remains
uncertain as we don't know the entry lists of other delegations," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
For the Pusan Games, Japan has dispatched a 397-member squad for
14
sports, including 279 athletes.
</P>
<P>
As a testing ground for the coming major international games,
"Japan has sent off new generation for the sports of basketball,
gymnastics, weightlifting and wrestling while our best athletes will
compete in the events of athletics, soccer and judo," he said.
</P>
<P>
On his behalf, Choe Hyun-yol, South Korean Chef de Mission, said
the host will spare no efforts and exploit its home advantage to take
over Japan in the medal tally as his athletes enjoy upperhands in
Taekwondo, Judo, Boxing and Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
However, both Japan and South Korea refrained from voicing their
intention to challenge China that garnered a dominating bag of 213
medals including 105 golds from the first edition.
</P>
<P>
For the fortnight Pusan Games, Kazakhstan replaces DPR Korea that
decides to skip the second edition which features the same roster of
China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Macao, Chinese Taipei, Mongolia
and Guam.
</P>
<P>
The hosts put up a stake of 203 gold medals in 14 sports of
athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, football,

<HEADLINE> Blood Donation in Beijing to Commemorate World Red Cross Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing opened blood donation
centers in its 18 districts and counties today to mark May 8th,
the World Red Cross Day.
</P>
<P>
"It is the 15th time for the city to hold such large-scale
blood donation," said Li Xueming, director of the city's Office of
Blood Donation, who was among the first group of volunteers to
donate blood today.
</P>
<P>
Li said since the publicity campaign of free blood donation
began in Beijing in 1984, about 260,000 people have donated their
blood. There were more than 80,000 blood donors in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the time the activity ended this morning, about 400 people
donated a total of 79,000 ml of blood, according to the donation
office.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary donation is a safer and more efficient way for blood
collection, compared to blood-selling and compulsory donation,
said Sui Baiqiu, executive vice-chairman of the Chinese Red Cross
Society.
</P>
<P>
But donated blood only makes up a small proportion of the total
amount of blood for clinical use in China, she added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the blood for clinical use in the
country surpassed 1,000 tons last year, which was collected from
five million people. But only five percent of the blood came from
unpaid donors, while 35 percent was collected through compulsory
donation.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that a draft law on the introduction of a free blood
donation system was submitted to the Standing Committee of the
Eighth National People's Congress for examination.
</P>
<P>
The law would help promote free blood donation in the country,
if adopted by the country's top legislature, she added.
</P>
<P>
Many countries and regions in the world have achieved the goal
that all the blood for clinical use is collected through free
blood donation.
</P>
<P>
China, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines are the only ones
among the 17 countries and regions in the Pacific region that
still rely on paid blood contribution.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Cost up to Four Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The cost of the 2000 Sydney Olympic
Games will be at least 5.2 billion Australian dollars (4.04
billion US dollars), according to the Sydney Organising Committee
for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cost is up 43 percent comparing with the original estimates
made four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, SOCOG are still forecasting a modest surplus. New
South Wales (NSW) Olympics Minister Michael Knight said the
substantial changes in the budget for SOCOG, were due to the
lessons learned from the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta last
summer.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a budget which is much more realistic than the bid
budget. It's the difference between planning and doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
While SOCOG's spending was up sharply from the original budget,
revenue has also increased sharply from 1.26 billion U.S. dollars
to 1.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG's budget is mainly generated from sponsorships,
television rights fees, tickets and marketing deals and does not
draw on the public purse.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG also released for the first time information on the size
of the salaries of its senior executives, which showed the top
eight staff earn between 194,500 and 350,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Customs Officials Warn Against Foreign Businesses' Tariff Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign businesses are evading
customs duties on imports by declaring lower purchasing prices
than they actually offered, Customs officials in eastern China's
Zhejiang province say.
</P>
<P>
Most of tax-evaders were solely foreign-funded ventures and
processing industries of imported materials, because the nation
abolished the tax exemption for foreign-funded ventures that
imported equipment and raw materials, according to an official
with the Provincial Administration for the Inspection of Import
and Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
"This not just ate away the state revenues from the import
business, some ventures also imported more equipment and raw
materials than the official quota they were allowed through the
same trick," he said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the past tax evasion trick of declaring higher
prices of the imports and passing shoddy goods for quality ones,
the new practice can do harm no less, said Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
"It not only contravened the normal work order of attracting
foreign investment and went against the principle of fair trade,
but also resulted in a severe drain of state revenue," said a
Customs official.
</P>
<P>
As a new measure against the tax evasion, foreign businesses
are required to hand over a deposit to guarantee against declaring
import prices lower than actual prices, and to pay taxes after
strict inspection and evaluation of the goods are conducted.

KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Inflation rate for April, 1997,
rose to 10 percent compared to 6.7 percent in May, reported the
local daily the New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in inflation is blamed on the increase in
prices of foodstuffs, rent, fuel and utilities, the paper quoted the
commisioner for statistics in the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent inflation rate is the highest since December,
1995, when the inflation rate of 11.5 percent was recorded.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala, capital of the country, a 26.5 percent increase in
the prices for staple foodstuffs was recorded in April, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of fruits and vegetables rose by over 10 percent in most
urban areas but fish, milk, eggs, sugar, tea and spices experienced
slight price increase in April, the paper said. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Urges Universal Adherence to Chemical Weapons Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese delegate today
called on all members of the international community to join the
implementation of a treaty banning all chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Manli, head of the Chinese delegation and ambassador to the
Netherlands, elaborated China's position on the issue at the first
session of the Conference of State Parties to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Effective from April 29, the treaty is formerly known as the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted the key to the success of activities related to the
document, popularly known as the Chemical Weapons Convention, or
CWC, laid in part in the achievement of its universality.
</P>
<P>
The CWC's purpose and principles can be achieved at an early
date "only when all the members of the international community
actively participate in and support" its implementation, she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese official appealed to the countries which
have not ratified the Convention, particularly those possessing
chemical weapons, to approve the document as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
As an original signatory of the treaty, she noted, China has
always stood for the total elimination of all types of weapons of
mass destruction, and has made unremitting efforts for this end.
</P>
<P>
"A victim itself to chemical weapons in the past," Zhu said,
China has always advocated their "complete prohibition and
thorough destruction," and has had great concerns over abandoned
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
She called it "most disturbing" that the chemical weapons
abandoned on China's territory are still posing a grave threat to
the lives and property of the Chinese people and the ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
Thus, she said, China strongly demands the concerned country to
show an attitude of being responsible for history and fulfill the
obligations under the Convention by cleaning up the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the indispensability of the verification regime to
the CWC's effectiveness, the official stressed that China was
strongly opposed to any act of abusing the Convention's
verification provisions to jeopardize China's sovereignty and
security.
</P>
<P>
"Any such abuse will certainly undermine the effectiveness and
universality of the Convention," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that China would continue to take part, with a
positive attitude, in the work of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to achieve an early realization of
the objectives and principles of the Convention.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysian-African Ties Growing Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad returned home today after a week-long visit to
three southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit to the Republic of Malawi, Botswana and South
Africa not only strengthened ties between Malaysia and these
African countries but also succeeded in wooing businessmen of
these countries to form partnerships with Malaysian investors.
</P>
<P>
His visit facilitated the understanding of each other's
potentials and resources, paving the way for more business
cooperation between the private sectors of Malaysia and the three
African countries.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi, Mahathir attended a business forum, which marked the
beginning of a new era for business collaboration between
Malaysian and Malawian businessmen with the two sides signing
agreements to build highways and upgrade existing roads.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian company, G-Two Holdings Berhad (Ltd.), will
undertake the mammoth project. It will also build a 3 billion
ringgit (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) new satellite township in
Blantyre, Malawi, besides a 70 million ringgit (about 28 million
U.S. dollars) international standard hotel.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's biggest telecommunication company, Telekom Malaysia
Berhad has also set foot in Malawi through its joint venture with
the Malawi Post and Telecommunication Corporation in Telekom
Network Limited.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Mahathir's visit, more Malaysian companies are
expected to go to Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir continued his business opportunity exploring mission
in Botswana, where he met with the local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The business delegation which accompanied Mahathir took the
opportunity to scout for possible joint ventures with their
counterparts in Botswana although there were no agreements signed
between the two countries during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Also in Botswana, Mahathir took the center stage at the first
Southern Africa International Dialogue in Kasane, where he
delivered a special address to 12 African leaders, stressing the
need for the southern African sub-region to form a smart
partnership to face the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was also asked to share his views on Malaysia's
success story.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the last leg of his mission, Mahathir was
honored for his "exceptional and invaluable contribution" to the
promotion of friendly and mutually beneficial relations between
the African republic and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He received South Africa's highest award "the Order of Good
Hope Class I: Grand Cross (Gold)" from South African President
Nelson Mandela, which underscored the close ties between Malaysia
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was described as the "source of inspiration to the
developing world" through his eminent leadership in the United
Nations, Non-Aligned Movement and other international fora.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Urged To Develop Noble Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar
today urged Muslims to develop noble values to ensure harmony and
progress in the Muslim society.
</P>
<P>
Religious education and self-discipline are of utmost
importance to achieve this, the King said when addressing the
Muslim New Year (1418) rally here.
</P>
<P>
He said that without a firm sense of conviction and a strong
desire for self-discipline, social problems like gangsterism, drug
addiction and moral turpitude within Muslim families would become
rampant and weaken the Islamic Ummah.
</P>
<P>
The King said the younger Muslim generation should realize the
importance of equipping itself with useful knowledge and avoiding
involvement in any activity that would bring about its own ruin.
</P>
<P>
He wanted Malaysia's Islamisation process to be given broad
emphasis to change the pattern of life among the people who had
deviated from the true teachings.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that culture should be integrated with Islam to
ensure consistency in the country's Islamisation process.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded Muslims to believe in Allah's divine promises
that religious observances such as praying, fasting, paying the
zakat and performing the haj would be the strong bastion against
lowly despicable influences.

<HEADLINE> India's Trade Deficit Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit widened by
almost one billion to 5.44 billion US dollars during 1996-97 due
to a sharp slowdown in export growth to 4 percent from the

<HEADLINE> Becker Wins, Stich Loses in German Open Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Boris Becker won his first ATP match
for nearly three months on Wednesday while compatriot Michael
Stich lost at the German Open in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Former world number one Becker has been suffering with a
long-term wrist injury but he overcame to beat 19-year-old fellow
German Nicolas Kiefer 7-5, 6-2 in the second round of the
clay-court tournament.
</P>
<P>
Becker, who surprisingly lost to Italian Renzo Furlan in the
first round at Monte Carlo two weeks ago, produced a reasonably
consistent performance in difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
He had some alarms in the sixth game of the opening set when he
dropped serve but he broke back immediately.
</P>
<P>
After Becker had served out to love to take the first set he
looked much more in control, breaking Kiefer three times with just
one break back.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Wimbledon champion and 16th seed Stich, who
recently announced he will retire in September, faded against
Czech Slava Dozedel and lost 7-6, 6-2 in windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches of the day, Tommy Haas, ranked 114 place
below the ninth-rated Spaniard Carlos Moya, beat the Australian
Open finalist 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Moya, seeded four, looked dispirited by the cold, windy
conditions and when he came back 2-5 to 4-5 in the first set he
had his momentum broken by a shower which stopped play for 20
minutes. He didn't find his form since then.

<HEADLINE> India, US to Join Hands for Developing Edible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States plan
to collaborate to develop genetically-engineered edible vaccines
against tropical diseases, an informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such venture between the two countries in a
frontier technology area having enormous commercial potential.
Edible vaccines are the latest concept in paediatric care where
instead of painful jabs, popular foods like chocolates are
converted into antibody carriers to target specific disease
causing virus and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The current venture is part of an extended vaccine action
program between the two countries under which vaccines for
tropical diseases like Hepatitis and Rotaviral diarrhoea have been
developed. The edible virus program will work towards finding
antibodies for rabies, a disease estimated to claim over 1,000,000
lives every year. The research will target plants from which the
antibodies are to be derived.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of US and Indian biotechnology experts held here
during early March this year decided to enter this exciting area
of research. Under the broad agreement, specialized equipment and
technical help will come from the US while the work of finding
suitable antibodies from plants and cloning them into common
foodstuffs will be done by Indian scientists.
</P>
<P>
Edible vaccines are the object of intense research by major
pharmaceutical companies in the world.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Transport Workers Call off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A trade union of transport workers
in Nepal has called off a nation-wide strike earlier scheduled on
next Sunday and Monday, union officials here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Independent transport Workers' Association of Nepal (ITWAN)
has decided to indefinitely postpone its future agitation programs
including the next week's strike, ITWAN President Uddhav K.C.
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the decision came after an agreement was
reached Monday between the union and the country's transport and
labor authorities over the transport workers' demands.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to implement revised transport
regulations within one month, he said, adding that the workers
would resume their protest program if the government does not keep
its words.
</P>
<P>
The ITWAN has been staging agitation programs since late last
year to press the government to fulfill its 10-point demand,
including implementation of revised regulations, provision of
working licenses and increase in accident insurance.

<HEADLINE> Think-Tank to Boost Australian Integration With Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered think-tank and
research organization dedicated to fostering Australia's links
with Asia is to be set up in Sydney tonight.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard will launch the AustralAsia Center
of the Asia Society at a dinner with a statement of his
government's policy toward Asia, which is also considered a
rebuttal of the views of One Nation party founder Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said last week that the
Hanson policy of banning foreign investment and implementing a
racially discriminatory immigration policy would cripple Australia
in its attempts to engage in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Hugh Morgan of Western Mining, the center is
"entirely funded by the private sector and has the most
high-powered business support of any such group in Australia," The
Australian, one of the nation's leading newspapers, reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper described the move as a strong push made by the
Australian business community to intensify the nation's
integration with Asia.
</P>
<P>
The center's advisory council includes Don Argus of National
Australia Bank; Rod Eddington of Ansett, the national airline
company; Kerry Packer, a media tycoon and Australia's richest man;
Janet Holmes a Court, Australia's richest woman; and John Prescott
of BHP, the nation's leading steel producer.
</P>
<P>
From the academic world it includes Vice-Chancellor of
Melbourne University Alan Gilbert and Chancellor of Sydney
University Leonie Kramer.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister for Foreign Affairs Gareth Evans and Secretary
of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Philip Flood are
among other luminaries on the advisory council.
</P>
<P>
The center has achieved a major coup in recruiting Richard
Woolcott, one of Australia's most distinguished diplomats and
Asianists, as its founding director.
</P>
<P>
Woolcott, former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade, was Australia's ambassador to four Asian countries and
chairman of the Australia-Indonesia Institute.

<HEADLINE> South Chinese Aquatics Popular in Overseas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Sanya in south
China's Hainan Province has exported 300 tons of aquatic products
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen from this city by the South China Sea rely heavily
on aquatics, but were restricted to inshore fishing due to
lagging technology in the past.
</P>
<P>
Priority was given to developing a large-scale fleet of boats
and deep-sea fishing. And the city built an ice-making factory
with a daily capacity of more than 200 tons, in a bid to store
high quality aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Now over 3,000 tons of aquatics are sold in Sanya every
day. Conger and other seafoods of high value are exported to Japan
and Hong Kong, and even to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong companies have invested millions of yuan in
setting up an aquatic product export base in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city's quarantine departments have tightened supervision
over aquatics for export, and prevented 18 tons of poor quality
conger products from being exported in March.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Following two consecutive days of
sharp slide, the index of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)
sank to a five-and-half-year low on Wednesday, less than a point
above the level recorded on October 16, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The SET composite index on Wednesday lost 16.71 points, or 2.6
percent, to close at 626.57, falling through the key support level
of 630 points, with the lowest level on the day touching 618.66
points.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's plummet followed on the heels of Tuesday's decline
of 16.82 points, or 2.55 percent, the biggest single-day drop
since March 4.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's close, the benchmark index was 205 points, or
24.65 percent, down on its 1996's year-end close of 831.57 points.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-led selling over the last two days was caused by
rumors that the Thai economy, despite the rescue measures in
place, will not recover in the next two years, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The rumors have prompted foreign investors in particular to
liquidate their holdings and switch their focus to Asian economies
riding on the coattails of Wall Street's recent surge.
</P>
<P>
The index downturn was also part of the reaction to Deputy
Prime Minister and concurrently Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan's
prediction that Thailand would post a budget deficit in the
current fiscal year ending September.
</P>
<P>
He told a seminar on the local bond market that revenues in the
year so far have fallen well below targets and ruled out further
budget cuts before the end of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Only two months ago, he forecast that the budget of this fiscal
year would post a surplus of 2 billion baht (80 million U.S.
dollars) after state spending cuts of 106 billion baht (4.24
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investors dumped shares in expectation of poor
first-quarter corporate performance figures, which led to stocks
dropping across the board.
</P>
<P>
After all, the SET fell simply because investors still lacked
confidence in the market and funds were readjusting their
portfolio holdings, said Surachai Visitpongaree, an analyst with
ITF Finance and Securities PLC.
</P>
<P>
The stock markets were typically awash with rumors about
government reshuffles, baht depreciation or policy failures during
an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, unofficial figures disclosed on Wednesday
indicated that the country's exports in the first quarter of 1997
registered a decline of 0.2 percent compared with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The slight decline compared with a 10-percent growth
authorities have forecast for this year. Last year the country's
exports were near zero growth.
</P>
<P>
With the export decline during the first three months of this
year, overall gross domestic product growth in the period would be
below 5 percent, against a forecast 6.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Assets Confiscated From Italian Builder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Palermo Court confiscated
assets valued at over 1,000 billion lire (about 0.66 billion
U.S. dollars) from builder Vincenzo Piazza, who has been in jail
for the past three years for mafia association.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest single confiscation of assets. Among the
holdings confiscated were 2,500 rooms, 10 schools, 131 apartments,
122 warehouses, eight industrial sheds, thousands of hectares of
land in the provinces of Palermo, Ragusa and even Siena, where
Piazza owned farms. Many of the over one thousand apartments he
built are currently rented out to local governments and state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Tax officials were able to ascertain that their total value and
volume were entirely incompatible with the possible income of the
builder and his family, who declared a taxable gross income of
1,857,000 lire (about 1,226 U.S. dollars) in 1989. Investigators
also determined that the funds available to Piazza could not "even
be justified by tax evasion".
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 companies had been impounded and grouped together
under two holding companies, Caravaggio and Leonardo Da Vinci,
registered in the names of Piazza's wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 thousand shares were also seized, equal to 8 percent
of the Sicilian savings bank's capital.

<HEADLINE> Indian Public Enterprises to Be Given More Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
increased the powers of the boards of public enterprises to
sanction capital outlay in their enterprises without prior
government approval in a bid to boost their production and
development.
</P>
<P>
The powers have been revised with a view to giving greater
autonomy to public-sector enterprises and in pursuance of an
announcement made by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in his budget
speech for 1997-98 in February this year, a government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises with gross block of less than 1,000 million
rupees (28.17 million U.S. dollars) will now have the power to
decide on their own expenditure without prior government approval
of up to 100 million rupees (2.82 million dollars) against the
existing 50 million rupees (1.41 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The term "gross block" refers to fixed assets and capital work
in progress as shown in the last published balance sheet, the same
official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those having gross block of between 1,000 million
and 2,000 million and 5,000 million rupees (28.17 million, 56.34
million and 140.85 million dollars) have the power to spend 1,000
million rupees without the prior approval of the government.
</P>
<P>
The enhanced delegated powers are subject to the condition that
the enterprise concerned should be profit-making. Another
condition is that the project is included in the approved
five-year and annual plans and outlays have been provided, the
same source added.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Accuse Moslems of Preparing War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb army's Chief of
General Staff Pero Colic today accused Muslim forces of preparing
a massive attack on Serbian territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Colic made the remarks during an interview published today by
the Belgrade-based evening newspaper Vecernje Novosti.
</P>
<P>
He said reliable intelligence information suggests that the
Muslim army now is making all-round preparations for the attack on
Serbs and the occupation of Serbian territories in coming August.
</P>
<P>
The planned attack, Colic said, will mainly target the northern
strategic line, on which the city of Brcko is a crucial point, to
cut the Serbian territories into two halves in seven days.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, he alleged, the Muslim army is now engaged
in intensive military training with the assistance of 250 officers
from the United States and some Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim forces are also stepping up espionage activities on
Serbian territories to collect intelligence information, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian side has already notified international
organizations of the situation, the army chief said, adding that
all Serbs have been urged to get ready to defend their country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Minister Urges Withdrawal of MPF if Fino Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations should withdraw the
Multinational Protection Force (MPF) from Albania if the national
reconciliation government headed by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino
falls, Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister told the Lower House that if the Fino
government fell, normal life would no longer exist in the war-torn
country. In this case, the United Nations should reconsider the
task or even withdraw the Italian-led MPF.
</P>
<P>
Italy and the other countries in the mission were seeking to
increase understanding between the Albanian parties and enable
elections to be held at the end of June, he said.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the MPF's most important role, as well as the
protection of aid convoys, was its presence as "an important
factor for confidence" among the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
He said the MPF's brief does not extend to policing crime gangs
or stopping Albanians leaving their country in an attempt to enter
Italy illegally.
</P>
<P>
If these tasks were accepted, he said, a more substantial force
would be needed, with different troops.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the Albanian government's request, Italian
naval forces were patroling in Albanian territorial waters to
dissuade and stop the flow of illegal immigrants
</P>
<P>
The defense minister also proposed holding an international
conference on rebuilding the Albanian economy and financial
system, following the havoc wreaked by the collapse of pyramid
financial schemes which precipitated the present crisis.

<HEADLINE> Junggar Basin to Produce More Oil and Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Junggar Basin in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is expected to verify 600 million
tons of oil reserves and produce an annual crude output of 10
million tons by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will develop an annual gas output of three
billion cu m by the year 2000, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
The Junggar Basin, located in the northern part of Xinjiang, is
very rich in oil and gas reserves. Both Chinese and foreign
experts estimate that the basin has geological oil and gas
reserves totaling 6.9 billion tons and 1.24 trillion cu m,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration in the basin started in the 1950s. The Karamay
Oil Field -- the country's first big oil field was found here. So
far, more than 20 oil and gas fields have been developed, 16
operational. The basin turned out 8.3 million tons of crude last
year, ranking first among the three great basins in the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
The Junggar Basin has huge potential to tap in terms of oil and
gas production and verification.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the cumulative proven oil reserves in the
basin will total three billion tons by 2005. In addition, its
annual oil and gas output will exceed 15 million tons and three
billion cu m, respectively, by that time.

<HEADLINE> FAO Predicts More Bananas Than Needed By 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said today that under existing
production and trade conditions, banana supplies could exceed
demand by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
The FAO projects show global banana exports of 12.87 million
tons in 1999, facing an import demand of 12.22 million tons,
resulting in a 650,000 tons surplus.
</P>
<P>
However, the very recent entry of China into the importing
market could combine with emerging markets in Central and Eastern
Europe to absorb some of the projected surplus, said FAO.
</P>
<P>
The organization said bananas were the most important tropical
fruit in world trade, and of vital importance in the economic and
social well-being of most developing tropical countries.

</P>
<P>
Responding to U.N. High Commission for Refugees' request on

Italy would only treat as refugees who are threatened in their

He urged international refugee officials to define what they
mean by a "refugee".

<P>
According to ANSA reports from San Marino, a small and ancient

"but they are not refugees".
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy would put a brake on those transporting
Albanians to Italy for profit.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Moots Natural Rubber Producer Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has mooted an alliance
with Malaysia and other natural rubber producing countries to
counter the stiff competition posed by synthetic rubber, according
to Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Kingsley Wickramaratna.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted today by the Daily News as saying that
Sri Lanka had mooted this idea with several other rubber producing
countries and they have responded well to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Indonesia in particular will figure in a big way
in the alliance as they are large producers of natural rubber, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The world rubber buyers have dictated the prices of natural
rubber because of the competition among producers so far. Once a
new alliance of rubber producers was formed, the prices would be
stabilized, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is one of the main natural rubber producing countries
in the world. Its rubber production was estimated at 112 million
kgs last year.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections Postponed at Western Nepali Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Election Commission has
indefinitely postponed local elections in over 40 villages of four
western districts where no nominations were filed, officials here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided Wednesday to direct local election
officers to issue notices of staying the elections, originally
scheduled on May 17, in these villages until further orders.
</P>
<P>
No single candidacy has been registered in 41 villages of west
Nepal's Rukum, Ropla, Jajarkot and Salyan districts as a leftist
guerrilla movement named "People's War" launched a boycott
campaign by spreading death threats among would-be candidates,
local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Candidates who filed their nominations Sunday in other villages
in the same hilly region, about 250 km west of Kathmandu, have
been reportedly withdrawing their names from the elections after
the guerrillas strengthened their threats by killing a candidate
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have carried out a door-to-door campaign against
the polls, terrorizing the local people, a Rukum district officer
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nepali voters are scheduled to elect leaderships of nearly
2,000 villages in west Nepal on May 17 under the first phase of
the country's local elections.

The election's second phase will be conducted in central and
east Nepal on May 26.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Reelects Top Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami (people's)
League (AL) reelected Sheikh Hasina and Zillur Rahman to the posts
of President and General Secretary of the party respectively on
the concluding day of its triennial National Council on Wednesday
</P>
<P>
They were unanimously declared elected Wednesday night by the
two-day 15th council of the party, the first such kind of meeting
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
With this election, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina became the
president for the fourth consecutive term of the 48-year-old
organization. The 50-year-old Hasina was made president of the AL
first in 1981 when she was in exile in India.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to perform my duties and serve the nation
by making the party more dynamic," Sheikh Hasina, whose party won
the last June general polls, told thousands of supporters after
she was reelected.
</P>
<P>
The AL's Council, which was earlier deferred four times due to
non-completion of conferences of its several district
organizational units, also declared a 13-member presidium with the
induction of two new leaders, Suranjit Sengupta and Abdul Jalil.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Sheikh Hasina announced a nine-point future
plan of action, including eradication of terrorism, checking
corruption and misuse of power, eradication of illiteracy and
alleviation of poverty.
</P>
<P>
She also vowed to build a Bangladesh free from poverty, hunger
and illiteracy by 2020 when the nation would celebrate the
centenary of the birth of its first president Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman, father of Sheikh Hasina.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Market Varies Sharply in 1996: GFMS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Compared with the preceding years,
the gold market showed much more variation during 1996, due to the
weakness of investment and increased supply, Gold Fields Mineral
Services (GFMS) said.
</P>
<P>
In its annual publication, Gold 1997, GFMS said mine
production will reach 2,424 tons, increasing by 3.4 percent over the
2,346 tons of 1996, after having declined marginally in each of
the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
Total supply amounted to 3,490 tons compared with 3,629
tons in 1995, with non-official sector sales rising to 239
tons from 182 tons, and scrap increasing to 644 tons from
625 tons.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, jewelery fabrication rose for the third
successive year, showing an increase of 40 tons, up 1.4 percent
to a new record level of 2,807 tons.
</P>
<P>
The use of gold in electronics, the second largest sector after
jewelery, rose for the fourth year in succession, with the
relatively modest increase of one percent.
</P>
<P>
The average prices in 1996, based on the average London (PM
fix), was 387.87 US dollars per ounce, one percent higher than
1995, with GFMS noting that with the sustained rise in the dollar
last year, the gold price in other currencies, particularly the
Rand, showed sustainable year-on-year increases.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the developments in early 1997 and the outlook
for the remainder of the year, GFMS chief executive Stuart Murray
said at the launch of Gold 1997: "The price weakness since the
last quarter of 1996 has been, to a large extent, the result of
poor sentiment, stemming above all from fears about the future
impact of the official sector on the gold market."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the evidence uncovered by GFMS was that
official sector in the gold market was not a "one-way street".
</P>
<P>
"Even more importantly, the physical market, which tended to
hold back in the final months of the year as the price was
falling, has now kicked in with a vengeance and is once again
providing a rather solid floor at the 340 US dollars level, in
spite of the continued strength of the dollar," Murray added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the physical market gap, Murray noted that
"as in previous years, the current level of mine production and
scrap will continue to be insufficient to meet the demands for
fabrication and bar hoarding, and, the question is how this is
most likely to be filled in 1997."

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan President Leaves for Central American-U.S. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman
left here this morning for a regional summit where he will press
his U.S. counterpart to soften a new American immigration law.
</P>
<P>
Besides U.S. President Bill Clinton, Aleman will be joined at
the meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica, on Thursday by other leaders
of Central America and those of the Dominican Republic and Belize.
</P>
<P>
Following Aleman, Clinton left for San Jose tonight, to make
the first visit by a U.S. president to Central America since
former U.S. President George Bush traveled to Costa Rica in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Aleman told a press conference at the
airport of this Nicaraguan capital that the main topics of the
summit will be immigration and a hemispheric free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan president, who was chosen to speak on behalf of
all Central American leaders, said he would ask Clinton to help
persuade U.S. Congress to repeal or change the new immigration law.
</P>
<P>
Effective April 1, the law makes it easier for deporting
illegal immigrants and bars immigrants from re-entering the United
States for up to 10 years after living there without authorization.
</P>
<P>
As many as 600,000 Central Americans now live in the United
States, and many of them are people who fled their countries to
escape civil wars that raged across the region in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Immigration is "the issue of greatest priority and importance"
for Nicaragua and El Salvador, the two countries of the region
most affected in the past decade by the civil wars, Aleman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all five Central American countries -- Costa Rica,
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua -- want to be
included in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, to group
together the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Aleman, who is accompanied by Foreign Minister Emilio Alvarez
Montalvan, said his government hopes the United States will grant
Central America the favorable treatment for NAFTA member nations.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda for the region's leaders at the coming
summit will be the signing of an "Open Skies" agreement between
Central American countries and the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the president said, will ease restrictions on
commercial flights and lower air fares, and in turn will help
promote tourism and economic growth in Central America.

BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in the first
quarter of this year were valued at 228 billion baht (9.12 billion
US dollars), a decline of 0.2 percent compared with the same
period of last year, according to a source at the Business
Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
The figures are not official but they indicate that reaching
the Thai government's growth target for the year could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has forecast export value to reach 1,550
billion baht (62 billion dollars) this year, up 10 percent over
last year when growth was almost zero.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also registered a trade deficit of 66.9 billion baht
(2.6 billion dollars) in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Of the total exports in the first quarter, 73.7 percent were
industrial products, 14.4 were farm products and the rest were oil
and fuel.
</P>
<P>
The source was quoted today by local press as saying that with
the decline in export, overall gross domestic product growth in
the first quarter would be below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Business Economics Department plans a meeting today to
review first-quarter exports. Representatives from the food,
textile and footwear industries will attend.

establish a huge free trade area of Americas at the beginning of
the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
In a conference with Mexican businessmen on "The Present and
Future of Mexico-U.S. Relations", Zedillo emphasized the role
played by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
He said that thanks to NAFTA, Mexico became the United States'
third most important trade partner and trade has increased more
than 60 percent since the establishment of NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is now exporting more goods to the United States than
China's Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea combined, Zedillo
explained.
</P>
<P>
Free trade is contributing to the building of a more intense
and orderly relations among North American countries and is
propitiating a more solid understanding among its governments,
said Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Mexicans have to win the war against poverty
and inequality, clearly and definitely within the next century.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Mexicans want and will reach a market economy
that has a human face and heart and that will lend support to the
most needy in an effective way.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Scientists Identify Papaya Scourge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, MAY 7 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan researchers have
identified a new virus which reduces papaya yields by causing
many papaya blossoms to drop off, so preventing the growth of the
fruit.
</P>
<P>
The virus was detected and classified by the laboratory of
biotechnology and plant virology of the Microbiology Center of
Venezuela's Institute of Scientific Research.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also identified strains of the virus that were
infecting crops of yuca, zucchini, watermelon, pepper, garlic,
legumes and sisal.
</P>
<P>
Once crops were affected by the virus, the fruit would be
underweight, deformed, bitter in taste, and would ripen unevenly.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have developed diagnostic equipment for each of
the viral diseases and for determining which insects are
responsible for transmitting them, as well as the host plants.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela, infections can also be seen in major
agricultural crops such as alfalfa, potatoes, beans, cucumber,
gourds, melons, bananas, cacti, citrus fruit and several
ornamental plants such as roses and lilies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Nonferrous Industry Making Headway In World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
leads the country's nonferrous metallic industry and is making
efforts to compete more profitably in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Hunan's nonferrous metallic industry has met advanced world
standards for processing technology of stibium, lead, zinc, and
hard alloy. Products from the Zhuzhou Smeltery have been traded on
the London Metal Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The resource-rich province has 11 million tons of reserves of
10 major nonferrous metals, including copper, lead, and stibium.
Its reserves of wolfram, stibium, bismuth, and fluorite rank first
in China.
</P>
<P>
The Xikuangshan Mining Administration, known as the hometown of
stibium, leads the world in its annual production, while the
Zhuzhou Smeltery has become China's largest base for lead and zinc
export.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 kinds of products in the industry sell well in
over 30 countries, earning 200 million US dollars annually from
exports.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders attribute the success to the large-scale
restructuring the province has carried out in the field. Some
enterprises were merged, nine of the 13 mining administrations
shifted to other production lines and development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mines have spent billion yuan on technological
upgrading. As a result, the province has increased its smelting
capacity by 69 percent, and its processing capacity by 111 percent.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology have also played a role in turning the
resource advantage into the economic advantage. More than 200
scientific and technological findings have been scored in the
nonferrous metallic industry over the past 10 years, and 85
percent of them have been applied to production.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Accuses U.S. of Releasing Pests on Cuban Territary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has accused the United States
before the United Nations of releasing a plague of insects that is
affecting food crops on the western side of the island.
</P>
<P>
"Granma", the Cuban official newspaper said a duster airplane,
with the registration number N3093M of the U.S. State Department,
was sighted on October 21, 1996 when it was releasing substances
over Playa Giron, on western Cuba island, where insects were later
detected in their potato crops.
</P>
<P>
The insect, detected last December, is the thrip palmi karay,
of Asian origin, which attack all kinds of crops, according to
Cuba's central laboratory of plant sanitation.
</P>
<P>
In the denunciation presented to the United Nations last March,
the Cuban authorities described the incident as biological
aggression by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The operation carried out by the U.S. aircraft was observed by
the crew members of a Cuban aircraft that was flying over that
area.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said in its denunciation that the United
States released biological agents to deteriorate the food base on
this island in the Greater Antilles.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, has implemented a series of
preferential policies to support development of the real estate
sector.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the city hopes that the move may
help establish a group of large comprehensive real estate
development enterprises by the year 2000, which will also become
the city's major tax contributors.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policies include giving tax rebates to a
number of key city- and provincial-level real estate development
groups, and giving subsidies to real estate developers who have
sold their open-market buildings at much lower prices to support
the city's "comfortable housing" project -- a program aiming at
providing low-income families with low-priced apartments.
</P>
<P>
The city will also adjust the housing construction structure
and arrange more "comfortable housing" projects to speed up
commercialization of housing for urban residents, and vigorously
expand the leasing of open-market apartments.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Lawmakers Form Group to Oppose Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 180 lawmakers today formed an
unofficial group aimed at preventing Ukraine from joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
The group, called "Ukraine outside NATO", warned in a statement
that joining the Western alliance would "pull our country into a
fratricidal war with neighboring states".
</P>
<P>
There is broad opposition to NATO membership in Ukraine. Russia
has been strongly opposing NATO's expansion toward its borders.
</P>
<P>
The new group, comprising 187 lawmakers mainly from the
Communist Party and the Socialist Party, was formed on the day
when visiting NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana handed to
President Leonid Kuchma a draft document outlining a special
partnership with the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
Like Russia, Ukraine is seeking something on paper to fend off
any security threat as Europe restructures its defense lines.
</P>
<P>
But Ukraine has been an active participant in NATO's
Partnership for Peace program. It has not announced it intends to
join NATO but Kuchma has urged closer integration with NATO and
the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Posts Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government posted a
6.6 billion pesos (252 million U.S. dollars) budget surplus in
April, a great improvement from a deficit recorded during the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press reports quoted officials from the Finance
Department as saying Wednesday that this is an indication that the
Philippine economy remains strong, despite the recent decline in
stock market prices.
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of this year, the government
registered a 648 million pesos (24.7 million dollars) deficit,
giving rise to concerns over the government's financial position.
</P>
<P>
But the reports said the government still failed to meet its
hefty surplus target of 16.3 billion pesos (620 million dollars)
for April it expected earlier.
</P>
<P>
For the entire year, the government estimates a budget surplus
of 13 billion pesos (494 million dollars). This projection is
already included in the macroeconomic targets under a supervision
program endorsed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Exports to EU Likely to Lose Tax Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine export products to the
European Union (EU) are expected to lose the preferential
treatment by the year 2000 under the EU's new Generalized System
of Preference (GSP) scheme, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The EU is set to review the level of competitiveness of
products being exported to the EU from the GSP's beneficiary
countries, including Philippine products, by 2000, an EU official
was quoted as telling a press briefing here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting EU Counselor for Economic Affairs Pedro Martinez said
under the new GSP scheme, products that are found to be
competitive on the world market would graduate from the scheme.
</P>
<P>
These competitive products will then have to pay the standard
duty rate with a lower discount rate, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Products that are still uncompetitive would also pay the
standard duty rate but would be given a higher discount rate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Discount rate could range from 10 percent to 60 percent,
according to Martinez. Under the old GSP scheme, all products from
beneficiary countries are given zero tariff rate.
</P>
<P>
Martinez explained that this new graduation mechanism was
designed to ensure a "system of fairness" in the GSP scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore used to share the same tariff privilege for
similar products lines with developing countries like Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and other countries like South Korea, Brazil, Brunei
and Chile had already been graduated from the GSP in February last
year.
</P>
<P>
The GSP is a unilateral trade program which grants preferential
treatment of tariffs to developing countries. The EU classified
the Philippines as a developing country.

<HEADLINE> Private Ventures Embrace Displaced Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Workers laid-off from the public
sector are encouraged to seek job opportunities in private
enterprises in east China.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels are taking measures to give full play
to the role of private sector in the nation's reemployment
strategy. Zhejiang has granted preferential policies which
encourage the private sector to employ displaced workers. A
reemployment center has also debuted in Shanghai to help such
workers grab jobs in private ventures.
</P>
<P>
The private economy re-emerged in China in 1980s, providing
more convenience for people's life and creating more job
opportunities. But working in the private sector used to be
regarded as something far from an honor and was belittled by
workers in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the conception shattered with the introduction of the
socialist market economy in recent years. And as the
cradle-to-grave welfare system disintegrated and social security
gradually took dominance, people are eyeing businesses as a
promising alternative to employment in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
In a job fair in April, more than 600 displaced workers were
reemployed by private ventures, Zhejiang. Private sector in
capital city of Hangzhou accepted 1,000 such employees.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the province plans to shuffle
another 200,000 displaced workers into the private ventures in the
upcoming three years and 30,000 to 50,000 displaced workers will
be taken into the private sector annually in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Kasparov Draws with Deep Blue Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- World champion Garry Kasparov
drew with Deep Blue computer again in the fourth game of the
six-game series at New York, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After five hours and the computer's 56th move, Kasparov
offered the draw while the computer accepted immediately. It was
the second draw between the 34-year-old Russian world champion
and Deep Blue supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
After the first four games, Kasporov and Deep Blue each had
two points from one win, two draws and one loss.
</P>
<P>
The computer played white on Wednesday. Kasparov played
cautiously at the outset to avoid engagements that would allow
the computer to take advantage of its superior calculating skills.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov sacrificed a pawn on his 20th move to make room to
maneuver his queen, rooks and knights. Deep Blue advanced pawns
around its king, creating weaknesses in the computer's position.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov then took advantages with his rooks and recaptured a
pawn from Deep Blue on his 35th move.
</P>
<P>
Around the 45th move, the supercomputer tried to obtain a draw
by repeating moves, but Kasparov ignored the offer, choosing to
play on.
</P>
<P>
But after 11 moves, Kasparov agreed that the deadlock was
permanent and the game came to an end.
</P>
<P>
Game 5 and 6 of the series are to be played on Saturday and
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Expert Urges Reforms of Employment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China is facing a severe
unemployment problem and, possibly, it will have to face this
problem until the beginning of the next century, an economist
warned.
</P>
<P>
This is because the growth of urban jobs can hardly keep pace
with the influx of rural labourers and the growing urban
population, today's "China Daily" quoted Zhou Qiren, a professor
at the China Center for Economic Research of Beijing University,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed, during the 1985-94 period, China's urban
population grew at an annual rate of 10.23 million. The figure
would reach 15.23 million if rural labourers who moved to work in
cities were included.
</P>
<P>
This growing urban population has proven too large for
state-owned urban enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The only way to deal with urban unemployment is to carry out
the employment and welfare reform in state-owned sectors to form a
highly competitive labour market, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Such reforms might lower salary and welfare standards that are
artificially high when compared to low bank rates and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Reduced salaries that reflect the true productivity of
state-owned enterprises will discourage many rural labourers from
entering cities, put the growth of the national economy back on a
sound track and prevent urbanization from developing too fast.
</P>
<P>
Zhou suggests that while resolutely enaging in such reform
measures, China should also take up a series of complementary
procedures:
</P>
<P>
First, the government should let the bank rate be decided by
the market to ensure a more efficient allocation of
resources. Capital and labour must at last reflect the realities
of surplus labour and insufficient capital.
</P>
<P>
Second, authorities should try to let enterprises of different
ownerships compete on an equal footing and refrain from prejudice
against non-state-owned businesses when giving bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Third, authorities should adjust taxes imposed on township
enterprises so they can create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the government should create a more favourable
environment and policies for the export of labour and
labour-intensive products.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, central authorities should let local governments deal
with laid-off workers, other unemployed people and job retraining
according to their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
China should proceed with reforms in urban state-owned sectors
regardless of unemployment pressure. Only with the reforms can
China find a way to use labour resources more effectively.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Pledges Compliance on Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
pledged that Russia will abide by the international treaty banning
chemical arms.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made in a letter to United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan. Russia is among the signatories of the
Chemical Weapons Convention, which came into effect on April 29,
but the Russian parliament has failed to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin wrote that the main obstacle in the way to ratifying
the treaty was the problem of money needed to destroy the
country's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The letter was made public today by the Russian President's
Press Office.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that if the international community could give
Russia vigorous help, Russia would be able to accelerate its
process of destroying chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Though the treaty had not been ratified by the Russian
parliament, Russia would, as always, fulfil its obligations
stipulated by the treaty, the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Ministerial Meeting Opens in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of labor ministers from
Latin American countries opened here today to discuss labor
matters facing the region with the participation of Director
General of the International Labor Organization (ILO) Michel
Hansenne.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Costa Rican Labor Minister Farid Ayales, the two-day
gathering will discuss the role of the labor ministry under the
new economic conditions, and problems that have a direct effect on
working conditions, such as economic globalization and migration.
</P>
<P>
Ayales appealed for improvement of the workers' working
conditions, saying that in spite of different development
characteristics of each nation, workers' fundamental rights should
be respected by all countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hansenne told participants that the ILO is
promoting three initiatives for handling poverty, which swells the
team of workers.
</P>
<P>
He noted the first was to link development policies with market
access, saying international financial organizations such as the
international Monetary fund (IMF) and the World Bank should
coordinate their policies with the ILO.
</P>
<P>
The second initiative is to improve control mechanisms so that
ILO member nations will respect the fundamental dispositions of
the international conventions on labor matters.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he proposed an improvement in policies concerning
employment.
</P>
<P>
Labor ministers from Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Panama,
El Salvador and Belize as well as public officials from other
countries of the region attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China's Sichuan Sees Quarterly Tax Revenue Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
collected 2.77 billion yuan (about 330 million US dollars) in
industrial and commercial taxes in the first quarter of this year,
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 26.6 percent increase from the same
period a year ago, according to the Provincial Tax Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that the revenue of the value-added
tax and income tax, two major taxes under China's new tax regime
introduced in 1994, was 2.58 billion yuan in the January-March
period, a rise of 5.2 percent over same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
An official of the bureau said that the increase in the tax
revenue was due largely to enhanced collection, especially of
delayed taxes.
</P>
<P>
An effective mechanism for clearing delayed taxes was
established across the province at the beginning of this year,
according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (69-70) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (69-70) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: How many Hong Kong banks issue currency today? Will
they continue to do so after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: For various historical reasons, Hong Kong does not have
a central bank. Its currency is issued by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
For a very long period of time, the Hong Kong dollar has been
issued by the Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation and the
Standard Chartered Bank. On May 1, 1994, the Hong Kong Bank of
China joined in the issue of the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
At present three banks in Hong Kong issue currency. They are
the Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation, the Standard
Chartered Bank and the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Banks issuing the Hong Kong dollar must obtain interest-free
certificates of liabilities from the foreign exchange fund against
100 percent assets in US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Such certificates will serve as the basis of eligibility for
currency issues. The foreign exchange fund will be managed by the
Hong Kong Financial Commission to ensure the stability of the
Hong Kong dollar and Hong Kong's monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Article 111 of the Basic Law stipulates, "The authority to
issue Hong Kong currency shall be vested in the Government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The issue of Hong Kong
currency must be backed by a 100 percent reserve fund. The system
regarding the issue of Hong Kong currency and the reserve fund
system shall be prescribed by law. The Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region may authorize designated banks to
issue or continue to issue Hong Kong currency under statutory
authority, after satisfying itself that any issue of currency will
be soundly based and that the arrangements for such issue are
consistent with the object of maintaining the stability of the
currency."
</P>
<P>
Its thus quite obvious that the system regarding the issue of
Hong Kong currency and the reserve fund system will remain
unchanged, and that the three existing currency-issuing banks will
continue to issue Hong Kong dollars in accordance with statutory
provisions.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will there be any restrictions on the flow of capital
within, into and out of Hong Kong after 1997? Will the business
of foreign-funded enterprises be taken over by mainland-funded
enterprises?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Article 112 of the Basic Law stipulates, "No foreign
exchange control policies shall be applied in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region. The Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall protect the free flow of
capital within, into and out of the Region."
</P>
<P>
Article 115 of the law stipulates, "The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall pursue the policy of free trade and
safeguard the free movement of goods, intangible assets and
capital."
</P>
<P>
This means that doing business in Hong Kong after 1997 will
continue to be freer and more convenient than in other countries
and regions, with businesses there enjoying low tax rates and high
returns on their investment and at the same time being able to
freely transfer their capital and profits.
</P>
<P>
It will be impossible for mainland-funded enterprises to take
over the business of foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Article 105 of the Basic Law stipulates, "The ownership of
enterprises and the investments from outside the Region shall be
protected by law."
</P>
<P>
Article 118 of the law stipulates, "The Government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region shall provide an economic and
legal environment for encouraging investments, technological
progress and the development of new industries."
</P>
<P>
After 1997, mainland-funded enterprises will cooperate with,
and compete fairly against, businesses funded by capital from
various countries and those funded by local Chinese capital under
rules as prescribed by the Basic Law and laws of the Hong Kong
SAR.

<HEADLINE> Australia Announces 2.5 Billion US Dollar Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- leases of three major airports in
Australia have been awarded to private consortiums at the price of
2.5 billion US dollars, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Awarding of the renewable 50-year leases, including the
airports of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, was announced Wednesday
by Minister for Finance John Fahey and Minister for Transport and
Regional Development John sharp.
</P>
<P>
A group dominated by the life insurance giant AMP and a British
company, BAA, will pay the federal government 1.307 billion
Australian dollars (1.01 billion US dollars) for Melbourne
Airport, the Melbourne-based newspaper The Age reported.
</P>
<P>
The group expected to earn an "internal rate of return" on the
airport of 14 percent before tax, officials of the new owner,
Australian Pacific Airports, was quoted by the newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Brisbane Airport was valued at 1.387 billion Australian
dollars (1.07 billion US dollars) and Dutch interests will play a
lead role at the airport, the Canberra Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The payments for the leases are higher than originally
envisaged, increasing optimism for the value of the Sydney Airport
lease, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The airport leasing arrangements, initiated by the former
Keating Labor government, will have the effect of substantially
restoring the federal government's budget fortunes, easing the
need for further major expenditure cuts.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the successful bidders were contractually
committed to long-term development obligations, including
substantial investment in core airport infrastructure totaling
more than 500 million Australian dollars (389 million US dollars)
during the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The successful bidders had also agreed to comply with the
government's post-privatization pricing regime, said the
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would result in real reductions in aeronautical
charges ranging from 18.5 percent in Melbourne, 20.6 percent in
Brisbane and 24.6 percent for Perth over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Gabon's Trade With China Rises Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Gabon's trade with China rose
sharply to 189 million U.S. dollars in 1996 from 126 million
dollars a year before.
</P>
<P>
Gabon, on the west coast of Africa, is among China's top
trading partners in the continent. It exported 146 million dollars
worth of goods to China last year.
</P>
<P>
Though a small country with an area of 267,000 square
kilometers and a population of 1.3 million, Gabon is endowed with
rich resources. It has a proven oil reserve of 200 million tons, a
manganese reserve of 200 million tons, and a uranium deposit of
400 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Gabon is also noted as a "country of forest", with 80 percent
of its land being covered with forests. Timber reserves total 300
million cubic meters, including such rare woods as ebony,
cigar-box wood and sandalwood.
</P>
<P>
Its territorial waters are also an excellent fishing ground,
containing an estimated stock of 1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Rich resources help boost the country's trade and economic
cooperation with other countries including China.
</P>
<P>
Since Gabon and China established diplomatic ties in 1974,
bilateral cooperation has been expanded to cover agriculture,
health care, fishery, education and public utilities.

<HEADLINE> World's First Direct Coal Liquefaction Plant in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China may build the world's first
facility to directly convert coal into clean, quality fuel oil in
an effort to allay fears over pollution and the eventual depletion
of crude oil, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The consideration for one such facility was encouraged
yesterday in Beijing by China's Ministry of the Coal Industry and
Germany's State of North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
Minister Wang Senhao and the German State's Economic Minister
Wolfgang Clement exchanged documents for a co-operative
feasibility study on a strategic direct coal liquefaction
demonstration plant.
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, the China Coal Research Institute
and the German firm of RUR and the German institute of DMT will
spend two years preparing the feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the study will lead to the construction of the
world's first direct coal liquefaction into fuel oil plant in
China's southwestern province of Yunnan, which is rich in coal
reserves suitable for liquefaction.
</P>
<P>
The liquefaction plant will be operational within four
years. It will process 1.7 million tons of brown coal
annually. Output will include 600,000 tons of diesel fuel and
gasoline. The quality will also be good enough to serve as fuel
for aircraft, Zhu Deren, president of the China Coal Research
Institute, said.
</P>
<P>
A mine will be operated in Yunnan capable of excavating 3
million tons of brown coal a year to serve the plant.
</P>
<P>
The technology and experience China has accumulated over the
past 17 years show that the liquefied coal fuels may cost less
than fuels refined from crude oil, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
However, solutions to problems concerning industrial production
and market prospects depend on the feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China is discussing co-operative possibilities
with governments and enterprises of the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China has some 115 billion tons of coal reserves and
diverse requirements for clean coal technology and development,
and welcomes foreign governments and enterprises to try other
kinds of technologies with kinds of different coal.
</P>
<P>
In China, crude oil will only last for a couple of decades,
while the reserves of coal ensures exploitation for at least 100
years. Imports of crude oil are expected to increase to 40 to 50
million tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Globally speaking, commercial utility of coal in a clean way
would bring about a revolutionary change in mankind's energy
consumption, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Credit Increase Slows Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The outstanding consumer credit
in the U.S. increased at a 2 percent seasonally adjusted annual
rate in March, the slowest since last September, the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate followed an increase of annual rate of 6.7
percent in February and 10.3 percent in January. It was the lowest
monthly increase since a revised 0.8 percent increase rate in
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that credit card debt increased by 1.5 billion
dollars in March, compared with a revised gain of 5 billion in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money owed on automobile loans shrank by 1.1
billion dollars after rising 300 million in February.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding balances on loans used for education, vacations or
boat and trailer purchases increased by 1.6 billion following an
increase of 1.5 billion in February.
</P>
<P>
At the year-on-year level, U.S. consumer credit was up by 6.9
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Total outstanding consumer credit in the U.S. reached 1212.2
billion dollars in March, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumer confidence and credit levels in the U.S.
have remained high for the last several months, due in part to
relatively low interest rates and steady economic growth.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks sank sharply today,
with investors securing more profits from the market's dramatic
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at record highs
on Monday and Tuesday, gave back 139.67 points at 7,085.65. It
gained nearly 500 points from the previous seven sessions.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled
497.58 million shares as against 601.30 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 12.14 to 815.62, and
the NYSE composite index fell 5.82 to 424.95.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.38 to 1,322.92, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.01 to 570.50.
</P>
<P>
The market was also weighed down by another weak day in the
bond market, where long-term interest rates have been creeping
back toward worrisome levels.
</P>
<P>
The bond market pulled back today by more signals from the
Federal Reserve that inflation remains a threat.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported today that U.S. productivity
increased at a 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the
best in more than three years, but the improvement was not as
strong as some had hoped. Improving productivity enables companies
to raise wages without raising prices because workers are
producing more with the same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices slipped today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
rose to 6.96 percent from late Tuesday's 6.89 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the long-bond yield plunged below 7 percent for the
first time in about a month which gave the stock market a boost.
</P>
<P>
Although the Fed is widely expected to raise rates again at a
May 20 policy meeting, investors fear that the central bank may
raise rates repeatedly, slowing consumer spending and company
profits.

NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The GTE Corporation, the largest
local telephone company in the United States said Tuesday that it
had agreed to pay 616 million U.S. dollars in cash to acquire the
BBN Corporation, one of the Nation's biggest Internet service
companies.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at becoming a major operator of corporate
data networks which will then be able to open a new round of
fierce competition against the big long-distance companies
including the AT&AMP;T Corporation, the New York Times commented in a
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are undergoing very dramatic, fundamental change in our
industry. We are becoming a nation-wide provider of
telecommunications services--voice, data and video," Charles R.
Lee, GTE's chairman, was quoted as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T is the leader in running national corporate networks, with
about 60 percent of a 12 billion U.S. dollar market, followed by
the MCI Communications Corporation, the Sprint Corporation and
Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
"Together we are an almost perfect strategic fit-- our
technology and their resources," George H. Conrads, BBN's
chairman, said of the proposed merger with GTE.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Both British and German foreign
ministers warned Israel today against the further construction of
the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, saying that it would
destroy the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is quite clear that the Har Homa settlement is
both wrong in principle and deeply damaging the peace process,"
said the new British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook at a news
conference after talks with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
in Bonn Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not be able to keep the peace process alive if there is
not progress in the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook also made clear that Britain would be anxious to use its
voice to make sure that both parties of the peace process do not
do any thing that is going to make it more difficult for the other
part to reach agreement within the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel meanwhile assured Germany's full support of the European
policy on the issue, saying "we too believe the establishment of
the settlement in east Jerusalem is not acceptable.... and agree
that peace process in Middle East is a process to which there is
no alternative."
</P>
<P>
At their talks Wednesday, Cook also assured Kinkel that Britain
would "show full solidarity" with Germany concerning its relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain would not send its ambassador back to
Teheran in advance of any decision to return an ambassador there
from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany's ambassador was recalled from Teheran after a German
court ruling that Iran's leaders were responsible for the 1992
killings in Berlin of three exiled dissidents and their
translator. Iran made clear recently that it would not welcome the
return of Germany's ambassador.

ABUJA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The first ever African First Ladies
Summit on Peace and Humanitarian Issues ended here today with the
adoption of the Abuja Declaration of Africa's First Ladies on
Peace and Humanitarian Issues and Program of Activities.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day summit, more than 20 first ladies of
African countries and representatives of their counterparts in
almost all other African countries exchanged views on how to help
African leaders and the international community bring lasting
peace and stability to the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The summit was focused on issues affecting the continent such
as armed conflicts, instability, the health of women and refugees
as well as other refugee-related problems.
</P>
<P>
The participants also dwelled on political, economic and
social empowerment of African women and their health, gender and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting with grave concern the need to mobilized resources for
peace activities, African first ladies declared the commitment to
promoting initiatives that enhance peace in their own countries
and the African continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, the first ladies will assist
on-going efforts to re-establish peace in conflict areas through
peace missions, while engaging in various humanitarian activities
in order to alleviate the effects of war.
</P>
<P>
They will call on parties to armed conflicts to desist from
child-soldiering and urge the international community to declare
it a war crime, while strongly condemning child labor and child
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
They also strongly condemned the use of landmines and appealed
to ban the use of landmines that have caused the deaths of
thousands of people and seriously injured more others.
</P>
<P>
The first ladies will also request their respective
governments and international bodies to appoint and recommend
qualified and capable women to decision-making positions.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, programs will be initiated for
the economic empowerment of women for full participation in civic
and political processes.
</P>
<P>
The first ladies are also ready to encourage public
sensibilization and the introduction of education on peace, human
rights, democracy, rule of laws as well as a culture of tolerance
at all levels of education.
</P>
<P>
They will recommend to their own governments and international
organizations to provide adequate and appropriate health and
socio-educational facilities to women and children in general and
victims of conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to the Program of Activities, the peace missions to
conflict areas will compose delegations of African first ladies,
if possible, the peace missions will form part of the OAU and UN
delegations.
</P>
<P>
The first ladies will carry out humanitarian activities to
supplement international assistance through the collection and
distribution of relief materials to victims of conflict, while
sponsoring other supportive activities.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to focus the attention of national
governments, civil society, the private sector and the
international community to combat, particularly for women and
child-victims of rape, sexual abuse, torture, slavery,
transmission of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
and reproductive tract infections, maternal health problems,
hunger, malnutrition and illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
As a means to mobilize resources for peace activities, the
first ladies will organize national and international activities
for fund raising and networking with potential donors.
</P>
<P>
To ensure follow-up for their efforts, the first ladies
decided to send a delegation of first ladies to brief the OAU
summit scheduled for June this year in Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded summit, which has drawn wide attention, was
jointly organized by the OAU and the UN Economic Commission for
Africa.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Report Says Economic Growth Moderate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
said today that economic growth in the country was moderate in
March and April and most prices remained subdued.
</P>
<P>
There were "few new reports of upward wage pressures" in the
last eight weeks despite continued tight labor markets, the U.S.
Fed said in its periodic Beige Book report, a survey based on
information collected from its 12 regional reserve districts
before April 28.
</P>
<P>
The report said that increased strength in housing and
construction sectors helped fuel the economy, while the retail
sector posted more moderate gains.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. central bank said that most of the districts reported
retail prices during March and April remained "relatively
subdued." In other sectors, prices for raw materials were flat.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, consumer spending grew as most districts
reported a moderate year-to-year increases in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing activity reached very high levels across much of
the nation despite scattered auto-related strikes that affected
several districts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed Beige Book is a mostly anecdotal account of the economy
compiled by its 12 district banks and released eight times a year.
It would be a major base on which the U.S. Fed will decide the
future monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed's policy-maker, the Federal Open Market Committee
will meet on May 20 to decide whether to raise interest rates for
the second time this year.

the country might participate in Europe's single currency plan.

<P>
The dollar traded as low as 124.85 yen in Asian dealings, the
lowest level since early April, before recouping a bit to settled
at 125.13 yen in New York, down from 125.40 Tuesday. The dollar
traded at 1.7212 marks, down from 1.7228. The pound cost 1.6113
U.S. dollars, down from 1.6337 U.S. dollars, the lowest since
March 21.
</P>

surplus in the first 20 days of April, compared with a 472 million

The trade report reinforced fears that the United States and

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today strongly defended the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) and called for the dismantling of trade barriers
throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cross section of Mexican society at the National
Auditorium, Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo,
said the NAFTA was a boon to both economies.
</P>
<P>
"We must accelerate the pace of these efforts, to reach more
people and more communities," Clinton said. "We must include more
nations in our partnership, so that we can achieve our goal of a
Free Trade Area of the Americas."
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said, "Free trade opens fertile pathways."
</P>
<P>
"In both our countries, there are some who would throw up walls
of protection to ward off the challenge of change," Clinton said.
"But more and more people here, in the United States and
throughout the Americas, understand that openness, competition and
the flow of ideas and culture can improve the lives of all our
people."
</P>
<P>
He and Zedillo said U.S.-Mexico trade has increased 60 percent
since the NAFTA tore down trade barriers between the United
States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said the United States and Mexico can work
together to "seize the opportunities and defeat the dangers of
this new time" -- illegal narcotics, organized crime and
environmental decay.

<HEADLINE> GCC, EU to Hold Meeting on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) and the European Union (EU) will hold discussions on their
cooperation on May 20 in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is aimed to create and develop
partnership between small and medium-sized companies in the two
regional blocks, Kuwait News Agency reported, quoting a statement
issued today by Secretary General of the GCC Chambers Union
Muhammed Al-Mulla as saying
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said the small and medium-sized companies
mainly include those manufacturing foodstuff, chemicals, plastics,
industrial machines and tools.
</P>
<P>
Two working papers by the European commissioner in the GCC on
how to enter the European market and incentives provided by the
European side to the small and medium-sized GCC companies will be
discussed during the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC will also prepare a working paper on the atmosphere of
investment in the GCC states which is to be discussed by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mulla said the EU is GCC's number one trade partner as trade
volume between the two blocks is at more than 35 billion
U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Besides, GCC total investments in EU countries exceeded 150
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Al-Mulla pointed out that there are still some
problems obstructing the development of further and comprehensive
cooperation between the two blocks.
</P>
<P>
He cited obstacles like the Gulf petrochemical carbon-tax as a
protectionist trend hindering the Gulf petrochemical exports. In
addition, the little European investments in the six GCC states
are other problems affecting the growth of cooperative
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mulla said he anticipated that the meeting will encourage
the conclusion of long-term deals between the two potential
partners.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the meeting will provide an opportunity for
the Gulf companies to develop active and serious dialog with the
European partners.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Rinderpest epidemic has
broken out in northern Tanzania, which constitutes a serious
threat to both livestock and wildlife, the national news agency
SHIHATA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest, a highly contagious killer disease of domestic and
wild animals, was detected in northern Tanzania since early
January this year, and it is feared that it might have already
spread to other areas due to long distance movements of livestock
which prevailed during the recent drought.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest epidemic was recognized in Kenya last October and
by January, 1997 had spread across the border into northern
Tanzania, the SHIHATA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has
granted Tanzania 430,144 US Dollars for rapid containment and
elimination of Rinderpest epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Warns Against Close Ties Between Turkey, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz warned here today against close ties between Turkey and
Israel, noting that Lebanon was "looking with worry" at the
growing relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz made the remarks following a reportedly planned joint
maneuvers by Israeli, Turkish and U.S. forces in the
Mediterranean, the state-run Lebanese National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has common history and interests in various fields
with the Arab, and it should not give a depth to its relationship
with Israel which makes some to interpret or extract that Turkey
was part of an aggression against Arab states," Boueiz was quoted
as saying by the agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister said he did not see a
crystallization of a tripartite alliance formed by Turkey, Israel
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Until this moment, the U.S. and Turkey have only said that
the thing is revolving round the technical cooperation and
military cooperation, actually outside a political-military
alliance," the Lebanese official said.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking with worry at these developments, especially
after we heard informations in the last hours on a participation
of the U.S. in the future military maneuvers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot separate this thing from a political-military
encirclement or a political-military alliance which is aimed to
blockade positions of some Arab states," the foreign minister
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Several Arab states have been upset by a report that
General Cevik Bir, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Turkish
military, flew to Israel Sunday to help plan joint maneuvers by
Israeli, Turkish and U.S. forces in the Mediterranean.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia hopes that Spain will take
into account Russia's position on NATO's eastward expansion plan
during the discussion of these issues in the Alliance, Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Spanish Foreign
Minister Abel Matutes y Juan, Ivanov noted that Russia outlined
its vision of the future European security system.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish foreign minister was accompanying King Juan Carlos
I of Spain on a three-day state visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Though Russia and Spain have different opinions on NATO
eastward enlargement, Ivanov said, they agreed that it is
necessary to alleviate, as much as possible, the consequences of
the expansion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two sides "have agreed to actively cooperate
in order to work out a European security charter for the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
Touching today's talks between Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana in Luxembourg,
Ivanov said the "responsible character" of the current stage of
work on the document between Russia and NATO and the "delicate
nature" of the issues were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Described the talks as "very hard," he said, "It would be
premature to make any forecasts." Primekov and Solana will
continue their talks in Moscow next week, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish foreign minister, on his part, said that Russia's
security is an "imperative factor" for the security of his country
and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Russia should feel at ease within the framework of
the agreements to be concluded in accordance with such a European
security scheme as may be adopted by NATO."
</P>
<P>
Abel Matutes y Juan stressed that NATO expansion is not aimed
against Russia and that Spain shares some of Moscow's concerns
over NATO's enlargement.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Top US Official May Spy for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The FBI is investigating whether
a senior U.S. government official has been providing sensitive
information to Israel, the Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The FBI launched the investigation in January after the
National Security Agency intercepted a secure communication
between a senior Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and a
superior in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
In the intercepted conversation, the Tel Aviv superior asked
the Washington-based agent to use someone code-named "Mega" to
obtain a secret letter from then Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat on Israeli troop
withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Washington-based officer
rejected this suggestion, saying, "This is not something we use
Mega for."
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials said that the context of the
conversation led them to believe that Mega may be someone in the
U.S. government who has provided information to the Israelis in
the past.
</P>
<P>
Israel denied that it has been using a highly-placed U.S.
government source for confidential information and its ambassador
to Washington Eliahu Ben Elissar said the allegation must
originate with "an evil-intentioned source."
</P>
<P>
"I deny it as strongly as one can deny anything," Elissar said.
"I simply think this allegation is ridiculous. Of course, I cannot
guarantee for everybody, but if anybody in this embassy had this
conversation or such a thought, he can be considered an utter
fool, a fool," he said.

</P>
<P>
The killing happened this afternoon in Kenge, a town 200

attack any people who are not taking part in the fighting, in
particular civilians, prisoners and the wounded, and also the
staff and buildings placed under the protection of the Red Cross
emblem. ICRC delegates and Zairian Red Cross personnel will

<HEADLINE> UAE Considers Measures Against Ships Violating UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) is considering measures against ships violating the
U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq, the UAE's official Wam news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed
al-Nahyan discussed with some UAE senior officials this afternoon
the "more and more" violations by some ships hanging UAE flags
against the U.N.-imposed sanctions, Wam said.
</P>
<P>
The agency gave no details of the measures and violations. But
informed sources here said that the violations were likely made by
some ships delivering food, clothes and other aid items from
Dubai, one of the seven emirate of the UAE, to Iraq in accordance
with the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal signed in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
On their way back to the UAE, these ships were loaded with
Iraqi goods such as date palms. Such move is banned by the
U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq imposed on it after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollar
worth of oil over a six month period for purchasing food and
medicines for its people who have been suffering under the
U.N. sanctions.

But he warned that voters who had turned to Labor in their
millions could just as easily eject the party in five years' time
if they felt their trust had been betrayed.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to carry out Labor's promises, Blair said that his
party was already beginning to make a difference within days of
taking office, improving relations with the European Union and
handing over control of interest rates to the nation's central
bank.

<HEADLINE> Britain Promises to Be Constructive Instead of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Signaling the end of an old era,
visiting Britain's new Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said here
today that the new Labour government in London want to make the
country a leading player within the European Union (EU) which will
be constructive instead of obstructive in future European
construction.
</P>
<P>
"It's our intention that Britain should from now on be one of
those leading members of Europe, not a country on the sideline,
seeking to be obstructive to the direction of Europe. We want to
be helping to shape the direction of Europe," said Cook at a news
conference after talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It was the first foreign visit by Cook since he took office
last week. Before coming to Bonn, Cook had also paid a visit to
Paris.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Bonn that his visit to Paris and Bonn
itself was a signal that Britain wanted to show that it was taking
Europe seriously and wished to be taken seriously within Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to draw a line under the sterile and negative
confrontation of the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first concrete result of Cook's first foreign visit was a
joint statement by Britain, France and Germany Wednesday, in which
the three countries promised to intensify their cooperation in the
field of arms control and disarmament, and to seek, in particular,
the early conclusion of a global agreement to ban anti-personnel
landmines.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the statement had demonstrated how the three biggest
EU countries can reach agreement and make an impact on foreign and
European policy "by working together rather than treating each
other as negotiating opponents".
</P>
<P>
On his government's future European program, Cook said first of
all, London would make common efforts with other EU countries to
bring the ongoing Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) on EU
reforms to an successful end at the June summit of the EU in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Although he added that there would be some difficult areas
which affect different national interests, Cook expressed the
confidence that an overall package that is good for all would be
reached in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said that once Britain took over EU presidency in the
first half of 1998, it would make efforts to speed up the
negotiations on EU enlargement to eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
London would also make sure that the EU would complete the
single European market by removing the remaining obstacles to the
free movement of goods and services, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the planned January 1, 1999 launching of the single European
currency -- the Euro, Cook reiterated that Britain was "unlikely"
to make the first wave to join the club.
</P>
<P>
"It is for Germany and other countries of Europe to decide
whether it is right for them to proceed with the Euro on that
timetable," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
But "once it was so decided, Britain is not going to put any
obstacle in the way of those who wish to proceed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch Clean-up Campaign to Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has embarked on a three-year
campaign to keep the Great Pyramids in Giza here from harm's way,
an Egyptian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently approved a plan to develop the Giza
plateau south of Cairo aimed at keeping tourist buses, cars and
animals as far away as possible from the area, Zahi Hawass,
director of the Pyramid Antiquities Compound, told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
A 10-kilometer "tourist ring road," including parking places, a
cultural and recreational center and a new station for camels,
horses and horse carts, will be built just south of the Pyramids,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of a clean-up campaign, the shacks and slum buildings
near the Pyramids will be demolished and villagers will be settled
elsewhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tradition of picnicking around Pyramids which
many Egyptians have followed over thousands of years, will be
changed if not completely disrupted, according to Hawass.
</P>
<P>
"Soon we will stop people from feasting at sites of Pyramids
and set a special picnicking area in the desert," he said.
</P>
<P>
All these practices are part of a three-year plan of the
Egyptian government to clean up the Pyramids, one of the surviving
Seven Wonders of the world.
</P>
<P>
Defending the somewhat radical plans, Hawass, a renowned
Egyptologist, said "We are not working for one day or tomorrow,
but for future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that without proper conservation, 15 percent of the
archeological sites in the Nile Delta he visited two years ago are
simply gone now.
</P>
<P>
Before it is too late, Hawass said, much more should be done for
the benefit of the Pyramids, like closing the smallest Pyramid for
six months due to the humidity caused by tourists.
</P>
<P>
There are now 105 pyramids all over Egypt, where over 5,000
years of history have bred a wealth of pharaonic, Roman and
Islamic relics.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 4,200 tombs have been recovered in Giza alone, only
19 of which are open to the public.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Asks France to Return Archives of Colonial Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Algeria today asked France to return
some 200,000 files of archives of its colonial times dating from
1830 to 1962, as well as some archives of the Ottoman period
before French occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Abdelkrim Badjadja, the
director of the Center of Archives of Algeria, as saying that
Algeria has only got back 60 files of its colonial time archives
since 1962.
</P>
<P>
He said that some Algerian archives dating from the times of
Ottoman Turkish rule are now kept in Aix-en-Provence, southern
France.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the debate on the return of the archives was
triggered by the commemoration of anniversary of the massacres of
May 8, 1945, in which French troops brutally suppressed a protest
by Algerians in eastern Algeria.
</P>
<P>
According to Algerian historians, about 45,000 people were
killed in the massacres.

<HEADLINE> Military Exercises Not Against Any Country: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint
military exercises scheduled to be held this summer are not
directed against any countries in this region, a goverment
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly press briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy
spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that the three-nation joint
military exercises are aimed for "the civil goal and the
strategic importance."
</P>
<P>
He said that the military exercises will be held in the
international waters of eastern Mediterranean Sea in the way of
the search-and-rescue scenario. But the exact date has not been
fixed, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a country which attaches importance to the
bilateral and regional cooperation and this is one of the basic
factors of our foreign policy. The three-nation military
exercises to be held are part of our understanding", said
Atacanli.
</P>
<P>
He added: "The Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint naval exercises will
secure contributions to the stability in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
In order not to disturb its Arab neighbors, the Israeli
Defense Ministry has claimed that the joint military exercises
will "be of human nature and focus on search-and-rescue
scenario," and are not aimed at the two traditional Israeli
foes, Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The frequent visits between senior Turkish and Israeli
high-ranking officials in recent months have caused grave concern
from Arab world, including Egypt, which obviously fears the
establishment of a Tel Aviv-Ankara alliance.
</P>
<P>
A string of senior Turkish officials, most of them from the
military, have visited Israel in a bid to further expand its
cooperation with Israel in the defense and military fields.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Firmly Supports Azerbaijan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey firmly supports the
independence, territorial integrity and the legal government in
Azerbaijan, a Turkish high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli made the
remarks at a weekly press conference in response to a Tuesday
speech by Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev, who said that there
had been sabotage force in his country whose objective was to
overthrow the legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said, "We condemned the coup attempt in Azerbaijan (at
that time) and we are now condemning this attempt." He, however,
failed to touch the fact that some Turks were involved in the
sabotage activities in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Turkish MPs, Aliyev, who arrived here on
Tuesday for a four-day official visit to Turkey, said that some
groups, including Turks in his country, had been attempting to
topple the present Azerbaijani government following the breakout
of the Nagorno-Karabakh armed conflict between Azerbaijan and
Armenia several years ago.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev had reportedly escaped an assassination attempt upon his
return to Baku, capital of Azerbaijan from a recent visit to Copenhagen,
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
So far, Azerbaijan and Armenia have made no progress in their
talks aimed at improving mutual relations due to their deepening
differences over a series of key issues, such as the future status
of the Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed strip within the boundaries of
Azerbaijan but populated mostly by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Aliyev's visit to Ankara was aimed at
further expanding political and economical cooperation between
Azerbaijan and Turkey, particularly in the field of oil and
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the Turkish parliament, the
Azerbaijani leader stated that his country was giving priority for
transportation of Caspian oil and Turkmenistan gas to the
Baku-Ceyhan (southern Turkey) pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is an energy-starved country and has suffered an
economic loss of billions of U.S. dollars as a result of the
U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq. It has a urge to develop its
cooperation with its oil-rich neighboring countries in an effort
to solve its energy problem as well to increase its economic
strength.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks With Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, Mozambique, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano shared the view to
further advance bilateral relations and gained common
acknowledgement on a wide-range of international issues in their
talks today.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Li Peng's first visit to the country, Chissano
defined Chinese premier's African trip as of "extremely important
significance" and the Mozambican government and the people are
honored to host the premier's tour.
</P>
<P>
Under the new international situation, Mozambican leaders
keenly hope for exchanging views in depth with Chinese leaders on
bilateral relations and international affairs, with a view to
enhancing mutual understanding and helping push ahead the
existing friendly cooperative relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's regards to
President Chissano and Jiang's invitation to Chissano to visit
China. Chissano gave his reciprocal regards to President Jiang
and said he was expecting to visit China again.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng highly valued the Sino-Mozambique relationship, saying
that Sino-Mozambique friendship fostered after the independence
of Mozambique in 1975 has kept developing and the two countries
have been conducting equal and mutually beneficial economic
cooperation. "China wishes to further strengthen such a
relationship with Mozambique," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng thanked the Mozambican government for its support to
China on the human rights issue in the international arena and
appreciated the Mozambican government's stand to uphold the "One
China" policy on the Taiwan issue. Chissano stressed that the
Mozambican government would continue to resolutely support China
on the human rights issue and uphold that all countries should
respect each other and oppose the imposing of pressure on others
on the issue. On the Taiwan issue, he stated, the Mozambican
government would also continue to stick to the "One China"
stance.
</P>
<P>
On the trade and economic ties between the two countries, Li
Peng said China's aid to Mozambique within its reach mirrors the
friendship of the Chinese people towards the Mozambican people.
In the new situation, the Chinese government wishes to probe new
ways and channels of economic and technical cooperation on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit. And as a matter of fact,
there is potential for further cooperation in resources
exploitation, developing agriculture and forestry by setting up
joint ventures, Li Peng said. The two governments should also
encourage their enterprises to cooperate in these areas and
establish direct links, the Chinese premier noted.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Li Peng's view in this aspect, Chissano said China had
not interrupted its aid to Mozambique even when Mozambique was at
its most difficult times. Mozambique has learned from its own
experience that there would be no economic development without a
stable political environment. Now that domestic peace has been
realized in Mozambique and the country needs all the more to
strengthen its cooperation with China as China's brotherly aid
devoid of any conditionalities, Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said he was pleased with the effective cooperation
between the two countries in water-conservancy, and medical and
public health fields, stressing that he welcomed Chinese firms to
invest in Mozambique and carry out two-way trade and that
enterprises of the two countries should also increase exchanges
and confidence so as to expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed on Mozambique's domestic situation, Li
Peng congratulated the Mozambican government for the realization
of its domestic peace and national reconciliation and its efforts
to rebuild the country. Li Peng also appreciated Mozambique's
independent and non-aligned foreign policy of peace and the
government's positive endeavor in promoting regional cooperation
and safeguarding the common interests of the developing countries
in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that despite huge efforts of the developing
countries in striving for economic growth, the gap between the
south and north kept widening and the world peace and development
are still under threat. In such a situation, China calls for
establishing just and equitable international political and
economic orders. China also holds that all countries, big or
small, should be equal and enjoy the right to choose their own
development roads according to their specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Li Peng and Chissano witnessed the signing of
three documents between the two governments, namely, the
agreement on economic and technical cooperation, the document on
China offering aid to Mozambique and the document on maintenance
of well drilling and water supply system.

ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
today stressed that his country was in no way preparaed to
negotiate its sovereign rights in any form of dialogue and would
not accept any process which questioned the present status quo in
the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fundamental position of the government that Greece does
not put up its sovereign rights, as these rights emanate
dialogue," Simitis said while addressing the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement's parliamentary group.
</P>
<P>
On the Committees of Experts to be formed by Greece and Turkey,
he said that the purpose of the committee was to improve the
climate in bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that the committee in no way implied
commencement of a political dialogue nor any form of arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Greece had nothing to fear and nothing to lose, he said, adding
that the government policy aimed at improving ties with Turkey
through a step-by-step approach.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Turkish relations have been strained for decades over
territorial disputes and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, progress has been made by the two countries
to improve their bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Banana Supplies Could Exceed Demand by 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization reported on Wednesday that under existing production
and trade conditions, banana supplies could exceed demand by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was available here, shows global banana
exports, put at 12.87 million tons in 1999, facing an import
demand of 12.22 million tons, resulting a 650,000 ton surplus.
</P>
<P>
However, the very recent entry of China into the market could
combine with emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe to
absorb some of the projected surplus, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's emergence in 1996 as a significant importer of bananas
is an important development in light of the projected banana
surplus compared to import demand.
</P>
<P>
The report said should China's imports continue to grow at
current levels, the projected banana surplus will be reduced.
"Though Chinese per capita imports are very low, even modest gains
in their imports could have a significant effect on exports and
potential export earnings for developing countries," the report
said.

WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced the
approval of financing totaling 260 million U.S. dollars for
projects in India and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indian State of Andhra Pradesh will launch a massive
cyclone recovery and mitigation program in response to the effects
of last year's disastrous cyclone and other natural disasters in
the state with 150 million dollars in assistance from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The financing includes a 100 million equivalent credit through
the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's
concessionary lending wing for developing countries, and a loan of
50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed to assist the state government to
implement a hazard management system to prevent and mitigate the
damage caused by cyclones, floods and drought as well as to
rebuild public infrastructure and to enhance the government's
cyclone early warning capacity.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 220 million dollars. The
Indian government and the state government will contribute the
remaining cost.
</P>
<P>
Another loan of 110 million dollars will be provided for
Indonesia to help finance a Bali Urban Infrastructure Project. The
project will meet the basic needs in all urban centers and the
needs of growing urbanization in South Bali through urban
infrastructure investments, private sector participation, cultural
heritage conservation and institutional strengthening. With the
total cost of some 334.7 million dollars, the World Bank's loan is
some 32.9 percent of the total cost.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Inquiry on Treatment of Refugees in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata Wednesday welcomed a call by the
government of Rwanda for an independent international inquiry into
the way in which Rwandan refugees were being treated in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR official told reporters in New York the High
Commissioner, in a letter to the government of Rwanda, also said
the inquiry should also cover recent attacks on refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Ogata rejected as totally unacceptable Rwandan
government accusations that it was delaying the repatriation of
refugees in Zaire and was responsible for the deaths of 92
refugees on a train.
</P>
<P>
"The charges leveled by the Rwandan government and the Alliance
against the humanitarian relief effort in eastern Zaire are
outrageous, unfair and demonstrably false," Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance, the anti-government force in Zaire, gave UNHCR a
60-day deadline beginning May 1 to complete the repatriation of
the Rwandan refugees following an international protest of the
violent dispersal of refugees in Kasese and Biaro and allegations
that many of them had been killed.
</P>
<P>
As of today, more than 12,000 of the 40,000 who have re-emerged
in Biaro have been airlifted to Rwanda since the operation started
on April 27.

LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's gross international
reserves declined by 41.093 million U.S. Dollars between December
1996 and January this year from 220.655 million Dollars to
179.562 million Dollars as foreign exchanges inflows continued to
decline.
</P>
<P>
High government debt servicing and continued reluctance by
international donors to resume their assistance also led to the
decline, according to the Bank of Zambia (BOZ).
</P>
<P>
The reserves of 179.562 million Dollars can only meet Zambia's
imports for one month.
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, international reserves are
supposed to meet the minimum of four months for a country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the BOZ also shows that between January and
March 1997, foreign exchange inflows amounted to only 34.989
million Dollars compared to 123.651 million Dollars received in
the last quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the low inflows in foreign exchanges, foreign
exchange outflow continued to increase as debt servicing consumed
more and more of its foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During the period foreign exchange outflows from the BOZ
amounted to 85.564 million Dollars, of which 56.026 million
Dollars went to service government debts.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fall of foreign exchange inflows, the
government has resorted to domestic borrowing to meet external
debt servicing, but this has spelt doom for the country by way of
transferring resources from the productive sector to
non-productive areas.
</P>
<P>
The domestic debt by the end of last year was over 300 billion
Kwacha (about 231 million Dollars) while debt servicing in 1996
was 122 billion Kwacha (about 94 million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Find HIV Infection Blockage in Lab Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A monoclonal antibody to CCR5, a
chemokine receptor on T cells, blocked HIV infection of those
cells in laboratory tests, it was reported in the May 5 issue of
the Journal of Experimental Medicine.
</P>
<P>
CCR5 is one of several co-receptors used by HIV to gain entry
to T cells. The results demonstrate that an anti-CCR5 agent can
block access to T cells by the strain of HIV found early in the
disease, the study's authors concluded.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at LeukoSite, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, the
Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center of New York and Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute of Boston collaborated on the study, according to
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Recently, two chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) were
identified as co-receptors through which HIV gains entry to T
cells. CCR5 is the portal for the macrophage-tropic HIV-1
strains, which predominate early in HIV infection, while CXCR4
allows the later-stage T-tropic HIV-1 strains to enter T cells.
Since the discovery of their role in HIV infection, the chemokine
co-receptors, especially CCR5, have become targets for the
development of new anti-AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
In November, LeukoSite announced it was collaborating with
Warner-Lambert on the discovery of small molecules that block the
CCR5 receptor, it said.

<HEADLINE> Public Hearing on Africa's Forests Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The two-day public hearing of
Africa's forests has ended here, concluding that the forests
should be given back to the indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the hearing organized by the World
Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development (WCFSD) on
Tuesday, Ola Ullsten, co-chairperson of the WCFSD, called on the
countries with the tropical forests to ensure that the
international community get the wood from them at right prices.
</P>
<P>
The public hearing is the fourth in a series organized by the
WCFSD to develop a better understanding of how forests could be
sustainably and more equitably managed.
</P>
<P>
Close to 100 eminent personalities from across the world
attending the meeting also came to the conclusion that the local
communities and governments have not received the right amount
for the wood taking out the forests.
</P>
<P>
In other word, the prices on the wood were too low compared to
what the exploiters and industrialists received after processing
the wood.
</P>
<P>
The next public hearing will be held in Russia after which the
commission will publish its final report in September this year.

BRUSSELS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations International
War Crime Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on Wednesday has
found a Bosnian-Serb guilty of crimes against humanity, according
to local television reports.
</P>
<P>
Reports said it was the first full international war crimes
trial since the end of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Defendant Dusan Tadic, a former 41-year old cafe-owner, was
found guilty of 11 of 31 charges relating to the persecution and
torture of Bosnian Moslem civilians, many detained in camps in
north-west Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Tadic, who denied all the accusations, was accused to have
carried out numerous beatings of people in prison there, one of
whom later died from the injuries.
</P>
<P>
But he was acquited of nine murder charges, the judges
deciding by majority that there was a clear lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Tadic would remain in custody until
sentencing on 1 July.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Market Much More Variation in 1996: GFMS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The gold market showed much more
variation during the course of 1996 relative to the preceding two
years due to the weakness of investment and increased supply, Gold
Fields Mineral Services (GFMS) said.
</P>
<P>
In its annual publication, Gold 1997, GFMS said that mine
production increased by 77 tons (3.4%) to 2,346 tons in 1996
after having declined marginally in each of the previous two
years.
</P>
<P>
Total supply amounted to 3,490 tons compared with 3,629
tons in 1995, with non-official sector sales rising to 239
tons from 182 tons and scrap increasing to 644 tons from 625
tons.
</P>
<P>
On demand side, jewellery fabrication rose for the third
successive year, showing an increase of 40 tons (1.4%) to a new
record level of 2,807 tons.
</P>
<P>
The use of gold in electronics, the second largest sector after
jewellery, rose for the fourth year in succession, with the
relatively modest increase of 1%.
</P>
<P>
The average prices in 1996, based on the average London (PM
fix), was 387.87 US dollars per ounce, 1 percent higher than 1995,
with GFMS noting that with the sustained rise in the dollar last
year, the gold price in other currencies showed substantial
year-on-year increases.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the developments in early 1997 and the outlook
for the remainder of the year, GFMS chief executive Stuart Murray
said at the launch of Gold 1997: "the price weakness since the
last quarter of 1996 has been to a large extent the result of poor
sentiment, stemming above all from fears about the future impact
of the official sector on the gold market."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the evidence uncovered by GFMS was that
official sector in the gold market was not a "one-way street".
</P>
<P>
"Even more importantly, the physical market, which tended to
hold back in the final months of the year as the price was
falling, has now kicked in with a vengeance and is once again
providing a rather solid floor at the 340 US dollars level in
spite of the continued strength of the dollar," Murray added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the physical market gap, Murray noted that
"as in previous years, the current level of mine production and
scrap will continue to be insufficient to meet the demands for
fabrication and bar hoarding, and, the question is how this is
most likely to be filled in 1997."
