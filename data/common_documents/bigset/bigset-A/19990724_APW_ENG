<HEADLINE> Monitor Crew's Account of Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From an account of the Monitor's sinking in 1862, written by  
Francis Butts, a crew member: 
</P>
<P>
	``I went forward to the cabin and found the water just above the  
soles of my shoes, which indicated that there must be more than a 
foot in the vessel. I reported this to the captain and all hands 
were set to bailing -- bailing out the ocean, as it seemed -- but the 
object was to employ the men, as there now seemed to be danger of 
excitement among them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``... the Rhode Island (a vessel that had been towing the  
Monitor) ... now lay her whole length against us, floating off 
astern; but not a man would be the first to leave his ship, 
although the captain gave orders to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``(I) think I was the last person who saw Engineer S.A. Lewis as  
he lay seasick in his bunk, apparently watching the water as it 
grew deeper and deeper, and aware of what his fate must be. ... `Is 
there any hope?' he asked; and feeling a little moved at the scene, 
and knowing certainly what must be his end, and the darkness that 
stared at us all, I replied, `As long as there is life there is 
hope.' `Hope and hang on when you are wrecked,' is an old saying 
among sailors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain again gave orders for the men to leave the ship,  
and fifteen, all of whom were seamen and men whom I had placed my 
confidence upon, were the ones who crowded the first boat to leave 
the ship. I was disgusted at witnessing the scramble. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was half-past twelve ... when I stood on the forecastle of  
the Rhode Island, watching the red and white lights that hung from 
the pennant-staff above the turret, and which now and then were 
seen as we would perhaps both rise on the sea together, until at 
last, just as the moon had passed below the horizon, they were 
lost, and the Monitor, whose history is familiar to us all, was 
seen no more.''

<HEADLINE> New Marines Leader Wants More 'Fun' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By a reputation earned in 223 years as  
America's seafaring soldiers, Marines are tough. What troubles 
their new leader, Gen. James L. Jones, is that their lives can be 
tough, too -- too tough, considering that one of the military's 
biggest problems is keeping people in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus Jones is quick to assure his troops that while military  
service is demanding, it need not be grim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK to have fun in the Marine Corps,'' he told a group of  
straight-faced Marines in Stuttgart, Germany, at the outset of his 
inaugural troop tour shortly after becoming commandant July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fun for Jones means appreciating the unique rewards of military  
service, bonding with fellow Marines. And it means being allowed to 
do your duty without being burdened by overly rigid bureaucracy. It 
means getting field assignments -- like stabilizing the peace in 
Kosovo -- that make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	On that four-country trip Jones spelled out his top priorities:  
moving more Marines out of noncombat jobs into the fighting, or 
``operational,'' force; improving the quality of life for Marines 
and their families; and instilling more tolerance for mistakes 
while maintaining the Corps' high standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to allow people to grow, learn from their mistakes  
and tolerate those human imperfections,'' Jones said. ``I like to 
say we are an imperfect people working in an institution that tries 
to be perfect. That is a noble thing ..., but you have to realize 
there is no perfect. We're human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a Marine anti-terrorism unit in Naples, Italy, Jones  
said that in his four years as commandant, Marines will find 
themselves pulled through fewer ``knotholes.'' By that he meant 
that Marines will be able to advance their careers with fewer 
reviews and other stressful administrative demands. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants Marines to feel part of the ``ownership'' of the Corps,  
with a say and a stake in its future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing we do in the Marines is what you do,  
not what I do,'' he told a few dozen Marines in a maintenance 
shelter at Aviano Air Base in Italy, as pairs of F-16 fighters 
roared overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 55, got his dream job on the recommendation of Defense  
Secretary William Cohen, who has known Jones for two decades. Cohen 
made Jones his senior military assistant when he became defense 
chief in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of a person that I've encountered over the years  
who has more compassion for people and a greater willingness to 
understand the challenges that confront them than Jim Jones,'' 
Cohen said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he expects Jones, a 32-year Marine veteran, to press  
for evolutionary, not radical, change. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a Marine Corps that is working,'' the defense  
secretary said, thanks to predecessors like Gen. Charles Krulak, 
who retired as commandant in June after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Kansas City, Mo., Jones grew up in France where his  
father worked for International Harvester after leaving the Marine 
Corps. He returned to the United States for his senior year in high 
school and then attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign 
Service. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine 
Corps in 1967 and was sent to fight in Vietnam that same year. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander of an understrength rifle company in Vietnam in May  
1968 near Khe Sanh, Jones and his men made a heroic stand against a 
North Vietnamese onslaught that lasted 12 hours. For his valor in 
what he calls a ``definitive moment'' as a Marine, Jones was 
awarded the Silver Star Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a 12-hour period those Marines taught me more about what  
the Corps stands for than any other experience of my life,'' Jones 
said at his change-of-command ceremony in Washington on June 30. 
Members of that rifle company, some of whom he had not seen since 
Khe Sanh, attended the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	One goal of the new commandant is to lighten the load on Marines  
-- not lessen their training but loosen bureaucratic ropes that can 
make a Marine feel unappreciated, even unwanted. He wants to 
preserve what he calls the ``sheer joy'' of putting on a uniform, 
``knowing you are going to be doing great things that day, with 
great people, for a great cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not having fun then you're missing out on one of the  
intangible benefits that nobody else can duplicate -- not Xerox, not 
Boeing, not IBM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mention of U.S. high-tech companies was a sign of concern  
that the allure of higher paychecks in the private sector is making 
it harder to retain Marines and to attract new ones. Jones intends 
to keep more Marines in the ranks by liberating them from what he 
calls ``negative leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples:  
</P>
<P>
	--He recalls visiting a barracks in 1995 where newly minted  
Marines of the 2nd Division were received for their first 
assignment. After weeks of basic training and few freedoms, the 
Marines arrived on a Friday evening to discover that on their first 
weekend they would be denied off-base liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start right there with negative leadership,'' Jones told a  
group of Marines in Stuttgart as he recounted the episode. ``You 
don't trust them not to do something stupid. You've got to trust 
them. I'm big on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He intends to end announced troop inspections, a practice which  
he said made many Marines feel compelled to spend extra money out 
of their own pockets to buy ``inspection gear'' -- equipment and 
uniform gear kept in pristine condition for display at inspections 
but not otherwise used. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of announcing inspections in advance, commanders will  
perform no-notice inspections that will require Marines to show 
they are reasonably ready for action but not require perfection, 
Jones said. This will cut down on the time Marines spend preparing 
for inspections -- time often stolen from training.

<HEADLINE> Columbus 4, Dallas 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Cunningham had a goal and an assist  
as the Columbus Crew beat the Dallas Burn 4-1 in Major League 
Soccer Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham put Columbus up 2-0 after collecting a shot by Stern  
John that ricocheted off Dallas defender Eric Dade and shooting it 
past Burn goalkeeper Matt Jordan in the 42nd minute. It was his 
seventh goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 50th minute, Cunningham sent a cross at the top of the  
box to John, who scored on a left-foot shot to make it 3-0. Crew 
defender Mike Lapper also assisted on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ansil Elcock opened the scoring for the Crew off a corner kick  
by Robert Warzycha. Jason Farrell assisted on the play by heading 
the corner to Elcock, who headed it past Jordan in the 28th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian West put the Crew up 4-0 in the 71st minute off an assist  
by Brian Maisonneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Eck scored for Dallas in the 90th minute after Maisonneuve  
tried to head away a cross inside the box, but instead sent it to 
Eck. Eck put it past Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew outshot the Burn 17-10 and 9-5 in shots on goal.  
</P>
<P>
	The Crew scored a season-high four goals despite playing without  
forward Brian McBride, who played Saturday with the national team 
in a Confederations Cup game against New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus closed to within four points of D.C. United in the  
Eastern Conference.

<HEADLINE> Li Rebuts Chinese Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The once-elusive leader of a meditation group  
outlawed in China is emerging to defend himself from a Beijing 
propaganda assault, rebutting claims his teachings have driven 
people to suicide and threatened Chinese society. 
</P>
<P>
	Just months ago, requests for interviews with Li Hongzhi were  
declined by his loosely organized network of followers in New York, 
where the spiritual leader moved last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the communist government banned his Falun Gong  
movement this week and began detaining hundreds of protesters, Li 
has begun meeting with reporters at a follower's modest Manhattan 
apartment, furnished with a few chairs and a futon sofa. One wall 
is decorated with a collage of snapshots of Li teaching and 
diagrams of the yoga-like movements practiced in Falun Gong. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief interview Friday, Li calmly answered most questions  
with one- or two-sentence answers, showing little or no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed up opportunities to mend relations with Beijing,  
refusing to say whether he believes in communism and declining to 
urge his followers in China to stop protesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not ask them to go'' out into the streets, said Li,  
whose pressed blue suit, white shirt and tie made him look more 
like a businessman than a guru. ``I don't have any control over 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Li, 47, grew visibly agitated when asked to rebut recent  
allegations in China's state-run media that his teachings caused 
people to go insane, commit suicide or eschew medicine. One report 
claimed a man slit his stomach looking for his ``wheel of law,'' or 
miniature of the universe mentioned throughout Li's writings. 
</P>
<P>
	In an answer that lasted nearly five minutes, Li said he has  
never encouraged mentally unbalanced or severely ill people to give 
up medication or practice Falun Gong, which is too physically 
demanding for sick people. The spiritual practice involves a blend 
of Buddhism, Taoism, meditation and martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they die, Falun Gong would be blamed,'' Li said. ``But some  
people still want to practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is known publicly about Li gives few clues about how a  
junior high school graduate could in just a few years amass such a 
broad following. The group is estimated to have as many as 70 
million members worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Li joined the army at 18, and spent eight years working on a  
horse farm in northeastern China. Later, he was a trumpeter and a 
clerk at a government grain company. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning at a ``young age,'' Li said he studied Falun Gong with  
a spiritual master. ``Other people don't give much attention to 
spiritual cultivation. They go swimming or play ball in their free 
time,'' he said. ``I spent my time practicing spiritual 
cultivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong has been enormously popular, particularly among Li's  
own generation, which grew up in a spiritual void left by the 
radical politics of the Cultural Revolution and the materialistic 
era that has ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice emphasizes morality and improved physical health  
through spiritual teachings and qigong -- martial arts exercises 
practiced by tens of millions of Chinese every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its unauthorized status, the sect did not openly clash  
with the Communist Party until April 25. On that day, some 10,000 
believers emerged to surround the Beijing compound where top 
Chinese leaders live in a silent protest against what they said was 
official harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	As protests continued, the government began building a case  
against Li and eventually banned the group on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said he worries that the military might violently suppress  
recent protests, as they did 10 years ago during Beijing's 
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Busloads of people 
have been taken to detention the past three days in Beijing, where 
crowds have dwindled from hundreds of people to small groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said he was puzzled by the crackdown because the group has no  
political ambitions and poses no threat to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the government has treated Falun Gong over  
seriously,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Female Shuttle Chief Busy in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command an  
America n rocketship, Eileen Collins, has been so busy in orbit she 
hasn't had time to think about her new spot in space history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'll have to worry about history a little bit later,''  
Collins said Saturday from space shuttle Columbia. ``I'm just happy 
that we pulled this mission off. We still have a few more days, so 
the pressure isn't off yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Air Force colonel said she was ``extremely  
happy'' when she and her crew reached orbit Friday, but even 
happier when they sent the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory 
on its five-year voyage to search for black holes and peer at 
galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. 
</P>
<P>
	As a longtime astronomy buff, Collins said, ``I couldn't have  
asked for a better mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, now flying up to tens of thousands of miles higher than  
Columbia, remained in excellent shape. The first of five engine 
firings, needed to put the world's most powerful X-ray telescope in 
an orbit extending one-third of the way to the moon, was performed 
successfully late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In typical test pilot fashion, Collins downplayed the electrical  
problem that occurred five seconds after Columbia blasted off. A 
momentary short circuit knocked out the prime controllers on two of 
the shuttle's three main engines; backup controllers immediately 
kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins saw the flashing warning light in the cockpit and knew  
something was wrong. After being notified it was an electrical 
short, she felt ``very confident'' because she had practiced before 
the flight for just such a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	If another electrical system had shorted out, an engine could  
have shut down, Collins said. And that would have meant an 
emergency landing, something never attempted in 18 years of space 
shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has yet to determine what caused the short. Nevertheless,  
it is expected to have no impact on the rest of the five-day 
shuttle flight, said Randy Stone, director of mission operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers also are perplexed over the slightly premature cutoff  
of the main engines following liftoff, which left Columbia seven 
miles short of its intended orbit. They initially suspected an 
inadequate load of liquid oxygen, but now they're not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chandra on its own, the astronauts used a small ultraviolet  
telescope to observe other planets, tended to plant experiments, 
and practiced shuttle maneuvers to be used during a radar-mapping 
mission in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins took time out for TV interviews, as did Cady Coleman, an  
Air Force lieutenant colonel who prepared Chandra for release and 
pushed the ejection button. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman had a small pink ribbon, a symbol of breast cancer  
research, pinned to her shirt. She said before the flight she 
wanted to draw attention to the disease given that this was ``a 
women's mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two women -- who are flying with three men -- said their  
high-profile roles aboard Columbia hopefully will show young girls 
that they, too, can do anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is, if you have a dream and you want to reach for  
the stars, so to speak, you can do it. But it's going to take a lot 
of hard work,'' Collins said. ``I've worked my whole life to get up 
here in space and as I look out the windows ... I feel like it's 
all paying off.''

<HEADLINE> Gooden Misses Game With Migraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dwight Gooden had a migraine before the game.  
Cleveland's pitching staff had one during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mark Langston and Paul Assenmacher were shelled by the New  
York Yankees in Saturday's 21-1 loss, Indians manager Mike Hargrove 
brought back Tom Candiotti, who started Friday night and was 
knocked out after 1 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, bypassed Friday in favor of the knuckleballer, was  
unavailable Saturday because of a pregame migraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got up this morning, I felt fine,'' Gooden said, ``But  
when I got to the ballpark, I could feel it coming on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden had been looking forward to pitching against his former  
team and close friend David Cone, who was coming off a perfect 
game. He missed another chance to pitch against the Yankees because 
of the migraine medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stuff they gave me pretty much knocked me out,'' Gooden  
said. ``I feel better now, but I'm still a little light-headed. I 
think with a night's sleep, I'll be ready for tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Gooden's absence, the ERA's of Cleveland pitchers soared.  
</P>
<P>
	Langston (4.98) allowed nine runs -- seven earned -- and 10 hits  
in 4 1-3 innings, and Assenmacher (8.02) gave up seven runs and six 
hits in 1 1-3 innings. Candiotti (7.32) allowed five runs and four 
hits in two-third of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in the series, Candiotti has been tagged for 10 runs and  
10 hits in 2 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doc got a migraine before the game that put everyone in a  
bind,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``We had to patch it 
together as best we could. He would have been the first one in 
there.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Ace Martinez Placed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez, who leads the  
majors in wins and the American League in strikeouts, was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list Saturday with a sore right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, retroactive to Monday, came a day after an MRI showed  
swelling in two muscles behind Martinez's rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 15-3 with a 2.51 ERA, missed his scheduled start  
Friday at Detroit after complaining he couldn't loosen up during 
his worst start of the season last Sunday against Florida. He 
lasted just 3 2-3 innings against the Marlins, allowing 12 hits and 
a career-worst nine runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said his problem might have stemmed from overthrowing  
in the All-Star Game, when he started at Fenway Park and struck out 
five of the six batters he faced to earn MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez has 187 strikeouts in 136 1-3 innings. He made 172  
consecutive scheduled starts before he was scratched Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Martinez is devastating for the struggling Red Sox,  
who have dropped six of eight and 11 of 15 to fall into third place 
in the AL East. Boston entered Saturday's games seven games behind 
the Yankees and a game back of Toronto in the wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is eligible to return Aug. 3. His roster spot was taken  
by left-hander Mark Guthrie, activated from the disabled list after 
an injury rehab stint with Triple-A Pawtucket.

<HEADLINE> Canada Takes Gymastics Gold From US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Silver medals in team gymnastics could  
not have felt more different for the U.S. women and men at the Pan 
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's competition began with Erinn Dooley pitching forward  
and falling face first to the mat on her balance beam dismount. It 
ended with Jeanette Antolin slipping off the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a lot of bright moments in between for the U.S. women  
Saturday, just not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada claimed the Pan Ams gold before a small but vocal  
pro-Canadian crowd at Winnipeg Arena. The United States, which had 
been favored, was done in by its mistakes and settled for the 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not 100 percent prepared,'' U.S. coach Mary Lee Tracy  
said. ``We were doing some new skills, not to mention the world 
championships to think about. But those are excuses. Basically, we 
got beat. They hit more than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While second was a disappointment for the women, it was a  
satisfying achievement for the U.S. men, a relatively inexperienced 
group that finished behind Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's their world championship team. We haven't selected that  
yet,'' U.S. coach Mark Williams said. ``Some of these guys are 
going to be on that team. This was a great experience to get them 
ready for those trials. I'm very pleased with our performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada won the women's title with 148.944 points. The United  
States had 148.364 and Brazil took the bronze with 147.639. Canada 
also won the Pan Am gold in 1979, the only other year the United 
States failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't come in here saying we had to beat the Americans,''  
Canada's Michelle Conway said. ``Our goal was to hit all our events 
and where it placed us, that's where it placed us. We would just 
see what happened. We did that and it paid off for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Yvonne Tousek was the top performer with an all-around  
score of 37.511. Morgan White, at 16 the youngest member of the 
U.S. team, was second at 37.330. 
</P>
<P>
	White and teammates Jennie Thompson (37.230) and Jamie  
Dantzscher (37.061) qualified for the all-around competition Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely didn't turn out the way we wanted,'' Thompson  
said. ``We were coming out here looking to win. But it's a long 
season, we have a long road ahead of us. We want to get ready for 
the world championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson recovered after falling off the balance beam and posted  
the top U.S. scores in the three other events: floor exercise, 
vault and uneven bars. She earned the highest single-event score of 
the day, a 9.7 with a crowd-pleasing floor exercise done to a 
boogie piano rendition of Chuck Berry's ``Johnny B. Goode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My second pass was new for me, and I was really excited about  
that,'' Thompson said. ``It felt strong. I love doing floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with its early spills, the United States held a slight lead  
over Canada when each had one competitor remaining: Conway on the 
beam and Antolin on the bars. Antolin scored 8.912 after her slip. 
Moments later, Conway hit her landing to a rousing ovation and was 
given a 9.387. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and teammates quickly mobbed Conway as the Canadian fans  
stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to stick it,'' said Conway, who trains in North  
York, Ontario, near Toronto. ``We have a saying in my gym: Own the 
beam, own the meet. If you stick the beam, you're set. I knew I had 
to stick to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came off ... my teammates came over and then I looked  
and saw all those people cheering and thought, `Oh, we won.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba won the men's gold in a runaway, compiling 222.375 points  
and posting the top three individual all-around scores. The United 
States had 216.00 points and Canada 215.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The only disappointment for Williams was that Cuba competed in a  
different round than his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been nice to have competed at the same time with  
them and see what would have happened,'' Williams said. ``As it 
was, we never even saw the Cubans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Dukta had the top overall score for the Americans at  
53.575. He and teammate Stephen McCain (53.40) both qualified for 
Sunday night's all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal coming out was to hit all my routines and do the best  
job I could for the team,'' Dutka said. ``Getting to the all-around 
really wasn't part of my thinking. I just wanted to hit my sets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Eric Lopez had the top all-around score, 56.775. He was  
followed by teammates Adonis Vazquez (54.20) and Lazaro Lamelas 
(54.100). Saturday's scores are not carried over to Sunday's 
competition.

<HEADLINE> Caroline Kennedy Waves To Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The intensely private Caroline Kennedy, thrust  
into a public moment Friday outside her brother's memorial Mass, 
rolled down her limousine window to oblige a throng of strangers 
with a stoic smile and a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The recipients of her brief salute honored her, in turn, with a  
small burst of applause and a tide of enthusiastic waves in her 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a real lady,'' said Eva Wiener, 70.  
</P>
<P>
	The spectators were aware of the significance of the moment:  
They were in the presence of the last remaining member of the 
family that resided in the White House until President Kennedy was 
assassinated in November 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Ancona, 55, a New York teacher, considers herself a child  
of the 1960s who grew up, in a way, with the Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she smiled and waved, I was just blown away,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Dixon, 42, an accountant, held a small American flag on a  
wooden stick as Ms. Kennedy passed en route to a post-service 
reception, capping what he described as a ``wrenching experience 
this past week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much has been said about Ms. Kennedy's penchant for privacy --  
she spelled out a legal argument for it in a 1995 book she 
co-authored and titled, ``The Right to Privacy'' -- and her role in 
planning her brother's private burial at sea and the private 
memorial Mass in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	She remained isolated with her husband and her three children in  
their Long Island home for most of the week after John F. Kennedy 
Jr.'s plane crashed into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of that, the crowd outside the church found comfort in  
Ms. Kennedy's wave. They saw it as a sign that the Kennedys knew 
they were grieving, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family,'' said Pearl Higgins of Kearny, N.J., with a nod  
of satisfaction, ``was glad we're here.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Unveiling New Air Quality Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revamping a 2-decade-old system, the  
Environmental Protection Agency is issuing a new air quality index 
that gives more detailed health warnings on the harms of air 
pollution and ways people can protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was announcing the new index today at a  
groundbreaking for a children's hospital in New York City. He said 
a category added to the chart would particularly benefit children 
with asthma and others with special respiratory conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new air quality index is a critical tool Americans need to  
protect their health,'' Gore said in prepared remarks. ``It will 
empower parents and communities to protect children, particularly 
the 6 million children who suffer from asthma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air quality index is used by local weather forecasters and  
others to gauge the health effects of air pollution on a given day. 
Pollution measurements are divided into ranges and a health 
advisory is given based on the day's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current standards have not been updated since their  
introduction in 1976 and are not always used consistently, 
according to the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised model is aimed at providing a uniform nationwide  
format that weather forecasters can use to relay information about 
when air pollution poses a health risk and what precautions people 
can take. The index looks at five major air pollutants: smog, soot, 
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in the levels of any or all of these pollutants can  
shift the health protection warning for that day. For example, if 
the index indicates moderate air quality, people who are unusually 
sensitive to pollution are advised to limit their outdoor activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The updated chart adds a new warning for when air quality might  
be unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as children and adults with 
respiratory problems, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also was using the event to urge Congress to pass the  
administration's $68 million plan to attack childhood asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money -- $50 million -- would be used for competitive  
state grants to identify and treat poor children served by Medicaid 
who have asthma. The initiative would help schools educate children 
and parents on how to avoid attacks, support research into 
environmental hazards and pay for a public information campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mission To Salvage Civil War Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OFF CAPE HATTERAS, N.C. (AP) -- The last time Bernie Denny plied  
these waters, he was more than a half-century younger and dodging 
German U-boats aboard a Navy transport loaded with explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was April of '42, when they were at their best,'' the  
Virginia Beach man says. 
</P>
<P>
	This day, Denny is heading out into the Atlantic again, aboard a  
38-foot fishing boat called the Lucky Chip. Northeast winds have 
lashed the North Carolina coast for three straight days, and the 
crashing of 4-foot swells nearly topples Denny, now 79, a retired 
airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one miles out, the fishing boat pulls alongside the Navy  
salvage vessel USS Grasp -- a ship bristling with booms and winches, 
not guns. Heavy rain pelts Denny's close-cropped white head as he 
steps gingerly off the Lucky Chip's gunwale on an upward swell, 
grabs the rope ladder and hauls himself aboard the larger vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	He has come for a rendezvous with a piece of naval history not  
his own. He has reached the watery grave of the ironclad USS 
Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Tin can on a shingle,'' they called the Union Navy's dark and  
strange-looking fighting ship. ``Cheesebox on a raft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the derisive names contemporaries hurled, Lt. Cmdr.  
Eric Anderson, the Grasp's skipper, knows the significance of the 
rusted skeleton lying 240 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Monitor is the grandfather of all warships,'' says  
Anderson, a 33-year-old first-time commander from Shelby in the 
shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains. ``I mean, our modern Navy 
historically can trace its roots right back to the Monitor and the 
Merrimack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Monitor met the Merrimack -- the Confederate ironclad also  
known as the CSS Virginia -- only once, on March 9, 1862. It was the 
first clash between steam-powered, iron ships. Although the 
four-hour confrontation ended in a draw, it changed forever the 
course of naval combat. 
</P>
<P>
	On New Year's Eve, 1862, Mother Nature achieved what the  
Merrimack could not. 
</P>
<P>
	Under tow and headed for resupply, the Monitor ran into a gale  
with 20-foot seas and 30-knot winds. She foundered, taking 16 
crewmen to the bottom in a place that has come to be known as the 
``Graveyard of the Atlantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There she lay until 1973, when Duke University researchers  
discovered her lying upside down, balanced on her distinctive 
turret. In an otherwise barren stretch of sandy bottom, the 
172-foot-long wreck has become a home for sponges, barnacles, and 
soft and hard corral. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter century after her rediscovery, Anderson and his crew  
have come to create a video layout of the wreck for the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Researchers hope the 
information will help in the recovery of the turret and the 
Monitor's unique engine before the rusting ship collapses. 
</P>
<P>
	An old salt named Bernie Denny will be helping them -- and  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Down in the officers' ward room aboard the Grasp, Denny  
confesses that the high-seas transfer has shaken him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sea legs are shot,'' he tells John Broadwater, manager of  
the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary. ``It made me feel like a 
fool. It made me feel O-O-OLD.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind what he's been through to get there. Never mind that  
just a few months ago, he was lying in a hospital bed wishing for 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife of 47 years, Irene, had died in November. And during a  
Christmas visit with his daughter in Texas, Denny's appendix 
ruptured. His kidneys shut down, he suffered a mini-stroke and 
developed a blood clot on his lung. He lost 44 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was a man who joined the merchant marine at 17 and  
spent time in a Fascist prison for running supplies to the Spanish 
loyalists; who hunted Nazi subs as a crew chief on Navy torpedo 
bombers; who took part in the Berlin Airlift in 1948-49 and later 
flew every plane in Pan Am's fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to make this thing or fall off and drown,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he has a purpose.  
</P>
<P>
	In the ward room, skipper Anderson hovers over a black,  
barrel-shaped object glued to a flat panel. It is a wooden mockup 
of the one-sixteenth scale working model Denny made of John 
Ericsson's idiosyncratic Monitor engine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a weird, weird piece of machinery, it is,'' says Denny,  
who collected single-cylinder boat engines as a young man and never 
lost the passion. ``You've got to be a machine person to appreciate 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows exactly what the Monitor engine looked like, so  
Denny cobbled together his design using plans from later models. 
When the folks at the Mariner's Museum in Newport News, Va., found 
out that their star volunteer had a Monitor engine in his garage, 
Denny had his ticket onto the surveying team. 
</P>
<P>
	The model is important in helping guide divers to what they need  
to know, what they might encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Navy divers brought up a prize -- the Monitor's  
propeller. This year's quarry is answers: Is the engine still 
attached to the hull? Can it be recovered? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting information,'' says Broadwater. ``That's our  
stock in trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In the greenish glow of the Grasp's bridge, a laptop displays a  
chart of Diamond Shoals and the Monitor's coordinates -- 35 
degrees/00 minutes/06.8 seconds North; 075 degrees/24 minutes/23.3 
seconds West. 
</P>
<P>
	Those coordinates are why the Monitor went down -- and why she  
remains there. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck site is where the Gulf Stream skirts the mainland  
before heading out to sea. It is where the cobalt-blue Gulf waters 
meet the green, nutrient-rich Labrador currents. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Art Kirchner out of Hatteras, the first person to run  
charter dives to the Monitor, remembers one incident when the two 
collided. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could actually see the wall of green water coming at  
you,'' he says, his eyes widening. ``The temperature dropped 11 
degrees in a matter of seconds..'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this late June day, the 225-foot-long Grasp sits almost  
placidly at its mooring, where four orange buoys mark the spot 
where the Monitor went down. The ARS-50-class ship has 40,000 
pounds of bottled gas, 21,000 cubic feet of salvage storage space 
and a lift capacity of 300 tons. It was the lead ship in the 
salvaging of wreckage from TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, N.Y., 
and last week took part in the search for the John F. Kennedy Jr.'s 
missing airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the swells, four 8,000-pound anchors hold the Grasp  
steady. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	After a lunch of chili-mac spicy enough to strip paint off the  
ship's hull, Anderson heads to the aft deck to prepare for his 
dive. 
</P>
<P>
	On deck, muscular men wait in the rain to suit up the divers.  
Most wear khaki shorts and blue T-shirts with inscriptions such as 
``Navy Divers -- the men your wife dreams about'' and ``Fly Navy -- 
we need the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coiled behind the men are the divers' ``umbilicals,'' licorice  
twists of colored hoses. Yellow is air; red is communications; blue 
is a pneumofathometer for depth readings; a thick black hose 
circulates 120-degree water through the dive suits; thin black is 
power for helmet lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	On the port side, away from the action, Chief Petty Officer  
Michael Jones lands two shimmering yellow-blue mahi-mahi in quick 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey chief!'' Anderson calls. ``No fair fishing while I'm stuck  
in the chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Anderson and the other divers suit up, Master Diver Scott  
Heineman conducts an opera in grunts and shouts. A laminated 
checklist is his libretto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any dives in the last 12 hours? Aches? Pains? Medication?  
False teeth? Contact lenses?'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the crew: ``Any problems -- solve it!''  
</P>
<P>
	The yellow-helmeted divers move to a metal stage suspended from  
a thick cable. They face away from each other as Heineman gives the 
hand signal to hoist them up and over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadwater waves as the divers slowly disappear. Denny captures  
the scene on video. 
</P>
<P>
	When the divers reach 20 feet, they switch to a bottom mix of 14  
percent oxygen and 86 percent helium -- because oxygen becomes toxic 
after 130 feet. Men who went into the water talking like John Wayne 
now sound like Donald Duck. 
</P>
<P>
	Every few seconds, the communications officer checks on them.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK red?''  
</P>
<P>
	``OK red.''  
</P>
<P>
	``OK green?''  
</P>
<P>
	``OK green.''  
</P>
<P>
	``OK both divers,'' the radio man shouts.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK BOTH DIVERS,'' the crew echoes.  
</P>
<P>
	All is professionalism on deck. The phrase ``cuss like a  
sailor'' has no meaning here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't use profanity on the dive site,'' says Engineman  
Chief Will Rubow. ``It's all kind of like `Mr. Rogers' 
Neighborhood.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The descent takes seven minutes, leaving only about 20 minutes  
of bottom time. Anderson, the ``red diver,'' moves out with a video 
camera and walks the 30 or so feet to the Monitor's pockmarked 
armor belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Visibility is just 10 feet as sand and marine life course toward  
the camera lens in a snowstorm effect, played topside on a small 
monitor. The images are scored by the constant ``suck-gurgle, 
suck-gurgle'' of Anderson's breathing apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
	His mission is to climb onto the wreck and work his way into the  
engine room, one of the only parts of the hull that still has most 
of its plating intact. But the unpredictable current has picked up, 
and he can't get enough slack on his umbilical. 
</P>
<P>
	The voice change makes it hard to understand what Anderson is  
saying. Heineman grabs the twin stopwatches dangling at his sides 
like a gunfighter drawing his pistols from their holsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has just enough time to lay a hand on the scarred  
turret before Heineman orders him back to the stage to give ``green 
diver'' Andrew McKaskle a shot. McKaskle reaches the wreck but 
can't find anything to crawl up on. 
</P>
<P>
	Heineman: ``Green diver, you think you'll be able to get  
anything done in the next two minutes?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKaskle: ``That's a negative topside.''  
</P>
<P>
	Heineman to Broadwater: ``Anything you want him to do just while  
he's standing there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadwater: ``If he heads to the right, the slope is down and he  
could probably just get up and pan, but that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heineman: ``Tell both divers to return to the stage.''  
</P>
<P>
	The divers ascend to 120, then stop for several minutes to begin  
decompression and purge the gases from their bloodstream. The next 
stop is 90 feet, then every 10 feet until they reach 40. They're 
facing each other now, watching for signs of oxygen toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
	At 40 feet, the divers are switched to 100 percent oxygen for 10  
minutes, then brought quickly up to the surface. Like a pit crew at 
the Indy 500, four sailors each swarm the divers in a scramble to 
strip them to their shorts and get them into the decompression 
chamber within five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The divers will spend the next hour and a half in the cramped  
chamber -- a three-hour bill for 20 minutes in nature's domain. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It would be several more days before conditions improved enough  
for divers to explore the Monitor's bowels. After his frustrating 
first dive, Anderson finally reached the hulk. 
</P>
<P>
	He climbed under the armor belt and looked up into the engine  
room. The encrusted machine has fallen loose but still appears to 
be intact -- and recoverable. 
</P>
<P>
	He also explored the 120-ton turret, which has filled with silt  
and sand, burying the duffle bags the frantic sailors stowed there 
as they tried to save the doomed ship. Visibility that day was 50 
feet, and he could clearly see three indentations where the 
Merrimack's guns pounded -- but could not penetrate -- the Monitor's 
iron skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson felt them with his own hand.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen photos showing those dents since I was a little kid,  
and it was amazing to be actually on the wreck,'' Anderson says via 
cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on the mainland, the people at the Mariner's Museum fill  
Denny in on the mission's successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just drooled,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Broadwater has promised to come by soon with video and photos of  
the engine. And Denny dreams of someday laying his own hands on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would mean an awful lot,'' he says. ``It would just mean  
you've got a piece of history.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Visits Baseball Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush paid tribute  
Saturday to Hall of Fame inductee Nolan Ryan, who pitched his final 
major league years for a team Bush partly owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate, appearing at a news  
conference with Ryan before Sunday's induction ceremony, said the 
two share the same values -- ``faith and family and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the three most important things in life,'' said  
Bush, who sold his share of the Texas Rangers last year. ``I may 
not be as hard a worker as he is, but I work hard and I understand 
the importance of discipline and focus as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who has campaigned for Bush in his Texas races, retired in  
1993 after five seasons with the Rangers. He said Bush, part of the 
group that purchased a majority share of the club in 1989, ``paid 
me extremely well'' as a Rangers owner. But, Ryan said, ``now he 
doesn't pay me at all'' for serving as a Bush-appointed member of a 
state commission on parks and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was dressed comfortably in a polo shirt, and Bush wore a  
suit and tie on a humid summer day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference in our dress,'' Bush joked, ``is someone who  
doesn't need work and someone who's looking for work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a night in the governor's mansion in Albany, Bush drove  
Saturday to Cooperstown with New York Gov. George Pataki, who has 
been mentioned as a possible running mate if Bush wins the 
Republican nomination for the 2000 election. They were attending a 
Bush campaign fund-raiser in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush planned to be in the audience during Sunday's induction  
festivities at baseball's shrine, and Pataki was to offer welcoming 
remarks. Bush later was heading for a few days' relaxation at the 
Kennebunkport, Maine, summer home of his parents, former President 
Bush and his wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki said he and Bush ``talked a lot about baseball'' Friday  
night in Albany. But Pataki also said: ``When you get two governors 
together, you always talk a little policy and politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he refused to elaborate. ``This is a weekend about  
baseball,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Monitor Crew's Account of Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From an account of the Monitor's sinking in 1862, written by  
Francis Butts, a crew member: 
</P>
<P>
	``I went forward to the cabin and found the water just above the  
soles of my shoes, which indicated that there must be more than a 
foot in the vessel. I reported this to the captain and all hands 
were set to bailing -- bailing out the ocean, as it seemed -- but the 
object was to employ the men, as there now seemed to be danger of 
excitement among them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``... the Rhode Island (a vessel that had been towing the  
Monitor) ... now lay her whole length against us, floating off 
astern; but not a man would be the first to leave his ship, 
although the captain gave orders to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``(I) think I was the last person who saw Engineer S.A. Lewis as  
he lay seasick in his bunk, apparently watching the water as it 
grew deeper and deeper, and aware of what his fate must be. ... `Is 
there any hope?' he asked; and feeling a little moved at the scene, 
and knowing certainly what must be his end, and the darkness that 
stared at us all, I replied, `As long as there is life there is 
hope.' `Hope and hang on when you are wrecked,' is an old saying 
among sailors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain again gave orders for the men to leave the ship,  
and fifteen, all of whom were seamen and men whom I had placed my 
confidence upon, were the ones who crowded the first boat to leave 
the ship. I was disgusted at witnessing the scramble. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was half-past twelve ... when I stood on the forecastle of  
the Rhode Island, watching the red and white lights that hung from 
the pennant-staff above the turret, and which now and then were 
seen as we would perhaps both rise on the sea together, until at 
last, just as the moon had passed below the horizon, they were 
lost, and the Monitor, whose history is familiar to us all, was 
seen no more.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Pleads Guilty to Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- With jurors seemingly deadlocked on  
assault charges against him, a one-time junior welterweight 
champion pleaded guilty to punching a police officer during a 
street brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Murray, 30, who won the IBF junior welterweight title in  
1993, will get three years' probation at his sentencing on Sept. 
10, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of second-degree assault, he could have drawn two  
to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and resisting  
arrest, both misdemeanors. The plea came Friday night as jurors 
were in their ninth hour of deliberations. After five hours, they 
had told the judge they were split on Murray's fate but were 
ordered to resume talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray insisted he was a target of excessive force by police and  
was defending himself when he allegedly hit officer Michael 
Nicholls in the face during a street fight last July. Nicholls' 
wound required 11 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had arrived to break up a fight involving about 150  
adults and children. The first officers tried to disperse the fight 
using pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Murray was trying to break up the fight too and  
was struck on the head with a nightstick by an officer before he 
punched Nicholls. Murray said he reacted instinctively because he 
thought Nicholls was going to douse him with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time in four years that Murray had been  
charged because of an altercation outside the boxing ring. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1994, he was arrested and later convicted of  
third-degree assault after a fight with another man in a pickup 
basketball game. He also was twice cleared of charges after being 
arrested in two domestic disputes.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Bailey for $9.64M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Champ Bailey signed a  
five-year, $9.64 million contract with the Washington Redskins on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey will also receive a $5.2 million signing bonus and has  
additional incentives up to $2.56 million. The cornerback is 
expected to report to the team's opening day of training camp 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He played offense and defense in college and has expressed a  
desire to do likewise in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big relief to get it over with and got it done on  
time,'' Bailey said Saturday at Redskins Park after being 
introduced by new team owner Daniel Snyder. ``I'm glad to be a 
Redskin. Obviously, if you miss any time in training camp, you're 
going to be set back. So I'm very happy to be here for the start of 
camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins coach Norv Turner expressed relief to have Bailey for  
opening day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time he came here in May until mid-July, Champ has  
done a good job in our offseason program,'' Turner said. ``He did a 
great job in our mini-camps and got himself ready. There are very, 
very, very few rookies who are successful if they miss any part of 
training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, a 6-1, 181-pounder, played cornerback and wide receiver  
for Georgia. Defensively, he made 52 tackles, including 30 solos 
and four for losses, with three interceptions and seven pass 
deflections. He returned 12 kickoffs for 261 yards (21.8 average) 
and four punts for 49 yards (12.3). 
</P>
<P>
	As a wide receiver, Bailey had 47 receptions for 744 yards (15.8  
average) and five touchdowns. He also rushed for 84 yards on 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I have goals,'' Bailey said. ``I want to be Rookie  
of the Year. ``But my main goal is to help this team get into the 
playoffs, which hasn't happened for a while. I'm just going to go 
out and do what Coach Turner wants me to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said Bailey won't initially be asked to play on both  
sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it from a standpoint of getting excited about  
having a talented guy who can make a difference in the game, we're 
going to do whatever Champ's capable of doing in terms of him 
helping us somewhere down the road offensively,'' Turner said. ``We 
will not even consider that until he's comfortable in playing at a 
high level as a corner.''

<HEADLINE> Paul Mellon Gifts To Be Exhibited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gifts from the late Paul Mellon, made over  
most of this century, will go on exhibit Nov. 7 at the National 
Gallery of Art, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will include the original wax model of the ``Little  
Dancer Fourteen Years Old'' -- one of 73 items in a trust disclosed 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon died Feb. 1 at 91. His father, Treasury Secretary Andrew  
Mellon, was among the gallery's founders and a major donor in his 
own right. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 paintings, sculptures and prints, contributed by Paul  
Mellon over his lifetime, will appear in the memorial show. The 
list has not been completed, said Patricia O'Connell, a gallery 
spokeswoman, but works will appear by British, French and American 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the show from the last gift is ``White Poodle in a  
Punt'' by George Stubbs, a British painter of animals. His pictures 
of horses were favorites of Mellon, who bred a Kentucky Derby 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dancer has been cast in bronze and reproduced many  
times. One copy went for $11,882,500 at a New York auction three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only version ... Degas himself every touched or  
saw,'' said Alison Luchs, a sculpture curator at the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Degas did the statue about 1880. He adorned it with hair and an  
orange-yellow bodice, which is still there, although the short tutu 
-- the standard ballet dancer's skirt -- has worn out over the years 
and had to be replaced. In earlier centuries many statues wore 
actual clothes, but it was an odd idea in Degas' own time. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon's last gift included 29 wax models by Degas, four in  
bronze and four in plaster. Many of these sculptures -- including 
some of his favorite subjects such as dancers, women bathing and 
horses -- turned up at a foundry after his death in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit will run through next February, with no admission  
charge.

<HEADLINE>  More Members of China Sect Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's campaign to vanquish an outlawed  
meditation sect intensified Saturday, with police rounding up more 
followers attempting to protest the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, Falun Gong members claimed protesters were  
attempting to converge on Beijing. But there were few signs of any 
activity inside the city as temperatures soared to 105 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing's Beihai Park, near the Zhongnanhai compound where  
China's leaders live and work, a group of about 30 Falun Gong 
members was surrounded and detained by police. 
</P>
<P>
	The government banned the group on Thursday after several days  
of silent protests near Zhongnanhai. Since the protests began on 
Tuesday, police have been rounding up Falun Gong adherents 
attempting to protest the crackdown on the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Most would-be demonstrators were forced to board buses and sent  
home, Civil Affairs Ministry officials said. Police recorded the 
names, addresses and employers of those detained and sent them back 
to their homes, reports on the World Wide Web said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact number of protesters could not be confirmed. However,  
apart from a few scuffles between police and protesters, detentions 
in Beijing and other cities have appeared to involve little 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, dozens of Falun Gong members performed their  
daily meditation Saturday in front of the Chinese Embassy to 
protest the round-up of believers half a world away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop arresting innocent practitioners,'' and ``We believe in  
truth, compassion, tolerance,'' read signs ringing the protest 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Later at a press conference, sect members from around North  
America said they feared for the safety and well-being of those 
arrested in China. The Chinese government's description of the 
group as a cult, they said, is a ``misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sect's clash with authorities began on April 25, when 10,000  
believers surrounded the Beijing compound where top Chinese leaders 
live to silently protest what they called official harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has clamped down on all forms of public protest,  
fearing they could catalyze public anger over rising unemployment 
and rampant corruption. Controls have become especially tight as 
China prepares for celebrations Oct. 1 to mark 50 years of 
communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, draws from Buddhism,  
Taoism, meditation and martial arts. It emphasizes morality and 
improved physical health through spiritual teachings and qigong -- 
martial arts exercises practiced by tens of millions of Chinese 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has declared Li Hongzhi, who founded the sect in  
1992 and now lives in New York, an ``evil person,'' describing his 
teachings as a menace to society and his group a would-be political 
organization that dared to challenge Communist Party authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The movement, estimated to have as many as 70 million followers  
inside China, has disavowed any political motives or connections 
with pro-democracy dissident groups. However, human rights groups 
rushed to voice their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scope and intensity of the campaign against Falun Gong  
attest to a new high tide of repression in China,'' Xiao Qiang, 
executive director of Human Rights in China said in a statement 
released Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cherokees Elect New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) -- Members of the nation's second-largest  
Indian tribe voted out a chief on Saturday whose tenure was marred 
by months of turmoil within the tribal government, according to 
unofficial returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenger Chad Smith received 7,197 votes, or 56 percent, to  
incumbent Joe Byrd's 5,550 votes, or 44 percent, with all precincts 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's tenure saw coffers of the 200,000-member Cherokee nation  
slide from a $3.4 million surplus to a projected $18 million 
deficit. Byrd administration officials countered that the chief 
inherited a $1.3 million deficit and has reduced it to less than 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're humbled, we're honored and we're going to have to take  
into consideration the very solemn charge the Cherokee people have 
put on our shoulders,'' Smith said. ``The turmoil is over. The 
healing begins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd comforted supporters, some in tears.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a load off my shoulders. I'm not sure President  
Clinton went through as much as I did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's runoff followed a May primary in which Byrd received  
32 percent of the vote and Smith gained 19 percent, with the 
remainder split among seven other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	About 26,000 of the Cherokees are registered voters. Only about  
half of them voted in the primary. Smith estimated a 20 percent to 
30 percent drop in voter turnout from the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal member Pamela Bacon said mudslinging by both sides kept  
voters away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to settle anything, no matter who  
wins,'' said Bacon, who wouldn't say who she voted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations of misspending have overshadowed much of Byrd's  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 audit by the U.S. Department of Interior found the tribe  
had improperly charged the government $88,000 for legal services 
and transferred $16.1 million in federal money to its operating 
fund without proof the transfers were reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	Turmoil started in February 1997 when Byrd fired tribal marshals  
who executed a search warrant for financial documents tied to a 
criminal investigation of his office. His supporters on the tribal 
council later impeached the three tribunal justices, and lawsuits 
and federal probes followed. 
</P>
<P>
	That summer, Smith was arrested as he tried to stop Byrd's  
administration from closing the tribal courthouse, and a crowd 
clashed on the steps a month later when two rival groups of tribal 
marshals fought over its control. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 45, ran television ads showing Smith being wrestled to the  
ground by a deputy and urged voters to choose ``responsible 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a 48-year-old lawyer, said he would provide the tribe  
with honest leadership, promote culture and improve health care. He 
called upon voters to remove Byrd ``while there's still time to 
save our nation.''

<HEADLINE> Ray's Approval Wins Carey at 20-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ray's Approval, a 20-1 shot, nosed out Stay Sound  
to capture the $150,000 Robert F. Carey Memorial Handicap on the 
turf at Hawthorne Racecourse on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's Approval, ridden by Early Fires, grabbed the early lead  
and stayed in front to the wire, covering the mile in 1:36. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse doesn't like the dirt,'' said Robert Irwin, trainer  
of Ray's Approval. ``The turf is his home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stay Sound, with Tony D'Amico aboard, finished strongly on the  
outside and was a neck better than favored Inkatha, who was closing 
fast at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I asked him to run, it was a little too late,'' D'Amico  
said. ``We just ran out of real estate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's Approval paid $41.20, $11.40 and $5, while Stay Sound  
returned $6.40 and $4, and Inkatha was worth $2.80.

<HEADLINE> Dennehy Gives Teacher Extra Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the gilded elegance of the Eugene O'Neill  
Theatre, the big man of Broadway is bringing down the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience can hardly contain itself, cheering and clapping in  
a frenzy of spontaneous applause. And the star hasn't even uttered 
his first line. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he will admit that he was momentarily unnerved by the raw  
adulation that swept the stage. But the most unnerving part of all 
was not that it was his first performance since winning a Tony 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	It was knowing who was watching from the eleventh row.  
</P>
<P>
	Snug in his spot in the orchestra seats -- best in the house --  
the teacher smiles. He doesn't yell ``Bravo!'' like everyone else, 
doesn't leap to his feet when the three-hour performance is over. 
He simply nods. And there's a glint of a tear in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to hand it to him,'' the teacher says, as his  
former student takes a final bow. ``He really learned his craft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later the two are backstage, locked in a tough-guy  
embrace. Brian Dennehy, star of ``Death of a Salesman,'' and his 
former football coach and drama teacher, Chris Sweeny, the man who 
yanked the big guy off the playing field, the man who inspired him 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
	At 60, Dennehy still has the hulking frame of a football player.  
It's easy to imagine the kid who swaggered on the field with such 
dramatic flair that Sweeny, tired of yelling about blocking 
tactics, ordered him to try out for Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, ``You got such a big mouth; let's put it to some  
use,''' Sweeny recalls, rolling his eyes as he relives the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1954. Fresh from the Air Force, Sweeny had been hired to  
coach football and teach English at Chaminade High School, a 
private Catholic school for boys in Mineola, N.Y. Asked to start a 
drama club, the young teacher turned to the students he knew best, 
the football players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a choice,'' Dennehy booms. ``Chris Sweeny was  
tough as nails. When he volunteered you for something, you didn't 
argue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny's eyes twinkle. At 69, he is tall and tan, with a  
thoughtful, authoritative air. He still has the commanding presence 
that inspired Dennehy and his classmates to brave the jeers of 
other jocks when they traded their football gear for tights. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was another reason that Sweeny singled out Dennehy.  
``What really interested me about Brian,'' Sweeny says in an 
exaggerated tone, ``was that he could be HEARD!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennehy roars. Sweeny's style never changes, not on the football  
field, not in the classroom, not in the dressing room of the man 
that Broadway has just crowned king. Always a performer. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you want to know how this guy got started,'' Sweeny begins,  
striking the perfect note of dreamy nostalgia, eyes gazing into the 
distance. ``It all began more than 40 years ago ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	His voice trails off, and the two men laugh. There are several  
versions of the story, embellished with age and artistic license. 
But it really comes down to two guys in love with theater who have 
taken very different routes to this glittering night on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Glittering it may be, but backstage, as accolades pour in from  
around the world and flowers arrive from David Letterman, the talk 
is of Chaminade, not Broadway. They remember Sweeny's first 
production, ``Pyramus and Thisby,'' the roar of the crowd when they 
performed at the annual Shakespearean competition at Hofstra 
University, the glory when they took the trophy home. Dennehy, 
decked out in black leggings and white rags and sporting an 
earsplitting grin, played a talking wall. He was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``We blew the place down,'' Dennehy says, face lighting up as if  
he can still hear the echo of those first ``encores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean people went crazy. They gave us the award, for sure.  
But it was more than winning. It was knockabout and farcical and 
hilarious and fun. It was what theater was all about. And, of 
course, I just got bitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny knew the feeling. He had been bitten himself years  
before, in the same gymnasium at Chaminade, when he played in a 
school production of ``Arsenic and Old Lace.'' He carried the 
feeling to Fordham University where he spent four years on a 
football scholarship and trained with Vince Lombardi, who was just 
starting as freshman coach. He carried it to the Air Force, where 
he organized an amateur theater group. He carried it back to 
Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, handsome, athletic, one of the few lay teachers in a  
strict Catholic school, Sweeny stood out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so articulate, so intelligent, so witty,'' Dennehy  
said. ``And he had this wonderful attitude toward life that 
anything was possible. I can't tell you how dazzled I was. And it 
wasn't just me, it was all of us. We couldn't wait to get to his 
classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny cuts him off with a gruff ``don't be such a wise guy.''  
But he doesn't say it too harshly. It's clear the actor's praise is 
more than just another polished line. 
</P>
<P>
	And it doesn't come just from Dennehy. From around the country  
Chaminade alumni join the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
	In University Place, Wash., retired executive Eugene Vorhies  
remembers the adolescent awkwardness of being 6 foot 6 inches, 
yearning to be involved in art and theater, yet ``trapped inside 
the body of a linebacker.'' Along came a teacher who showed him 
that he could do it all, and well. ``I've never told him this,'' 
Vorhies said, ``But I have felt grateful all my life that Chris 
Sweeny crossed my path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A physician in Chicago says the same thing, as do a physicist in  
New Mexico and a football coach in Indiana. Guys who hammed it up 
with Dennehy in ``Hope Is a Thing With Feathers'' and ``George 
Washington Slept Here'' and ``Macbeth.'' Guys who still remember 
Sweeny coaching them in speech and debate, pushing them to do 
better, yet never pushing too far. Four decades later, their voices 
fill with affection when they talk about a teacher who opened their 
mind to the idea that the arts, like athletics, could teach them 
more about themselves, to the idea that they could walk easily in 
both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny insists that it was the subjects that dazzled them, not  
the teacher. The same subjects had dazzled him. Especially theater. 
He couldn't get enough: the sets, the applause, the sheer joy of 
immersing himself in a character. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knew the perils. He couldn't have made any money at  
acting, couldn't have supported his family, didn't want to subject 
them to that kind of risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was make-believe,'' Sweeny says, a tinge of regret in his  
shrug. ``It was a hobby. It could never be anything more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reality was that his $3,500 salary at Chaminade wasn't  
enough either, not to support a wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
	So Sweeny gave up acting and he gave up teaching and headed to  
Wall Street, where he made a lot of money selling bonds. He was 
there for 35 years. He became a great salesman. And the best master 
of ceremonies the street had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennehy headed to Wall Street, too, but he didn't stay long. The  
parade of suits scared him more than the insecurity of the stage. 
So he chucked his selling job and went to work driving trucks and 
taxis, acting in small productions wherever he could. 
</P>
<P>
	They stayed in touch over the years, the teacher and the  
student: school reunions, funerals. Occasionally, Sweeny would 
watch Dennehy perform in local theaters. Small parts. He doesn't 
remember their names. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, in the 1970s, they ran into each other in a restaurant on  
Long Island. They spent the night talking: about acting and 
teaching, about families and sacrifice. In his 30s, Dennehy hadn't 
yet found the fame that would eventually come with movies like 
``Cocoon'' and ``Silverado'' and ``Gorky Park''. Back then, it 
wasn't clear that he would ever find it. But it was clear that he 
wouldn't stop trying. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny drove home that night wondering if his former student's  
struggle was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sweeny has wondered about his own choices through the years:  
Could his name have been on billboards, too? Could he have it to 
made it to Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was a pretty good actor,'' Sweeny says carefully,  
``but to say that trivializes people like Brian. I didn't have the 
100 percent devotion that he had, the passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sweeny had another passion, one he couldn't let go. As soon  
as he retired from Wall Street, he marched straight back to 
Chaminade and asked if he could come back to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past nine years he has worked there, about 20 hours a  
week, coaching football, raising money, touching lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling through the corridors in his crimson and gold  
Chaminade sweater, Sweeny jokes that he feels like he's in a time 
warp. The boys look the same in their blazers and ties, and they 
still greet him with shouts of ``Hi, Coach.'' The photographs of 
Dennehy and his class of 1956 might have been hung yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sense, Sweeny says, things haven't changed. There's still a  
need to nurture the talents of teens, to show them how Shakespeare 
and football can mix, to introduce them to the endless 
possibilities of both worlds, to bring them to performances like 
``Death of a Salesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Sweeny saw Dennehy's ``Salesman'' was on opening  
night. He sat with other specially invited guests, next to Gregory 
Peck and behind Lauren Bacall. It was nice to be honored that way: 
He enjoyed the celebrity touch. But he didn't go to the party at 
Tavern on the Green afterward, didn't want to steal any of the 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to return this summer to watch Dennehy's wrenching  
portrayal of Willy Loman one more time. He wants to bring a 
student, a 20-year-old with an athlete's build and an actor's 
heart, a kid who reminds him of the young Brian Dennehy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk to him,'' Sweeny urges the actor as they sit in a  
restaurant after the show. ``Try to knock the stage out of him. And 
if you can't knock it out of him, then give him all the 
encouragement you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennehy nods. Sure, he says. He'll do what he can. Doesn't he  
always follow the advice of the teacher who inspired him?

<HEADLINE> Scientist Accused of Bogus Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A scientist who the government says faked  
the results of a study linking power lines to cancer has agreed to 
have some of his data retracted by journals that published the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement with the federal Office of Research Integrity,  
Richard P. Liburdy also agreed to a three-year ban on receiving 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy's 1992 study claimed to find a link between  
electromagnetic fields around power lines and certain cellular 
changes in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	After a whistle-blower complained, the ORI investigated and  
concluded that Liburdy had committed scientific misconduct by 
tossing out data that did not support his conclusions, agency 
director Chris Pascal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence demonstrates Liburdy knew his data manipulations  
were significant to the conclusions of the paper,'' the agency said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy, 51, resigned his 15-year position at Lawrence Berkeley  
National Laboratory in March after losing his funding, the San 
Francisco Chronicle reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, he agreed to ask scientific journals that published his  
work to retract three key graphs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a letter in last month's issue of the journal  
Science, he denied doing anything wrong other than failing to 
explain his graphing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``My scientific conclusions stand as published,'' Liburdy wrote.  
``I admit no scientific wrongdoing. I could not afford a protracted 
legal battle with the ORI, and a settlement was reached by which I 
admit no liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three independent scientists who evaluated the facts at  
Liburdy's request supported him, the Chronicle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy, a cellular biologist who lives in Tiburon, outside San  
Francisco, did not respond Friday to a request for comment faxed to 
his home by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that electromagnetic fields can cause childhood  
leukemia and other illnesses has raised fears among people living 
near high-tension power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory had been raised well before Liburdy's study, but he  
found what was thought to be the first plausible biological 
explanation for such a connection. At least 20 subsequent studies 
have failed to find any conclusive link of the sort he described. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy's studies, published in the Annals of the New York  
Academy of Sciences and FEBS Letters, a publication of the 
Federation of European Biochemical Societies, tied electric and 
magnetic radiation to calcium signaling, a process responsible for 
a number of cellular functions, including cell division and the 
turning of genes on and off. 
</P>
<P>
	ORI examined Liburdy's raw data and found that in one graph, he  
had used only 7.1 percent of his data. The ORI also said he 
fabricated data.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Fans Want To Watch Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Though Lance Armstrong should win the Tour  
de France on Sunday while most Americans are eating breakfast, his 
adopted hometown will wait to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	And while some fans say they will watch the final stage in Paris  
via the Internet, many say they will wait for ABC's national 
telecast of taped coverage in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of cyclists will be out riding Sunday morning. I  
think they'll be able to hold out until Sunday afternoon,'' cyclist 
Jay Aust said. ``Surely some people will be following on the 
Internet. I won't be one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be different if a close finish was expected, said Bill  
Reams, a local rider who races with the Violet Crown Sports 
Association. But with Armstrong leading by 7 minutes, 37 seconds 
after winning Saturday's time trial, it would take a catastrophe 
for him to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a close race you'd probably want to watch it live  
Sunday,'' Reams said. ``If something happens to make it close, 
maybe I will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the 27-year-old Armstrong learned he had testicular  
cancer that spread to his lungs and brain, requiring surgery and 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, not only is he on the brink of joining Greg LeMond as the  
only Americans to win the Tour, one of the world's most rugged 
endurance tests, he is about to make believers out of scores who 
doubted he could come back from such a devastating illness. 
</P>
<P>
	A local radio station and downtown brewery will host a party to  
watch the taped footage, and Armstrong's cancer research foundation 
will give away memorabilia, including autographed posters. 
</P>
<P>
	Traci Ripley, director of special events at the Copper Tank  
Brewing Co., said the pub is expecting as many as 500 people to 
attend. Promoters have asked fans to wear yellow, the traditional 
jersey color of the tour leader. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials also are planning a parade and festival when  
Armstrong returns to Austin, but no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it's Lance, we'll be inviting people to come out and  
be in the parade and bring their bikes,'' said Mayor Kirk Watson, 
who, like Armstrong, has survived testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be emotional for a lot of people because he's an  
American winning the Tour de France, one of the greatest races in 
the world. ... And it will be emotional for those who have survived 
cancer. It shows that you can come back to win the best race.''

<HEADLINE> Paul Mellon Gifts To Be Exhibited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gifts from the late Paul Mellon, made over  
most of this century, will go on exhibit Nov. 7 at the National 
Gallery of Art, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show will include the original wax model of the ``Little  
Dancer Fourteen Years Old'' -- one of 73 items in a trust disclosed 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon died Feb. 1 at 91. His father, Treasury Secretary Andrew  
Mellon, was among the gallery's founders and a major donor in his 
own right. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 paintings, sculptures and prints, contributed by Paul  
Mellon over his lifetime, will appear in the memorial show. The 
list has not been completed, said Patricia O'Connell, a gallery 
spokeswoman, but works will appear by British, French and American 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the show from the last gift is ``White Poodle in a  
Punt'' by George Stubbs, a British painter of animals. His pictures 
of horses were favorites of Mellon, who bred a Kentucky Derby 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dancer has been cast in bronze and reproduced many  
times. One copy went for $11,882,500 at a New York auction three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only version ... Degas himself every touched or  
saw,'' said Alison Luchs, a sculpture curator at the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Degas did the statue about 1880. He adorned it with hair and an  
orange-yellow bodice, which is still there, although the short tutu 
-- the standard ballet dancer's skirt -- has worn out over the years 
and had to be replaced. In earlier centuries many statues wore 
actual clothes, but it was an odd idea in Degas' own time. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Mellon's last gift included 29 wax models by Degas, four in  
bronze and four in plaster. Many of these sculptures -- including 
some of his favorite subjects such as dancers, women bathing and 
horses -- turned up at a foundry after his death in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit will run through next February, with no admission  
charge.

<HEADLINE> GOP Trumpets Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fresh from a GOP House victory that provides  
for a $792 billion tax cut, Majority Leader Dick Armey said today 
that huge budget surpluses should be used to give Americans a 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
	``You created the surplus. And it's only fair that you get a  
refund,'' Armey, R-Texas, said in the weekly Republican radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nearly straight party-line vote Thursday, the House  
approved a measure that would cut taxes by about $792 billion over 
10 years. Senate Republicans plan to pass a tax cut next week that 
is the same size as the House bill but differs in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has threatened to veto such a steep cut,  
saying it could undermine Social Security and Medicare reform and 
reduce spending for other critical programs. He favors a tax cut in 
the range of $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton continued his assault on the GOP bill in his own radio  
address today. ``It is so large and it balloons in size so 
dramatically in future years that it would be impossible to invest 
our surplus to save Social Security, to save and strengthen 
Medicare with a prescription drug benefit, to pay off our national 
debt,'' he contended. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armey said the Republican plan provides needed relief to  
Americans who are beleaguered by what he called an unfair tax 
system. He said the tax code now punishes those who marry and 
burden those who want to save money for the future, as well as 
families who save for their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would ease taxation on interest accrued from savings  
and reduce the ``marriage penalty,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosperity you created brought us the first budget surplus  
in 39 years,'' he said. ``We must return that money to you so it 
isn't spent in Washington on more big government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey also asserted that the goals of fiscal responsibility  
could be reconciled with a tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can cut taxes and pay down the debt -- and the American  
people expect us to do both,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lions Sign Claiborne and Gibson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions agreed to terms with  
first-round draft choices Chris Claiborne and Aaron Gibson on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiborne, a linebacker selected ninth overall out of Southern  
California, will get a $2 million signing bonus in a contract worth 
$7.62 million for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 255-pound Claiborne won the 1998 Butkus Award as  
the nation's top linebacker. He was a first-team All-American last 
season and twice made the All-Pac-10 first team. His totals at USC 
included 312 tackles, 12 sacks, eight interceptions and 23 pass 
deflections. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge Gibson, 6-4 and 380 pounds, was the 27th overall pick  
out of Wisconsin. He got a $3.9 million deal, including a signing 
bonus of $1.675 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A finalist for both the Outland and Lombardi trophies in 1998,  
Gibson, who can play guard or tackle, was a first-team All-American 
and was named to the All-Big Ten first team for a second straight 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The signings were timely because rookies report to the Lions'  
training camp on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always vital to a rookie's development to be in camp on  
time,'' coach Bobby Ross said.

<HEADLINE> Cops Kill Suspect in Georgia Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTELL, Ga. (AP) -- Police fatally shot a man Saturday who had  
gunned down two SWAT team members and barricaded himself and his 
73-year-old mother inside their house in a 16-hour standoff that 
began with a fight between neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Smith, 40, found his home surrounded by police Friday night  
after he shot and wounded an officer who tried to arrest him for 
assaulting a neighbor in this Atlanta suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours later, two Cobb County SWAT team members were killed  
when they stormed the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff came to an end Saturday morning after negotiations  
with Smith ended abruptly, said Cobb County police spokesman Dana 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said officers did not enter the home to end the standoff,  
but they acknowledged he was shot by police, indicating he was 
killed by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's mother, Mildred, walked to an ambulance and appeared to  
be unharmed, but was taken to a hospital because police had fired 
tear gas into the house during the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were first called Friday after Smith, a trucker, argued  
with neighbor Jerald Barnett, 55, and struck the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett called police while Smith went in to his house and  
returned with a handgun, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer J.H. Mestre, who was wearing a bulletproof vest,  
attempted to arrest Smith but was shot several times in the leg and 
the arm. He returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked out my door and saw the police officer bleeding,''  
Barnett said. ``He was looking for cover so I told him to come on 
in and I helped him inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Wellstar Cobb Hospital would not give Mestre's  
condition. Police said only that his injuries were not 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Police negotiated with Smith for more than four hours, then  
decided that his mother was in danger and sent in the SWAT team 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way things had transpired, we had to draw the line,''  
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb County police Sgt. Steve Reeves, 35, and Officer Stephen  
Gilner, 32, were wounded during the SWAT team raid, and died at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they negotiated with Smith off and on throughout the  
night until talks ended abruptly about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the middle-class community about 15 miles northwest  
of Atlanta described Smith as easy-going and mild-mannered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't socialize a lot but he never created any problems.  
He was just very low key,'' Barnett said.

<HEADLINE> Santerre Races to 1st NASCAR Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Andy Santerre, last season's  
rookie of the year, got his first NASCAR Grand National victory 
Saturday, holding off Tim Fedewa by less than a second to win the 
NAPA AutoCare 250 at Pikes Peak International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Bodine finished third, followed by Jeff Green and Jeff  
Purvis. 
</P>
<P>
	Santerre, making only his third season start because of a broken  
leg suffered at Daytona in February, took the lead for good 16 laps 
from the end when he put his Chevrolet ahead of the Chevy driven by 
Dale Earnhardt Jr., the leader in the season driver standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the checkered flag, I didn't know what to do,''  
Santerre said. ``I just pushed the button (two-way radio) and 
started screaming. I was pretty excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Earnhardt) picked up the throttle early trying to beat me,  
but I think he tried to pick the throttle right back up and got up 
a little too high. Then I still thought he'd come back by me on the 
outside, but he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got up in front of him, I knew I got the line then.''  
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt was involved in a crash with 11 laps left that dropped  
him to a 36th-place finish and cost him the points lead. Matt 
Kenseth, who finished seventh, improved to 2,786 points, 24 ahead 
of Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Blaney, who started from the pole, was involved in a late  
accident that dropped him to 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had an awfully tough year, the injury,'' Fedewa said  
of Santerre's broken leg. ``People just don't realize just how 
serious his injury was. He was out for several months, and the 
rehabilitation he had to go through, and not knowing if he is going 
to be able to make it back.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Eulogy for Lauren Bessette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the eulogy given by Dr. Jack Messina during the memorial  
service for Lauren Bessette. He is her uncle, the brother of her 
mother, Ann Freeman. 

</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette was born on Nov. 5, 1964, followed three minutes  
later by her twin sister, Lisa. Fifteen months later, Carolyn 
Bessette entered the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 16, 1999, two of these remarkable women, along with  
Carolyn's beloved husband, John Kennedy, unexpectedly left us. 
Their departure has left an enormous void in all our lives and has 
touched the lives of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carolyn and John were meaningfully eulogized by Hamilton  
South and Senator Ted Kennedy at yesterday's memorial service. It 
was no easy task for them to reflect on the lives of Carolyn and 
John within a limited time frame, and I find it equally daunting to 
share with you in the short time we have together the essence of my 
niece, Lauren, an enormously complex woman whom we all loved. 
</P>
<P>
	As I began to think of what I would say, it became clear that  
this could not be accomplished from just my perspective. Lauren's 
character and personality was so rich, vibrant and multifaceted 
that I turned to other family members to share their thoughts and 
feelings. From the children, Kristin, Matthew, Courtney, Kyle and 
the four Floyd 'Killer Bees' -- Brittney, Bobby, Billy and Buddy -- 
we collected these words'': 
</P>
<P>
	She fit into our kid world -- she was more like a friend and a  
sister than a grown-up. She was really fun. We remember the day she 
played miniature golf in the back yard in her pajamas and high 
heels. She knew so much about so many things and was always 
teaching us things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Her goddaughter told me she is saving every beautiful thing  
Lauren ever gave her so she can pass them on to her children. We 
are comforted in knowing that Lauren is still with the children in 
memory and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving on to her friends, I learned more about Lauren. They  
described her as someone always there to find that piece of elusive 
information that was wanted so desperately, to introduce them to 
the exact person they needed in their lives to say a good word when 
it was really needed and to always boost them up when things were 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren had a far-reaching spiritual side. She honored the  
beliefs of many religious heritages and was not above consulting 
Chinese fortunetellers. From a packet of angel cards recently given 
to her, a friend selected a few cards that captured the spirit and 
colors of Lauren -- strength, compassion, tenderness, adventure, 
beauty, courage, responsibility, power, abundance, enthusiasm, 
grace and love. 
</P>
<P>
	A close friend shared a few e-mail communications he had  
received from Lauren, and one so reflected her sense of humor that 
I felt compelled to share it. To put it mildly, Lauren was never 
much of a sports fan. Until recently, she had never attended a 
professional sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after attending her first prize fight, in typical  
Lauren fashion, she began to enthusiastically embrace all 
professional sports. She e-mailed the following: `I am now 
considering to be such an avid sports fan that the invitations just 
keep rolling in. Off to the Knicks game tonight and I can only 
imagine what tomorrow will bring. I am the envy of my male 
colleagues, all of who are extremely bitter, which naturally 
enhances my enjoyment of these events. Thanks again to the 
introduction to boxing.' Lauren's personality to a T. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren was an adoring grandchild. Her love for her Nana knew no  
bounds. I know she'll continue to keep a protective eye out for 
her. Lauren's mother, my sister Ann, reflected on the light and joy 
her daughter brought into her life. She was pleased with what 
Lauren accomplished professionally, but she was most proud of who 
she was and who she was becoming. She loved Lauren's sense of 
personal entitlement, the view she held of the world as her own and 
her ability to convince the world this was true. 
</P>
<P>
	To me, Lauren was fascinating as all the Bessette woman are and  
were. She was breathtakingly intelligent. Her intellect and sense 
of aesthetics allowed her to appreciate art, literature, opera, 
economics and world events. Everything was interesting to her. It 
was a marvel to be around her and see if you could catch up and 
keep up. Conversation with her was lightning-quick, broad-based, 
often irreverent, filled with repartee and always witty. Just 
listening to her I felt a sense of pride, a hope in the future 
because of our young people and maybe just a little bit old. 
</P>
<P>
	I can still see Lauren, tall and gracefully talking with those  
adorably quirky hand gestures. I see her tossing that long shiny 
hair and hear her laughter. I sense her vitality and her strength 
and her love. We shall miss her. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite our losses, our family's grateful to have Lisa with us.  
Like my other two nieces, she possesses the gifts of intelligence, 
wit, compassion and drive. We cherish her for those qualities that 
remind us of Lauren and Carolyn, but in particular for those that 
make her a unique and special individual in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
	If the events of these past eight days have taught us anything,  
it is to honor the moment. Cherish those around you. Try to find a 
balance between work and family. Contribute something to your 
community and above all, share the love you feel for others each 
and every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren loved opera, but her taste in music was eclectic. Amongst  
her favorite songs was ``She's a Rainbow'' by Mick Jagger. I now 
know why.

<HEADLINE> Rogers Recalls Urban Upbringing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Kenny Rogers may represent country, but he says  
he got his street smarts growing up in the city's housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a child, this is where the foundation for me and my family  
was laid. It was a wonderful experience to be in a place like 
this,'' the country singer said Friday as he toured the recently 
renovated Allen Parkway Village. ``It's a very real part of my 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers had not walked through the village since moving out in  
1953. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rogers lived in the projects, all the families were white.  
Black and Hispanic families lived in other parts of the city's 
segregated housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the separation, he remembers black children coming to  
Allen Parkway to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know the difference. When you're a kid you don't  
stop to analyze black and white,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Aerospace Firms Near Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and France's  
Aerospatiale Matra are close to agreement on a merger deal that 
would create the world's biggest aerospace company after Boeing, a 
newsmagazine reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel said the plans to fuse the two companies are already  
on the desk of French President Jacques Chirac, who must approve 
any deal involving the aerospace and defense group Aerospatiale 
Matra, which is 48 percent state-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine said the deal was worked out by DaimlerChrysler  
chairman Juergen Schrempp and Jean Luc Legardere, chairman of 
Aerospatiale Matra's supervisory board. The report did not cite 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, Rainer Ohler, would  
neither confirm nor deny the report. ``Everybody's talking with 
everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Aerospatiale Matra in Paris declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel's report is the latest in a flurry of consolidation  
announcements from Europe's aerospace and defense industry, which 
has said it hopes to better compete against U.S. giants like Boeing 
and Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	European companies already cooperate in building Airbus  
commercial planes and Eurofighter and Tornado military jets, but 
industry insiders fear that unless they pool their skills, finances 
and research more closely, they will be picked off by U.S. firms 
keen to expand into European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, known as Dasa,  
signed a memo of understanding with Spain's Construcciones 
Aeronauticas SA to merge into Europe's first multinational 
aerospace company, beating out Aerospatiale Matra and other 
European firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dasa earlier this month announced a joint venture in space  
technology with Aerospatiale Matra and the Marconi division of 
Britain's General Electric Co. The Alenia Spazio division of 
Italy's Finmeccanica is expected to join that venture, called 
astrium, later. 
</P>
<P>
	In both deals, Dasa officials said the aim was to strengthen  
competitiveness and contribute to ``European industrial 
integration.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball's Richest Pitchers Meet Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- At first glance, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown,  
baseball's richest pitchers, would seem to be experiencing similar 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has a 10-7 record. Brown is 10-6.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as they prepared for a Sunday night showdown, their third  
since last October, their true fates have been vastly different. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson leads the NL in earned run average at 2.65 and the  
majors in strikeouts with 229. He is a legitimate threat to break 
Nolan Ryan's single-season strikeout record of 383. If not for a 
four-game stretch when he pitched great but lost because his 
Arizona teammates failed to provide him with even one run, Johnson 
could easily be 14-3. And, most significantly, his team is 
contending for the NL West title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could make the case for Randy maybe having one of the best  
years of his career with the exception of those games he should 
have won,'' manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least on the surface, Johnson has coped with his team's  
inability to provide him with any help. The Diamondbacks finally 
came through for him in a 6-0 shutout in his triumphant return to 
Seattle last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I'm trying to do out there is put the team in  
position to win,'' Johnson said. ``It doesn't matter what pitcher 
I'm facing. I've got a job to do and that's to keep the runs to a 
minimum, and our hitters have a job to do and that's to score runs. 
If we both do our jobs, good things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, meanwhile, has a 3.79 ERA with 127 strikeouts, third in  
the NL but 102 fewer than Johnson. Brown has had some strong games, 
and some awful ones. After allowing just eight homers all of last 
season with San Diego, he has given up 15 this year. Los Angeles, 
the team that counted on him to lead it to the NL West crown, has 
nose-dived into last place, 10 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a year where it seems like someone is trying to test  
me,'' Brown said after his last outing, an 8-4 victory over 
Pittsburgh. ``It's been that way the whole year. Game after game, 
it's like a witch doctor has a curse on me. If anybody knows how to 
get rid of it, tell him to send it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing for sure, both pitchers will be intense Sunday. It's  
their trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one thing that I respect and appreciate in his game is  
that he goes about his business much like I do,'' Johnson said. 
``Maybe it's not the best way, but it's the best way for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two pitchers first squared off last October in the NL  
divisional playoffs, an outstanding duel that ended with Brown's 
Padres beating Johnson and the Houston Astros 2-1. Both became 
highly-sought free agents after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Arizona Diamondbacks. Twelve days later, Brown signed an amazing 
seven-year, $105 million deal with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April 5, on opening day, they were the starting pitchers as  
the Diamondbacks played at Dodger Stadium. Another close, 
low-scoring game? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously they're the premier pitchers in the league,''  
Dodgers' catcher Todd Hundley said. ``Opening day everyone was 
expecting a pitcher's duel, and look what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks got five runs on 10 hits off Brown in 5 2-3  
innings. Johnson pitched well, and left after seven innings with a 
5-2 lead. But, as would be the case many more times in the coming 
weeks, Arizona's bullpen couldn't hold on, and Los Angeles came 
back to win 8-6 in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night probably won't be the last time the two will face  
off this season. If the rotation stays intact, Johnson and Brown 
will be the starters next Friday night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, though, said he never thinks about his opposing  
pitcher. Everybody seems to mount their best effort when they know 
he's pitching, he said. Jose Jimenez of St. Louis, who beat Johnson 
and the Diamondbacks with a 1-0 no-hitter, is a classic example. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pitching matchup is one thing, but I'm not facing him,''  
Johnson said. ``I'm facing his lineup. I can only worry about 
facing those eight guys that are coming up to the plate. It doesn't 
matter who I'm pitching against. What's the worse that Kevin 
Brown's going to do on Sunday? Shut me out? Like I haven't had that 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Derails in Rensselaer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENSSELAER, N.Y. (AP) -- An Amtrak passenger train partially  
derailed as it approached a train station Saturday afternoon, 
injuring 16 people on board, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cars slipped off the tracks when the train slammed into  
another train it was attempting to hook up with, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve passengers and four crew members of the ``Lakeshore  
Limited'' were taken to local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	None appeared to be seriously injured, according to John  
Brennan, superintendent of train operations for Empire Services of 
Albany and Rensselaer, a division of Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said the train, which was coming in from Chicago and  
bound for Boston, was going too fast when it collided with the 
second train at about 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars that derailed included two passenger cars and a cafe  
car, according to Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington. 
</P>
<P>
	Remington wouldn't speculate on the cause of the crash.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials said it would take several hours to determine the  
cause of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Umpires' Man in a Fight of His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To umpires, he's a hero. To owners and players,  
he's a bully. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone agrees that Richie Phillips is a brash, boastful  
battler who has been wildly successful on behalf of the umpire's 
union since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's in the middle of another fight, only this one involves  
Phillips himself and some of the very umpires he's represented for 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of AL umps say he should be replaced. In March, 14 voted  
against giving Phillips a new five-year contract, saying they 
wanted a less confrontational lawyer such as Ron Shapiro of 
Baltimore, who represents Cal Ripken and Kirby Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not like me personally, do not like my style,''  
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	On that, the opposition group agrees. They think he's misjudged  
umpires' leverage with baseball and even their own unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am adamantly opposed to this kind of leadership,'' said AL  
umpire Dave Phillips, a 29-year veteran who is no relation. ``There 
are times when you pull out your gun, your mortar and go 
winner-take-all. But communication and negotiation are the most 
important ingredients we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips says he doesn't care that some umpires are against him.  
He says he's fighting for the hard core, the group intent on 
resigning Sept. 2 because baseball refuses to negotiate a new labor 
contract before the current deal expires on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	He is not your classic, buttoned-down Philadelphia lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	When the 280-pound, 6-foot-2 Phillips doesn't get what he wants,  
he screams, he throws things, he files unfair labor practice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The perfect image of his negotiating style was evident eight  
years ago. He didn't like what he was hearing from baseball 
management lawyer Robert Kheel during a bargaining session, so he 
hurled an office chair through the wall of a conference room at 
Willkie Farr &AMP; Gallagher, one of the nation's most prestigious law 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	When the sides reached an agreement and held a news conference  
later that day, Phillips was proud of his destruction, pointing it 
out as if it were some sort of battle scar. 
</P>
<P>
	Kheel never sent him a bill, Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He provoked it,'' Phillips recalled Friday, laughing. ``He  
knew he deserved that hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the only time Phillips made baseball owners pay.  
</P>
<P>
	When he became the lawyer for the Major League Umpires  
Association in 1978, rookie umpires made $17,500 and the most 
senior veterans got $40,000. In the labor contract that expires 
Dec. 31, they make a minimum of $95,000 and can earn up to 
$282,500, including the postseason bonuses they all receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58-year-old burly Phillips scares owners and management  
officials even more than players' association head Donald Fehr and 
his chief lawyer, Gene Orza. 
</P>
<P>
	Kheel, citing the delicate situation, wouldn't say a word about  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not?'' Phillips wanted to know.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to assess his strengths and weaknesses, Phillips said the  
people who sit across bargaining tables from him should do that. 
Told they wouldn't, he paused, reflected and said: ``I don't have 
any weak points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips graduated from with an economics degree from Villanova,  
where he played guard and linebacker on the Wildcats' team that 
beat Wichita State in the 1961 Sun Bowl. He spent 1962 as an 
assistant football coach there and coached the freshman team the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from Villanova Law School, he became a defense  
lawyer from 1967-69 and spent three years as an assistant district 
attorney in Philadelphia under Arlen Specter, now a U.S. Senator. 
</P>
<P>
	After that came the private sector. He was a lawyer for the  
Philadelphia Transport Worker's Union from 1972-73, the 
Philadelphia Carpenters' Union from 1972-74 and the Philadelphia 
76ers from 1974-76. Then he switched sides and became the 
negotiator for the NBA referees' union from 1976-83. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, he was the agent for catcher Mike Scioscia, and he  
occasionally represented pitching great Steve Carlton. In 1978, he 
was approached to represent the umpires by Jerry Crawford, now the 
union president, Bruce Froemming and Paul Runge, now the NL's 
executive director of umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year, Phillips led umpires in their first-ever strike.  
When they ended the walkout after seven weeks, they had their first 
collective bargaining agreement, average raises of $7,000 and, for 
the first time in baseball history, two weeks' vacation during the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	He still considers that his greatest success.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had to break the mind-set of baseball in dealing with the  
umpires,'' he said. ``The umpires were advised repeatedly by letter 
and telegrams that they had been permanently replaced and would 
never work again in baseball. Despite those threats and edicts, 
they hung together and they hung in for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next fight came in 1984, when umpires struck the first four  
games of the postseason. They threatened another strike in 1985, 
struck for over a day in 1991 and missed most season openers. Then 
they were locked out for the first eight days of the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it's been one battle after another:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Umpires tried to strike the 1996 postseason, angered when  
Roberto Alomar received only a five-day suspension for spitting at 
John Hirschbeck -- a penalty that was delayed until the following 
regular season. Phillips forced owners to get a federal injunction 
to prevent a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He was incensed when players won an arbitration ruling that  
forced owners to pay them for all suspensions for on-field conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Umpires threatened to eject players for even the slightest  
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Until an arbitrator ordered him to, he wouldn't allow umpires  
carry stopwatches to make sure innings didn't start before 
television commercials ended. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He filed a grievance over an attempt to get umpires to call  
the strike zone as it's defined in the rule book, and another to 
prevent umpires from working the Baltimore Orioles' exhibition 
series against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	When players held a survey to rate umpires, he ridiculed it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're patently absurd. I've even been told that some  
players had their kids fill them out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the umpires got him the most publicity, he spent most of  
his time on other work. He was lawyer for the Horsemens' Benevolent 
and Protective Association from 1984-91 and has been the lawyer for 
the Professional Association of Golf Officials since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	His main job is chairman, president and chief executive officer  
of Pilot Air Freight Inc., which he says has 1,500 employees in 56 
offices and generates close to $200 million annually in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Pilot employee, Gepke Wils, sued him for sexual  
harassment, claiming in federal court papers last November that he 
pressed her for sexual favors from 1995-1997. Wils also filed 
complaints in October 1997 with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no factual basis to any of these  
allegations,'' Phillips said last autumn. He said both agencies 
investigated but found no merit to her complaint. Officials at the 
agencies said they don't release information on such complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and his wife Ellenanne have been married 35 years and  
have four children - two daughters and two sons, ranging in age 
from 28 to 34.

<HEADLINE> EPA Unveiling New Air Quality Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revamping a 2-decade-old system, the  
Environmental Protection Agency is issuing a new air quality index 
that gives more detailed health warnings on the harms of air 
pollution and ways people can protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was announcing the new index today at a  
groundbreaking for a children's hospital in New York City. He said 
a category added to the chart would particularly benefit children 
with asthma and others with special respiratory conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new air quality index is a critical tool Americans need to  
protect their health,'' Gore said in prepared remarks. ``It will 
empower parents and communities to protect children, particularly 
the 6 million children who suffer from asthma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air quality index is used by local weather forecasters and  
others to gauge the health effects of air pollution on a given day. 
Pollution measurements are divided into ranges and a health 
advisory is given based on the day's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current standards have not been updated since their  
introduction in 1976 and are not always used consistently, 
according to the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised model is aimed at providing a uniform nationwide  
format that weather forecasters can use to relay information about 
when air pollution poses a health risk and what precautions people 
can take. The index looks at five major air pollutants: smog, soot, 
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in the levels of any or all of these pollutants can  
shift the health protection warning for that day. For example, if 
the index indicates moderate air quality, people who are unusually 
sensitive to pollution are advised to limit their outdoor activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The updated chart adds a new warning for when air quality might  
be unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as children and adults with 
respiratory problems, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also was using the event to urge Congress to pass the  
administration's $68 million plan to attack childhood asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money -- $50 million -- would be used for competitive  
state grants to identify and treat poor children served by Medicaid 
who have asthma. The initiative would help schools educate children 
and parents on how to avoid attacks, support research into 
environmental hazards and pay for a public information campaign.

<HEADLINE> Giants Lose Brock for 6-8 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants' trade for Livan  
Hernandez was perfect timing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after acquiring Hernandez in a trade Saturday with  
Florida, the Giants learned right-hander Chris Brock will be 
sidelined six to eight weeks with a torn anterior cruciate ligament 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock was hurt in the second inning of a 6-5 win over Cincinnati  
on Friday night, when he tripped over first base and fell hard on 
the knee while legging out an infield single. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock stayed in the game and pitched four more innings. He left  
after six innings with a no-decision. However, the knee was still 
sore after the game and the Giants had him undergo an MRI Saturday 
that revealed the tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 24, who helped the Marlins to the 1997 World Series  
title and became just the second rookie to win Series MVP honors, 
will take Brock's place in San Francisco's rotation. He'll make his 
first start for the Giants on Wednesday against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock, who emerged from a spring training competition to win the  
job as the Giants' fifth starter, was 6-8 with a 5.48 ERA in 19 
starts. He had 76 strikeouts and 41 walks in 106 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Dennehy Gives Teacher Extra Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the gilded elegance of the Eugene O'Neill  
Theatre, the big man of Broadway is bringing down the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience can hardly contain itself, cheering and clapping in  
a frenzy of spontaneous applause. And the star hasn't even uttered 
his first line. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he will admit that he was momentarily unnerved by the raw  
adulation that swept the stage. But the most unnerving part of all 
was not that it was his first performance since winning a Tony 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	It was knowing who was watching from the eleventh row.  
</P>
<P>
	Snug in his spot in the orchestra seats -- best in the house --  
the teacher smiles. He doesn't yell ``Bravo!'' like everyone else, 
doesn't leap to his feet when the three-hour performance is over. 
He simply nods. And there's a glint of a tear in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to hand it to him,'' the teacher says, as his  
former student takes a final bow. ``He really learned his craft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later the two are backstage, locked in a tough-guy  
embrace. Brian Dennehy, star of ``Death of a Salesman,'' and his 
former football coach and drama teacher, Chris Sweeny, the man who 
yanked the big guy off the playing field, the man who inspired him 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
	At 60, Dennehy still has the hulking frame of a football player.  
It's easy to imagine the kid who swaggered on the field with such 
dramatic flair that Sweeny, tired of yelling about blocking 
tactics, ordered him to try out for Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, ``You got such a big mouth; let's put it to some  
use,''' Sweeny recalls, rolling his eyes as he relives the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1954. Fresh from the Air Force, Sweeny had been hired to  
coach football and teach English at Chaminade High School, a 
private Catholic school for boys in Mineola, N.Y. Asked to start a 
drama club, the young teacher turned to the students he knew best, 
the football players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a choice,'' Dennehy booms. ``Chris Sweeny was  
tough as nails. When he volunteered you for something, you didn't 
argue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny's eyes twinkle. At 69, he is tall and tan, with a  
thoughtful, authoritative air. He still has the commanding presence 
that inspired Dennehy and his classmates to brave the jeers of 
other jocks when they traded their football gear for tights. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was another reason that Sweeny singled out Dennehy.  
``What really interested me about Brian,'' Sweeny says in an 
exaggerated tone, ``was that he could be HEARD!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennehy roars. Sweeny's style never changes, not on the football  
field, not in the classroom, not in the dressing room of the man 
that Broadway has just crowned king. Always a performer. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you want to know how this guy got started,'' Sweeny begins,  
striking the perfect note of dreamy nostalgia, eyes gazing into the 
distance. ``It all began more than 40 years ago ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	His voice trails off, and the two men laugh. There are several  
versions of the story, embellished with age and artistic license. 
But it really comes down to two guys in love with theater who have 
taken very different routes to this glittering night on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Glittering it may be, but backstage, as accolades pour in from  
around the world and flowers arrive from David Letterman, the talk 
is of Chaminade, not Broadway. They remember Sweeny's first 
production, ``Pyramus and Thisby,'' the roar of the crowd when they 
performed at the annual Shakespearean competition at Hofstra 
University, the glory when they took the trophy home. Dennehy, 
decked out in black leggings and white rags and sporting an 
earsplitting grin, played a talking wall. He was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``We blew the place down,'' Dennehy says, face lighting up as if  
he can still hear the echo of those first ``encores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean people went crazy. They gave us the award, for sure.  
But it was more than winning. It was knockabout and farcical and 
hilarious and fun. It was what theater was all about. And, of 
course, I just got bitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny knew the feeling. He had been bitten himself years  
before, in the same gymnasium at Chaminade, when he played in a 
school production of ``Arsenic and Old Lace.'' He carried the 
feeling to Fordham University where he spent four years on a 
football scholarship and trained with Vince Lombardi, who was just 
starting as freshman coach. He carried it to the Air Force, where 
he organized an amateur theater group. He carried it back to 
Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, handsome, athletic, one of the few lay teachers in a  
strict Catholic school, Sweeny stood out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so articulate, so intelligent, so witty,'' Dennehy  
said. ``And he had this wonderful attitude toward life that 
anything was possible. I can't tell you how dazzled I was. And it 
wasn't just me, it was all of us. We couldn't wait to get to his 
classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny cuts him off with a gruff ``don't be such a wise guy.''  
But he doesn't say it too harshly. It's clear the actor's praise is 
more than just another polished line. 
</P>
<P>
	And it doesn't come just from Dennehy. From around the country  
Chaminade alumni join the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
	In University Place, Wash., retired executive Eugene Vorhies  
remembers the adolescent awkwardness of being 6 foot 6 inches, 
yearning to be involved in art and theater, yet ``trapped inside 
the body of a linebacker.'' Along came a teacher who showed him 
that he could do it all, and well. ``I've never told him this,'' 
Vorhies said, ``But I have felt grateful all my life that Chris 
Sweeny crossed my path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A physician in Chicago says the same thing, as do a physicist in  
New Mexico and a football coach in Indiana. Guys who hammed it up 
with Dennehy in ``Hope Is a Thing With Feathers'' and ``George 
Washington Slept Here'' and ``Macbeth.'' Guys who still remember 
Sweeny coaching them in speech and debate, pushing them to do 
better, yet never pushing too far. Four decades later, their voices 
fill with affection when they talk about a teacher who opened their 
mind to the idea that the arts, like athletics, could teach them 
more about themselves, to the idea that they could walk easily in 
both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny insists that it was the subjects that dazzled them, not  
the teacher. The same subjects had dazzled him. Especially theater. 
He couldn't get enough: the sets, the applause, the sheer joy of 
immersing himself in a character. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knew the perils. He couldn't have made any money at  
acting, couldn't have supported his family, didn't want to subject 
them to that kind of risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was make-believe,'' Sweeny says, a tinge of regret in his  
shrug. ``It was a hobby. It could never be anything more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reality was that his $3,500 salary at Chaminade wasn't  
enough either, not to support a wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
	So Sweeny gave up acting and he gave up teaching and headed to  
Wall Street, where he made a lot of money selling bonds. He was 
there for 35 years. He became a great salesman. And the best master 
of ceremonies the street had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennehy headed to Wall Street, too, but he didn't stay long. The  
parade of suits scared him more than the insecurity of the stage. 
So he chucked his selling job and went to work driving trucks and 
taxis, acting in small productions wherever he could. 
</P>
<P>
	They stayed in touch over the years, the teacher and the  
student: school reunions, funerals. Occasionally, Sweeny would 
watch Dennehy perform in local theaters. Small parts. He doesn't 
remember their names. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, in the 1970s, they ran into each other in a restaurant on  
Long Island. They spent the night talking: about acting and 
teaching, about families and sacrifice. In his 30s, Dennehy hadn't 
yet found the fame that would eventually come with movies like 
``Cocoon'' and ``Silverado'' and ``Gorky Park''. Back then, it 
wasn't clear that he would ever find it. But it was clear that he 
wouldn't stop trying. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeny drove home that night wondering if his former student's  
struggle was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sweeny has wondered about his own choices through the years:  
Could his name have been on billboards, too? Could he have it to 
made it to Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was a pretty good actor,'' Sweeny says carefully,  
``but to say that trivializes people like Brian. I didn't have the 
100 percent devotion that he had, the passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sweeny had another passion, one he couldn't let go. As soon  
as he retired from Wall Street, he marched straight back to 
Chaminade and asked if he could come back to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past nine years he has worked there, about 20 hours a  
week, coaching football, raising money, touching lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling through the corridors in his crimson and gold  
Chaminade sweater, Sweeny jokes that he feels like he's in a time 
warp. The boys look the same in their blazers and ties, and they 
still greet him with shouts of ``Hi, Coach.'' The photographs of 
Dennehy and his class of 1956 might have been hung yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sense, Sweeny says, things haven't changed. There's still a  
need to nurture the talents of teens, to show them how Shakespeare 
and football can mix, to introduce them to the endless 
possibilities of both worlds, to bring them to performances like 
``Death of a Salesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time Sweeny saw Dennehy's ``Salesman'' was on opening  
night. He sat with other specially invited guests, next to Gregory 
Peck and behind Lauren Bacall. It was nice to be honored that way: 
He enjoyed the celebrity touch. But he didn't go to the party at 
Tavern on the Green afterward, didn't want to steal any of the 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to return this summer to watch Dennehy's wrenching  
portrayal of Willy Loman one more time. He wants to bring a 
student, a 20-year-old with an athlete's build and an actor's 
heart, a kid who reminds him of the young Brian Dennehy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk to him,'' Sweeny urges the actor as they sit in a  
restaurant after the show. ``Try to knock the stage out of him. And 
if you can't knock it out of him, then give him all the 
encouragement you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennehy nods. Sure, he says. He'll do what he can. Doesn't he  
always follow the advice of the teacher who inspired him?

<HEADLINE> Russians Ponder Their Next Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A strange thing happened when Russia's economy  
collapsed last summer. While Western economists spun out the most 
dire scenarios of hyperinflation, social unrest and even civil war, 
Russians went on with their daily business and, for the most part, 
coped. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, they cursed the government ineptitude and corruption  
that, once again, had plundered their pockets and cleaned out their 
bank accounts. But they didn't riot; they didn't stop working; and 
they didn't starve. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a year later, Russia stands at a new crossroads, its  
political future even more the focus of concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the economy remains critically ill and on life support  
with International Monetary Fund aid, it has weathered the crisis 
better than almost anyone could have predicted. The ruble has 
remained relatively stable. Some industries are even showing signs 
of revival. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say things are rosy. Russia remains deeply rutted  
in economic depression. Social problems continue to worsen. 
Declines in health care and education threaten the nation's future; 
growing crime and despair imperil the here-and-now. 
</P>
<P>
	But when people speak of crisis in Russia these days, they are  
more likely to be talking about politics than socio-economics. For 
Russia's democracy is, at best, a work in progress, tattered by 
intrigue, scandal and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin, who has fired three prime ministers in  
little more than a year, recently survived a Communist-led attempt 
at impeachment and emerged politically strengthened and 
invigorated. Yet, Yeltsin remains an ailing and extremely unpopular 
figure who increasingly draws comparison to the doddering leaders 
who led the Soviet Union to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	With presidential elections scheduled next summer, some question  
whether he will ever yield power willingly. Recently there has been 
speculation Yeltsin is pushing a merger with tiny Belarus on the 
pretext that the creation of a new, expanded state would free him 
from his current two-term limit as president. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of a decade, Yeltsin has been the strongest  
force pushing Russia toward the West, much as Peter the Great did 
three centuries before. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time this spring, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia awakened a  
fierce, anti-Western nationalism that appeared likely to do what 
inflation, stagnation and scandal could not: Shove Russia off the 
road it set out on roughly a decade ago, when Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev effectively declared the Cold War over and 
prepared Russia to rejoin the world it had turned its back on 70 
years before. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO has opened a new epoch for us like Hitler,'' the author  
Alexander Solzhenitsyn said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is clearly having none of that, as his performance at  
the June meeting of world leaders in Cologne, Germany, showed. ``I 
am among my friends now,'' he declared, speaking of such figures as 
President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Russia has a habit of confounding those who try to  
predict what it will do next. Certainly, few people a decade ago 
could have imagined the course Russia has taken in the years since 
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	No one could have been that pessimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	Those were giddy days when Russians threw off seven decades of  
totalitarian rule under the Communist Party. The opportunities 
seemed endless, the new world exciting and, surely, rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some of the results:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly four of every 10 Russians live below the official  
subsistence level, defined as an income below 829 rubles a month, 
the equivalent of about $34. In December 1991, only 11 percent were 
in that category. 
</P>
<P>
	--Inflation-adjusted personal income per capita is estimated at  
about one-fourth the level of 1991 and just over half that of four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Russia's overall economic output this year is expected to be  
lower than that of Belgium, a country with 1-14th the population 
and 1-500th the land. 
</P>
<P>
	--Russia's population dropped by 401,000 people last year,  
continuing a decline that began seven years ago. During that time, 
the country has lost roughly 2 million people, largely because 
alcoholism and stress have contributed to a rising death rate and 
people are having fewer children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Russia's homicide rate has become one of the world's highest,  
triple that of the United States and seven times as high as 
Germany's. 
</P>
<P>
	--The suicide rate is also more than triple that of the United  
States. Nearly one-quarter of all military deaths are by suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Life expectancy is now estimated at 60.8 years for men, up  
considerably from a low of 57.6 years in 1994, but still shockingly 
low for an industrial nation. 
</P>
<P>
	--The average pension is 403 rubles -- $17 -- a month.  
</P>
<P>
	--The average monthly wage is 1,225 rubles -- $51 -- but millions  
go months or even years without getting paid at all. 
</P>
<P>
	--Between $50 billion and $250 billion is believed to have been  
illegally transferred to the West the past five years. That is at 
least twice as much as Russia's national budget of $25 billion for 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The list could go on and on. Tuberculosis rages in prisons.  
Organized crime has a stranglehold on entire regions of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Decaying nuclear submarines pose a horrific environmental  
threat; the risk of rogue scientists selling nuclear weapons or 
biological warfare technology terrifies many in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government just got to work on the Year 2000  
computer bug this year, and predicts the nation's computers will 
have about a one in five chance of failing when the year changes. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder Russians are disappointed by their journey on the  
golden road to capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted the free market. They wanted liberalization. They  
wanted to live like in America,'' said Boris Kagarlitsky, a leftist 
political analyst with the Russian Academy of Sciences. ``I always 
say people were punished for their own stupidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting on a plane and being told you're embarking  
for America and when you take off you discover that you're actually 
going to Burkina Faso or some such place,'' he added. ``And at that 
point, you can't get off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, as disgusted as most Russians are by their country's  
decline, they retain a fierce love for it and an astonishing 
ability to shoulder its burdens and get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ruggedly beautiful southern Siberian region of Buryatia,  
there is a group of homeless people who survive in some of the most 
awful conditions anywhere. They have carved a camp into the earth 
in a forest near a garbage dump, with crude wood-and-sheet metal 
shacks covering shallow caves dug in the ground. In these dank, 
smelly holes, they take shelter in winters that see temperatures 
sometimes plummet to minus 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is Alexander Sokolov, a 43-year-old jobless electrical  
engineer who lives in one of the dugouts with his wife, Lara. Far 
from defeated by the twists that led him there, he is practically 
upbeat as he discusses the homeless camp's potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have handy people. Our women can knit and sew, and we can  
make metalwork,'' he says enthusiastically. ``We need very little 
credit to start. We have a good team here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude may be Russia's saving grace. Russians, whose  
historical memory encompasses the loss of more than 25 million 
people in World War II, know a thing or two about hardship, and 
they aren't easily panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you compare this to Indonesia, the Russian currency fell as  
much in a few weeks as the Indonesian currency fell in six months, 
and you had Indonesians rioting in the streets,'' noted Peter 
Westin, an economist at the Russian European Center for Economic 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from rioting, Russians scarcely protested when the ruble  
lost two-thirds of its value practically overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Westin said, the situation is more complicated than  
it might appear. For one thing, Russians retain some of the 
benefits of socialism. Most people live in heavily subsidized 
housing, or apartments they own. Utilities are cheap, health care 
and education are theoretically free, and many city dwellers own 
rural garden plots where they grow most of their vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, ``you shouldn't have the illusion that people think  
it's OK, because they don't,'' he said. But he added that Russians 
are ``very persistent'' and show remarkable adaptation skills. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sergei Stepashin won parliamentary approval in May as  
Yeltsin's new prime minister, he seemed to express common yearnings 
for an ordered society, an end to uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all united by pain for our motherland and our people and  
the wish to see our country finally become normal, civilized, rich, 
prosperous and decent,'' Stepashin said in his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are some glimmers of hope.  
</P>
<P>
	In early July, Russia's monthly inflation was down to 1 percent  
and foreign currency reserves and tax collections were rising, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pensions and state workers' current wages were finally being  
paid on time, officials said, but many are still owed back payments 
-- and the wages are too paltry to end deep poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic collapse may actually be stimulating the economy.  
Domestic production has begun to climb as consumers -- who can no 
longer afford many imported goods -- turn back to Russian-made 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	In the old city of Kazan, the local tobacco company is winning  
back customers for its foul-smelling but cheap cigarettes, and the 
Kazan Macaroni Plant -- which had been losing a battle to Turkish 
and Iranian imports -- has found a new lease on life. Similar 
stories are being played out in cities and towns throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The real wild card now is politics. Yeltsin has clung to power  
despite serious health problems, a hostile parliament and a public 
that overwhelmingly dislikes him. In a recent poll, just 6 percent 
of the public approved of his performance in office -- and that was 
up from earlier polls. 
</P>
<P>
	With parliamentary elections scheduled later this year and  
presidential elections to be held sometime next year, the political 
forces in the country are jockeying for power. It's an ugly 
process, filled with scandal, backroom deals and endless intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
	With the public disgusted by the path of economic reform and  
increasingly angry at the West, the situation seems ripe for an 
authoritarian, nationalist candidate who can promise to restore 
order and pride to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people warn darkly that Russia is headed toward the  
creation of a new Iron Curtain, a new dictatorship. Others believe 
that Russians, however angry about the country's economic mess, 
would never give up the democratic freedoms they now cherish. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagarlitsky, the political analyst, sees the likelihood of a  
middle path -- a semi-authoritarian, semi-leftist government. It 
would be, he says, ``a very imperfect democracy. But I think that's 
better than a good dictatorship.''

	NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Competing anti-government groups held  
rallies in Serbian cities today, drawing thousands of people but 
failing to unite against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
About 25,000 protesters, the largest opposition gathering in the 
last month of rallies, turned up in the southern city of Nis at a 
demonstration called by Vuk Draskovic, of the Serbian Renewal 
movement. In Sombor, near the northern border with Hungary, 5,000

	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton, mingling with big-money  
Democratic donors, described the Republicans' tax-cutting plan in 
doomsday terms today, saying it would ``imperil the future 
stability of the country.'' ``It doesn't make sense,'' Clinton said 
in his weekly radio address, asserting that the GOP program would 
soak up money needed to fix Social Security, Medicare and other 
social programs. In reply, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, praised the $792 billion tax cut passed last week as 
returning surplus federal money to the people to keep it from being 
spent in Washington.

U.S. military, State Department and Customs Service as well as from

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Fans Try To Stay Cool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- At the original Woodstock, there were warnings  
about bad acid. At Woodstock '99, the admonishments are about water 
-- drink lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers on Saturday tried to push H2O on more than 225,000  
people sweltering in 90-degree-plus temperatures during the second 
day of the three-day megaconcert. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of free water here. There's water all over the  
site. We just have to get people to use it,'' promoter John Scher 
said. ``Without being preachy or lecturing them, we are telling 
concertgoers to drink lots of water, wear hats and use sunscreen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, emergency medical crews treated more than 400 people  
for heat exhaustion and dehydration and that continued Saturday to 
be the top concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Not crime. Not traffic. Not gatecrashers. Not the growing piles  
of garbage and overflowing portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the heat, the 30th anniversary festival at an  
abandoned military base in upstate New York was running faily 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one death: a 44-year-old man suffered a heart attack  
overnight at his campsite. The man had been in the hospital two 
weeks ago for heart surgery and state police believed his death was 
unrelated to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	A concertgoer also gave birth. The delivery came at a local  
hospital, not the festival site, officials said. No other 
information was available. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of scattered showers in the forecast Saturday  
might afford concertgoers some relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost unbearable,'' said Angela, an 18-year-old from New  
Hampshire, who didn't want to give her last name. She was sporting 
a serious sunburn around her neck and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``But a little heat and sunburn are nothing to put up with for a  
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were water fountains and ``rain rooms'' -- tents with  
sprinklers -- set up throughout the site. At each stage, concert 
workers sprayed those in the front with hoses and passed jugs of 
water back into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain rooms are hard to get into because of the lines,''  
said Kirsty Dawson, 20, of Fishkill, N.Y. ``If I get too hot, I'll 
roll in the mud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the second day began, people continued streaming into  
the concert grounds. About 25,000 people arrived overnight Friday 
and Scher said organizers would continue to sell discounted tickets 
-- now priced at $120 apiece -- as long as people wanted to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
	Six more people were arrested Friday night, bringing the total  
to nine since Thursday. Four of those arrested were driving drunk, 
one was charged with drug possession and another with shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, we're astonished at how few arrests we've  
had,'' said New York State police Major James Parmley. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the musicians performing Saturday were Counting Crows,  
Dave Matthews Band, Alanis Morissette and Metallica.

<HEADLINE> Digital Music Revolution Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's been called a major revolution in the  
history of the music business, liberating artists to deliver their 
music directly to listeners and terrifying record company 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	But questions are arising over whether digital distribution of  
music over the Internet will live up to all its hype. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts warn it may take several years before fundamental  
hurdles are overcome, many of them technological, delaying the day 
when consumers can download any song they want off the Internet and 
hear it on a portable player. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, despite an initially defensive response from the  
recording industry to digital downloading, record companies don't 
appear to be in any real danger of losing their position at the top 
of the heap in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, enthusiasm about downloading music has been  
overwhelming. This past week the shares of MP3.com, a company that 
provides free downloads of music, went as high as three times their 
initial offering price, making its 32-year-old CEO Michael 
Robertson a billionaire on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this past week, a two-day conference in New York dealing  
with online music issues drew hundreds of music industry 
professionals, who packed meeting rooms to hear experts discuss the 
latest trends in this emerging arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest is understandable. Thanks to the spreading use of  
MP3, a compression technology that squeezes music data into files 
of a manageable size, for the first time PC users can easily 
download music to their hard drives and play it back whenever they 
want, instead of hearing it just once over the Web with 
``streaming'' technology. 
</P>
<P>
	An even bigger breakthrough came with the introduction of the  
Rio, a portable device that allows users to transfer MP3 files from 
a personal computer, store them and play them back on the 
Walkman-like device. The Rio and other devices like it can hold the 
equivalent of one hour of music, the length of one CD. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the catch: since MP3 was an open standard, it allowed  
anyone to take music from a CD and post it on the Internet, 
allowing an infinite number of perfect copies of the music to be 
made. Unlike analog technology like cassette tapes, where making 
more copies means poorer sound quality, a copy of a digital file is 
identical to the original. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial reaction from the recording industry was hostile.  
Seeing MP3 as a powerful new tool for pirating music, the Recording 
Industry Association of America sued last year to halt the 
distribution of the Rio but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, however, the industry has undergone a major shift in  
attitudes, no longer focusing primarily on the threat of piracy 
posed by the Internet but rather on possibilities for delivering 
music to consumers on their own terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen a shift in the overall attitude toward the piracy  
threat and the opportunities on the Internet. The opportunities 
clearly outweigh the threats now,'' Hilary Rosen, president and CEO 
of the RIAA, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small population of people who use MP3, but they  
signaled a much more aggressive desire for music online than the 
industry realized. But I think that we've caught up,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be fairer to say they are catching up. Sure, the  
industry has made moves to crack down on illegal bootleg sites, but 
the only music that's available on legal sites is mostly from 
obscure bands since major record labels are still leery to release 
music in the unsecure MP3 format. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to offer a better alternative, the record labels last year  
launched the Secure Digital Music Initiative, an effort to produce 
uniform technical standards to allow secure, non-copiable versions 
of music to be downloaded and played. But many details have yet to 
be worked out, and it may be a few years before all the pieces are 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, several labels are hedging their bets by making  
separate deals with technology companies like IBM and Microsoft to 
offer downloaded music in a secure format. Warner Music Group has 
just begun offering downloads of singles from major artists at 
popular retail sites like CDNow, and Sony plans to make similar 
offerings later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	For now there are several secure formats for downloads, but  
they're all different. What's more, current versions of the Rio 
player only play files in the MP3 format. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics makers are hoping to get the next generation of  
playback devices in stores by Christmas, but it is likely to take 
more time for the industry to agree on one secure format. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing here is the very, very first stage of  
something that will take a few years,'' says Paul Vidich, executive 
vice president of Warner Music Group. ``Within about two years, the 
consumer will be able to go to any online music store, get and play 
any music they want, and it should all be transparent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some are predicting that digital downloading could take even  
longer to become commonplace. Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at 
Forrester Research, says that downloaded music could build up to 
some $1 billion by 2003, still a fraction of the overall $40 
billion worldwide market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I think the industry is aware that digital delivery  
is definitely in their future,'' Hardie said. ``Unfortunately, we 
have a ways to go before it's a reality.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Buys Back Supercomputer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department's Sandia National  
Laboratory last week bought back a supercomputer it had sold as 
surplus to Korber Jiang, a Chinese citizen who is the principle of 
EHI Group USA and exports American goods to his home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called Friday for Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson's resignation, saying that the computer could have been 
used ``to design nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going around the country saying there are no problems in  
the Department of Energy, that everything is under control,'' 
Weldon said in a telephone interview. ``If there are no problems, 
then how can this happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Singer, a spokesman for Sandia National Laboratories, said  
that the New Mexico facility sold the Intel Paragon XPS to Korber's 
one-man company for $30,000 in October. After discovering Korber's 
nationality, Singer said, the department bought back the computer 
for $88,000 last week and stored it under guard at Sandia. The 
spokesman said the difference in cost may have been due to shipping 
costs incurred by Korber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Richardson has instituted a moratorium on any sales  
of surplus material that incorporates export control technology 
until there has been a thorough review of what happened,'' said 
Energy Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction was first reported by Insight Magazine.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Known in Hollywood for dressing down, Janeane  
Garofalo is proud to say she just doesn't care, even if that means 
she'll never be a major movie star. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Friend Blasts Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In life, late baseball Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio  
closely guarded his privacy. Now some of his confidential medical 
charts have been found mixed with hospital documents being used in 
a court case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such an invasion of privacy for such a private man,''  
said Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney. 
``What's more sacred than your hospital records?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The records were among medical papers submitted as evidence in  
the case of a mother accused of deliberately making her daughter 
sick to get attention and sympathy for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio and Kathy Bush's daughter, Jennifer, were both treated  
at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. DiMaggio died in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake was discovered Friday when attorneys for both sides  
gathered to view the hospital documents. Mrs. Bush's attorneys are 
now arguing the mistake is evidence the hospital mishandled the 
girl's records. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital called the mistake a clerical error, apologized for  
the sloppiness and said it is reviewing its procedures to prevent 
other mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said he plans to sue to obtain DiMaggio's records from  
the hospital to keep them safe.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Pres. Denies Oil Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president, in a letter to  
President Clinton, denied charges his country was flooding the U.S. 
market with cheap oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has never been, nor is, Venezuela's strategy,'' President  
Hugo Chavez said in the letter, obtained by The Associated Press on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of small U.S. oil companies based in Oklahoma filed  
a ``dumping'' complaint last month with the Commerce Department, 
accusing Venezuela, Iraq, Mexico and Saudi Arabia of selling 
petroleum on the U.S. market at prices below costs of production. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action is totally contrary to the free market and to the  
close energy relationship that has benefited our countries,'' 
Chavez said in the letter, sent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Commerce Department finds in favor of the U.S. companies,  
it could impose tariffs on the imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico as the No. 1  
exporter of oil to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Flynt To Fight Complaint Vs. Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Larry Flynt doesn't intend to move his adult  
bookstore out of a downtown building without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hustler magazine publisher is planning to fight a complaint  
filed by the city against his store. The complaint was filed 
Thursday after Flynt refused an eviction notice to vacate the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's attorney, H. Louis Sirkin, said city officials are  
trying to force his client out because they do not approve of the 
Hustler Books, Magazines &AMP; Gifts store. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attempt to silence and censor,'' Sirkin said. ``We're  
going to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant City Solicitor Geri Hernandez Geiler said the store is  
occupying the building illegally. She said the city now owns the 
building and it must make room for an arts center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not trying to run any of those businesses in that area  
out of town,'' Ms. Geiler said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Plane Wreckage Transported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTIS AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. (AP) -- Two flatbed trucks under  
police escort transported wreckage from the John F. Kennedy Jr. 
plane crash to the Coast Guard hangar where it will be examined in 
detail by federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga, described as ``twisted  
metal,'' arrived late Friday night, a Coast Guard official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the  
investigation, hopes to learn what happened July 16 that caused the 
plane to dive into the sea off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	However authorities have acknowledged they may never find the  
reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife and 
sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have emerged that there was no mechanical failure in the  
engine or with the craft's propellers. CBS news reported Friday 
night that preliminary reports showed pilot error is suspected to 
be the cause behind the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, only one regional investigator would be assigned to  
examine the cause of a small plane crash, NTSB spokesman Paul 
Schlamm told the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kennedy crash, a team of eight or nine people will  
investigate, Schlamm said, including specialists such as 
metallurgists, meteorologists and structures experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board will examine all the available parts to figure  
out how the plane broke up -- and the cause of the break-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it an impact break? Was there a crack? Was there something  
pre-existing?'' Schlamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are also examining radar data from five states to  
create a more accurate picture of the plane's path before it 
crashed about 7 miles off the coast of Aquinnah. They will analyze 
the plane's history and maintenance records as well as Kennedy's 
pilot experience for more clues to the flight's final records. 
</P>
<P>
	No more of the plane's debris is expected to be recovered, Navy  
Lt. Cmdr. Victor Beck said. About 90 percent of the wreckage has 
been removed from the ocean floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's aboard that's coming aboard,'' Beck said. ``The  
Navy's work here is done.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Smoltz Off Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves reinstated right-hander  
John Smoltz from the 15-day disabled list and designated 
right-hander John Hudek for assignment on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, sidelined with a strained right elbow, was scheduled to  
make his 16th start of the season against the Philadelphia Phillies 
on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 8-3 with a 3.49 ERA before going on the disabled list  
July 5. He made two rehab appearances at Double-A Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz was on the disabled list with the same injury from May 17  
to June 1. When he returned, Smoltz went 4-3 with a 4.76 ERA before 
going back on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz began the year in stellar fashion as he went 4-0 with a  
1.51 ERA in his first five starts, earning him NL pitcher of the 
month honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek compiled an 0-1 mark with a 6.48 ERA in 15 games after  
being acquired by the Braves. The right-hander struggled with his 
control, walking 11 and allowed 21 hits in 16 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Urges Daewoo to Sell Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A top government economic policy maker  
urged South Korea's troubled Daewoo Group on Saturday to accelerate 
selling off assets to improve its severe cash shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Economy and Finance Minister Kang Bong-kyun was the second  
senior government official to warn that if Daewoo does not move 
quickly to resolve its financial woes, it could drag down the 
entire economy. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung has urged the nation's bloated  
conglomerates to slim down. Other conglomerates have sold assets 
and refocused on profitability, but Daewoo has continued to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo has an estimated $50 billion in debt against $65 billion  
in total assets. It must unload most of its 40 subsidiaries to pay 
the debts, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, narrowly  
escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever bankruptcy early this 
week when creditors agreed to delay for six months repayment of 
$8.3 billion in short-term debt and to extend $3.3 billion in new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubts persisted over Daewoo's commitment and ability to  
unload the subsidiaries within six months. Korean stock prices 
plunged by 7.3 percent on Friday -- the third-largest drop in the 
stock market's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to contain the panic, Lee Hun-jai, head of the  
government's Financial Supervisory Commission, said Friday that 
credit banks will help Daewoo's restructuring by selling $8.42 
billion of Daewoo stock and real estate the conglomerate put up as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of subsidiaries will also help Daewoo raise funds to  
improve the financial standing of its two main companies -- the 
flagship trading arm Daewoo Corp. and Daewoo Motors, the country's 
No. 2 car maker, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit banks will begin converting unpaid loans into equity to  
lower Daewoo's debt and make the subsidiaries more attractive for 
sale, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daewoo share owners and credit banks could suffer losses  
because some Daewoo subsidiaries will have to reduce their capital 
to make them more attractive for sale, Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' QB Has Sore Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ryan Leaf's season might have ended just 20  
minutes into the San Diego Chargers' first practice of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback, coming off a troubled rookie season, is  
scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his throwing shoulder 
Monday, and could be out 3-4 months or all season, depending on the 
extent of the muscle tear. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, benched after nine starts last year, injured his shoulder  
in June when he jumped on a fumble during a workout. Twenty minutes 
into the team's first training camp practice Friday, he complained 
of shoulder pain when throwing a deep pass. He was taken for an MRI 
exam, which detected the torn labrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf underwent X-rays after the June injury, but not an MRI.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't to the point where I felt like there was something  
really seriously wrong,'' he said. ``I just threw every day, and it 
didn't bother me lifting weights. I'm just that type of hard-nosed 
person that I say I'm not hurt until I guess the doctor says so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The development came one day after the Chargers added a second  
veteran, Erik Kramer, to a quarterback corps that already included 
Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, Kramer was sidelined for the last half of 1998  
while with Chicago after suffering a torn labrum in his throwing 
shoulder and a knee injury, both of which required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said he tried to keep playing after he was hurt last  
year, but it got progressively worse, and he finally had to shut 
down. After having surgery in December, he was told his rehab would 
be four months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can feel the effects of it up to a year,'' said Kramer,  
who admitted after the morning practice that he was rusty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't wish this on anybody,'' Kramer said. ``He'll be  
fine, but the hard part is coming in here daily while everyone else 
is playing and having to rehab and lose time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said that while the long-term outlook is bright, ``right  
now, he's got to be bumming because he's losing all this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on what they learn Monday, the Chargers will  
eventually have to decide whether to keep Leaf on the active roster 
or put him on injured reserve, which means he'd be lost for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were in a position where we needed him at that time and  
he was healthy and ready to go, I don't see why we couldn't do 
that,'' coach Mike Riley said. ``So I would not discount that. But 
at the same time, if we're rolling along and everything's going 
good and we have all our quarterbacks healthy, then maybe the best 
thing would be to not play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf was on the verge of tears as he met with reporters two  
hours after he got the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football's my love; it's all I've lived for the last six  
years. When they say you can't even do that, it feels like your 
heart's torn out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft, Leaf signed a  
$31.25 million contract that included an $11.25 million signing 
bonus. He threw 15 interceptions and just two touchdown passes, and 
made news with boorish off-field behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh and Kramer took almost all the snaps Friday, which is  
what the Chargers envisioned for the regular season even before 
Leaf was hurt. Some of their passes went to All-Pro linebacker 
Junior Seau, who might be used as a tight end in certain schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Whelihan, who started the final seven games last year  
after Leaf was benched, now finds his job secure. He likely would 
have been cut at some point had Leaf not been hurt. Leaf and 
Whelihan combined for 34 interceptions last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in Friday's first practice, Kramer threw a  
wounded-duck pass, prompting a fan to yell, ``Quack quack!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have seen me throwing three weeks ago, I don't  
think that would have raised any eyebrows,'' Kramer said. ``I think 
I've got enough experience that things seem to come fairly quickly. 
My main focus is to get back 100 percent where I'm not feeling any 
effects from my rehab.''

	AMITE, La. (AP) -- Oliver Stone apparently has agreed to give a  
deposition in a lawsuit accusing his movie, ``Natural Born 
Killers,'' of triggering a violent attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone and his lawyers plan to be in Louisiana later this year to  
testify in the case, according to the lawyer for the plaintiffs, 
Joe Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson is suing Stone and Time Warner, the movie's distributor,  
on behalf of the family of Patsy Byers. The convenience store clerk 
was shot four years ago and left paralyzed from an attack by Sarah 
Edmonson and Benjamin Darras. 
</P>
<P>
	Byers died of cancer in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Edmonson and Darras are each serving 35-year prison sentences.

<HEADLINE> Donor-List Flap Has PBS in the Soup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- List-swapping is routine in the business of  
asking for money, which is why a donation sent to one organization 
often draws mail from others. It also is why public broadcasting is 
in trouble with the Republican Congress over trades with the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stations swapped names with Republican organizations, too,  
officials of public TV and radio told a critical House panel. They 
said either way, it shouldn't have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was deals with the Democrats that started the  
controversy, and that's the real problem for public broadcasting, 
which gets about 20 percent of its budget from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a few Republicans always thought public broadcasting  
catered to liberals and so leaned Democratic. Case proved, some of 
them are saying now. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no single boss in public broadcasting. The private,  
nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes federal 
funds to the 353 public television and 694 public radio stations, 
the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Public 
broadcasting officials said they do not condone list deals with 
partisan political organizations and told a House panel that they 
are asking stations to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin S. Duggan, president of PBS, called it ``embarrassing and  
downright stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practice surfaced after a woman put her 4-year-old son's  
name on a donation to Boston's public television station and he 
then got a fund-raising letter from the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The station blamed staff mistakes, although it had dealt with  
the Democrats on donor names before. Then stations in other major 
cities, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles, said they'd 
traded member-donor lists with political groups, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy came as the House Commerce Committee worked on a  
bill authorizing increased federal spending on public broadcasting 
over the next five years. Because of it, the Republican sponsor of 
that bill is reducing the offer. Public broadcasting is getting 
about $250 million this year. The rest of its money comes from 
state governments, foundations, corporations and individual donors 
-- the people on those lists. 
</P>
<P>
	There were Republican complaints about public television before  
any of this, assertions that its programs are tilted to liberal 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations to public broadcasting qualify for charitable tax  
deductions, and organizations with that status are barred from 
involvement in partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert T. Coonrod, president of the corporation, said that the  
list dealing was wrong but not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a House subcommittee on Tuesday that a survey of 75 big  
market stations showed that 53 used brokers to exchange membership 
lists with other nonprofit organizations and that 26 had dealt with 
political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The people involved said there was no partisan motive. Their  
problem is that list-trading usually involves organizations that 
are likely to share interests and attitudes. So the Democratic 
swaps fit Republican claims that public broadcasting leans left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the beginning, there has been a close relationship  
between the public broadcasting service and what many of us 
perceive as the liberal agenda,'' Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., told 
the House. ``Now we have discovered that there is more than just an 
ideological connection between PBS and the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An overstatement, but one that tells the direction the debate  
will take. 
</P>
<P>
	Since they took control of Congress, Republicans have pruned  
spending for public TV and radio, saying public broadcasting should 
be moving toward self-support -- which, in turn, would mean more 
reliance on donations from the people on those lists. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, public broadcasting has been drawing praise as  
an oasis in the violent programming of commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Tom Bliley, chairman of the Commerce Committee,  
said on June 30 -- before the list-swapping flap -- that it is 
``swimming against the tide of the coarse programming that has 
become the staple of commercial broadcasting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley also said public broadcasting should eventually be able  
to pay its own way, without federal subsidies, ``self-sufficient, 
free of the strings that always are attached to government 
handouts.'' 
</P>

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Two pleasure boats, one without its  
lights on, slammed into each other on the Ohio River, killing at 
least two people and injuring two more in a late-night accident, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers on Saturday used sonar in the murky, 30-foot-deep water  
to search for two more possible victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday when the river was  
still crowded with boaters out on excursions on the hot, muggy 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were two boats, one going upriver and one downriver,  
that had a head-on collision,'' said Officer Aaron Graham, a 
Louisville police spokesman. ``We know that the downriver boat did 
not have its running lights on, and that may be a contributing 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both victims were from the boat without lights and police  
believe there may have been up to four people on board. That boat 
was ripped apart on impact and sank. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if alcohol was a factor.

Department's acting counterterrorism coordinator said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The character of international terrorism has shifted somewhat  
since 1980, when Americans were being held hostage in the U.S. 
Embassy in Iran, Michael Sheehan told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups involved in the bombing nearly a year ago of U.S.  
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, he said, 
``are more in the mold of the new terrorist threat -- groups that 
are often self-financed with less direct linkage to state 
sponsors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears for the safety of diplomats and other Americans abroad  
have grown with the approach of the Aug. 7 anniversary of the 
bombings, which killed 224 people including 12 Americans and 
injured thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing connection of narcotics trafficking and terrorism can  
be seen around the globe, Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see it in Colombia, all the way through the Bekaa  
Valley in the Middle East, all the way out to South Asia and in 
Afghanistan and in other parts of the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan spoke at his confirmation hearing Friday. He is the  
Clinton administration's nominee to hold the job permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's terrorists also are more violent. ``These terrorists  
want a `body count,''' Sheehan said. ``For this reason, our efforts 
against terrorism must remain strong and consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because domestic U.S. anti-terrorism measures are strong, he  
said, terrorist groups still prefer to attack targets outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan promised that if he is confirmed, his top priority will  
be to bring to justice the bombers responsible for the attack 
against the embassies in East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the State Department said the U.S. Embassy in Chad  
reopened Friday, a day after it was closed because of a telephoned 
bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-hour search of the building uncovered nothing, spokesman  
James P. Rubin said. He said embassy management decided to suspend 
operations for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Mozambique remained closed for a  
fifth day Friday because of security concerns. The State Department 
has declined to discuss specific reasons for the shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Niners Deal With Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- After more than a week of  
negotiations, the 49ers and Lawrence Phillips appear ready to 
conclude a deal that would bring the controversial running back to 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh said Friday he plans to finalize the  
deal with Phillips by Monday, when the 49ers open training camp at 
the University of the Pacific in Stockton. He said he didn't 
foresee any stumbling blocks to signing Phillips unless another 
team jumps in and ups the ante. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source close to the team said the 49ers already were  
making arrangements for a news conference Monday to announce 
Phillips' acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be close at this point,'' Walsh said. ``We've  
been exchanging proposals and evaluating them for some time. We're 
close, but it's not complete. If we sign anything, it will be done 
on Monday, along with our draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other clubs,'' Walsh added. ``And you never know.  
Like with Charles Haley, right at the 11th hour, the new owner of 
the Redskins flew him to Washington just like that and we were a 
little shaky there. And then he refused, and came back and joined 
us. But things like that can always happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, released previously by the St. Louis Rams and Miami  
Dolphins because of spotty play and off-field problems, drew 
renewed interest from NFL teams after starring for Barcelona of NFL 
Europe. In what was a trouble-free campaign for Phillips this 
spring, he rushed for 1,021 yards and 14 touchdowns in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers reportedly have offered Phillips a two-year,  
incentive-laden deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo and Green Bay were also competing with the 49ers for the  
services of Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a league source, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the other suitors were fading from the picture and Phillips 
had zeroed in on San Francisco, which has a void at running back 
because of the loss of Garrison Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, who set a team record by rushing for 1,570 yards last  
season, has circulatory complications that have stagnated his 
recovery from a broken left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors planned to operate on Hearst's lower left leg today to  
try to stimulate blood flow to the damaged area. Hearst, hurt on 
the first play of a playoff loss at Atlanta last January, is 
expected to miss most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips would compete with Charlie Garner, signed last week as  
a free agent, along with Travis Jervey, to become the 49ers' top 
running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, who once said he would never have drafted Phillips  
because of his history of violence, has conceded acquiring him 
would be a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh also acknowledged earlier this week that the 49ers have  
gotten some negative feedback from fans and ticketholders upset 
over the team's pursuit of Phillips, who assaulted a former 
girlfriend while playing at Nebraska and struck a woman who refused 
to dance with him at a Florida nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have some concern and let's face it, there has to be  
concern on a lot of people's part,'' Walsh said, adding that 
Phillips would be cut at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walsh also believes surrounding Phillips with such veteran  
leaders as Steve Young and Jerry Rice will provide a positive 
influence and ease the expectations on him, giving him the best 
chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody can make this a success, our team can,'' Walsh  
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Japanese Bankers Hid Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Former executives of a failed Japanese bank said  
they hid huge losses to try to make it look like a government 
bailout was working, Kyodo News agency reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. executives, including the former  
chairmen and president, were arrested Friday on suspicion of 
covering up more than $830 million in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives claimed they concealed the problem to avoid  
having to report that the bank had lost money for a third straight 
year, Kyodo said, citing unidentified sources close to the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives said another year of massive losses would have  
shown that a plan by the Ministry of Finance to make the bank 
healthy had failed, Kyodo reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the ministry pressed other financial institutions  
to pitch in $2.1 billion in emergency loans and gave $500 million 
in taxpayers' money in an effort to keep the bank afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Phones rang unanswered at the bank and at prosecutors' offices  
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run broadcaster NHK said Friday the investigation could  
spread to the Finance Ministry, which allegedly knew the bank was 
not disclosing the full extent of its problems but took no steps 
out of fear of provoking a collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests at NCB came a month after prosecutors arrested three  
former top executives of another failed lender, the Long-Term 
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks were taken over by the government last year after  
regulators determined they were insolvent.

<HEADLINE> Indian Plaintiffs Plead to Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge is deciding whether to take  
charge of $500 million in Indian trust funds that the government 
mismanaged for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for account holders who are suing the government asked  
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth on Friday to appoint a special 
master to supervise the cleanup of the 300,000 accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall supervision of this trust reform effort is, as we  
see it, absolutely necessary,'' Thaddeus Holt, an attorney for the 
plaintiffs, said during closing arguments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth is expected to issue a decision in late August or  
September. 
</P>
<P>
	He hinted strongly Friday that he would get involved in some way  
but said he hasn't decided what to do. ``Any court has to be 
concerned about doing such a thing in the least intrusive way to 
get the job done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the judge held Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt and then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt for 
their delay in producing account records sought by the lawsuit's 
lead plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has acknowledged mismanaging the trust funds,  
which distribute money owed individual Indians based on land 
holdings. But Babbitt argued in testimony during the six-week trial 
that the accounting system is being fixed and the records cleaned 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	While Babbitt wouldn't object to reporting to Lamberth  
periodically, greater court supervision could slow down the job, 
Justice Department lawyer Tom Clark told the judge on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials are determined to correct the problems,  
and they already have congressional committees looking over their 
shoulders in addition to the judge, Clark said. ``There is 
supervision out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth turned away criticism of a new computer system that the  
government is installing for managing the trust accounts and 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office has criticized the system, and  
lawyers for the account holders said the department was being too 
hasty in putting in place since it hadn't finished cleaning up the 
records yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that I'm not going to criticize the department  
for going too fast,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust records are scattered in more than 100 Bureau of  
Indian Affairs offices, and many of the accounts are worth only a 
few cents because of the way ownership of Indian land has 
splintered through inheritances. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who is the Interior Department's assistant  
secretary for Indian affairs, told the judge during the trial that 
it would destroy the BIA -- and by extension the government's 
special relationship with tribes -- to lose control of the accounts.

<HEADLINE> Text of Eulogy by Sen. Kennedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the eulogy delivered by John F. Kennedy Jr.'s uncle,  
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass: 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you, President and Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea, for being  
here today. You've shown extraordinary kindness through the course 
of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, when they asked John what he would do if he went into  
politics and was elected president, he said, ``I guess the first 
thing is call up Uncle Teddy and gloat.'' I loved that. It was so 
like his father. 
</P>
<P>
	From the first day of his life, John seemed to belong not only  
to our family, but to the American family. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole world knew his name before he did.  
</P>
<P>
	A famous photograph showed John racing across the lawn as his  
father landed in the White House helicopter and swept up John in 
his arms. When my brother saw that photo, he exclaimed, ``Every 
mother in the United States is saying, 'Isn't it wonderful to see 
that love between a son and his father, the way that John races to 
be with his father.' Little do they know, that son would have raced 
right by his father to get to that helicopter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But John was so much more than those long ago images emblazoned  
in our minds. He was a boy who grew into a man with a zest for life 
and a love of adventure. He was a pied piper who brought us all 
along. He was blessed with a father and mother who never thought 
anything mattered more than their children. 
</P>
<P>
	When they left the White House, Jackie's soft and gentle voice  
and unbreakable strength of spirit guided him surely and securely 
to the future. He had a legacy, and he learned to treasure it. He 
was part of a legend, and he learned to live with it. Above all, 
Jackie gave him a place to be himself, to grow up, to laugh and 
cry, to dream and strive on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	John learned that lesson well. He had amazing grace. He accepted  
who he was, but he cared more about what he could and should 
become. He saw things that could be lost in the glare of the 
spotlight. And he could laugh at the absurdity of too much pomp and 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved to travel across the city by subway, bicycle and roller  
blade. He lived as if he were unrecognizable, although he was known 
by everyone he encountered. He always introduced himself, rather 
than take anything for granted. He drove his own car and flew his 
own plane, which is how he wanted it. He was the king of his 
domain. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought politics should be an integral part of our popular  
culture, and that popular culture should be an integral part of 
politics. He transformed that belief into the creation of 
``George.'' John shaped and honed a fresh, often irreverent 
journal. His new political magazine attracted a new generation, 
many of whom had never read about politics before. 
</P>
<P>
	John also brought to ``George'' a wit that was quick and sure.  
The premier issue of ``George'' caused a stir with a cover 
photograph of Cindy Crawford dressed as George Washington with a 
bare belly button. The ``Reliable Source'' in The Washington Post 
printed a mock cover of ``George'' showing not Cindy Crawford, but 
me dressed as George Washington, with my belly button exposed. I 
suggested to John that perhaps I should have been the model for the 
first cover of his magazine. Without missing a beat, John told me 
that he stood by his original editorial decision. 
</P>
<P>
	John brought this same playful wit to other aspects of his life.  
He campaigned for me during my 1994 election and always caused a 
stir when he arrived in Massachusetts. Before one of his trips to 
Boston, John told the campaign he was bringing along a companion, 
but would need only one hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Interested, but discreet, a senior campaign worker picked John  
up at the airport and prepared to handle any media barrage that 
might accompany John's arrival with his mystery companion. John 
landed with the companion all right -- an enormous German shepherd 
dog named Sam he had just rescued from the pound. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved to talk about the expression on the campaign worker's  
face and the reaction of the clerk at the Charles Hotel when John 
and Sam checked in. 
</P>
<P>
	I think now not only of these wonderful adventures, but of the  
kind of person John was. He was the son who quietly gave 
extraordinary time and ideas to the Institute of Politics at 
Harvard that bears his father's name. He brought to the institute 
his distinctive insight that politics could have a broader appeal, 
that it was not just about elections, but about the larger forces 
that shape our whole society. 
</P>
<P>
	John was also the son who was once protected by his mother. He  
went on to become her pride -- and then her protector in her final 
days. He was the Kennedy who loved us all, but who especially 
cherished his sister Caroline, celebrated her brilliance, and took 
strength and joy from their lifelong mutual admiration society. 
</P>
<P>
	And for a thousand days, he was a husband who adored the wife  
who became his perfect soul mate. John's father taught us all to 
reach for the moon and the stars. John did that in all he did -- and 
he found his shining star when he married Carolyn Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	How often our family will think of the two of them, cuddling  
affectionately on a boat, surrounded by family -- aunts, uncles, 
Caroline and Ed and their children, Rose, Tatiana, and Jack, 
Kennedy cousins, Radziwill cousins, Shriver cousins, Smith cousins, 
Lawford cousins -- as we sailed Nantucket Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Then we would come home, and before dinner, on the lawn where  
his father had played, John would lead a spirited game of touch 
football. And his beautiful young wife, the new pride of the 
Kennedys, would cheer for John's team and delight her nieces and 
nephews with her somersaults. 
</P>
<P>
	We loved Carolyn. She and her sister Lauren were young  
extraordinary women of high accomplishment -- and their own 
limitless possibilities. We mourn their loss and honor their lives. 
The Bessette and Freeman families will always be part of ours. 
</P>
<P>
	John was a serious man who brightened our lives with his smile  
and his grace. He was a son of privilege who founded a program 
called Reaching Up to train better caregivers for the mentally 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Wall Street executives on the Robin Hood Foundation to  
help the city's impoverished children. And he did it all so 
quietly, without ever calling attention to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	John was one of Jackie's two miracles. He was still becoming the  
person he would be, and doing it by the beat of his own drummer. He 
had only just begun. There was in him a great promise of things to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish Ambassador recited a poem to John's father and mother  
soon after John was born. I can hear it again now, at this 
different and difficult moment: 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to the new child,  
</P>
<P>
	A heart that can be beguiled,  
</P>
<P>
	By a flower,  
</P>
<P>
	That the wind lifts,  
</P>
<P>
	As it passes.  
</P>
<P>
	If the storms break for him,  
</P>
<P>
	May the trees shake for him,  
</P>
<P>
	Their blossoms down.  

</P>
<P>
	In the night that he is troubled,  
</P>
<P>
	May a friend wake for him,  
</P>
<P>
	So that his time be doubled,  
</P>
<P>
	And at the end of all loving and love  
</P>
<P>
	May the Man above,  
</P>
<P>
	Give him a crown.''  

</P>
<P>
	We thank the millions who have rained blossoms down on John's  
memory. He and his bride have gone to be with his mother and 
father, where there will never be an end to love. He was lost on 
that troubled night, but we will always wake for him, so that his 
time, which was not doubled, but cut in half, will live forever in 
our memory, and in our beguiled and broken hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John  
Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by 
his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	We who have loved him from the day he was born, and watched the  
remarkable man he became, now bid him farewell. 
</P>
<P>
	God bless you, John and Carolyn. We love you and we always will.

<HEADLINE> EPA Unveiling New Air Quality Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revamping a 2-decade-old system, the  
Environmental Protection Agency is issuing a new air quality index 
that gives more detailed health warnings on the harms of air 
pollution and ways people can protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was announcing the new index today at a  
groundbreaking for a children's hospital in New York City. He said 
a category added to the chart would particularly benefit children 
with asthma and others with special respiratory conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new air quality index is a critical tool Americans need to  
protect their health,'' Gore said in prepared remarks. ``It will 
empower parents and communities to protect children, particularly 
the 6 million children who suffer from asthma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The air quality index is used by local weather forecasters and  
others to gauge the health effects of air pollution on a given day. 
Pollution measurements are divided into ranges and a health 
advisory is given based on the day's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current standards have not been updated since their  
introduction in 1976 and are not always used consistently, 
according to the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised model is aimed at providing a uniform nationwide  
format that weather forecasters can use to relay information about 
when air pollution poses a health risk and what precautions people 
can take. The index looks at five major air pollutants: smog, soot, 
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in the levels of any or all of these pollutants can  
shift the health protection warning for that day. For example, if 
the index indicates moderate air quality, people who are unusually 
sensitive to pollution are advised to limit their outdoor activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The updated chart adds a new warning for when air quality might  
be unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as children and adults with 
respiratory problems, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also was using the event to urge Congress to pass the  
administration's $68 million plan to attack childhood asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money -- $50 million -- would be used for competitive  
state grants to identify and treat poor children served by Medicaid 
who have asthma. The initiative would help schools educate children 
and parents on how to avoid attacks, support research into 
environmental hazards and pay for a public information campaign.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Search Costs $287,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard incurred costs totaling  
$287,402 in the first two days of the search for John F. Kennedy 
Jr.'s missing aircraft, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The search and rescue effort began early Saturday morning and  
ended when it became clear that Kennedy's plane had crashed into 
the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	That initial search involved patrol boats, helicopters and other  
aircraft stationed along the East Coast, including bases in Cape 
Cod, Mass.; Montauk, N.Y; Newport, R.I.; and Woods Hole, Mass., 
according to Coast Guard spokesman Mike Lapinski. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs include fuel, maintenance and salaries and were  
covered by the Coast Guard's annual congressional appropriation for 
operating expenses, Lapinski said.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Dellucci Having Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder David Dellucci  
said Saturday night that he likely will undergo season-ending 
surgery on his injured left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci said tests have shown the bone in his wrist is damaged  
and he has been told it may be a risk to his career if he continues 
to play. The team has given him a couple of days to decide if he 
wants to rest awhile and try to play, tough it out now or have the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dellucci seemed to be reluctantly realizing that surgery was  
the only logical course. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, I have to accept it, and that may take a couple of  
days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci, one of the team's most popular players, started eight  
of the last 10 games before sitting out the last two. He was 
hitting .516 in those eight starts (16-for-31). For the season, 
Dellucci is batting .394 in 109 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to tell you that ice and rest would fix it up,  
but unfortunately I don't think this is one of those deals,'' 
Dellucci said. ``I can tough it out, but that may be jeopardizing 
my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the wrist bothered him the last two years and worsened  
over the past couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started getting unbearable last week, bad enough for me to  
complain about it, and I don't complain about much,'' Dellucci 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it hurts constantly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even wash my hair with my left hand,'' Dellucci said.  
``The thing that got me worried was it got worse over the All-Star 
break without me doing anything.''

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Fans Try To Stay Cool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- At the original Woodstock, there were warnings  
about bad acid. At Woodstock '99, the admonishments are about water 
-- drink lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers on Saturday tried to push H2O on more than 225,000  
people sweltering in 90-degree-plus temperatures during the second 
day of the three-day megaconcert. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of free water here. There's water all over the  
site. We just have to get people to use it,'' promoter John Scher 
said. ``Without being preachy or lecturing them, we are telling 
concertgoers to drink lots of water, wear hats and use sunscreen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the concert began on Friday, Scher said emergency medical  
crews had treated nearly 1,000 people for heat exhaustion and 
dehydration, and that continued to be the top concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Not crime. Not traffic. Not gatecrashers. Not the growing piles  
of garbage and overflowing portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the heat, the 30th anniversary festival at an  
abandoned military base in upstate New York was running fairly 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one death: a 44-year-old Massachussetts man suffered a  
heart attack overnight at his campsite. The man had been in the 
hospital two weeks ago for heart surgery and state police believed 
his death was unrelated to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	A concertgoer also gave birth. The delivery came at a local  
hospital, not the festival site, officials said. No other 
information was available. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of scattered showers in the forecast Saturday  
might afford concertgoers some relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost unbearable,'' said Angela, an 18-year-old from New  
Hampshire, who didn't want to give her last name. She was sporting 
a serious sunburn around her neck and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``But a little heat and sunburn are nothing to put up with for a  
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were water fountains and ``rain rooms'' -- tents with  
sprinklers -- set up throughout the site. At each stage, concert 
workers sprayed those in the front with hoses and passed jugs of 
water back into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain rooms are hard to get into because of the lines,''  
said Kirsty Dawson, 20, of Fishkill, N.Y. ``If I get too hot, I'll 
roll in the mud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the second day began, people continued streaming into  
the concert grounds. About 25,000 people arrived overnight Friday 
and Scher said organizers would continue to sell discounted tickets 
-- now priced at $120 apiece -- as long as people wanted to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
	Six more people were arrested Friday night, bringing the total  
to nine since Thursday. Four of those arrested were driving drunk, 
one was charged with drug possession and another with shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, we're astonished at how few arrests we've  
had,'' said New York State police Major James Parmley. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the musicians performing Saturday were Counting Crows,  
Dave Matthews Band, Alanis Morissette and Metallica.

<HEADLINE>  NFL Camps Include Hope, Holdouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Training camp in the NFL is two-H time -- hope and holdouts.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lions haven't heard from Barry Sanders, who's threatening to  
retire. Marshall Faulk is still negotiating with the Rams, to whom 
he was traded in April because the Colts didn't want the contract 
hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman, one of the league's top receivers, is still  
negotiating with the Packers. And rookie quarterback Cade McNown, 
who's expected to start for the Bears, was a no-show when Chicago 
opened camp Thursday, waiting until contract negotiations are 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	But veterans, even those with their own squabbles, have some  
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as me and all of the other players in the NFL don't  
like training camp, I don't want to miss any time,'' says Jamal 
Anderson, who gained 1,846 yards as Atlanta made its surprise run 
to the Super Bowl last season and is now trying to renegotiate his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every intention of remaining a Falcon. Where else am I  
going to go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By next weekend, all the NFL's camps will be open -- with some  
big holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, for example, opens camp without John Elway, who retired  
after leading the Broncos to two straight Super Bowls titles. Green 
Bay won't gave Reggie White, who left on a high note as NFL 
defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the old go out, there are always the new, players and  
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is the Cleveland Browns, replacing the one Art Modell  
took to Baltimore after the 1995 season. Like Carolina and 
Jacksonville, who began play in 1995, the Browns should be 
respectable: Free agency allowed them to get a number of solid 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all teams, there are those high hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of year, I've never felt as good about what we  
have to do and what we have to do it with,'' says coach Dick 
Vermeil of the Rams, who are 9-23 in his two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Indianapolis, which finished 3-13 last season, is looking  
forward to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always excited at the beginning,'' team president Bill  
Polian says. 
</P>
<P>
	Who could blame him? The Colts have Peyton Manning, who finished  
his rookie season looking like he could be the next Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more on the horizon.  
</P>
<P>
	Five quarterbacks were drafted in the first round last April.  
Two, McNown and Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia, might be instant 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, who's  
the Saints' only draft choice. Mike Ditka gave up the rest of his 
picks because he thinks Williams can carry the ball and his 
otherwise shaky team all the way to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other running backs in the spotlight were Sanders,  
Anderson and Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interesting is Sanders, who will break Walter Payton's  
career rushing record when he runs for 1,458 yards, a little less 
than a normal season's work for him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lions haven't heard from him since early May. He missed  
training minicamp, and the last word Detroit had was from his 
father, William, who said his son was tired of playing with a 
losing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Lions say (hope?) they'll see him in Saginaw Valley,  
Mich., when camp opens Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a holdout has been Barry's MO,'' Detroit coach  
Bobby Ross says. ``If you look at his past history, he's been 
pretty much doing this year what he's done in previous years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams obtained Faulk from the Colts because they assumed they  
could work out the contract hassles that prompted Indianapolis to 
trade him. But they opened camp last Thursday without him. 
</P>
<P>
	But as high as most teams' hopes are, they can be dashed  
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, for example, has been scrambling to find a new  
running back after learning that the ankle Garrison Hearst broke in 
the playoffs last season, may not be healthy until late this year, 
if ever. It will probably be running-back-by-committee until then. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego, which last year went into camp with high hopes for  
Ryan Leaf, taken second to Manning in the draft, is now looking at 
things from a totally different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	As Manning flourished last season, Leaf struggled. He'll would  
have begun the season as the Chargers' third-string quarterback 
behind two veteran free agents, Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer. But 
he injured his shoulder on the first day of camp and could miss the 
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway gone, Denver won't be favored to win a third straight  
Super Bowl, even though Bubby Brister, who will start the season at 
quarterback, was 4-0 last season when Elway was out. 
</P>
<P>
	One good omen for the 36-year-old Brister: Last year's best QBs  
included Randall Cunningham, Chris Chandler, Steve Young and Doug 
Flutie, were all well in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Broncos are rated no higher than third in the AFC behind  
the Jets, whom they beat in the AFC title game last season, and 
Jacksonville, which has been a contender for three of its four 
years in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, which went 15-1 last year only to lose at home to  
Atlanta in overtime of the NFC title game, is probably the favorite 
in the conference. Although the Vikings have lost two of their four 
starters in the secondary and some other key players, they still 
have Cunningham and his wide receivers -- Randy Moss, last year's 
brilliant rookie, and Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta? For whatever reason, their 14-2 record is viewed as  
something of a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost their only deep threat, Tony Martin, who was released  
after being indicted on money-laundering charges and signed by 
Miami. So many things went their way last season that some things 
have to go sour this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they're a good playoff contender.  
</P>
<P>
	After those two, the NFC is anyone's guess. Dallas, Arizona or  
the New York Giants could all win the East, but all are flawed. 
Green Bay has lost a lot but still has Brett Favre, the game's best 
quarterback, which means they're a threat. And San Francisco will 
probably win 10 or more games for the 17th straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there another 1998 Atlanta out there?  
</P>
<P>
	It's training camp. And where there's a camp, there are hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Polian, Ditka and Vermeil.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Campaigns in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKENY, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole sharpened her focus on next  
month's GOP straw poll Saturday, suggesting some campaigns might 
not survive a poor showing in the media-driven event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have made it significant,'' Dole said, meeting  
with reporters after opening her latest campaign trip in Iowa. 
``The press, the media truly have made it significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Republican Party has scheduled the straw poll Aug. 14  
to raise money, but the event has taken on a life of its own and is 
getting huge attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates have responded by stepping up their campaign efforts  
in the state, hoping to avoid an embarrassing showing that could 
dampen fund raising as the opening of the primary season nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole was asked if a strong showing was needed to allow some  
candidates to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe for some. I don't think it is in our campaign,'' Mrs.  
Dole said. ``I don't think it would be do or die. Obviously, we 
want to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole opened an intense-three day trip with a town  
hall-style meeting in Ankeny, where 300 backers showed up to hear 
the stump speech and ask a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
	She was crisscrossing the state repeating that effort, and  
conceded that the emergence of the straw poll have jangled some 
campaign schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, in terms of our time, I'd say we're spending more  
time in Iowa than other places,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``I think right 
now, we're spending more time here than in maybe some of the other 
early states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the candidates are spending very heavily and putting a  
premium on a strong showing. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander 
sent out a fund-raising letter seeking to collect $1 million for 
his straw poll effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to Texas Gov. George W. Bush have said they'll bring 5,000  
people to the event, and publisher Steve Forbes is spending 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said her focus is on the grassroots basics.  
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it's doing what's important in Iowa and New  
Hampshire, which is retail campaigning,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``If that 
is in any way bypassed, it will be pretty serious in terms of the 
future of the caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses, which open the presidential nominating  
season, are followed closely by the nation's first primary in New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole rejected suggestions the straw poll was adding new  
early pressure to the candidates, noting she was campaigning for 
her husband during the last campaign when the GOP ran a similar 
straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same in '96,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``That's one of the  
advantages of having had some experience. To me it's not 
frustrating, because you've got to build toward the caucuses and 
this is part of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically what we were doing long before the straw poll  
kicked in and will be doing long after,'' she said.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Four people were injured Saturday when two  
powerboats collided during a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Two boats were making the final turn of the race near the  
Francis Scott Key Memorial Bridge on the Patapsco River. Footage 
from a news helicopter showed one boat making a turn, while a 
second continued forward, rode over the turning boat's bow and 
flipped.

	Divers jumped into the water to rescue the pilot of the  
overturned boat. The unidentified racer was taken to University of 
Maryland Shock Trauma with possible head and back injuries.

fuel in the water. 
</P>
<P>

	The 19th and next-to-last stage of the Tour de France ended  
Saturday afternoon some 220 miles from Paris, beneath bright skies 
at a science-fiction theme park called Futuroscope. It ended with 
Armstrong winning his fourth stage, probably the sweetest yet, 
since he got to walk off the podium with the leader's yellow jersey 
-- le maillot jaune -- still on his back and an arm draped over the 
shoulder of his just-arrived mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels very special,'' he said afterward, speaking in  
French. ``I wanted to show why I had the yellow jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win gave Armstrong a 7-minute, 37-second lead over his  
closest pursuer, Alex Zulle of Switzerland. Barring a crash or some 
other disaster Sunday, he will roll into Paris about 4 p.m. local 
time, zoom around the Arc de Triomphe, then up and down the wide 
boulevard of the Champs-Elysees to become only the second American 
to win the world's greatest bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's recovery from a deadly form of testicular cancer  
should be one of the best, most joyous comeback stories ever. Just 
2 1/2 years ago, after the disease had spread to his lungs and brain, 
doctors doubted Armstrong would live, let alone recover and compete 
in anything more strenuous than gin rummy. 
</P>
<P>
	But ever since he took control of the race, it has bothered some  
Frenchmen to no end that Armstrong was poised to win the event that 
defines, above all others, sport in their land. And not just 
because he's an American. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's countryman, Greg LeMond, won here three times and is  
still widely adored. But LeMond's family bloodline traces back to 
France, where the Tour originated in 1903. And when he won the 
first time, in 1986, LeMond rode for a French team, and then for 
Belgian teams in his 1989 and 1990 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem for Armstrong is that he's about to win the  
2,306-mile, three-week-long race at a time when the Tour is itself 
recovering from a drug scandal that rocked the sport. Another is 
that for the first time since 1926, a Frenchman will not win even 
one stage of a race they've won a record 36 times -- but not since 
1985. And to top it off, Armstrong comes off sometimes as American 
as American gets. 
</P>
<P>
	He can be blunt where LeMond was boyish, he hails from big, bad  
Texas where LeMond hails from frozen, friendly Minnesota. Worst of 
all, Armstrong rides for an American team. To let folks back home 
know how improbable a victory by an American team rider seems, U.S. 
Postal Service team manager Mark Gorski compared it to a French 
team crossing the Atlantic to win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The strange thing is that Armstrong's opening-stage win was  
greeted with relief. Trying to shake the specter of doping, 
promoters dubbed this year the ``Tour of Redemption.'' And as a 
cancer survivor with no drug allegations clouding his past, 
Armstrong became their poster boy. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no grumbling when he won Stages 1 and 9, both time  
trials over flat courses, because Armstrong was the road-racing 
world champion in 1993. But French newspapers fired up the rumor 
mill on July 13, when he locked up the race with an 
uncharacteristically brilliant ride up into the Alps in Stage 10, 
and haven't shut it down since. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprising thing is how little venom has spilled over into  
the public. Already a hero in the United States, people riding 
bikes around Paris who are stopped for interviews refer to 
Armstrong as ``le miraculeux'' -- the miraculous one -- and a source 
of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, it's not hard to see where the suspicions  
spring from. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, Armstrong wasn't known as a strong mountain  
racer, a necessary component to be the overall Tour champion. But 
he came to France in the wet and cold of last winter to practice 
every stage, including the Alps, applying the same maniacal work 
ethic that surprised his stateside doctors during an arduous 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	French newspapers, though, ignored that, instead suggesting that  
cycling had returned to doping as usual. The tone of the coverage 
shifted 180 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	L`Equipe, the national sports daily, headlined its story ``On  
Another Planet.'' The popular tabloid, France Soir, referred to him 
as ``Stupefying Armstrong.'' They were double-entendres, but the 
newspapers' underlying message was clear: They suspected him of 
using performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode reached a crescendo when the respected daily,  
LeMonde, joined in. Saying it had copies of Armstrong's drug tests 
from the first two days of the race, it accused him of taking a 
banned medication. As it turned out, Armstrong had used a skin 
cream for his saddle sores that contained glucocorticoid, an 
anti-inflammatory steroid commonly used to treat rashes. It had 
nothing to do with performance enhancement and besides, the 
International Cycling Union noted Armstrong had a prescription to 
use it. 
</P>
<P>
	At a televised news conference Wednesday, Armstrong took no  
delight in being right. Instead, his demeanor went from blunt to 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say stress causes cancer,'' he said. ``So if you want to  
avoid cancer, don't come to the Tour de France and wear the yellow 
jersey. It's too much stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he's moved on from there faster than the newspapers, faster  
than the innuendo and whispers, too fast for anything or anybody 
but the winged goddess of victory to lay a hand on him. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Langston Has Yankee Nightmare Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk about horror films.  
</P>
<P>
	When Mark Langston walked out to the mound at Yankee Stadium on  
Saturday, he saw a videotape of a night he'd rather forget: Tino 
Martinez's grand slam off him in Game 1 of last year's World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Langston gave up nine runs in his worst outing in 11 years  
as Cleveland lost to the New York Yankees 21-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre was livid, immediately calling  
upstairs for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Yankees should be above that,'' Torre said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even before he talked about the win, the Yankees' biggest in 46  
years, Torre wanted to send a message to Langston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought it was in bad taste,'' Torre said. ``I have no  
idea who was responsible for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego led the Yankees, an overwhelming favorite, 5-2 in the  
fifth inning of Game 1 last Oct. 17 before Chuck Knoblauch's 
three-run homer off Donne Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	With the bases loaded, Langston went to a 2-2 count on Martinez  
and thought he threw a called third strike by him, but plate umpire 
Richie Garcia called it a ball. Martinez then homered for a 9-5 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing is, they didn't show the 2-2 pitch,'' Langston  
said, showing a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	After the video, Langston walked Chuck Knoblauch and fell down  
trying to field Derek Jeter's bunt, which went for a single. 
</P>
<P>
	Two outs later, Chili Davis hit a two-run single that center  
fielder Kenny Lofton nearly came up with on an attempted diving 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all kind of fell apart from there,'' Langston (1-1) said.  
</P>
<P>
	He allowed nine runs -- seven earned -- and 10 hits in 4 1-3  
innings. It was the most runs off him since Oakland scored nine on 
April 29, 1988, when he was with Seattle. It was the most hits he 
allowed since Detroit got 10 on April 19, 1997, when he was with 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, my stuff wasn't that good,'' Langston said.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Use Smaller Observatory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- With the world's most powerful  
X-ray telescope safely set adrift, the crew of space shuttle 
Columbia today began using a smaller, onboard observatory to gather 
images of planets inside Earth's solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Steven Hawley took ultraviolet snapshots of Jupiter  
using the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System, a telescope-camera 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's five crew members turned their attention to the  
small, onboard observatory and a handful of secondary experiments 
after successfully completing their primary objective: releasing 
the $1.5 billion Chandra Observatory within hours of liftoff early 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A rocket motor then propelled Chandra into an elliptical orbit  
that eventually will have a high point of 87,000 miles, or 
one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle commander Eileen Collins, the first woman to lead a U.S.  
space mission, said she was ``extremely happy'' when she and her 
crew reached orbit and even happier when the Chandra X-ray 
Observatory set off on its mission Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her place in space history, Collins told a TV  
interviewer: ``I guess I'll have to worry about history a little 
bit later. I'm just happy that we pulled this mission off. We still 
have a few more days, so the pressure isn't off yet. But we've got 
a bunch of happy people up here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope release went flawlessly, unlike the shuttle's  
8 1/2-minute climb to orbit seven hours earlier. A short circuit five 
seconds into the flight knocked out a controller on two of the 
three main engines; backup controllers immediately took over on the 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, an Air Force colonel, said she felt ``very confident''  
throughout liftoff, in large part because the problem resembled 
what had been thrown at her during practice sessions on the ground 
in the months and years leading up to the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The electrical problem is not expected to affect the rest of the  
five-day shuttle mission, Collins said. Columbia is set to land at 
Kennedy Space Center in Florida late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller, onboard imaging system being used by Hawley, an  
astronomer as well as an astronaut, is considered a complement to 
larger observatories like Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope 
because of its ability to look at objects close to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was first used in August 1997 to capture more than  
400,000 images of the Hale-Bopp comet, which the Hubble could not 
observe at times because the sun's glare obscured it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though less sensitive than the Hubble, the ultraviolet system  
also has a field of view about 30 times wider than its bigger 
cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the course of Columbia's mission, Hawley is expected to  
gather images of Mercury, Venus and Earth's moon. He is also set to 
use the telescope-camera to search for evidence of vulcanoids, a 
belt of small, asteroid-like bodies which scientists believe 
encircles Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ground controllers finished powering up Chandra's  
instruments late Friday. Next up for the 45-foot telescope is a 
small rocket burn tonight to adjust its orbit, the first of several 
such corrections over the next nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	After three to four weeks of instrument calibrations, Chandra  
will transmit its first images back to Earth.

<HEADLINE> Donor-List Flap Has PBS in the Soup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- List-swapping is routine in the business of  
asking for money, which is why a donation sent to one organization 
often draws mail from others. It also is why public broadcasting is 
in trouble with the Republican Congress over trades with the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stations swapped names with Republican organizations, too,  
officials of public TV and radio told a critical House panel. They 
said either way, it shouldn't have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was deals with the Democrats that started the  
controversy, and that's the real problem for public broadcasting, 
which gets about 20 percent of its budget from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a few Republicans always thought public broadcasting  
catered to liberals and so leaned Democratic. Case proved, some of 
them are saying now. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no single boss in public broadcasting. The private,  
nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes federal 
funds to the 353 public television and 694 public radio stations, 
the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Public 
broadcasting officials said they do not condone list deals with 
partisan political organizations and told a House panel that they 
are asking stations to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin S. Duggan, president of PBS, called it ``embarrassing and  
downright stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practice surfaced after a woman put her 4-year-old son's  
name on a donation to Boston's public television station and he 
then got a fund-raising letter from the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The station blamed staff mistakes, although it had dealt with  
the Democrats on donor names before. Then stations in other major 
cities, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles, said they'd 
traded member-donor lists with political groups, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy came as the House Commerce Committee worked on a  
bill authorizing increased federal spending on public broadcasting 
over the next five years. Because of it, the Republican sponsor of 
that bill is reducing the offer. Public broadcasting is getting 
about $250 million this year. The rest of its money comes from 
state governments, foundations, corporations and individual donors 
-- the people on those lists. 
</P>
<P>
	There were Republican complaints about public television before  
any of this, assertions that its programs are tilted to liberal 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations to public broadcasting qualify for charitable tax  
deductions, and organizations with that status are barred from 
involvement in partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert T. Coonrod, president of the corporation, said that the  
list dealing was wrong but not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a House subcommittee on Tuesday that a survey of 75 big  
market stations showed that 53 used brokers to exchange membership 
lists with other nonprofit organizations and that 26 had dealt with 
political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The people involved said there was no partisan motive. Their  
problem is that list-trading usually involves organizations that 
are likely to share interests and attitudes. So the Democratic 
swaps fit Republican claims that public broadcasting leans left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the beginning, there has been a close relationship  
between the public broadcasting service and what many of us 
perceive as the liberal agenda,'' Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., told 
the House. ``Now we have discovered that there is more than just an 
ideological connection between PBS and the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An overstatement, but one that tells the direction the debate  
will take. 
</P>
<P>
	Since they took control of Congress, Republicans have pruned  
spending for public TV and radio, saying public broadcasting should 
be moving toward self-support -- which, in turn, would mean more 
reliance on donations from the people on those lists. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, public broadcasting has been drawing praise as  
an oasis in the violent programming of commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rep. Tom Bliley, chairman of the Commerce Committee,  
said on June 30 -- before the list-swapping flap -- that it is 
``swimming against the tide of the coarse programming that has 
become the staple of commercial broadcasting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley also said public broadcasting should eventually be able  
to pay its own way, without federal subsidies, ``self-sufficient, 
free of the strings that always are attached to government 
handouts.''

<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Lauren Bessette, the Kennedy plane crash  
victim the world knew least, was remembered Saturday as 
intelligent, spiritual and caring -- ``an enormously complex woman 
whom we all loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still see Lauren, tall and gracefully talking with those  
adorably quirky hand gestures,'' her uncle Dr. Jack Messina told 
about 400 guests who attended a private candlelight service for the 
34-year-old investment banker and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see her tossing that long shiny hair and hear her laughter.  
I sense her vitality and her strength and her love. We shall miss 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hour and a half long service, attended by many Kennedys, was  
a final, heartfelt farewell to the two sisters who perished with 
John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly, the candlelight service was held in the name of  
Lauren -- the ``other Bessette'' -- although prayers were also 
offered for Carolyn, 33 and John, 38. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Carolyn and John were meaningfully eulogized by Hamilton  
South and Senator Ted Kennedy at yesterday's memorial service. It 
was no easy task for them to reflect on the lives of Carolyn and 
John within a limited time frame, and I find it equally daunting to 
share with you in the short time we have together the essence of my 
niece, Lauren, an enormously complex woman whom we all loved,'' 
Messina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brilliant and beautiful, Lauren earned her business degree from  
the prestigious Wharton School of Business at the University of 
Pennsylvania. She rose rapidly in the world of international 
finance and worked for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York for 
eight years. She specialized in Asian investments and was based in 
Hong Kong until about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a good friend, a very dear friend,'' said Krista  
Trattnig, who studied Chinese with Lauren in Hong Kong and flew in 
from Austria for the service. What do you think when your friend 
dies?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would probably never have been buried at sea -- in a stately  
ceremony aboard a Navy destroyer with a folded American flag -- 
except for the fact that her glamorous 33-year-old sister had 
married a Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In tribute, and recognition, the Kennedy clan flocked to the  
service, described as ``tearful and joyful'' by the Rev. Rev. Hugh 
Tudor-Foley, one of three celebrants. Mourners included JFK Jr.'s 
sister Caroline Kennedy, uncle Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, aunts Ethel 
Kennedy and Jean Kennedy Smith, cousins Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 
Maryland's lieutenant governor, Douglas Kennedy, Maxwell Kennedy, 
Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo as well as Rory Kennedy and her 
fiance, Mark Bailey, whose wedding was postponed by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Freeman, the Bessette sisters' mother, and Dr. Richard  
Freeman, their stepfather arrived early, along with Lisa Ann, 
Lauren's twin. The parents attended a separate service for Kennedy 
and his wife in New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The services included brief tributes from friends and hymns that  
reflected Lauren's love of opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their departure has left an enormous void in all our lives and  
has touched the lives of millions,'' Messina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Christ Church, people gathered to show support for the  
family, leaving bouquets and hand-written notes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Dall, a former high school classmate of Lauren's, placed  
flowers on a makeshift memorial. Although he hadn't seen her since 
they graduated from Greenwich High School in 1982, he felt 
compelled to pay his respects. ``We're here to show the family our 
hearts are with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were beautiful people,'' said Idoline Kearns of  
Larchmont, NY, who arrived mid-afternoon with her husband, Richard. 
``We feel we have an obligation to sit here, three or four hours. 
We're here for both families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others reflected on the unspeakable sorrow of parents forced to  
bury two children at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastating,'' said Chuck Morrell, the chief sexton of Christ  
Church, as he helped with preparations at the 90-year-old Gothic 
building earlier in the day. ``Two daughters who were living life 
to the full. No parent should have to bear such a loss,'' Morrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the arched red wooden doors, a hand-scribbled card lay  
beside a bouquet of carnations. 
</P>
<P>
	``John, Carolyn and Lauren,'' the note read. ``Our thoughts and  
prayers are with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to it, a bunch of wildflowers lay over a child's drawing of  
Winnie-the-Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, in a brief, poignant statement, the family  
said it had drawn comfort from the fact that Carolyn and John 
``will comfort Lauren for eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement added, ``Nothing in life is preparation for the  
loss of a child.''

<P>
	``They were beautiful people,'' said Idoline Kearns of  
Larchmont, NY, who arrived mid-afternoon with her husband, Richard. 
``We feel we have an obligation to sit here, three or four hours. 
We're here for both families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others reflected on the unspeakable sorrow of parents forced to  
bury two children at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastating,'' said Chuck Morrell, the chief sexton of Christ  
Church, as he helped with preparations at the 90-year-old Gothic 
building earlier in the day. ``Two daughters who were living life 
to the full. No parent should have to bear such a loss,'' Morrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the arched red wooden doors, a hand-scribbled card lay  
beside a bouquet of carnations. 
</P>
<P>
	``John, Carolyn and Lauren,'' the note read. ``Our thoughts and  
prayers are with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to it, a bunch of wildflowers lay over a child's drawing of  
Winnie-the-Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, in a brief, poignant statement, the family  
said it had drawn comfort from the fact that Carolyn and John 
``will comfort Lauren for eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement added, ``Nothing in life is preparation for the  
loss of a child.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Worker in Critical State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An airline gate agent remained in critical  
condition Saturday, two days after being slammed to the ground by 
an angry passenger at Newark International Airport, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines worker Angelo Sottile, 50, suffered head  
and spinal injuries on Thursday during the brief scuffle with 
passenger John C. Davis, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, of Fredricksburg, Va., was apparently pursuing his  
straying toddler on the walkway leading to a plane, and failed to 
show a boarding pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sottile tried to stop Davis, prompting a violent reaction,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was charged with aggravated assault.  
</P>
<P>
	Port Authority Police Capt. Nicholas Kormash said Davis claims  
he was acting in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Sottile was taken to University Hospital in Newark. He remained  
in critical condition on Saturday, according to a nursing 
supervisor.

<HEADLINE> Ellerbe Wins Pan Am Gold for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Dawn Ellerbe wiped away all the  
disappointments of her international career by winning the first 
gold medal in track and field at the 1999 Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my first Pan Am Games and winning is very special,''  
Ellerbe said Saturday after smashing the meet record in the women's 
hammer throw with a heave of 214 feet, 5 inches on her final 
attempt. Ellerbe's first throw was 208-10. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the second time the event was contested at the  
Games, and five of Ellerbe's six throws surpassed the mark of 193-4 
set by Alexandria Given of the United States in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other track and field finals were scheduled Saturday, the  
opening day of the sport's competition: the men's shot put and 
5,000 meters and the women's long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, Canada edged the United States in women's team  
gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
	The early track competition went to form, as Americans Johnny  
Gray and Trinity Townsend won their semifinal heats in the men's 
800, and Meredith Rainey Valmon, the defending champion in the 
women's 800, and Kathy Rounds qualified for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ellerbe was the star of the show on a steamy afternoon at  
sparsely attended University of Manitoba Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. champion for the past four years and the two-time NCAA  
champion at South Carolina, Ellerbe entered the Pan Am Games a 
prohibitive favorite off her American record of 230-2 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she also had several past failures in international  
meets. She finished seventh in both the 1997 World University Games 
and 1998 Goodwill Games and placed fourth in this year's World 
University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first international title,'' Ellerbe said. ``I put  
in a lot of hard work this year and it paid off. I will take a V -- 
for victory -- any way I can get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to win at the world championships (next month at  
Seville, Spain). That last throw put me on the way toward that. 
Winning the gold here is close to winning the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about what happened today.''  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the other Americans also were pleased with their  
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to run faster than I thought,'' Rainey Valmon said after  
winning her semifinal heat in 2 minutes, 1.95 seconds. ``The track 
is great. It's very fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some tracks look big and are more intimidating than others.  
This one is not intimidating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainey Valmon, the 1999 U.S. champion, ran 1:59.44 in winning  
the Pan Am title four years ago at Mar del Plata, Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to run faster than that in (Sunday's) final,''  
said Rainey Valmon, who also will compete in the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, the remarkable 39-year-old who contemplated retirement 11  
years ago, eased to victory in his heat in 1:47.07. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I think about retirement, there's always another big  
meet that comes along -- the Olympics, world championships, World 
Cup, World University Games -- that I always say I will run one more 
year,'' the enthusiastic Gray said. ``Retirement usually crosses my 
mind about once a year. This year, it's crossed my mind 10 or 15 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't return, I will run Masters races. I'm getting tired  
of running against kids half my age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the major championships that keep him going, Gray  
said he hasn't quit ``because of the respect I get for what I've 
done for track and field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The captain of the U.S. track and field team has run the 800  
under 1:45 a total of 67 times, more than any runner in history. 
</P>
<P>
	At a team meeting prior to the start of the Games, many of the  
other runners were in awe of Gray's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young runners said, `Wow,' we didn't know you had done all  
that,'' the four-time Olympian and 1992 bronze medalist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor that everyone now knows what I've done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Canada beat the favored Americans in women's gymnastics with  
148.944 points. The United States had 148.364 and Brazil took the 
bronze with 147.639. Canada also won the Pan Am gold in 1979, the 
only other year the United States failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not 100 percent prepared,'' U.S. coach Mary Lee Tracy  
said. ``We were doing some new skills, not to mention the world 
championships to think about. But those are excuses. Basically, we 
got beat. They hit more than we did.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faces Argentina in Key Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- There will be no chance of an  
Olympic gold medal in Australia unless the United States wins today 
against Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team plays its most important  
non-Olympic game in seven years, needing a victory to qualify for 
the 2000 Games in Sydney. Not since 1992, the year of the original 
Dream Team, has the United States been forced to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our next game is the most important game that our team could  
ever have to play, to have to qualify with the way this is set 
up,'' coach Larry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal, it's Puerto Rico vs. Canada.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite winning the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, the United  
States has to qualify for the 2000 Games because of its finish in 
the 1998 World Championships. NBA players did not play there 
because of the league's lockout. Yugoslavia won, and the United 
States finished third with CBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	In this tournament, the United States had no problem with  
Argentina in the first round, winning by 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight games overall, the U.S. team won by an average of 32.6  
points and allowed no opponent to score more than 76. The only team 
that kept things tight into the second half was Brazil, which 
pulled within three points before the Americans pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	If there was one memorable moment for the Argentineans in the  
first round, it came when 19-year-old Andres Nocioni threw down a 
dunk over Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's between Kevin Garnett and that man,'' Tim Hardaway  
said, drawing a laugh from Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still wish that kid the best,'' Garnett said Thursday. ``I  
hope he makes the league off that and gets a whole bunch of 
endorsements, to tell you the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canada-Puerto Rico game will be a rematch of what might have  
been the best game in the first two rounds -- Wednesday night's 
five-point victory by Puerto Rico in a game the host team needed to 
win by at least four points to avoid the Americans in the 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Steve Nash made a turnover late in that game,  
preventing Canada from getting off a decent attempt on its final 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be hard for them to beat us twice,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico is shooting for its second consecutive Olympic  
berth. Using many of the same players who are still on the team, 
Puerto Rico finished 10th -- ahead of only Angola and South Korea -- 
in the 12-team 1996 Olympic field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans took the day off Friday, their first rest after  
playing eight games in eight nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are staying in Rio Mar -- almost an hour outside  
San Juan -- and must make a long bus ride before and after every 
game. In addition, they played three consecutive games that started 
at 10 p.m. EDT during the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's 115-76 victory over Puerto Rico was a lift,  
coming before a raucous pro-Puerto Rican crowd of more than 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until Saturday gets here so we can go out and do  
what we have to do,'' Gary Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hardaway: ``We're on a mission -- to go to Australia and  
play in the Olympics. We don't want to give anybody any ideas. We 
want to go out there and play with our minds and our bodies and 
show everybody that we are the best team in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinal winners meet in the gold medal game Sunday at 8  
p.m.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Knocks GOP Tax-Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton, mingling with big-money  
Democratic donors, described the Republicans' tax-cutting plan in 
doomsday terms Saturday, saying it would ``imperil the future 
stability of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio  
address, asserting that the GOP program would soak up money needed 
to fix Social Security, Medicare and other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, a top Republican praised the $792 billion tax cut  
passed last week as returning surplus federal money to the people 
to keep it from being spent in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived early Saturday morning in this swank resort town  
of million-dollar vacation homes for what was supposed to be a 
leisurely weekend of hobnobbing with contributors who gave at least 
$50,000 to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president decided to cut the Colorado weekend short --  
compressing two days of schmoozing into about five hours -- to fly 
overnight to Morocco for Sunday's funeral of King Hassan II. He was 
to be accompanied by his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Hassan as ``a great friend of the peace  
process'' and a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan, who helped forge Middle East peace and ruled Morocco for  
38 years, died Friday of a heart attack at age 70. He was succeeded 
by his son, Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' weekend retreat gave donors a chance to rub  
elbows with Clinton, the first lady and members of his Cabinet. It 
was expected to raise $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Republicans have changed their tune about him,  
saying they can reclaim the White House when he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``After telling everybody for 6 1/2 years what a bad guy I was,  
they're now basically saying, `Oh, well, you know, Bill Clinton is 
like Michael Jordan, he just jumps higher than the other guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Republicans hope that when he's gone, they can  
put the Democrats ``in the cellar again. There's a sort of a 
cynical, political thing. ... I could not have done anything, 
anything in the last six years if our ideas hadn't been right and 
if I hadn't had the help of Al Gore and Hillary and (Sen.) Dianne 
Feinstein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president mixed with donors at a sprawling cedar ``cabin''  
owned by Feinstein of California and her husband, Dick Blum. Under 
a brilliant sun, guests listened to a Western band and strolled 
among aspen trees and wild flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the radio, the president opened up a new line of attack  
against the Republicans' 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their reckless tax plan would threaten law enforcement across  
the board, forcing reductions in the number of federal agents and 
cutting deeply into support for state and local law enforcement,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced the award of $50 million in Justice Department  
grants to hire 680 law enforcement officers in 64 communities. In 
addition, the District of Columbia will get $15 million to hire 200 
new community police officers and 40 new federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the grants, Phoenix will receive $7.5 million to hire 100  
officers; Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., $10.8 million to hire 144 
officers; Detroit $9 million to hire 120 officers; and Austin, 
Texas, $3.7 million to hire 50 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' own radio address credited Americans with  
producing the economic bounty that enables a tax cut at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan helps fix an unfair tax system by making it  
financially easier to get married and save money for children's 
education or other long-term needs, House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would ease taxation on interest accrued from savings  
and reduce the ``marriage penalty,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosperity you created brought us the first budget surplus  
in 39 years,'' he said. ``We must return that money to you so it 
isn't spent in Washington on more big government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an almost straight party-line vote Thursday, the House  
approved a measure that would cut taxes over 10 years. Senate 
Republicans plan to pass a tax cut next week that is the same size 
as the House bill but differs in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has threatened to veto such deep cuts and instead favors  
a tax cut in the range of $250 billion.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux-Penguins Deal Pushed Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Mario  
Lemieux has pushed back to next week his goal of closing a deal to 
buy the financially troubled team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux had been optimistic about wrapping up things by Friday,  
but putting all the documents together was taking longer than 
expected, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing will likely happen sometime next week, attorney Doug  
Campbell told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday, citing the 
volume of work required to finalize the $50 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell did not return calls for comment on Friday, but U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz's office confirmed that the deal 
was still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Markovitz agreed to give Lemieux until Monday to  
secure funding from investors. Lemieux then has until Aug. 5 to 
complete the rest of the transaction, which includes signing a new 
lease with SMG and a new television contract with Fox Sports Net 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, details of a new lease showed the Penguins paying SMG  
$1.8 million a year until 2007 in order to play at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Leeper, executive director of the Public Auditorium  
Authority, said the Penguins would really only pay about $1 million 
a year in rent, because SMG has agreed to pick up game-day expenses 
for the entire regular season -- which should end up costing about 
$800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a fraction of the $6 million to $7 million annually the  
club has shelled out in previous years, a burden many have blamed 
for the team's current predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	However, attorneys continue to negotiate terms of the contract.  
After listening to details of Lemieux's deal with SMG, Markovitz 
issued a memorandum stating that he did not approve a settlement 
between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG attorney Daniel Shapira did not return phone calls Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Part of the pressure to close the deal comes from the NHL. The  
Penguins must start selling tickets and signing player contracts 
for the coming season.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Updated Air Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore tried Saturday to breathe  
fresh air into the nation's 2-decade-old air quality index system, 
saying the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to give more 
detailed health warnings so vulnerable people can protect 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the announcement at the groundbreaking for a children's  
hospital in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	A new category added to the air quality index will bring relief  
to 6 million children with asthma and others with respiratory 
conditions, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new index will provide specific, more detailed  
information, included warnings for those with special health 
conditions such as asthma,'' the vice president added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said local forecasters would deliver a ``uniform, clear,  
understandable measure of daily air quality and the health risks 
associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The new air quality index is a critical tool Americans need to  
protect their health,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many local weather forecasters since 1976 have reported daily on  
the Air Quality Index, which measures the health effects of air 
pollution. Pollution measurements are divided into ranges, and a 
health advisory is given based on the day's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said it wanted changes to the index  
in part because people are not adequately told how to protect 
themselves on days when the air can adversely affect their health. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised model is meant to provide a consistent format for  
weather forecasters to explain when air pollution poses a health 
risk and what precautions can be taken. The new index measures five 
major air pollutants: smog, soot, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide 
and nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats to health from unsafe levels of any or all of these  
pollutants can trigger a health protection warning for that day.

<HEADLINE>  Redskins Sign Bailey for $9.64M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Champ Bailey signed a  
five-year, $9.64 million contract with the Washington Redskins on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey will also receive a $5.2 million signing bonus and has  
additional incentives up to $2.56 million. The cornerback is 
expected to report to the team's opening day of training camp 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He played offense and defense in college and has expressed a  
desire to do likewise in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big relief to get it over with and got it done on  
time,'' Bailey said Saturday at Redskins Park after being 
introduced by new team owner Daniel Snyder. ``I'm glad to be a 
Redskin. Obviously, if you miss any time in training camp, you're 
going to be set back. So I'm very happy to be here for the start of 
camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins coach Norv Turner expressed relief to have Bailey for  
opening day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time he came here in May until mid-July, Champ has  
done a good job in our offseason program,'' Turner said. ``He did a 
great job in our mini-camps and got himself ready. There are very, 
very, very few rookies who are successful if they miss any part of 
training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, a 6-1, 181-pounder, played cornerback and wide receiver  
for Georgia. Defensively, he made 52 tackles, including 30 solos 
and four for losses, with three interceptions and seven pass 
deflections. He returned 12 kickoffs for 261 yards (21.8 average) 
and four punts for 49 yards (12.3). 
</P>
<P>
	As a wide receiver, Bailey had 47 receptions for 744 yards (15.8  
average) and five touchdowns. He also rushed for 84 yards on 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I have goals,'' Bailey said. ``I want to be Rookie  
of the Year. ``But my main goal is to help this team get into the 
playoffs, which hasn't happened for a while. I'm just going to go 
out and do what Coach Turner wants me to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said Bailey won't initially be asked to play on both  
sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it from a standpoint of getting excited about  
having a talented guy who can make a difference in the game, we're 
going to do whatever Champ's capable of doing in terms of him 
helping us somewhere down the road offensively,'' Turner said. ``We 
will not even consider that until he's comfortable in playing at a 
high level as a corner.''

Redskin. Obviously, if you miss any time in training camp, you're 
going to be set back. So I'm very happy to be here for the start of 
camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins coach Norv Turner expressed relief to have Bailey for  
opening day of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time he came here in May until mid-July, Champ has  
done a good job in our offseason program,'' Turner said. ``He did a 
great job in our mini-camps and got himself ready. There are very, 
very, very few rookies who are successful if they miss any part of 
training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, a 6-1, 181-pounder, played cornerback and wide receiver  
for Georgia. Defensively, he made 52 tackles, including 30 solos 
and four for losses, with three interceptions and seven pass 
deflections. He returned 12 kickoffs for 261 yards (21.8 average) 
and four punts for 49 yards (12.3). 
</P>
<P>
	As a wide receiver, Bailey had 47 receptions for 744 yards (15.8  
average) and five touchdowns. He also rushed for 84 yards on 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I have goals,'' Bailey said. ``I want to be Rookie  
of the Year. ``But my main goal is to help this team get into the 
playoffs, which hasn't happened for a while. I'm just going to go 
out and do what Coach Turner wants me to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said Bailey won't initially be asked to play on both  
sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at it from a standpoint of getting excited about  
having a talented guy who can make a difference in the game, we're 
going to do whatever Champ's capable of doing in terms of him 
helping us somewhere down the road offensively,'' Turner said. ``We 
will not even consider that until he's comfortable in playing at a 
high level as a corner.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, AOL Battle Over Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The latest battle between Microsoft Corp. and  
America Online is shaping up over software allowing instantaneous 
message exchanges. And there's a twist: This time it's Microsoft 
that's pushing for an industry standard while AOL is trying to 
maintain its proprietary dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging -- which is as immediate as a phone  
conversation -- is fast becoming one of the hottest ways to 
communicate on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's version, AIM, is currently provided to the company's 17  
million subscribers and also is offered free to other Internet 
users who can download it from the AOL Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	AIM and ICQ (as in ``I seek you''), another instant message  
service AOL bought for $235 million last year, have a combined 80 
million users. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the computer industry have asked AOL to make its instant  
messaging technology an ``open standard'' which would allow other 
companies to write software that would interface with the AOL 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The company so far has refused, mostly for economic reasons,  
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, AOL pretty much owns the instant message service,''  
said Rob Enderle, an electronic communications consultant with Giga 
Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Thursday, Microsoft released MSN Messenger Service,  
which offered instant messaging with AIM users via the Microsoft 
Network site. 
</P>
<P>
	That allowed any Internet user to get a free Hotmail account and  
a free AIM account for instant messaging through MSN or AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike AIM, MSN Messenger carries no advertising and has no  
immediate plans for any, but there is room for ads in the MSN 
window, said Deanna Sanford, a lead products manager in MSN's 
marketing division. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first day of its release, the software was downloaded by  
200,000 users, second only to the 202,000 downloads of Internet 
Explorer 5.0 on the Web browser's release day, Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL electronically blocked Microsoft's program but MSN posted a  
revised version. AOL retaliated with another block on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of midday Saturday, Sanford said Microsoft's latest revision  
was getting around the AOL blocks again. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL officials did not return messages left at their homes and  
offices Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said that to  
determine which AOL users are online, the Microsoft product enters 
AOL's servers in a way that violates its copyrights and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that Microsoft requires AOL users to enter their  
screen name and password. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford denied any wrongdoing or privacy risk, saying the screen  
name and password are not retained in Microsoft server computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is among about 40 companies -- AOL not among them --  
that proposed a standard within the Internet Engineering Task Force 
about two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Stottlemyre Eyes August for Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Barring any complications, Todd Stottlemyre will  
return to the Arizona Diamondbacks' pitching rotation on Aug. 18 in 
a home game against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter, Stottlemyre and the team's  
medical staff met Friday night and established a tentative 
timetable for the right-hander's rehabilitation that includes two 
simulated games in the coming days, followed by three starts in the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctor David Zeman said Stottlemyre has made a remarkable  
recovery from the torn rotator cuff, an injury that occurred May 17 
when he was pitching against the Giants in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbelievable,'' Zeman said. ``It's a big credit to him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre is to pitch the first of two simulated games Tuesday  
in San Diego. He'll throw another simulated contest, then plans to 
make three minor league starts in Tucson. At least the first will 
be with the Diamondbacks' team in the Arizona Rookie League. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre decided not to undergo surgery to repair the injury  
because he wanted to play this year. Instead, he opted for a 
strenuous rehabilitation program. He worked out daily on the 
weights to strengthen the area around the injury, but wasn't able 
to begin throwing until June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre was elated to have a date set for his return.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, not only throwing a baseball for five weeks, there  
was no light at the end of the tunnel. All it was weight 
training,'' Stottlemyre said. ``Then when I started throwing, it 
was such a cautious, slow process. Every time I threw, it was 
trying to get over the next hurdle. The nice thing for me this time 
is there's light at the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as there are no setbacks, they've got me pitching in a  
major league game. I'm real excited about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was hurt, Stottlemyre, who signed as a free agent with  
Arizona, was 4-1 with a 3.59 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Missing U.S. Army Plane Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A massive aerial search for a missing  
U.S. Army spy plane focused Saturday on the rugged, green Andean 
mountains near Colombia's southwestern border, where leftist rebels 
are strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Airplanes and helicopters from the U.S. military, State  
Department and Customs Service as well as from the Colombian 
military helped search for the plane, which took off from a 
Colombian military base Friday morning on a ``routine counterdrug 
mission,'' the U.S. Army said. There was no ground search so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas often fire on low-flying Colombian military aircraft  
and crop-dusting planes sent to fumigate illegal drug crops in 
areas they control. But there was no immediate evidence that the 
U.S. aircraft that disappeared Friday, carrying five American 
soldiers and two Colombian air force officers, had come under 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for seven live people right now,'' said Army  
Capt. Jack Miller, a spokesman for the Southern Command in Miami, 
the Army's operations base for Latin America. Employed in the 
search were dozens of aircraft, including Colombian OV-10 small 
planes, U.S. army P-3 patrol planes based in Ecuador and the island 
of Aruba, and U.S. and Colombian UH-1 helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonstop search over ``rugged mountain terrain'' would  
continue overnight if necessary, said Southern Command spokeswoman 
Lt. Jane Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior guerrilla commander, Raul Reyes, told Caracol radio  
late Saturday that he had heard nothing from rebel units concerning 
the lost plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconnaissance mission's aim was to gather information to  
support the Colombians in the counterdrug effort, the Army said, 
not to fumigate drug crops -- the United States' principal 
anti-narcotics activity in Colombia. Several American pilots -- 
private contractors hired by the State Department -- have been 
killed in crashes while on fumigation missions in Colombia in the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the missing Americans were not immediately  
released, but Miller said they included two captains, a warrant 
officer and two enlisted men. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Army official Texas confirmed the soldiers were from  
Fort Bliss, an army base in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, which left from a base in a mountainous region near  
Apiay, 45 miles southeast of Bogota, typically flies such missions 
at altitudes between 5,000 and 25,000 feet. Adverse weather 
conditions, including low cloud cover, were reported near the 
takeoff point. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was circling over the southern state of Putumayo when  
it fell out of contact, Miller said. Putumayo has seen an explosive 
growth in recent years in illegal plantations of coca, the plant 
used to make cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the plane was supposed to return to Apiay six to  
eight hours after taking off, and had no plans to land elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing aircraft is a four-engine de Havilland RC-7  
reconnaissance plane, which are typically equipped with 
sophisticated electronic systems that include expensive radar and 
devices capable of listening to conversations on the ground. A 
version of the aircraft is used in Korea to monitor North Korean 
military activities. 
</P>
<P>
	As the world's No. 1 source of cocaine and a growing supplier of  
heroin, Colombia is the major focus of U.S. anti-narcotics policy. 
The country will receive nearly $300 million in U.S. anti-narcotics 
aid this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance comes on the eve of a visit by the  
Clinton administration's top anti-narcotics official. National Drug 
Control Policy director, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, is scheduled to 
arrive Sunday and visit an army base where the U.S. military is 
training and equipping a new, 1,500-member counternarcotics 
battalion. 
</P>
<P>
	Requesting substantially more aid to fight the drug war in the  
Andes, McCaffrey this week called Colombia an ``emergency'' 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military involvement in anti-drug efforts in Colombia is  
growing amid signs that leftist rebels are increasingly involved in 
protecting the cocaine trade. Colombia's principal counternarcotics 
force, the National Police, is outgunned by the heavily armed 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the police said they destroyed nearly two tons of  
cocaine Saturday while dismantling a massive drug laboratory in the 
jungles of northwest Antioquia state. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, most U.S. anti-narcotics aid to Colombia has paid for  
crop-dusting aircraft and armed helicopters that escort the planes 
on fumigation missions. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the leftist, 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces  
of Colombia, or FARC, increasingly involved in the drug trade, the 
lines between fighting drugs and countering the rebels are becoming 
blurred.

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Mourn Another Short Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When asked once what he would do if elected  
president, John F. Kennedy Jr. answered with a dash of his 
trademark wit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the first thing is call up Uncle Teddy and gloat,''  
Sen. Edward Kennedy recalls his nephew saying. ``I loved that. It 
was so like his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sadly familiar scene -- Edward Kennedy tenderly eulogizing a  
life cut short -- unfolded Friday at a Gothic-style church, where 
America's first family of politics paid tribute to its crown prince 
and his wife of three years, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial came one week after Kennedy's plane crashed off  
Martha's Vineyard, killing the couple and Ms. Kennedy's sister, 
Lauren Bessette. A private memorial for the 34-year-old financial 
executive was to be held today in her hometown of Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., 38, ``was still becoming the person he would be, and  
doing it by the beat of his own drummer,'' Edward Kennedy said at 
the private Mass. ``He had only just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among somber mourners were Caroline Kennedy -- the last surviving  
child of slain President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis -- President Clinton, and JFK Jr. hero Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Kennedy may have become disoriented by darkness  
and foul weather before his single-engine plane plunged into the 
sea. But friends and family celebrated him as a free spirit who 
kept his bearings in life, even after the public cast the child who 
saluted his father's casket as the heir to Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a boy who grew into a man with a zest for life and a  
love of adventure,'' said Edward Kennedy. ``He was a pied piper who 
brought us all along. ... He had a legacy, and he learned to 
treasure it. He was part of a legend, and he learned to live with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of Kennedy's 10-minute tribute, Caroline Kennedy  
rose and hugged her uncle, who had fought back tears, those inside 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners said Caroline Kennedy read from Shakespeare's ``The  
Tempest'' and, with her husband and three children, lighted a 
candle. A gospel choir sang ``Amazing Grace.'' Worshipers sang 
along and tapped their seats with their fingers to ``Swing Low, 
Sweet Chariot.'' And hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean was the soloist for 
the reggae anthem ``Many Rivers to Cross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fashion executive Hamilton South gave the eulogy for Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for designer Calvin Klein. 
South was a close friend of the couple and had joined them on 
skiing trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy's mother, Ann Freeman, read from Henry Scott  
Holland's meditation ``Facts of Faith.'' Though it was not known 
which part she read, the piece includes this passage: ``Death is 
nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into 
the next room. ... I am but waiting for you, for an interval, 
somewhere very near, just around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those filling the red velvet-lined pews in the  
126-year-old Church of St. Thomas More were first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, Ethel Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Maria Shriver 
and husband Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maurice Tempelsman, the 
longtime companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the memorial, the congregation walked two blocks uptown to  
the landmark Convent of the Sacred Heart for a reception. Several 
Kennedys, their heads down and their eyes hidden by sunglasses, 
walked hand-in-hand toward the gathering at the school's James 
Burden Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The media-shy Caroline Kennedy, her husband, Edwin Schlossberg,  
and their children took a limousine to the reception as church 
bells rang and helicopters buzzed overhead. At one point, she 
lowered a window and waved to the crowd that had swelled on the 
sidewalks around the church in the hours before the invitation-only 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some onlookers, kept more than a half-block from the entrance to  
St. Thomas amid tight security, arrived as early as 4 a.m. 
Dog-walkers, nannies pushing strollers and tourists jockeyed for 
the chance to bid farewell to the man who grew up in front of a 
nation's eyes to become a criminal prosecutor, quiet 
philanthropist, irreverent magazine entrepreneur, and a true New 
Yorker -- one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be here today because he did so much for Harlem and  
poor people,'' said Juan Ellis, 35, a security guard. ``He didn't 
care he was a president's son. He always acted like a regular 
guy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Brian McBride and Jovan Kirovski  
scored goals Saturday as the United States beat New Zealand 2-1 in 
the Confederations Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans went ahead in the 25th minute, when John Harkes  
passed up the middle and McBride headed the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve minutes into the second half, Eddie Lewis centered a  
corner kick and Kirovski headed it past New Zealand goalie Michael 
Utting. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand's only goal came on a free kick in the final minute  
of the game that Chris Zoricich fired into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd clearly favored New Zealand, booing every time the  
Americans got the ball and roaring when New Zealand made a drive. 
Fans yelled ``Get out! Get out!'' at a 9-year-old boy who bought an 
American flag from a vendor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rooting for New Zealand because they're the underdog. And  
I'm against the United States because they treat the Mexicans who 
go up there badly,'' Ricardo Hernandez, a 21-year-old student, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the near-capacity crowd at the 58,000-seat Jalisco  
Stadium left at the conclusion of Brazil's 4-0 victory over 
Germany, and most of the rest trickled out during the second match. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and New Zealand are considered the weaker  
teams in the Guadalajara group, and American coach Bruce Arena had 
said the United States needed this victory if it were to have any 
hope of advancing in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams in this group advance to the semifinals, along  
with the top two of the Mexico City group.

</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- John Doohan, chief librarian for The  
Kansas City Star and The Kansas City Times for almost three 
decades, died Wednesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Doohan ran the newspapers' third-floor clip library, where  
generations of journalists went to find the correct date, address 
or circumstance of Kansas City history. The Times was later folded 
into The Star and is no longer published. 
</P>
<P>
	Doohan, who retired in 1978, also worked as a reporter, copy  
reader, feature writer and grain reporter before becoming head 
librarian in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1966 to 1977, he wrote the ``Forty Years Ago'' column,  
which summarized news events from the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Mary Catherine Doohan; two  
daughters, Monica Flynn and Juliana Fiser; four grandchildren and 
one great-grandchild.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Paul E. Flato, a retired jeweler whose  
clients included movie producers and stars, died July 17. He was 
98. 
</P>
<P>
	Flato opened his own jewelry shop in the early 1920s, becoming  
one of the foremost designers of his era. He opened a branch in 
Beverly Hills, Calif., and designed jewelry for several films. 
</P>
<P>
	Flato moved to Mexico City later in life and established a shop  
there before returning to Texas in 1990.

</P>
<P>
	RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- King Hassan II, who ignored regional  
taboos to help forge Mideast peace and ruled his North African 
country for 38 years, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan played a precarious balancing act in the Middle East,  
bringing Arabs and Israelis closer together, partly because tens of 
thousands of Israelis are of Moroccan origin. In the 1970s, he made 
several secret diplomatic overtures to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped bring about the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and  
Egypt, as well as subsequent agreements between Israel and both the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first major initiative as king, he met Algeria's  
then-president, Ahmed Ben Bella, in Bamako, the capital of 
neighboring Mali, and made sweeping concessions that led to 12 
years of peace in the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan tried to improve the country's human rights record. He  
became a pioneer in the Arab world by ordering the release of 
dozens of political prisoners in recent years, and by ordering 
compensation for the families of prisoners who disappeared or were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1995, Hassan mediated peace talks between Israeli Foreign  
Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chief Yasser Arafat. A summit of the 
world's Muslim leaders hosted by the king in 1994 resulted in a 
public statement against Islamic extremism. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, he oversaw the establishment of an elected lower house  
of parliament, in which leftists gained a majority in elections.

a victory for the Montgomery bus boycott, outlawed segregation 
across a wide spectrum -- on public transportation and in parks, 
restaurants, libraries and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he signed the original order to integrate the  
University of Alabama, and he participated in the decision that 
ultimately became the ``one man, one vote'' principle established 
by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic orders of his career, Johnson  
cleared the way for Martin Luther King Jr. and swelling ranks of 
voting rights marchers to make their historic 1965 march from Selma 
to Montgomery despite Wallace's attempt to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite accolades from civil rights groups, Johnson insisted  
throughout his career that he was simply following the law and was 
hardly a liberal. He also showed firm resolve despite the violence 
of the times. A cross was once burned on his lawn, and his mother's 
house was bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was nominated to be FBI director by President Carter in  
1977 but eventually withdrew because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was appointed by President Eisenhower to the district  
court in Montgomery in 1955, Johnson was 37 and the youngest 
federal judge in the country. Barely a year later, he joined in the 
2-1 ruling that outlawed segregation of public transportation, 
giving King and the bus boycott in Montgomery a victory that helped 
jump-start the civil rights movement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Knocks GOP Tax-Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton, mingling with big-money  
Democratic donors, described the Republicans' tax-cutting plan in 
doomsday terms Saturday, saying it would ``imperil the future 
stability of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio  
address, asserting that the GOP program would soak up money needed 
to fix Social Security, Medicare and other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, a top Republican praised the $792 billion tax cut  
passed last week as returning surplus federal money to the people 
to keep it from being spent in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived early Saturday morning in this swank resort town  
of million-dollar vacation homes for what was supposed to be a 
leisurely weekend of hobnobbing with contributors who gave at least 
$50,000 to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president decided to cut the Colorado weekend short --  
compressing two days of schmoozing into about five hours -- to fly 
overnight to Morocco for Sunday's funeral of King Hassan II. He was 
to be accompanied by his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Hassan as ``a great friend of the peace  
process'' and a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan, who helped forge Middle East peace and ruled Morocco for  
38 years, died Friday of a heart attack at age 70. He was succeeded 
by his son, Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' weekend retreat gave donors a chance to rub  
elbows with Clinton, the first lady and members of his Cabinet. It 
was expected to raise $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Republicans have changed their tune about him,  
saying they can reclaim the White House when he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``After telling everybody for 6 1/2 years what a bad guy I was,  
they're now basically saying, `Oh, well, you know, Bill Clinton is 
like Michael Jordan, he just jumps higher than the other guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Republicans hope that when he's gone, they can  
put the Democrats ``in the cellar again. There's a sort of a 
cynical, political thing. ... I could not have done anything, 
anything in the last six years if our ideas hadn't been right and 
if I hadn't had the help of Al Gore and Hillary and (Sen.) Dianne 
Feinstein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president mixed with donors at a sprawling cedar ``cabin''  
owned by Feinstein of California and her husband, Dick Blum. Under 
a brilliant sun, guests listened to a Western band and strolled 
among aspen trees and wild flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the radio, the president opened up a new line of attack  
against the Republicans' 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their reckless tax plan would threaten law enforcement across  
the board, forcing reductions in the number of federal agents and 
cutting deeply into support for state and local law enforcement,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced the award of $50 million in Justice Department  
grants to hire 680 law enforcement officers in 64 communities. In 
addition, the District of Columbia will get $15 million to hire 200 
new community police officers and 40 new federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the grants, Phoenix will receive $7.5 million to hire 100  
officers; Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., $10.8 million to hire 144 
officers; Detroit $9 million to hire 120 officers; and Austin, 
Texas, $3.7 million to hire 50 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' own radio address credited Americans with  
producing the economic bounty that enables a tax cut at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan helps fix an unfair tax system by making it  
financially easier to get married and save money for children's 
education or other long-term needs, House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would ease taxation on interest accrued from savings  
and reduce the ``marriage penalty,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosperity you created brought us the first budget surplus  
in 39 years,'' he said. ``We must return that money to you so it 
isn't spent in Washington on more big government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an almost straight party-line vote Thursday, the House  
approved a measure that would cut taxes over 10 years. Senate 
Republicans plan to pass a tax cut next week that is the same size 
as the House bill but differs in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has threatened to veto such deep cuts and instead favors  
a tax cut in the range of $250 billion.

<HEADLINE> Americans Work More Outside of Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Born in 1909, Maurice Rovner lived over his  
hardware store, selling the nails that patched northwest 
Baltimore's row houses. Even on his one day off customers came 
knocking -- because they knew where to find him. Would he sell them 
some mousetraps, three for a dime? 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1960, his grandson Dave Rovner rides the computer  
revolution, opening a laptop easily on his kitchen table, taking a 
cell phone call while out with his kids, checking e-mail while on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	During this hard-working century, when productivity grew an  
average 2 percent a year, Americans increasingly toiled outside the 
home: on factory assembly lines, steelyards, in office cubicles. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the century's start and finish, workers such as the  
Rovners earned their keep from home, steps from their families, 
blurring the line between home and work and sometimes paying a 
price for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Work hovered over every minute of Maurice Rovner's day.  
Nowadays, his grandson totes it almost everywhere. Millions of 
workers fret whether to answer right away when the boss e-mails on 
a Saturday. Tele-work is clean and cutting-edge, but the technology 
that frees us to bring the office home shackles us, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Little by little, lines are being drawn. ``People are creating  
more boundaries, not without difficulty,'' says Ellen Galinsky, 
president of the Families and Work Institute. ``You have to invent 
it yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In colonial times, work and home were one. Mostly farmers or  
craftsmen, men and women worked as full partners in supporting the 
family and raising children. Married women were called yoke-mates. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the 1830s, ``boss'' had become a commonly used word. In  
1800, just 12 percent of people had one, but that figure was 40 
percent by 1860. 
</P>
<P>
	As this century opened, a majority of people depended on wage  
labor for the first time. By the end of World War I, as industry 
churned out goods propelled by a new gospel of efficiency, 87 
percent of wage earners worked for corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, homes were still workplaces.  
</P>
<P>
	A close look at one apartment building in New York reveals a  
hive of at-home enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	In one apartment of what is now the Lower East Side Tenement  
Museum, Nathalie Gumpertz, a single mother, worked as a seamstress. 
In other dim, dusty apartments, tenants made brooms and cigars. It 
was 1900, and 25,000 New Yorkers took in ``home work,'' finishing 
the manual work started elsewhere. It was an essential way to 
supplement family income. 
</P>
<P>
	At best, working conditions at home were primitive. But as more  
and more family members took jobs outside the home, they 
encountered horrific workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Holzman began working in a rudimentary New York furniture  
factory in 1921 at the age of 14, a year after leaving his native 
Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dust was so thick, you had to not only wear a handkerchief  
over your mouth to breathe, you couldn't see someone standing three 
feet away,'' he told oral history researchers from New York 
University's Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's wages were crucial, since family income was often  
seasonal and injuries were common. Handing the weekly pay packet 
over to your parents was a ritual of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until the day I was married, I handed it in,'' says Cecelia  
Ohlandt, a gregarious 81-year-old who had to leave school at age 
16. ``My mother and father both worked, and still, if you wanted to 
have a fairly decent life -- at least have some clothes -- this is 
the way it had to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took bloody strikes, lethal accidents and muckraking  
journalism to galvanize reform. In 1906, Upton Sinclair's landmark 
book, ``The Jungle,'' exposed the abuses of the meatpacking 
industry. In 1911, some 146 women died in a fire in New York's 
Triangle Shirtwaist factory, some because doors had been locked to 
keep them on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	A patchwork of worker protections was born, first aimed at women  
and children. States enacted workers' compensation, restrictions on 
child labor and an eight-hour day in some industries. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the late 1930s, however, that reforms became  
national and applicable to all. And even today, immigrants in New 
York or Los Angeles -- like workers in many other countries around 
the globe -- toil in filthy, dangerous sweatshops that earlier 
reformers sought to eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
	In these turbulent decades, home truly became ``... Sweet Home''  
-- a consciously separate oasis in a cruel and hurried world. 
</P>
<P>
	Women ideally stayed home, although in reality growing numbers  
went to work before marriage. Homes evolved from work and social 
centers bustling with business partners, boarders and neighbors, to 
private family fiefdoms, notes historian Tamara Hareven. 
</P>
<P>
	``Separating work and home was something most people aspired  
to,'' says social historian Stephanie Coontz, author of ``The Way 
We Never Were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Rovner was a friendly, second-generation immigrant  
beloved in his Baltimore neighborhood. But he soon yearned to live 
away from his hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
	With the business open six days a week until 8 p.m., his wife,  
Stella, had to bring his meals downstairs or mind the store while 
he went up to eat. And there were those Sunday customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1940s, the family bought a house with a backyard,  
and they felt they'd made it. After that, Maurice brought a little 
bookkeeping home, and his wife occasionally took lunch to the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly work stayed at the store, and Sundays were theirs,  
recalls Howard Rovner, the only one of Maurice's sons to make the 
hardware business his life. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, when Howard married Naomi, a Baltimore girl who had  
lived over a grocery store as a young girl, she worked as a clerk 
and secretary -- until the children came. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, work was work and home was home.  
</P>
<P>
	``Work was the most important thing. That was my training.  
Business came first,'' says Howard Rovner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He was out early in the morning, would come home late, six  
days a week,'' says Dave Rovner, owner of a flourishing computer 
consulting firm, Strategic Network Designs, based in New Jersey, 
far from his Baltimore roots. He's talking about his father, 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	It's 1999 now, and Dave Rovner is wheeling his BMW along a  
suburban street, ticking off the ways he squeezes work into his 
day. He totes his cell phone to the golf course. He takes his two 
youngsters to work on Saturdays, where they color while he catches 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	This way, he says, he can work hard yet see his family --  
something he believes his father missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his grandfather and father before him, Dave is amiable and  
works very hard. But he has a new confidence, a certainty he's 
controlling his life -- not letting his business control him. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Rovner is a bit bewildered. How can anyone relax if work  
constantly intrudes at home? 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, he understands that his son, as the boss, has to work  
hard. And yet, Howard notes, his son takes his laptop on family 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may as well not go on vacation,'' Howard muses.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One in four households today has a home office, up from one in  
five just two years ago, reports CDB Research &AMP; Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	True, most Americans still slog to the office or plant -- and  
still fret if they need to slip out for their daughter's soccer 
game. Corporate work-family efforts -- day care, health clubs -- 
often just end up chaining people to the job even more. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the home office is a powerful symbol of a new way to  
work, a badge of honor in an age when intellectual capital counts 
and time off is better than money. Working at home also promises 
the Great Family-Friendly Life, the balance we yearn for after 
tucking work and home into two separate boxes for most of this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, you can work in your bathrobe -- ha! to the dress code.  
At home, you can nurse the baby while you work the phones. At home, 
you punch your own clock, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting-edge home buyers think so, and they want offices with  
the best possible techno-gadgets. (Who talks about dens anymore?) 
</P>
<P>
	With this in mind, IBM has paired with a Houston developer to  
build one of the country's first communities with ``networked'' 
homes, meaning they have fast Internet connections, multiple phone 
lines and fully linked computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first two weeks on the market, 23 Stone Gate homes were  
sold -- quadruple the rate in traditional developments. Half the 
buyers work at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this is the next frontier,'' says Mary Walker, an  
IBM executive whose title suggests the new direction: general 
manager for home networking. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies go even further. Regis McKenna did away with all  
permanent offices at his Palo Alto, Calif., consulting firm in 
1997. Now, he and his staff sign up for an office by the day if 
they need one. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, McKenna stops work whenever he likes, to lunch with his  
wife or play with his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of time in the 24 hours to intermix all those  
things,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Well ...  
</P>
<P>
	California pharmaceuticals executive Lisa Conte revels in her  
home office: she can tuck her three children, ages 1, 3 and 6, into 
bed, then work for hours. ``If you can get away with not sleeping 
too much, you can have a whole day's work at night,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch? She's exhausted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still figuring out how to turn it off,'' says Ms. Conte,  
the chief executive officer of Shaman Pharmaceuticals. ``It's such 
a competitive world. Anyone has access to me any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is talking with a reporter at 7 a.m., two hours after  
starting work. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just the boss who's on call. At 15 percent of  
companies, most employees are expected to check voice mail and 
e-mail after hours and during vacations, according to a Conference 
Board study of 62 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet little by little, workers and bosses are setting boundaries.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Christian, an executive recruiter who's so plugged in he  
makes phone calls on ski lifts, planned his honeymoon at a resort 
that bans cell phones on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Neisser, a marketer, blocks off ``down time'' on his  
calendar -- and keeps to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Rovner is struggling to draw the line, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a compromise when I integrate family and personal and  
work,'' he says. ``It's challenging to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On vacation now, he only reads the urgent e-mails.

<HEADLINE> Man Held for Yosemite Decapitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel maintenance man  
was detained for questioning Saturday in the decapitation of a 
naturalist in Yosemite National Park, and the FBI hinted at a 
possible link with the slaying of three park sightseers earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, was taken into custody by federal authorities  
Saturday morning at a nudist colony in Wilton, Calif., near 
Sacramento, said a Sacramento County source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. Stayner was last seen Thursday night by friends and 
coworkers at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, a community at the 
western edge of the park where he works as a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
	Park rangers on Thursday found the body of 26-year-old Joie Ruth  
Armstrong about four miles from Cedar Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	James Maddock, FBI agent in charge, confirmed at a news  
conference Saturday that someone had been detained in connection 
with the case, but would not identify who it was or provide further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said no arrests had been made but he anticipated a  
``significant announcement'' to be made at a news conference Sunday 
at Sacramento's FBI headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	He also backed off of a statement he made Friday that there was  
no evidence linking this case the slayings earlier this year of 
three Yosemite sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to comment on whether there is a link at this  
time,'' he said. ``In the last 24 hours I have received additional 
information that may cause me to modify my statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on the matter further.  
</P>
<P>
	Patty Sailors, whose husband manages the Laguna Del Sol  
clothing-optional resort, said a man identifying himself as Stayner 
checked in Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A visitor recognized Stayner from news reports and called the  
FBI, Mrs. Sailors said. Stayner, who was not a member of the resort 
but had visited there several times, was taken into custody about 9 
a.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is the brother of Steven Stayner, a kidnap victim who  
made national headlines in 1980 after he escaped from Kenneth 
Parnell, a convicted child molester. Steven Stayner, who was held 
and sexually abused for seven years, died in a 1989 motorcycle 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Delbert Stayner, Steven and Cary's father, told the San  
Francisco Chronicle that he's sure his son was not directly 
involved in the woman's death, but worries that he may have been a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``My little boy Stevie Stayner went missing for seven and a half  
years. ... Now my oldest son is missing. I'm kind of torn up over 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Armstrong was discovered a few hundred yards from  
the park housing she shared with a man and woman, who were away at 
the time. A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
told The Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was initially reported overdue by a friend she was  
driving to visit in Sausalito, just north of San Francisco. She was 
last seen alive Wednesday at the park offices of Yosemite 
Institute, where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was a dedicated educator who was beloved among  
children, said institute director Mike Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joie was a bright light to all who knew her,'' Lee said at the  
FBI's news conference Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said there was no indication that the victim knew the  
person who was detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yosemite Institute's main offices are in El Portal, and the  
organization has held conferences at the Cedar Lodge and takes 
groups there to eat before heading to the park. 
</P>
<P>
	El Portal is the town where Eureka residents Carole Sund, her  
daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso of Argentina were 
last seen alive in February during a sightseeing trip. Their bodies 
were found a month later. No one has been charged in connection 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The three sightseers stayed at the Cedar Lodge, where Stayner  
rents a room above the restaurant. He did not work at the lodge at 
the time the women vanished. El Portal is about 190 miles southeast 
of Sacramento.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Seek Leader After Elway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe has the swagger, Terrell  
Davis the statistics, Tyrone Braxton the seniority. Bubby Brister 
has the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos are hoping at least one will be able to  
provide the unspoken leadership that John Elway displayed with his 
cool demeanor, daring downfield scrambles and ultimate success. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, how you become a leader is when you play the game  
well,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Some people vocally, 
other people just perform well. We need guys to step up where some 
of our leadership is gone. I think we have a nucleus to make that 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Elway's successor, Brister is the obvious choice to assume a  
more prominent role as Denver's on-field leader. Although he will 
be 37 when the Broncos open the season in September, Brister has 
the energy of a caffeine addict and the confidence of a car 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has the respect of his teammates after helping the  
Broncos win five games in Elway's absence last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a leader like John go down, you always look  
to your quarterback to fill that role,'' defensive end Harald 
Hasselbach said. ``I certainly have every confidence in Bubby. He's 
extremely well-liked by the guys and he commands a lot of 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister also embraces the challenge of being top dog. He has  
been awaiting the opportunity since returning in 1997 from a 
one-year hiatus from football. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of my strong suits and always has been -- being a  
good leader,'' Brister said Saturday after Denver's first practice 
of training camp, ``but I like to lead by example and not scream 
and holler too much if you don't have to. I'll pick my spots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody leads by example better than Davis, who was named league  
MVP last year after rushing for more than 2,000 yards. Humility, 
however, is one of Davis' best traits. It's not a quality that 
often accompanies a locker room leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty much a quiet-type person when it comes to  
leadership,'' Davis said. ``I don't speak much. I want to go out 
there and just play and hopefully that's enough to encourage 
players who need some leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, on the other hand, rarely meets a run-on sentence he  
doesn't like, and his All-Pro credentials substantiate his 
supercilious nature. It doesn't necessarily mean he's ready to act 
as the team's hall monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably one of the few guys on offense who will say  
something if I see a guy that's slacking,'' Sharpe said. ``Does 
that make me the leader? No. I'm just going to go out there and do 
my job. I have enough to worry about trying to get Shannon ready to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, no one has more seniority than Braxton, a safety who  
has spent 12 years in the NFL and 11 with the Broncos. Although not 
as boisterous as Sharpe, the man they call ``Chicken'' isn't afraid 
to prod his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton offers his own candidate, defensive end Alfred Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like Alfred because he's the type of guy who's fun to be  
around but knows when to get serious and take care of business,'' 
Braxton said. ``He has fun, but when it's time for us to go out on 
the field, he does his job.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Mourn Another Short Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When asked once what he would do if elected  
president, John F. Kennedy Jr. answered with a dash of his 
trademark wit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the first thing is call up Uncle Teddy and gloat,''  
Sen. Edward Kennedy recalls his nephew saying. ``I loved that. It 
was so like his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sadly familiar scene -- Edward Kennedy tenderly eulogizing a  
life cut short -- unfolded Friday at a Gothic-style church, where 
America's first family of politics paid tribute to its crown prince 
and his wife of three years, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial came one week after Kennedy's plane crashed off  
Martha's Vineyard, killing the couple and Ms. Kennedy's sister, 
Lauren Bessette. A private memorial for the 34-year-old financial 
executive was to be held today in her hometown of Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., 38, ``was still becoming the person he would be, and  
doing it by the beat of his own drummer,'' Edward Kennedy said at 
the private Mass. ``He had only just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among somber mourners were Caroline Kennedy -- the last surviving  
child of slain President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis -- President Clinton, and JFK Jr. hero Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Kennedy may have become disoriented by darkness  
and foul weather before his single-engine plane plunged into the 
sea. But friends and family celebrated him as a free spirit who 
kept his bearings in life, even after the public cast the child who 
saluted his father's casket as the heir to Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a boy who grew into a man with a zest for life and a  
love of adventure,'' said Edward Kennedy. ``He was a pied piper who 
brought us all along. ... He had a legacy, and he learned to 
treasure it. He was part of a legend, and he learned to live with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of Kennedy's 10-minute tribute, Caroline Kennedy  
rose and hugged her uncle, who had fought back tears, those inside 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners said Caroline Kennedy read from Shakespeare's ``The  
Tempest'' and, with her husband and three children, lighted a 
candle. A gospel choir sang ``Amazing Grace.'' Worshipers sang 
along and tapped their seats with their fingers to ``Swing Low, 
Sweet Chariot.'' And hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean was the soloist for 
the reggae anthem ``Many Rivers to Cross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fashion executive Hamilton South gave the eulogy for Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for designer Calvin Klein. 
South was a close friend of the couple and had joined them on 
skiing trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy's mother, Ann Freeman, read from Henry Scott  
Holland's meditation ``Facts of Faith.'' Though it was not known 
which part she read, the piece includes this passage: ``Death is 
nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into 
the next room. ... I am but waiting for you, for an interval, 
somewhere very near, just around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those filling the red velvet-lined pews in the  
126-year-old Church of St. Thomas More were first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, Ethel Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Maria Shriver 
and husband Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maurice Tempelsman, the 
longtime companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the memorial, the congregation walked two blocks uptown to  
the landmark Convent of the Sacred Heart for a reception. Several 
Kennedys, their heads down and their eyes hidden by sunglasses, 
walked hand-in-hand toward the gathering at the school's James 
Burden Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The media-shy Caroline Kennedy, her husband, Edwin Schlossberg,  
and their children took a limousine to the reception as church 
bells rang and helicopters buzzed overhead. At one point, she 
lowered a window and waved to the crowd that had swelled on the 
sidewalks around the church in the hours before the invitation-only 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Some onlookers, kept more than a half-block from the entrance to  
St. Thomas amid tight security, arrived as early as 4 a.m. 
Dog-walkers, nannies pushing strollers and tourists jockeyed for 
the chance to bid farewell to the man who grew up in front of a 
nation's eyes to become a criminal prosecutor, quiet 
philanthropist, irreverent magazine entrepreneur, and a true New 
Yorker -- one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be here today because he did so much for Harlem and  
poor people,'' said Juan Ellis, 35, a security guard. ``He didn't 
care he was a president's son. He always acted like a regular 
guy.''

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Org. Buys Abused Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Nine young elephants abused by  
their trainers have been bought by a wildlife organization that 
plans to set them free in a South African game reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Fund for Nature South Africa says it will pay the  
owner $80,000 for the nine animals, according to a statement 
released by the group on Friday. The agreement requires the owner, 
Riccardo Ghiazza, to donate the money toward management of the 
elephants. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine animals are the last of 30 elephants captured by  
Ghiazza in neighboring Botswana last year. The other 21 were sold 
to zoos in Europe or released in game reserves in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the elephants being beaten on the trunk and hind  
quarters were broadcast recently on South African television, 
prompting a campaign for their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund said it will most likely relocate the elephants to the  
Marakele National Park in the Northern Province, a national reserve 
wedged between South Africa's dry west and its moister, more 
tropical east, the South African Press Association reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The elephants were brought last year to Ghiazza's African Game  
Services ranch, 36 miles north of Johannesburg, where Indonesian 
``mahouts'' were to train them. 
</P>
<P>
	Their methods included the use of sharp prods and water and food  
deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Societies to Prevent Cruelty to  
Animals won custody of the elephants in a court suit, but were 
ordered by an appeals court to allow the elephants to remain in 
Ghiazza's possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization stationed two full-time monitors on the  
property who videotaped the beatings. They were forbidden by a 
court last year to release previous videotapes of the mistreatment.

<HEADLINE> Altercation Stops Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- An Atlanta-bound Delta Airlines flight made an  
unscheduled stop in Las Vegas early Saturday after a passenger 
scuffled with the flight crew, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people suffered minor injuries, including a baby scalded by  
spilled coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hung Cong Duong, 30, a Tampa, Fla., resident originally from  
Vietnam, was charged with interfering with a flight crew, and FBI 
spokesman Kevin Caudle said he could face more charges, including 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's brother told FBI agents his brother became unruly  
because he hadn't taken his medication, but Caudle didn't know what 
kind of medication he referred to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual who had the altercation was up and moving  
around when he wasn't supposed to be and they tried to seat him. He 
tried to get past the beverage cart and just got violent,'' 
McCarran International Airport spokesman John Hanks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the injured on Delta Flight 194, which originated in Los  
Angeles, was a 17-month-old boy burned by spilled coffee. He was 
treated at University Medical Center and released. Also injured 
were a flight attendant and two female passengers. They were 
treated at the scene for cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delta spokesperson did not immediately return a phone call  
from The Associated Press seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Skinner Happy With All Pocono News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Mike Skinner thought he had a decent car,  
so he wasn't certain if he should try to make it better. 
</P>
<P>
	So after practice Friday, he sought out crew chief Larry  
McReynolds, who had already brightened Skinner's outlook by 
announcing he would remain with Richard Childress Racing for the 
next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner didn't want to make another mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were about an eighth- or 10th-place car after practice,''  
he said. ``I told Larry, I went for all or nothing at Loudon two 
weeks ago, and it bit me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner didn't drive a good lap in qualifying for the New  
Hampshire race, and wound up starting 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to tell me what he wanted to do,'' Skinner said.  
``I told him whatever we did, we'd do it together. He said we're 
going to be together for three years, so let's go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner did just that, and changes in the car resulted in a lap  
of 170.451 mph on the 2 1/2-mile Pocono International Raceway. It gave 
him the third pole of his Winston Cup career. 
</P>
<P>
	It exceeded all expectations, and now Skinner's Chevrolet is the  
car to beat Sunday in the $2.2 million Pennsylvania 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was a perfect lap,'' said Skinner, whose  
only other Winston Cup poles came for both Daytona International 
Speedway races as a rookie in 1997. ``But it was a real good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in keeping with the spirit of a day in which McReynolds  
announced that in the wake of his ill-fated attempt to start his 
own team he would remain with RCR through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I feel like a winner in this deal,'' Skinner said  
of the news on McReynolds. ``I'm pretty pumped up about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also enthusiastic was Mark Martin, whose broken and bent body is  
starting to heel from multiple fractures of three weeks ago. Gone 
is a gait that two weeks ago resembled that of the Hunchback of 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great run,'' Martin said after locking up the outside  
of the front row with a lap of 170.078 in a Ford. ``I gave them 
everything I had on that lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is still recovering from fractures of a knee, wrist and  
rib received three weeks ago in practice for the Pepsi 400 at 
Daytona. A week later, he started 37th and finished sixth in the 
Jiffy Lube 300. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great in the race car,'' he said. ``In New Hampshire, I  
was in pain all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-fastest was the Chevy of five-time Pocono polesitter Ken  
Schrader at 169.933. He'll start from the most productive position 
on the grid, one that has produced eight victories in 43 Pocono 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I don't ruin that stat,'' said Schrader -- winless in  
his last 253 starts. ``But that's one of those statistical things 
that don't make much difference when we race Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going from outside of the second row will be the Pontiac of  
Bobby Labonte, the winner last month of the Pocono 500. Labonte's 
lap was run at 169.827. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought he could have been faster, but never found the ideal  
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just needed to be a little tighter,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't Sterling Marlin's problem. He established the track  
qualifying record with a run last month at 170.506, and was the 
fastest Friday in both practice sessions before qualifying ninth in 
his Chevy at 169.444. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tightened the car up a little bit from practice,'' he said.  
``But the clouds were out, and we were a little too tight in turn 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-fastest was the Pontiac of John Andretti. Then came the  
Chevys of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Wally Dallenbach and Jeff 
Gordon. Ward Burton was eighth in a Pontiac, followed by Marlin and 
the Chevy of Joe Nemechek. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying 15th in a Ford was series points leader Dale Jarrett.

<HEADLINE> Minor Leaguer Sees a Big Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Craig Paquette's baseball experience  
has taken him from the major leagues to the Triple-A stops a notch 
below, where the players aren't quite as good, the perks not quite 
as lavish. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at age 30, Paquette find himself in a different uniform,  
playing a brand of baseball that is, in some ways, a throwback to 
his earliest days in the game. It's certainly not as glamorous, but 
that's OK with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can anybody turn this down?'' says Paquette, the cleanup  
hitter on the United States Pan Am baseball team, his nation's 
first to use professional players in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people at (Class AAA) Norfolk notified me that I had the  
opportunity and I found out it was a great chance to play for your 
country and be seen by a lot of other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Paquette was the Kansas City Royals' starting  
third baseman, one season after establishing career highs with 22 
homers and 67 RBIs. But hitting slumps and then ankle surgery after 
signing with the New York Mets have limited his time in the majors 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	He's still got 426 major league games and 55 big league homers  
to his credit. He's becoming reacquainted with his baseball 
beginnings and hoping he can address his future with a good 
showing. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's different.  
</P>
<P>
	During practice games leading up to the Pan Am competition that  
begins Sunday, the USA team didn't find the clubhouse food spreads 
that awaits professional players, especially those in the majors. 
There wasn't even a clubhouse at one locale. 
</P>
<P>
	So Paquette and his teammates wolfed down fast food before the  
game and changed from practice to game uniforms in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most guys where anticipating this any way,'' said USA  
teammate Jason Hardtke, who has seen limited time in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to play baseball and that's all that matters,''  
Paquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of this is new for everybody. We only have one or two  
guys competing who've been in international play. I've never been 
in single elimination games before. No doubt there is a lot of 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team USA must finish in the top two or fail to qualify for the  
Sydney Olympics next year. They must do so against a talented field 
that includes seven-time defending Pan Am baseball champion Cuba 
and the Dominican Republic, which beat the USA twice in a warmup 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette can DH, play first or the outfield, but mostly he's  
being counted on to provide punch for a team that doesn't have a 
lot of power. Leadership, too, for a mix of veterans and young 
pros, none of whom are on 40-man major league rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of the guys look up to Craig because he's been  
around and got a lot of time in the majors,'' Hardtke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the U.S. does qualify for the Olympics, there's a good  
chance many of the players currently in Winnipeg won't be making 
the long trip to Australia. Why? They hope by that time to be 
called to the majors, or in Paquette's case, be called back up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can still play in the big leagues, it's a matter of  
getting a chance,'' Paquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll return to Norfolk once the Pan Am baseball competition  
ends and then take it from there. Finish out the Triple-A schedule 
and maybe get a late-season call from the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going on,'' he said. ``I don't even pay  
attention to it anymore. I'm tired of it. I don't worry what's 
happening up there and I don't even look at the box scores 
anymore,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is play baseball and take advantage of it. Just  
like playing for your country. You get the chance and you take 
advantage of it, too.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball's Richest Pitchers Meet Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- At first glance, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown,  
baseball's richest pitchers, would seem to be experiencing similar 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has a 10-7 record. Brown is 10-6.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as they prepared for a Sunday night showdown, their third  
since last October, their true fates have been vastly different. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson leads the NL in earned run average at 2.65 and the  
majors in strikeouts with 229. He is a legitimate threat to break 
Nolan Ryan's single-season strikeout record of 383. If not for a 
four-game stretch when he pitched great but lost because his 
Arizona teammates failed to provide him with even one run, Johnson 
could easily be 14-3. And, most significantly, his team is 
contending for the NL West title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could make the case for Randy maybe having one of the best  
years of his career with the exception of those games he should 
have won,'' manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least on the surface, Johnson has coped with his team's  
inability to provide him with any help. The Diamondbacks finally 
came through for him in a 6-0 shutout in his triumphant return to 
Seattle last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I'm trying to do out there is put the team in  
position to win,'' Johnson said. ``It doesn't matter what pitcher 
I'm facing. I've got a job to do and that's to keep the runs to a 
minimum, and our hitters have a job to do and that's to score runs. 
If we both do our jobs, good things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, meanwhile, has a 3.79 ERA with 127 strikeouts, third in  
the NL but 102 fewer than Johnson. Brown has had some strong games, 
and some awful ones. After allowing just eight homers all of last 
season with San Diego, he has given up 15 this year. Los Angeles, 
the team that counted on him to lead it to the NL West crown, has 
nose-dived into last place, 10 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a year where it seems like someone is trying to test  
me,'' Brown said after his last outing, an 8-4 victory over 
Pittsburgh. ``It's been that way the whole year. Game after game, 
it's like a witch doctor has a curse on me. If anybody knows how to 
get rid of it, tell him to send it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing for sure, both pitchers will be intense Sunday. It's  
their trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one thing that I respect and appreciate in his game is  
that he goes about his business much like I do,'' Johnson said. 
``Maybe it's not the best way, but it's the best way for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two pitchers first squared off last October in the NL  
divisional playoffs, an outstanding duel that ended with Brown's 
Padres beating Johnson and the Houston Astros 2-1. Both became 
highly-sought free agents after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson signed a four-year, $52.4 million contract with the  
Arizona Diamondbacks. Twelve days later, Brown signed an amazing 
seven-year, $105 million deal with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April 5, on opening day, they were the starting pitchers as  
the Diamondbacks played at Dodger Stadium. Another close, 
low-scoring game? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously they're the premier pitchers in the league,''  
Dodgers' catcher Todd Hundley said. ``Opening day everyone was 
expecting a pitcher's duel, and look what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks got five runs on 10 hits off Brown in 5 2-3  
innings. Johnson pitched well, and left after seven innings with a 
5-2 lead. But, as would be the case many more times in the coming 
weeks, Arizona's bullpen couldn't hold on, and Los Angeles came 
back to win 8-6 in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night probably won't be the last time the two will face  
off this season. If the rotation stays intact, Johnson and Brown 
will be the starters next Friday night at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, though, said he never thinks about his opposing  
pitcher. Everybody seems to mount their best effort when they know 
he's pitching, he said. Jose Jimenez of St. Louis, who beat Johnson 
and the Diamondbacks with a 1-0 no-hitter, is a classic example. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pitching matchup is one thing, but I'm not facing him,''  
Johnson said. ``I'm facing his lineup. I can only worry about 
facing those eight guys that are coming up to the plate. It doesn't 
matter who I'm pitching against. What's the worse that Kevin 
Brown's going to do on Sunday? Shut me out? Like I haven't had that 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Aerospace Firms Near Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and France's  
Aerospatiale Matra are close to agreement on a merger deal that 
would create the world's biggest aerospace company after Boeing, a 
newsmagazine reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel said the plans to fuse the two companies are already  
on the desk of French President Jacques Chirac, who must approve 
any deal involving the aerospace and defense group Aerospatiale 
Matra, which is 48 percent state-owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine said the deal was worked out by DaimlerChrysler  
chairman Juergen Schrempp and Jean Luc Legardere, chairman of 
Aerospatiale Matra's supervisory board. The report did not cite 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, Rainer Ohler, would  
neither confirm nor deny the report. ``Everybody's talking with 
everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Aerospatiale Matra in Paris declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel's report is the latest in a flurry of consolidation  
announcements from Europe's aerospace and defense industry, which 
has said it hopes to better compete against U.S. giants like Boeing 
and Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	European companies already cooperate in building Airbus  
commercial planes and Eurofighter and Tornado military jets, but 
industry insiders fear that unless they pool their skills, finances 
and research more closely, they will be picked off by U.S. firms 
keen to expand into European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, known as Dasa,  
signed a memo of understanding with Spain's Construcciones 
Aeronauticas SA to merge into Europe's first multinational 
aerospace company, beating out Aerospatiale Matra and other 
European firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dasa earlier this month announced a joint venture in space  
technology with Aerospatiale Matra and the Marconi division of 
Britain's General Electric Co. The Alenia Spazio division of 
Italy's Finmeccanica is expected to join that venture, called 
astrium, later. 
</P>
<P>
	In both deals, Dasa officials said the aim was to strengthen  
competitiveness and contribute to ``European industrial 
integration.''

<HEADLINE> Shakespeare for Dummies Book Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Beneath the desk where Ray Lischner  
writes his lesson plans are three computers named for characters 
from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'': Prospero, Antonio and the one 
with the screwed-up mother board, Caliban. 
</P>
<P>
	So it should come as no surprise that when Lischner asked his  
wife, Cheryl, whether he should pitch ``Shakespeare for Dummies'' 
to IDG Books, publishers of the ``Dummies'' series of manuals on 
everything from computer programs to flyfishing, she responded, 
``Yesss! That book you HAVE to write!'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the summer Shakespeare season upon us and Hollywood  
reviving interest in the Bard, this is a book to help folks 
planning to watch 400-year-old plays figure out what's up with all 
these sword fights, women dressed as boys and iambic pentameter. 
</P>
<P>
	``School kids looking for a quick way to get a paper out will be  
disappointed,'' says Lischner, who teaches computer science at 
Oregon State University when he isn't writing programming books on 
the Delphi computer language. ``It is to give you the background 
you need to understand the plays on their own terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lischner fell in love with William Shakespeare in high school in  
Cherry Hill, N.J., where his English teacher brought the obscure 
language and confusing texts alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed my life,'' Lischner says. ``I was interested in  
science. This was an English class where you had to interpret and 
analyze. What was Shakespeare trying to do when he wrote `Hamlet?' 
There is more to the play than just, 'Hamlet kills his uncle.''' 
</P>
<P>
	When Lischner went to the California Institute of Technology to  
study computer programming, Shakespeare went with him. He did his 
independent study project on Shakespeare and Italian Renaissance 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for ``Shakespeare for Dummies'' sprang from Lischner's  
appearance in a university production of ``Titus Andronicus,'' in 
which he played the last man standing after all the Goths and 
Romans are killed. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep track of who was winning as the many bodies fell, he  
developed a scorecard, much like a baseball scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
	Confident this could be big, Lischner recognized he didn't have  
the credentials to write ``Shakespeare for Dummies'' by himself. He 
needed a collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter John Doyle, a British theater director who has extensive  
experience with Shakespeare and served as artistic director of four 
theaters in England. When he presented a series of workshops at 
Oregon State, Lischner enrolled. He pitched the book after one of 
the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle recalls wondering if the world needed another book on  
Shakespeare. ``Then he said it would be part of the `Dummies' 
series,'' Doyle says. ``I liked it because I thought, `Anything to 
help make Shakespeare accessible.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With Doyle in Hastings, England, and Lischner in Corvallis, they  
collaborated by e-mail. As one would finish something at the end of 
his day, he would e-mail it to the other, eight time zones away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact we never saw each other made it easier,'' Doyle says.  
``You don't sit down and have all those hours of heartache. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started communicating with the publishers more and the  
academic editor, the whole thing was e-mails going round in 
worldwide circles. I don't know what Shakespeare would think of 
that. I do think he would quite approve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book offers hints to understanding the language of  
Elizabethan England in a chapter titled, ``Why Does Everyone Talk 
So Funny?'' and insights into the sources of stories behind the 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	One chapter is devoted to Doyle's workshop on using the  
imagination, something both authors say Shakespeare demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to exercise, like everything else,''  
Lischner says. ``Your imagination can get weak and flabby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each play is summarized, so someone going to a play can read it  
just before walking into the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you are not spending your time trying to keep track of  
the plot,'' Lischner says. ``You can spend your time enjoying the 
language, the images, the interplay, the characters or whatever you 
choose to focus on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, each summary has a scorecard to keep track of the  
players and action. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Romeo and Juliet,'' for example, when Romeo falls in love  
with a stranger in Act 1 Scene 1, the reader would draw a heart 
with a question mark next to Romeo's name on the scorecard. In 
Scene 4, the reader is urged to draw a pair of spectacles 
indicating Romeo dons a disguise. 
</P>
<P>
	In romantic encounters, first base on a baseball diamond  
indicates a suitor who woos a lover. Second base is awarded for 
meeting a lover in private, third base for getting engaged. Getting 
married is a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	A happy face means victorious in battle, a frowning face means  
defeated in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of saying, `Don't take this all too seriously,'''  
Doyle says. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle recommends playgoers fill out the scorecards while reading  
the play, not watching a performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were sitting next to somebody trying to keep score in a  
theater, I would be furious,'' Doyle says. ``We do suggest if you 
do that, you do it at the interval.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Cancels Headquarters Tours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular public tours of FBI headquarters  
are suspended indefinitely as a result of unconfirmed threats 
against FBI facilities here, including a recent one believed to 
originate among backers of wealthy Islamic radical Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1991, the FBI halted the tours that  
250,000 people take each year. FBI spokesman Tron Brekke said 
Friday the tours would not resume ``until we can do a security 
assessment to ensure the safety of our employees and tourists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An unconfirmed, nonspecific threat against FBI facilities in  
Washington was detected several weeks ago, but over time the bureau 
regularly has received threats directed specifically against the J. 
Edgar Hoover headquarters building, said one law enforcement 
official, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been unable to corroborate it in any way, shape or  
form by all the means we have,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Hoover building, the FBI's Washington field  
office occupies another building that also fills a city block. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said both the recent and previous threats prompted  
the FBI to improve security at the Hoover building but, until 
Friday, these measures had not addressed the safety of tourists who 
line up outside FBI headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News reported that the recent threat concerned possible  
terrorist attacks by followers of bin Laden, who is charged in this 
country with masterminding last August's bombings of U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing recent events, another law enforcement official said of  
the latest threat that ``it's fairly evident bin Laden's followers 
would be the prime suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five U.S. embassies in Africa were closed last month for several  
days for security reasons. The State Department did not 
specifically link the closures to bin Laden, but U.S. officials 
have said he is believed to planning an attack against Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a threat against FBI facilities in Washington,  
D.C.,'' said Brekke, the FBI spokesman. But he added the recent 
threat is ``nonspecific and uncorroborated''; that is, no specific 
target was identified. ``Nevertheless, we have to take it 
seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been taking steps to combat any attempts to harm  
Americans at home or abroad,'' said White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent threat was not conveyed directly to the government by  
letter, telephone call or other communication, Brekke said. Rather 
it was discovered by intelligence means. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began opening its headquarters to public tours in 1937  
when the bureau occupied part of the Justice Department building on 
Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, the tours moved across the street to the new FBI  
headquarters in the J. Edgar Hoover Building. The tours are 
highlighted by agents demonstrating the firing of a submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
	People on the tour also get to see, through glass partitions,  
the FBI laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Security concerns caused temporary cancellation of tours during  
the Persian Gulf War in 1991, domestic rioting in 1968, the 
anti-Vietnam War ``May Day'' protests in the early 1970s and World 
War II.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Nears Tour de France Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FUTUROSCOPE, France (AP) -- While holding the Tour de France lead  
through punishing mountain stages and energy-sapping sprints, Lance 
Armstrong was looking forward to a final time trial to cement his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, winner of both time trials earlier in the tour, made  
no mistakes during Friday's 18th stage of the tour from Jonzac to 
Futuroscope. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a catastrophe in today's 35-mile time trial around a  
science fiction park near the town of Poitiers would prevent him 
from coasting into Paris as an easy winner on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little chance of that.  
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong excels in time trials. He won races against the clock  
in the prologue and eighth stage, so went into today full of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Following unsubstantiated drug accusations in some parts of the  
French media, he decided against appearing at postrace news 
conferences Thursday or Friday, but did receive backing from race 
director Jean-Marie Leblanc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did they express doubt about Miguel Indurain's five  
victories?'' Leblanc told the newspaper Le Figaro. ``Never! Did 
they interview him, even one day, with the same impudence with 
which they are questioning Armstrong? Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, with the information at my disposal, I find these  
accusations scandalous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong hasn't let the accusations get in the way of his bid  
to be the first American to win the race since Greg LeMond in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he took no chances, stayed safely in the pack and  
came in 31st, not losing a second of his lead of 6 minutes, 15 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tactic is to protect the yellow jersey from danger,'' said  
Johan Bruyneel, director of Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. 
``We're in an ideal situation, but we have to be careful there 
isn't an accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the perfect scenario play out here,'' he said. ``I  
couldn't have made it up myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, American fans have cheered him on. Penny Zim of  
Peoria, Ill., is in France on a cycling trip and likes what is 
happening to her sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a huge spread on cycling in the hometown paper,  
that's progress,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	French fans aren't as ebullient. Their countrymen haven't won a  
stage on this tour. The last time the French were shut out was in 
1926, and a Frenchman hasn't won the tour since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Jean-Cyril Robin came close Friday with a second-place  
finish, but it was Italy's Gianpaolo Mondini who won the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, Spain's Fernando Escartin is second,  
followed by Alex Zulle of Switzerland, 7:28 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Friday's 117-mile stage saw the riders pass from  
Bordeaux's wine country into cognac country. ``Cognac Loves 
Armstrong,'' read a banner in the town's main street. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief pause when workers from Cognac, angry at the  
multinational corporations they say are making huge profits off 
them, briefly disrupted the start of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cognac protesters were clearly race fans. They handed  
cups of brandy to drivers passing ahead of the cyclists -- in full 
view of smiling gendarmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage began with an early break by five riders, including  
Frenchmen Frederic Bessy and Christophe Mengin. The group shrank 
and grew throughout the stage, and with 15 miles to go, 13 riders 
were in front by just more than two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	French national champion Francois Simon was one of the leading  
group. He made an attempt to break away near the end, but was 
caught and then outsprinted by Mondini.

	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Beneath the desk where Ray Lischner

developed a scorecard, much like a baseball scorecard. 
</P>
<P>
	Confident this could be big, Lischner recognized he didn't have  
the credentials to write ``Shakespeare for Dummies'' by himself. He 
needed a collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter John Doyle, a British theater director who has extensive  
experience with Shakespeare and served as artistic director of four 
theaters in England. When he presented a series of workshops at 
Oregon State, Lischner enrolled. He pitched the book after one of 
the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle recalls wondering if the world needed another book on  
Shakespeare. ``Then he said it would be part of the `Dummies' 
series,'' Doyle says. ``I liked it because I thought, `Anything to 
help make Shakespeare accessible.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With Doyle in Hastings, England, and Lischner in Corvallis, they  
collaborated by e-mail. As one would finish something at the end of 
his day, he would e-mail it to the other, eight time zones away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact we never saw each other made it easier,'' Doyle says.  
``You don't sit down and have all those hours of heartache. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started communicating with the publishers more and the  
academic editor, the whole thing was e-mails going round in 
worldwide circles. I don't know what Shakespeare would think of 
that. I do think he would quite approve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book offers hints to understanding the language of  
Elizabethan England in a chapter titled, ``Why Does Everyone Talk 
So Funny?'' and insights into the sources of stories behind the 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	One chapter is devoted to Doyle's workshop on using the  
imagination, something both authors say Shakespeare demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to exercise, like everything else,''  
Lischner says. ``Your imagination can get weak and flabby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each play is summarized, so someone going to a play can read it  
just before walking into the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you are not spending your time trying to keep track of  
the plot,'' Lischner says. ``You can spend your time enjoying the 
language, the images, the interplay, the characters or whatever you 
choose to focus on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, each summary has a scorecard to keep track of the  
players and action. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Romeo and Juliet,'' for example, when Romeo falls in love  
with a stranger in Act 1 Scene 1, the reader would draw a heart 
with a question mark next to Romeo's name on the scorecard. In 
Scene 4, the reader is urged to draw a pair of spectacles 
indicating Romeo dons a disguise. 
</P>
<P>
	In romantic encounters, first base on a baseball diamond  
indicates a suitor who woos a lover. Second base is awarded for 
meeting a lover in private, third base for getting engaged. Getting 
married is a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	A happy face means victorious in battle, a frowning face means  
defeated in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of saying, `Don't take this all too seriously,'''  
Doyle says. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle recommends playgoers fill out the scorecards while reading  
the play, not watching a performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were sitting next to somebody trying to keep score in a  
theater, I would be furious,'' Doyle says. ``We do suggest if you 
do that, you do it at the interval.''

<HEADLINE> Langston Has Yankee Nightmare Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk about horror films.  
</P>
<P>
	When Mark Langston walked out to the mound at Yankee Stadium on  
Saturday, he saw a videotape of a night he'd rather forget: Tino 
Martinez's grand slam off him in Game 1 of last year's World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Langston gave up nine runs in his worst outing in 11 years  
as Cleveland lost to the New York Yankees 21-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre was livid, immediately calling  
upstairs for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The New York Yankees should be above that,'' Torre said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even before he talked about the win, the Yankees' biggest in 46  
years, Torre wanted to send a message to Langston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought it was in bad taste,'' Torre said. ``I have no  
idea who was responsible for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego led the Yankees, an overwhelming favorite, 5-2 in the  
fifth inning of Game 1 last Oct. 17 before Chuck Knoblauch's 
three-run homer off Donne Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	With the bases loaded, Langston went to a 2-2 count on Martinez  
and thought he threw a called third strike by him, but plate umpire 
Richie Garcia called it a ball. Martinez then homered for a 9-5 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing is, they didn't show the 2-2 pitch,'' Langston  
said, showing a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	After the video, Langston walked Chuck Knoblauch and fell down  
trying to field Derek Jeter's bunt, which went for a single. 
</P>
<P>
	Two outs later, Chili Davis hit a two-run single that center  
fielder Kenny Lofton nearly came up with on an attempted diving 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all kind of fell apart from there,'' Langston (1-1) said.  
</P>
<P>
	He allowed nine runs -- seven earned -- and 10 hits in 4 1-3  
innings. It was the most runs off him since Oakland scored nine on 
April 29, 1988, when he was with Seattle. It was the most hits he 
allowed since Detroit got 10 on April 19, 1997, when he was with 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, my stuff wasn't that good,'' Langston said.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Tertyshny Dies in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Dmitri  
Tertyshny was killed when he fell out of a boat and was slashed by 
the propeller while on a trip to British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Russian was on the boat with two players from  
the minor-league Philadelphia Phantoms, Francis Belanger and Mihail 
Chernov, when the accident occurred Friday night on Okanagan Lake 
near Kelowna. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was kneeling up on the seats at the very front of the  
boat,'' Staff Sgt. Phillip Boissonneault of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police said Saturday. ``The boat hit a wave, which caused 
Dmitri to lose his balance and fall forward overboard. And then the 
boat ran over top of him and he was struck by the propeller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny had two goals and eight assists as a rookie last year  
in 62 games. He was drafted by the Flyers in the sixth round of the 
1995 NHL entry draft but he continued to play in his hometown of 
Chelyabinsk, Russia, until joining the Flyers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were in Kelowna for a power skating clinic.  
</P>
<P>
	``You worry about Tertyshny's family and you worry about the  
things you normally worry about when a young person passes away,'' 
Flyers team president and general manager Bob Clarke said Saturday. 
He said counseling will be available for players who were shaken up 
by the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny did not die right away, according to Boissonneault.  
</P>
<P>
	``He suffered some very severe lacerations to his neck,'' he  
said. Tertyshny, who was not wearing a life preserver, was bleeding 
severely, and likely severed his jugular vein, when he was pulled 
into the boat and likely died in the boat, Boissonneault added. 
</P>
<P>
	Boissonneault said a local woman identified as Michelle Monroe,  
who had met the players on the beach, was also on the boat. No 
information was immediately available about her. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol was consumed by the boating party but Belanger, who was  
operating the boat, was not legally impaired, Boissonneault said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot prove any criminal responsibility by any of the  
individuals on board and there are no charges contemplated at this 
time,'' Boissonneault said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tertyshny is survived by his wife, Pauline, who still lives in  
Russia. A Flyers spokesman said the body will be returned to Russia 
for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great sense of humor, he was outgoing,'' team captain  
Eric Lindros said. ``He was an all-star in the making. He was just 
a terrific player and loved the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros said he was in shock when he learned of his teammate's  
death Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will certainly be missed as a teammate first and  
foremost,'' Lindros said. ``He always put the team first; he worked 
extremely hard.''

<HEADLINE>  Reformers Admire Ross Perot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Reform Party founder Ross Perot on  
Saturday night urged his party to remain united and continue to 
fight for a balanced budget, term limits and campaign reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot didn't say whether he is interested in seeking his party's  
nomination for a third presidential run. But many waved Perot 
placards and hooted with approval during his 40-minute, 
campaign-style speech at the party's national convention Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the American people to understand what real democracy  
is all about,'' he said, waving his arms toward about 580 
conventioneers. ``I want them to understand that you have worked 
your hearts out since 1992 for one reason: that you love this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perot said the country must return to a moral foundation, saying  
the party should never nominate a candidate ``that could not be a 
good role model for our children and grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for tax reform, a complete overhaul of Medicaid,  
Medicare and Social Security and shorter election campaigns that 
would cost less. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also seemed to recognize those in the party who have said  
they don't want him to make another presidential run in 2000, 
promising to stay ``as long as I am helpful to the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want is what I see in the papers day in and  
day out, about catfights and what have you that have nothing to do 
with fact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot, a Dallas billionaire, has been the party's most famous  
face since his 1992 presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	But some party members, including influential Minnesota Gov.  
Jesse Ventura, say Perot's diminishing returns in the 1996 
presidential race have convinced them he should step aside and let 
someone else run. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Reform Party members announced plans to draft retired  
Gen. Colin Powell for the 2000 presidential campaign, even though 
it's a job Powell says he doesn't want. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Shaffer, 53, an Illinois construction worker dressed like  
Uncle Sam, said he supports Ventura for the 2000 nomination despite 
prior votes for Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ross Perot is the most honorable founder of our party, a good  
citizen who founded something that will last a lifetime,'' Shaffer 
said. ``But based on the performance in Ventura's election, I have 
a feeling he could do that nationwide.''

	Female Shuttle Chief Busy in Orbit  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The first woman to command an  
American rocketship, Eileen Collins, was ``extremely happy'' when 
she and her crew reached orbit yesterday, but even happier when 
they sent the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory on its 
five-year voyage to search for black holes and peer at galaxies, 
quasars and exploded stars. The 42-year-old Air Force colonel said 
she has been so busy in orbit that she hasn't had time to think 
about her new spot in space history. ``We still have a few more 
days, so the pressure isn't off yet,'' Collins said today from 
space shuttle Columbia.

Martha's Vineyard. At a private memorial, the two sisters were

deterrence must be sent to those who perpetuate the violence that 
has shattered Kosovo in the last year. The victims were found by a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Buys Back Supercomputer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department's Sandia National  
Laboratory last week bought back a supercomputer it had sold as 
surplus to Korber Jiang, a Chinese citizen who is the principle of 
EHI Group USA and exports American goods to his home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called Friday for Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson's resignation, saying that the computer could have been 
used ``to design nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going around the country saying there are no problems in  
the Department of Energy, that everything is under control,'' 
Weldon said in a telephone interview. ``If there are no problems, 
then how can this happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Singer, a spokesman for Sandia National Laboratories, said  
that the New Mexico facility sold the Intel Paragon XPS to Korber's 
one-man company for $30,000 in October. After discovering Korber's 
nationality, Singer said, the department bought back the computer 
for $88,000 last week and stored it under guard at Sandia. The 
spokesman said the difference in cost may have been due to shipping 
costs incurred by Korber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Richardson has instituted a moratorium on any sales  
of surplus material that incorporates export control technology 
until there has been a thorough review of what happened,'' said 
Energy Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction was first reported by Insight Magazine.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An airline gate agent remained in critical  
condition Saturday, two days after being slammed to the ground by 
an angry passenger at Newark International Airport, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines worker Angelo Sottile, 50, suffered head  
and spinal injuries on Thursday during the brief scuffle with 
passenger John C. Davis, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, of Fredericksburg, Va., was apparently pursuing his  
straying toddler on the walkway leading to a plane, and failed to 
show a boarding pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sottile tried to stop Davis, prompting a violent reaction,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was charged with aggravated assault.  
</P>
<P>
	Port Authority Police Capt. Nicholas Kormash said Davis claims  
he was acting in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Sottile was taken to University Hospital in Newark. He remained  
in critical condition on Saturday, according to a nursing 
supervisor.

<P>
	NORTH RANDALL, Ohio (AP) -- Stellar Brush overtook the field  
around the turn and held off Ecton Park by a neck to win the 
$300,000 Ohio Derby at Thistledown on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stellar Brush went 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 1-5 and paid $9.60, $3.80  
and $3. Ecton Park paid $3.20 and $2.80 while Valhol, 
three-quarters of a length back in third, paid $5.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Stellar Brush, sired by 1986 Ohio Derby winner Broad Brush, ran  
in the back of the pack early, made a move on the turn to gain a 
contending position, then charged into the lead with a quarter-mile 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrific course,'' said Richard Small, who has also  
trained a second- and a third-place finisher in previous Ohio 
Derbys. ``We couldn't be more pleased. We were lucky to have 
(jockey) Michael McCarthy give up some good rides at Delaware Park 
to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stellar Brush opened the day at 9-2 and was bet down to 7-2 by  
post time. He won the $200,000 Leonard Richards at Delaware Park 
earlier this year and also was second in the $200,000 Iowa Derby at 
Prairie Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sky's led through six furlongs before fading to fourth.  
Grits'n Hard Toast and Millions battled near the lead much of the 
race and then weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely a pinnacle for my career,'' McCarthy said.  
``I've been here before, but never on such a huge scale. Our horse 
was a little excited before the race because I think he just wanted 
to get in and get it over with. He settled nicely after he broke 
from the gate and responded when I needed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stellar Brush claimed a $180,000 purse by besting 12 rivals.  
</P>
<P>
	The Derby is the first leg of the $1 Million DeBartolo Racing  
Challenge, which includes the Remington Park Derby on Sept. 5 and 
the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs on Oct. 2. Any horse winning all 
three events receives a $1 million bonus. Horses running in all 
three races are eligible for various participation bonuses totaling 
$300,000.

	Small said he wasn't sure whether Stellar Brush would race in  
the Remington Park Derby.

<HEADLINE> Slim Evidence Against SLA Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No eyewitnesses link former fugitive Kathleen  
Soliah to a police bombing plot and the most damaging witnesses 
against her are dead, according to newly released transcripts from 
her 23-year-old case. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Soliah planted the bombs as a member of the  
radical Symbionese Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 27 witnesses testified before the federal grand jury  
that indicted Soliah, a plumbing contractor and a bomb expert 
provided the strongest links to materials used in the 1975 attacks, 
according to 1976 transcripts released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men have since died.  
</P>
<P>
	Soliah, now a 52-year-old doctor's wife and Minnesota mother of  
three, could face life in prison if convicted of conspiracy to kill 
Los Angeles police with nail bombs that were placed under two 
patrol cars. Neither bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
	Soliah, who now calls herself Sara Jane Olson, has pleaded  
innocent. She was freed Tuesday on $1 million bail after spending 
five weeks in jail following her arrest in Minnesota. She arrived 
at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Friday night, 
and did not meet with reporters or supporters waiting to greet her. 
</P>
<P>
	She has admitted fleeing two decades ago after her indictment.  
</P>
<P>
	The 236-page grand jury transcript records the testimony of  
witnesses, most of them law enforcement officers, who told how the 
pipe bombs were discovered under police cars -- one in the parking 
lot of a restaurant and one at a police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb experts explained in detail the components of the bombs and  
the flaws that kept them from detonating and other experts told of 
the grave injuries that would have occurred if they exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police claimed that the bombs were intended as retaliation for  
the 1974 SLA shootout in which Los Angeles officers killed six 
members of the radical underground group. 
</P>
<P>
	A former San Francisco policeman and freelance photographer told  
of hearing Soliah speak at a Berkeley rally shortly after the 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Jason identified Soliah from a photo. He testified  
that he heard her speak of the death of her friend Angela Atwood, 
who was killed in the shootout, and express support for William and 
Emily Harris and Patricia Hearst, known as Tania, who were then 
wanted by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember her saying, 'Tania, Emily, and Bill ... you have  
made your message clear. Keep fighting,''' Jason testified. ``She 
said, 'Keep fighting. We are with you. I am with you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Plumbing company employee James Marshall identified Soliah from  
a photograph as the woman who accompanied a man who bought 
materials linked to the pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb expert, Arleigh McCree, said he thought the bombs could  
have been made in an apartment in San Francisco where Soliah's 
fingerprints were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah's lawyer, Stuart Hanlon, noted that the FBI and  
police department experts were unable to match prints on the bombs 
to any SLA members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't that make you think they have the wrong group of  
people?'' Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless further evidence is uncovered, the case should be  
dismissed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Michael Latin has acknowledged the circumstantial  
nature of the case but has said there is sufficient evidence to 
bring her to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Soliah's fingerprints were found in a San Francisco apartment  
rented by the Harrises. Authorities said a closet full of 
bombmaking materials and weapons were found in the apartment, along 
with a gun manual and an Army technical manual. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the transcript, experts found Soliah's prints on  
the gun manual and the apartment walls. 
</P>
<P>
	However, McCree, who examined the police car bombs and a bomb  
found in the closet, was the only expert who testified that the 
three devices positively were connected, based on their materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some individual who had access to those materials did build  
these three bombs,'' McCree testified.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Hires Gonzaga's Monson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Monson was hired Saturday as men's  
basketball coach at Minnesota, a month after the school bought out 
the contract of former coach Clem Haskins following an academic 
fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, 37, led Gonzaga to a 52-17 record and consecutive West  
Coast Conference titles in two seasons as coach. His last Gonzaga 
team eliminated Minnesota from the NCAA tournament last season, 
then advanced to the regional final before losing to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson will receive a seven-year base salary of $150,000 per  
year and an outside package worth another $340,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson signed a 10-year deal with Gonzaga in April, but he  
assured Gophers fans that he wouldn't take the next available 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was well known there with my administration that if I had  
an opportunity of a lifetime, that I have certain goals in my 
profession to move up, and I feel that this is one of those 
opportunities of a lifetime,'' Monson said during a news conference 
at Williams Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who had been in Portugal and Majorca during the last  
month while Minnesota was conducting its coaching search, said the 
move's timing is ``terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, it doesn't get much worse for me  
personally,'' he said. ``But there is no good time to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson takes over just weeks before Minnesota takes an  
exhibition trip to Europe, and less than three months before 
practice begins Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball program also faces an uncertain future. The  
academic fraud investigation by independent investigators is 
expected to wrap up in September, and the university could face 
NCAA probation or sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson seemed resigned to some type of penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know with this probation, the next coach here has to do  
things the right way,'' he said. ``In that regard, I know I'm 
coming into a place that expects me to run my program the only way 
I know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said he was confident Monson  
could restore respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coach Monson is outstanding and he's the right person  
to grow the basketball program, and take us where we want to go and 
take us there what I'll call `the right way,''' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota bought out Haskins' contract June 30, the coach  
walking away with $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Rick Majerus, Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders  
and Virginia athletic director Terry Holland were also reported to 
be candidates for the job. Each turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson said he didn't mind that he wasn't the school's initial  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that it's what choice I was,'' he said. ``It's  
that I was the choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Minnesota players on hand for the news conference said  
they were glad to see Monson hired despite having voted to endorse 
former Washington Wizards coach Bernie Bickerstaff to replace 
Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I wanted was a young coach because he's got a lot of  
enthusiasm,'' said sophomore center Joel Przybilla, one of seven 
players who supported Bickerstaff, father of Gophers forward John 
Blair Bickerstaff. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who is getting married in Spokane Aug. 7, said he would  
stay in Minneapolis until Friday to meet with players and hire 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just before the Gonzaga-Minnesota game that the Saint  
Paul Pioneer Press reported that Gophers players were involved in 
academic fraud. A former office manager in the athletic 
department's academic counseling office said she wrote papers for 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga officials declined to comment Saturday on reports that  
assistant coach Mark Few would replace Monson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll announce who it is on Monday,'' vice president Harry  
Sladich said.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Search Costs $287,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard incurred costs totaling  
$287,402 in the first two days of the search for John F. Kennedy 
Jr.'s missing aircraft, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The search and rescue effort began early Saturday morning and  
ended when it became clear that Kennedy's plane had crashed into 
the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	That initial search involved patrol boats, helicopters and other  
aircraft stationed along the East Coast, including bases in Cape 
Cod, Mass.; Montauk, N.Y; Newport, R.I.; and Woods Hole, Mass., 
according to Coast Guard spokesman Mike Lapinski. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs include fuel, maintenance and salaries and were  
covered by the Coast Guard's annual congressional appropriation for 
operating expenses, Lapinski said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Buys Back Supercomputer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department's Sandia National  
Laboratory last week bought back a supercomputer it had sold as 
surplus to Korber Jiang, a Chinese citizen who is the principle of 
EHI Group USA and exports American goods to his home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called Friday for Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson's resignation, saying that the computer could have been 
used ``to design nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going around the country saying there are no problems in  
the Department of Energy, that everything is under control,'' 
Weldon said in a telephone interview. ``If there are no problems, 
then how can this happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Singer, a spokesman for Sandia National Laboratories, said  
that the New Mexico facility sold the Intel Paragon XPS to Korber's 
one-man company for $30,000 in October. After discovering Korber's 
nationality, Singer said, the department bought back the computer 
for $88,000 last week and stored it under guard at Sandia. The 
spokesman said the difference in cost may have been due to shipping 
costs incurred by Korber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Richardson has instituted a moratorium on any sales  
of surplus material that incorporates export control technology 
until there has been a thorough review of what happened,'' said 
Energy Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction was first reported by Insight Magazine.

<HEADLINE> Aides Help Keep Bush on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is accused of stretching  
campaign laws and embellishing his military record. One of his 
fund-raisers evaded her taxes; another sells assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Republican presidential candidate still is in command of  
the nomination race, unbowed by miscues that tested his tiny band 
of political confidants. The quick response of three key aides, 
called the ``Iron Triangle'' because of their steely grip on power 
in Bush's past and present campaigns, may foreshadow how the Texas 
governor will respond to bigger snags later in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has stuck,'' complained Democratic consultant James  
Carville, who helped Bill Clinton slip through a minefield of 
scandals in the 1992 campaign. ``But it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an error-free opening to his campaign, the Texas governor  
faced his first bit of trouble when news organizations reported 
that: 
</P>
<P>
	--The host of a Florida fund-raising get-together had pleaded  
guilty to two counts of income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	--His finance chairman in Maine was an assault weapons  
manufacturer being sued by a Los Angeles police officer wounded in 
a gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bush used unregulated out-of-state campaign contributions to  
rent prime space for next month's Iowa straw polls, a practice that 
tests the bounds of federal election laws. 
</P>
<P>
	--His 1978 campaign literature said Bush served in the Air Force,  
a claim that is legitimate only if the brief time he spent in 
training or on alert with the Texas Air National Guard counts as 
Air Force service. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first sign of trouble, the Bush team acted.  
</P>
<P>
	The tax evader no longer was welcomed at the fund-raiser. The  
weapons manufacturer quit the campaign. The straw poll money was 
replaced with cash from Bush's own campaign account. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides initially insisted the so-called ``soft money''  
donations were legal, and held firm for an entire weekend. On 
Monday, as reporters uncovered more details, the Bush team met in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Joe Allbaugh led a discussion about the  
complicated legal questions and the obvious political problem. 
Several aides, including communications director Karen Hughes, 
suggested that Bush simply use campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Allbaugh, a no-nonsense Texan, replied, ``Just do it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bush's team was better prepared for questions about the Texas  
Air National Guard. Months ago, aides researched Bush's personal 
history and Hughes read Bush's political file from the 1978 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've dealt with this stuff before,'' she said, recounting his  
1994 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	When questions surfaced, Hughes had details at hand. She said  
the pamphlet was accurate, because Bush worked 607 days of active 
duty service, during flight training between November 1968 and 
November 1969 and in periods of Air National Guard alerts, when she 
said he was considered to be on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force said Air National Guard members are considered  
``guardsmen on active duty,'' not Air Force personnel, while 
receiving pilot training. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush seemed to back off a bit. He said later that day that he  
thought the pamphlet was correct, but he didn't ``want to get in a 
semantical discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key to Bush's fast-moving operation is the three-member  
inner circle. Hughes manages the message. Allbaugh keeps things on 
track. Karl Rove runs the political operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rove is a fellow traveler of the late Lee Atwater, the  
high-profile consultant who managed Bush's father's 1988 
presidential campaign. Rove ran Bush's successful gubernatorial 
campaigns in 1994 and 1998, then quietly laid the groundwork for 
him to emerge as the presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a small circle of top advisers makes for quick decisions  
and, so far, a single-minded focus to do what it takes to get Bush 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize if there is a potential problem, we better be quick  
to fix it,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation reminds some of Clinton's 1992 team that included  
Carville, George Stephanopoulos, Paul Begala and an intimate or two 
from Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly they've done a good job at moving fast,'' Carville  
said grudgingly. ``But they're going to have to move fast a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush rivals predict that Bush, like Clinton, will find it harder  
to recover from trouble with each passing controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One wonders over time if they will have an accumulative  
effect,'' said Bill Dal Col, campaign chairman for GOP presidential 
candidate Steve Forbes. ``The question is, will he sag under the 
weight of controversies?''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Perez Pulled From Rotation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Carlos Perez was removed from the Los Angeles  
Dodgers' pitching rotation and second baseman Eric Young was given 
at least a few days off as manager Davey Johnson tries to shore up 
his slumping team. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez (2-10) gave up 10 runs on 11 hits in six innings in the  
Dodgers' 10-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks Friday night. The 
27-year-old right-hander, acquired in a seven-player trade with 
Montreal a year ago, has a 7.43 ERA, worst among Dodgers starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's debacle clinched Johnson's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to work at it, I'm sure he can get it back,''  
Johnson said. ``But I can't keep going through that. He took it 
pretty hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he will decide by Sunday who will take Perez's  
place in the rotation next Wednesday against Cincinnati. He 
mentioned five possibilities, including two relievers on the 
big-league roster -- Jamie Arnold and Onan Masaoka. Arnold (2-2) has 
two starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also said he was considering two pitchers with Triple-A  
Albuquerque, Mike Judd and Robinson Checo, and Eric Gagne, pitching 
for Double-A San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Young will sit because various leg ailments have  
hampered his defense. Young's failure to turn a routine double play 
Friday night cleared the way for Arizona's five-run fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it is footwork and timing,'' Johnson said. ``If  
you're not 100 percent, you're going to get killed down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he would wait to see how Young feels early next  
week to determine whether to put him back in the lineup. Meanwhile, 
Jose Vizcaino and Craig Counsell will platoon at second. Vizcaino 
was in the starting lineup Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson brushed aside any concern over Raul Mondesi's behavior  
Friday night. After the five-run inning, Mondesi didn't go back to 
the dugout, instead of spending the Dodgers' time at-bat in the 
bullpen chatting with relief pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to talk to him to find out what was going on,'' Johnson  
said. ``I don't take a head count in the dugout. For all I know, he 
had to go to the bathroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi has declined to discuss the incident.

<HEADLINE> Fans Flock to Hemingway's Haunts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETOSKEY, Mich. (AP) -- Although Judy Henn was raised in New York  
and lived in Israel for 31 years, there was no question in her mind 
she was in the right place Saturday as she trudged along the muddy 
two-track forest road in northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a genuine, certified Ernest Hemingway nut,'' Ms. Henn  
said, fanning herself with a sheaf of papers on which she has 
scrawled copious notes while visiting sites linked with the 
author's early days. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 20-minute walk along the path, Ms. Henn paused beside a  
clearing overgrown with waist-high grass. This was the Indian camp 
referred to in several of the Nick Adams stories, a guide explained 
to the group Ms. Henn was with. 
</P>
<P>
	She gazed at the spot.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being in places like this gives you a sense of what he saw,  
what he felt,'' she said. ``It's a heady experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 fans have flocked to Petoskey and neighboring Horton  
Bay this week for a Hemingway centennial festival. Born July 21, 
1899, he spent his first 16 summers at the family cottage on 
Walloon Lake. Many of his short stories and the novella ``The 
Torrents of Spring'' are set in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by the Michigan Hemingway Society and the Little  
Traverse Bay Historical Society, this week's events have given the 
faithful -- from the United States and countries ranging from 
England to Japan -- a chance to retrace the writer's boyhood 
footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are academics, such as Ms. Henn, who is writing a doctoral  
dissertation on ``The Torrents of Spring.'' Others are aspiring 
writers. Still others simply admire the man and his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wrote about the kinds of things we did as kids -- fishing,  
hunting, playing in the woods, and he did it so vividly it all 
comes to life again,'' said Karen Moberg of Rapid River. ``You can 
feel it and taste it and smell it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Bourke, who teaches a Hemingway course at a college in the  
Canadian province of Alberta, was among a group that attended a 
conference in the author's hometown of Oak Park, Ill., before 
heading to Petoskey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps provide that sense of place that's so important to  
understand Hemingway's writing,'' Bourke said after touring 
Windemere, the Hemingway cottage on Walloon Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Busloads of tourists arrived throughout the week to see the  
cottage, which owner Ernest Mainland -- the author's nephew -- opened 
to the public for the occasion.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Friend Blasts Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In life, late baseball Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio  
closely guarded his privacy. Now some of his confidential medical 
charts have been found mixed with hospital documents being used in 
a court case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such an invasion of privacy for such a private man,''  
said Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney. 
``What's more sacred than your hospital records?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The records were among medical papers submitted as evidence in  
the case of a mother accused of deliberately making her daughter 
sick to get attention and sympathy for herself. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio and Kathy Bush's daughter, Jennifer, were both treated  
at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. DiMaggio died in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistake was discovered Friday when attorneys for both sides  
gathered to view the hospital documents. Mrs. Bush's attorneys are 
now arguing the mistake is evidence the hospital mishandled the 
girl's records. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital called the mistake a clerical error, apologized for  
the sloppiness and said it is reviewing its procedures to prevent 
other mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said he plans to sue to obtain DiMaggio's records from  
the hospital to keep them safe.

<HEADLINE> JFK's Dog Said To Be in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife died, many  
people wondered what had happened to the couple's dog, Friday, who 
was frequently seen around the city with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The black and white dog is safe -- it was apparently taken to  
Massachusetts by a close friend of Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy, shortly after their plane disappeared last weekend, said a 
law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News first reported on Thursday that the dog was alive  
and living in Massachusetts with the couple's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if the Kennedys' cat was also in  
Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Redskins, Top Pick Agree on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins today reached a  
verbal agreement with first-round draft pick Champ Bailey, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Team sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Bailey  
agreed to a five-year deal and the contract could be signed in time 
for Bailey to report to the first day of training camp in 
Frostburg, Md., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Times reported today the deal was worth $10.25  
million over five years and includes a $5.2 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins had been seeking a five-year contract while  
Bailey's agent had been looking for a four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was the seventh overall selection in the April draft. He  
played cornerback and wide receiver at Georgia and is expected to 
start at cornerback opposite Darrell Green for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Norv Turner said this week that if Bailey reported to camp  
on time there would be a chance that he also could play on offense 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey's signing was the latest aggressive move by new team  
owner Daniel Snyder, who closed his $800 million purchase of the 
team earlier this month. On Friday, Snyder removed Charley Casserly 
as general manager and made him a ``consultant to the owner.'' 
Vinny Serrato was appointed director of player personnel, assuming 
most of Casserly's duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, it appeared negotiations with Bailey would  
not be resolved until several days into training camp.

<HEADLINE> Ellerbe Smashes Record, Takes Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Dawn Ellerbe wiped away all the  
disappointments of her international career by winning the first 
gold medal in track and field at the 1999 Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my first Pan Am Games and winning is very special,''  
Ellerbe said Saturday after smashing the meet record in the women's 
hammer throw with a heave of 214 feet, 5 inches on her final 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	This was only the second time the event was contested at the  
Games, and five of Ellerbe's six throws surpassed the mark of 193-4 
set by Alexandria Given of the United States in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In other track finals, Americans finished 1-2 in the men's shot  
put for the second straight games, as Brad Mears won at 65-4 3/4, 
followed by Jamie Beyer at 62-2 1/4; Brazil's Maurren Maggi, the world 
leader in the women's long jump, won at 21-7 1/2; and Mexico's Jose 
Galvan was declared the winner of the men's 5,000 in 13:42.04, 
after first-place finisher Pablo Olmedo, also of Mexico, was 
disqualified for obstructing or jostling another runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-place finisher Elenilson Silva of Brazil was disqualified  
for the same infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Chris Huffins, the two-time U.S. champion in the  
decathlon, led after Saturday's first five events with 4,415 
points. He won the 100 in 10.47 and the long jump at 24-10, then 
had seconds in the shot put and high jump, and a fifth in the 400. 
The final five events are Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada edged the United States in women's team gymnastics, then  
Cuba did the same to the men. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Venezuelan, with help from a Mexican, beat an American to  
the finish of the men's triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of table tennis was delayed 5 1/2 hours when the Latin  
American federations protested the seeding procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought it would be one way, then they discovered it  
wasn't and went, `Hold on,' '' said games press secretary Brian 
Koshul, who added that a compromise was reached and ``everybody is 
happy and nobody dropped out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early track competition went to form. Americans Johnny Gray  
and Trinity Townsend won their semifinal heats in the men's 800. 
Meredith Rainey Valmon, the defending champion in the women's 800, 
and Kathy Rounds qualified for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ellerbe was the star of the show on a steamy afternoon at  
sparsely attended University of Manitoba Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. champion for the past four years and the two-time NCAA  
champion at South Carolina, Ellerbe entered the Pan Am Games a 
prohibitive favorite off her American record of 230-2 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she also had several past failures in international  
meets. She finished seventh in both the 1997 World University Games 
and 1998 Goodwill Games and placed fourth in this year's World 
University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first international title,'' Ellerbe said. ``I put  
in a lot of hard work this year and it paid off. I will take a V -- 
for victory -- any way I can get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to win at the world championships (next month at  
Seville, Spain). That last throw put me on the way toward that. 
Winning the gold here is close to winning the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about what happened today.''  
</P>
<P>
	Later, two of the top U.S. sprinters -- Tim Harden and Angela  
Williams -- looked sluggish in their semifinal heats. Harden had an 
excuse after finishing second in his heat: he did not arrive in 
Winnipeg until 2 a.m. Saturday, after getting stuck in Minneapolis 
for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired,'' Harden said. ``It was a bad race. I was  
lethargic. I just want to rest and run my race in the final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA champion from Southern California, also was  
second in her heat in 11.52. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got out bad,'' said the freshman. ``It was a shock. Instead  
of being aggressive after that, I let my will get me down. That's 
basically giving up on a race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand my mistakes. I can't play around any more.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gray, the remarkable 39-year-old who contemplated retirement 11  
years ago, eased to victory in his heat in 1:47.07. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I think about retirement, there's always another big  
meet that comes along -- the Olympics, world championships, World 
Cup, World University Games -- that I always say I will run one more 
year,'' the enthusiastic Gray said. ``Retirement usually crosses my 
mind about once a year. This year, it's crossed my mind 10 or 15 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada beat the favored Americans in women's gymnastics with  
148.944 points. The United States had 148.364 and Brazil took the 
bronze with 147.639. Canada also won the Pan Am gold in 1979, the 
only other year the United States failed to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not 100 percent prepared,'' U.S. coach Mary Lee Tracy  
said. ``We were doing some new skills, not to mention the world 
championships to think about. But those are excuses. Basically, we 
got beat. They hit more than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's Gilberto Gonzalez, who was bedridden with pneumonia  
earlier this year, edged American Hunter Kemper in the triathlon. 
He teamed with Mexico's Javier Rosas to wear out Kemper in the 
grueling run-swim-cycle event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had good teamwork with the Mexicans and my brother  
Camilo,'' Gonzalez said. ``I think I worked well on (Kemper).''

<HEADLINE> Latest Tragedy Damages Kennedy Aura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Saldarriaga was born a decade after  
President Kennedy was assassinated. He's a little unclear what 
``Camelot'' means. But here he stands amid the freshly laid roses 
at the site of John Kennedy Jr.'s memorial service, lamenting the 
loss of an era he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
	``JFK Jr. is the last of the Camelots,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy mystique may have survived Vietnam, Watergate, the  
Reagan ``revolution'' and unflattering revelations about the 35th 
president. But now that another John Kennedy is dead, can the myth 
endure? 
</P>
<P>
	An aura has surrounded the Kennedys for decades because the  
family's tale has all the elements of a good myth, says John 
Hellmann, author of ``The Kennedy Obsession: The American Myth of 
JFK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A great mythology is a story ... in which people see their  
highest beliefs and values -- along with their greatest fears -- 
mirrored,'' says Hellmann, an English professor at Ohio State 
University, in Lima. ``If anything, this may enhance it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The myth that began with Camelot bridges celebrity and politics.  
Both JFK and JFK Jr. seemed equally at ease with political and 
movie stars. JFK's portrait still hangs next to the pope's in homes 
from Boston to Belfast. His son's photo adorns college dormitory 
walls and teen magazines. The parallels carry through to death. The 
father was brought down by an assassin at 46; the son died in a 
plane crash at 38. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason John F. Kennedy Jr. and Sr. continued to dominate  
the news for so long is because they managed to make the transition 
from serious culture to pop culture,'' says Larry Sabato, director 
of government studies at the University of Virginia in 
Charlottesville. The elder JFK, he says, became ``the political 
Marilyn Monroe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When David McCullough asks college students to name their  
favorite president, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ``Truman'' 
always gets the same response: JFK. The highest rated show on his 
PBS program, ``The American Experience,'' featured the Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of the younger JFK is unlikely to alter that, says  
McCullough, who quit a magazine job to work for the U.S. 
Information Agency under President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, the myth will endure. And, yes, the myth will be in some  
ways misleading and not representative. But it won't be untrue,'' 
he says. ``The heroic young man, potential leader of his people, 
who was cut off, destroyed before his time. ... People will be 
telling this story 100 years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Historians trace the mystique of Camelot to JFK's widow,  
Jacqueline, who told a reporter for Life magazine that her husband 
liked the score of ``Camelot.'' The bittersweet musical recounting 
the legend of King Arthur's medieval court opened on Broadway a 
month after JFK's election. 
</P>
<P>
	His favorite line: ``Don't let it be forgot that once there was  
a spot for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When actor Louis Hayward reached those words in a Chicago  
performance after JFK's death, the play stopped while audience 
members wept. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a magical time, in some respects,'' McCullough recalls.  
``Never, never had there been a president who was himself and with 
his family as glamorous as anything on the screen. ... We respond 
to beauty in all manifestations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the myth began in World War II when JFK was injured  
while he commanded PT-109, which was rammed by a Japanese 
destroyer. He later downplayed his heroism: ``It was involuntary. 
They sank my boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger JFK might never had entered politics. But he would  
not have lacked opportunities. JFK Jr. had taken a local 
prosecutor's job that launched other aspiring politicians. But he 
quit to publish the magazine George, a novel blend of politics and 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought politics should be an integral part of our popular  
culture, and that popular culture should be an integral part of 
politics,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy said Friday in a eulogy for his 
nephew. ``He transformed that belief into the creation of George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many hoped the younger JFK would follow his father's career.  
</P>
<P>
	``His father began as a journalist who turned to politics,''  
says historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who later chronicled the 
elder JFK's career. ``I think young John was moving in that 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the last year, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,  
unsuccessfully urged JFK Jr. to represent New York in the Senate. 
His uncertain future in politics may only solidify JFK Jr.'s place 
in the Kennedy mythology. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no more certain means of establishing a place in  
history that reflects the qualities Americans admire most than to 
die young,'' Torricelli says. ``John Kennedy Jr.'s untimely death 
now adds one more element of permanent youth to the Kennedy 
mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over two centuries, Americans have favored political dynasties,  
electing two presidential families: the Adams and the Roosevelts. 
</P>
<P>
	And, political analyst Sabato says, ``who's the leading  
candidate for president right now? The son of a president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While JFK Jr. had never proven himself in politics, the standing  
ovation he received at the 1988 Democratic Convention revealed one 
party's hopes for a third. But, unlike Kennedy, George W. Bush 
began his political ascent years ago and has already been elected 
governor of Texas twice. 
</P>
<P>
	To Sabato, another JFK presidency is just part of the myth.  
``The people who would've been attracted to JFK Jr. as a 
presidential candidate are people who read teen magazines,'' says 
Sabato, ``and they don't vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before JFK Jr.'s death, the Kennedy mantle had grown  
frayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Kennedy Sr., the family patriarch and ambassador to  
England, expected to pass it to his eldest son, Joe Jr. When the 
younger Joe's plane exploded during World War II, the father's 
presidential aspirations were passed to John. With his 
assassination in 1963, the family's leading political role passed 
to his brother, Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this dream of the Kennedys returning to the White  
House,'' says Ohio State's Hellmann. ``There was this sense of 
restoration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When RFK died, many then looked to a young Edward Kennedy. His  
aspirations were dashed in 1969, when he drove off a bridge on 
Massachusetts' Chappaquiddick Island and killed Mary Jo Kopechne. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, says Hellmann, ``in whatever subliminal sense, the  
attention turned to John Kennedy Jr.'' That ended last weekend when 
JFK Jr.'s plane plunged into the waters off Martha's Vineyard, 
leaving no apparent heir to President Kennedy's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	With both the father and son, ``we've had to leave to our  
imaginations what might have been,'' says Tom Dardenne, who last 
week visited the site where President Kennedy was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the myth that began with the elder JFK endures depends  
largely on younger Americans. Judging from the freshmen in Sabato's 
politics course, it has already faded. 
</P>
<P>
	``They connected with his celebrity and his dashing appearance,  
but for the most part John F. Kennedy was ancient, dusty history,'' 
Sabato says. ``There was no emotional connection whatsoever. And 
John F. Kennedy Jr. was just another rock star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Dealey Plaza in Dallas, 21-year-old Michelle Wells, too, sees  
the slain president as a subject of study. ``My parents really 
liked him,'' she says. ``Of course you say, 'Oh, sure, I know JFK,' 
but I don't really know any history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among her parents' generation, it clearly lives on.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds placed bouquets to wilt in the hot sun outside the John  
F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, where admirers queued to 
sign a condolence book for the JFK Jr.'s sister, Caroline, who has 
shunned the political spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sad as it is, I think his death is the end of the Kennedy  
mystique,'' says Donna Dimarzo, a 48-year-old accountant from 
Norwood, Mass. ``It's the end of Camelot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, she took it all back: ``Caroline has a son,  
Jack. Maybe he'll grow up to do something special.''

<HEADLINE> African Queen Offering Rides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) -- The boat that once carted Humphrey Bogart  
and Katharine Hepburn around on the silver screen is plying 
Michigan waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The African Queen, from the movie of the same name, will offer  
rides on the Saginaw River as a fund-raiser for the Saginaw Valley 
Naval Ship Museum Committee. A half-hour cruise on the boat built 
in 1912 costs $15. The rides will last until Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat is captained by James Hendricks, 75, a retired Kentucky  
attorney who bought the vessel in 1982 for $65,000 because, ``I was 
trying to find something respectable to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hendricks, a fan of Hepburn, also owns two boats used in another  
of her movies, ``On Golden Pond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogart and Hepburn were on the boat when they filmed their movie  
in Africa. Hendricks said in the early 1980s he exchanged letters 
with Hepburn and asked her if she would like to ride on The African 
Queen once more. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said she thought it blew up in Africa,'' Hendricks  
recalled. He was never able to get Hepburn on board.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Mack Won't Miss the Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kick returner-defensive back Tremain Mack, in  
trouble with the NFL for a series of alcohol-abuse arrests, will be 
allowed to play at least part of the upcoming season, the NFL has 
told the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue met with Mack for two hours in  
New York on Friday to review the player's status under the league's 
substance-abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue is to decide in the next few weeks on a possible  
suspension or fine. In the meantime, Mack will be allowed to 
participate in the Bengals' preseason training camp which opens 
Friday in Georgetown, Ky., Bengals officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a fourth-round pick in 1997 from the University of Miami,  
set Bengals season records last year for kickoff return yardage and 
average per return. He is the team's No. 1 returner and a backup 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the final four games of last season when he went to  
jail after his second drunken driving arrest in the Cincinnati 
area. The suspension cost him about $62,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first two years with the Bengals, Mack has had the two  
DUI arrests in Ohio along with other alcohol-related arrests in 
Texas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He has signed a two-year contract extension with the Bengals.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that he knows he's made mistakes,'' Bengals president  
Mike Brown said. ``He regrets it, wants to do the right thing, but 
he has to live that out. Sometimes, guys can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he's successful with it,'' Brown said. ``You can say  
goodbye or you can try to help. We try to help them and, more often 
than not, it's successful. Sometimes a guy doesn't get out of the 
ditch, but I don't regret trying to help.''

<HEADLINE> Irishman Plays American Sheriff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For ``Lake Placid'' costar Brendan Gleeson,  
playing a small-town American sheriff was tough. The Irishman 
thinks sounding American is one of his greatest challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quite nervous about the accent thing,'' Gleeson says in  
the July 23 issue of Entertainment Weekly. ``At home I could go 
county by county. But a standard American accent is actually the 
hardest thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gleeson, who starred in ``The General,'' a film dealing with  
Irish gangster Martin Cahill, said playing the notorious thug was 
touchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to dance on anybody's grave,'' Gleeson said.  
``There are still people hobbling about Dublin in pain from things 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A schoolteacher before his acting career took off in 1990,  
Gleeson is currently doing another ``foreign'' accent, playing an 
English villain in the sequel, ``Mission Impossible 2,'' which is 
being filmed in Australia.

<P>
	A blaze in California had spread across 13,700 acres.  
</P>
<P>
	The column of smoke was clearly visible from downtown Reno as  
flames spread through steep canyons near Lockwood, about eight 
miles east of Reno and within one-half mile south of Interstate 80. 
Wind carried the smoke away from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mostly a hand-crew operation and they've been hiking in  
the dark in rough terrain,'' Forest Service spokeswoman Jocelyn 
Biro said Saturday. Four firefighters were treated for knee and 
ankle injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was estimated at about 50 percent contained at one  
point, but officials backed that off to 35 percent later in the day 
after the flames crossed a ridge and burned closer to the 
interstate. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway remained open but authorities warned motorists to  
watch for fire equipment driving through the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of travelers stopped along the road Saturday afternoon to  
watch the flames and the helicopters dipping huge buckets on cables 
into a river to scoop up water to dump on the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	It started Friday and the cause was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still burning pretty good. It's not just one flame front.  
We have pretty good activity in three or four areas,'' Biro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were confident the Truckee River running along the  
south side of I-80 would keep the fire from jumping the highway, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	No buildings were threatened.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire 30 miles southeast of Fallon, a town 60 miles east of  
Reno, was about 50 percent contained Saturday, said federal fire 
command post spokeswoman Heidi Netzler. 
</P>
<P>
	That blaze was started Thursday by bombs dropped by Navy planes  
on a training range at Naval Air Station Fallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were prepared to evacuate the town of Middlegate  
late Friday, but Netzler said a shift in the wind made an 
evacuation unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters also were at work Saturday on a fire that had  
burned 32,000 acres in the sparsely settled northeast corner of 
Nevada and into Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears they've got that one pretty much handled,'' said  
Bob Knutson of the Great Western Great Basin fire center in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the West, a 13,700-acre fire in California's Santa  
Barbara County had been 75 percent surrounded, and full containment 
was expected Sunday evening, said county fire department Capt. 
Charlie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,800 firefighters worked on the six-day-old blaze  
Saturday, contending with erratic wind and temperatures in the 90s.

<P>
	It took the Houston Astros more than five weeks to win this one.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Larry Dierker and the Astros finally finished their  
suspended game against the San Diego Padres on Friday night, 
winning 4-3 behind the grand slam Derek Bell hit June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros then won their scheduled game against the Padres 7-4,  
behind Matt Mieske's grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker caused the suspended game when he collapsed in the  
dugout from a seizure. He had brain surgery two days later to 
repair abnormal blood vessels and returned last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had this one logged as a win, although I knew anything could  
happen,'' Dierker said after the opener. ``I've been counting this 
win for about a month now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Reynolds (11-7) got the victory without throwing a pitch  
Friday and Heath Murray (0-2) got the loss without being present. 
Murray (0-2), who allowed the grand slam, started for Triple-A Las 
Vegas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his 24th save despite  
allowing solo homers to Phil Nevin and Ruben Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything more had happened, I might have had another  
seizure and Shane might have had one with me,'' Dierker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mieske's third career slam broke an eighth-inning tie as Houston  
rallied against Donne Wall (6-2) in the second game. Mike Hampton 
(13-3) pitched his third complete game of the season, allowing 
eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't here when Derek hit his,'' said Mieske, obtained June  
20 from Seattle. ``So that makes it kind of neat that we won both 
games on grand slam homers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, it was Philadelphia 6, Atlanta 5 in the first  
game; Atlanta 3, Philadelphia 1, in the second game; Montreal 5, 
Pittsburgh 1; Florida 5, Milwaukee 4; New York 5, Chicago 4; St. 
Louis 6, Colorado 4; Arizona 10, Los Angeles 1; and San Francisco 
6, Cincinnati 5.

</P>
<P>
                    *Braves 3, Phillies 1, 2nd game    	
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Kevin Jordan went 2-for-4 with three RBIs,  
including a key two-run single, as the Phillies rallied from a 
five-run deficit to win the opener of a doubleheader with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Bruce Chen allowed one run in 7 2-3 innings and Bret  
Boone broke an eighth-inning tie when he scored on a wild pitch as 
the Braves won the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	While Philadelphia has won six of nine, the Braves have lost six  
of eight. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Expos 5, Pirates 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Javier Vazquez pitched a four-hitter to become the first  
Montreal starter in nearly a month to win as the Expos scored five 
in the top of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez (3-5) got his first career complete game to stop  
Montreal's three-game losing streak and extend the Pirates' losing 
streak to five. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez posted the first win by an Expos starter since Carl  
Pavano beat Florida on June 25. Montreal starters were 0-11 with a 
6.38 ERA in a 23-game winless stretch that tied the team record set 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Ritchie (9-7) took the loss.  
</P>
<P>
                        *Marlins 5, Brewers 4    	
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, Jorge Fabregas' two-out single in the ninth inning  
completed a comeback by Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 4-2 in the eighth, the Marlins moved within a run when  
Bob Wickman (2-5) walked a batter with the bases loaded. A wild 
throw in the ninth helped the Marlins win on RBI singles by Mark 
Kotsay and Fabregas. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Nunez (4-3) pitched a scoreless ninth for his first win  
since being traded from Arizona to the Marlins for Matt Mantei. 
</P>
<P>
                           *Mets 5, Cubs 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza's two-out single broke a seventh-inning tie at New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Agbayani's two-out, two-run triple tied it in the sixth  
for the Mets, who have won seven of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Cook (8-2) pitched a perfect seventh for the victory.  
Cubs starter Kevin Tapani (6-7) has not won since June 24 at 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 35th homer for the  
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Cardinals 6, Rockies 4    	
</P>
<P>
	In Denver, Mark McGwire hit his 34th home run, one short of  
major league-leader Sammy Sosa, as St. Louis ended Colorado's 
three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, 2-for-4 with a walk, has homered in seven of his last  
nine games. Rookie Joe McEwing went 3-for-4 with a solo homer and 
two RBIs for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Oliver (5-7), 0-5 with four no-decisions in nine previous  
starts, allowed two runs and eight hits in eight innings. Roberto 
Ramirez (1-2) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Diamondbacks 10, Dodgers 1    	
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, Matt Williams hit his 24th home run and six other  
Diamondbacks doubled as Arizona won its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bell was 2-for-3 with three RBIs and Luis Gonzalez went  
2-for-4 with two RBIs for the Diamondbacks, who hadn't won four 
straight since June 16. Eight of Arizona's runs came with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Daal and Byung-Hyun Kim combined on a two-hitter. Daal  
(9-5) allowed one run -- Gary Sheffield's solo homer in the sixth -- 
on two hits through seven innings. Los Angeles' Carlos Perez (2-10) 
gave up all 10 runs and 11 hits through six innings. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Giants 6, Reds 5    	
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, Ellis Burks walked twice with the bases  
loaded, driving in the tie-breaking run in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Servais also drew a bases-loaded walk to give San  
Francisco three runs from walks. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, just the third in the past 10 games for San Francisco,  
kept the Giants a half-game in front of Arizona in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Spradlin (3-1) threw a scoreless seventh for the victory.  
Scott Sullivan (3-2) took the loss.

<P>
	David Cone didn't have to be perfect for the New York Yankees to  
beat the Cleveland Indians. They did need a perfectly placed hit by 
Derek Jeter, though. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cone failed to approach his perfect-game performance  
against Montreal, the Yankees beat Cleveland 9-8 in 10 innings 
Friday night thanks to Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' All-Star shortstop came through with the winning  
hit when he sliced a two-out, two-run single with the bases loaded 
beyond the reach of right fielder Manny Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't fun for me until the last at-bat,'' said Jeter, who  
was 0-for-5 with three strikeouts before his winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching for the first time since his perfect game Sunday, Cone  
started Friday night's game at Yankee Stadium by walking Kenny 
Lofton. Against the Expos, Cone never allowed any batter as many as 
three balls. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Cone lasted only four innings and allowed six runs,  
two of them earned. He made 104 pitches, 16 more than he threw 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a very good encore,'' he said. ``I was really pumped up. I  
was probably a little overly excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the AL, it was Toronto 2, Chicago 1; Texas 11,  
Tampa Bay 8; Baltimore 1, Anaheim 0; Detroit 14, Boston 5; 
Minnesota 5, Seattle 4; and Kansas City 12, Oakland 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar hit a grand slam off Cone and started a  
sensational double play for the Indians. Still, the Yankees moved 
past Cleveland for the best record in the majors -- it's the first 
time this year the World Series champions (58-37) have had the top 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won its fourth in a row overall and eighth straight in  
extra innings. The Indians (58-38) have lost seven of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrique Wilson's RBI single with two outs in the 10th off Jason  
Grimsley (7-1) put Cleveland ahead 8-7. Mike Jackson (3-4) then 
gave up a single and two walks before allowing Jeter's hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't afford to walk guys,'' Jackson said. ``For some  
reason, I couldn't get the ball down.'' 
</P>
<P>
                       *Blue Jays 2, White Sox 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Mike Matheny hit a two-run homer in the fifth at Chicago to lead  
Toronto to its seventh straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey Hamilton (3-5) entered the game with a 7.58 ERA, but held  
the White Sox scoreless until Frank Thomas' 13th homer in the 
seventh made it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Green extended his hitting streak to a career-high 21  
games with a first-inning double off Jim Parque (9-6). Green tied 
Thomas and the Orioles' B.J. Surhoff for the AL's longest hitting 
streak this season. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Rangers 11, Devil Rays 8    	
</P>
<P>
	Todd Zeile hit a three-run homer and Danny Kolb got his first  
major league victory as Texas won at Tampa Bay, the Rangers' sixth 
straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, 8-1 despite homering in just three games since the  
All-Star break, homered four times. Lee Stevens and Ivan Rodriguez 
added two-run homers and Rusty Greer hit a solo shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolb (1-0), in his first appearance since being recalled from  
Triple-A Oklahoma City on Tuesday, replaced injured starter Mike 
Morgan to start the third. Devil Rays starter Ryan Rupe (4-5) was 
the loser. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Orioles 1, Angels 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Baltimore, Juan Guzman pitched eight scoreless innings as the  
Orioles spoiled Jack McDowell's 1999 debut and handed the Angels 
their eighth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell, activated from the disabled list before the game,  
allowed one run and four hits in 5 2-3 innings. The 1993 Cy Young 
winner, sidelined after undergoing offseason surgery on his right 
elbow and shoulder, was making his first appearance in the majors 
since Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell (0-1) was outdueled by Guzman (5-8), who lost four of  
his previous five decisions. Harold Baines doubled in the fourth 
and scored the lone run for the Orioles, who have won four straight 
and nine of 11. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Tigers 14, Red Sox 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Five players homered for Detroit and the travails of Boston  
right-hander Tomokazu Ohka continued as the Tigers beat the 
visiting Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohka (0-2), knocked out in the second inning of his major league  
debut against Florida on July 19, gave up three runs in the first. 
Ohka, signed last November from the Japanese professional league, 
yielded seven runs on nine hits in 4 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Santana gave up the next seven runs, including six in the  
sixth -- when the Tigers hit three homers. Karim Garcia, Deivi Cruz, 
Gregg Jefferies, Jason Wood and Luis Polonia also homered for the 
Tigers, while Jose Offerman had a two-run homer for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit starter Brian Moehler (8-9) benefited from his  
teammates' power show. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Twins 5, Mariners 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Matt Lawton's RBI single in the bottom of the ninth led  
Minnesota to a comeback victory over Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawton's single off Jose Paniagua (6-9) scored pinch-runner  
Jacques Jones from third, as the Twins battled back from a 4-0 
deficit. The Twins rallied for a run in the sixth and three more in 
the seventh to tie the game 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Hector Carrasco (1-2) gained the victory after allowing one hit  
in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Royals 12, Athletics 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Jermaine Dye knocked in three runs with a double in a seven-run  
third inning, and Kansas City rallied to win its seventh straight 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland, which has an AL-worst 18-31 road record, took a 6-1  
lead in the third on Jason Giambi's grand slam off Mac Suzuki and 
Eric Chavez's RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Royals went ahead 8-6 in the bottom of the third with  
the help of Dye's big hit. Jeremy Giambi, Jason's younger brother, 
capped the rally with a run-scoring double.

<HEADLINE> Reformers Admire Ross Perot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Reform Party founder Ross Perot on  
Saturday night urged his party to remain united and continue to 
fight for a balanced budget, term limits and campaign reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot didn't say whether he is interested in seeking his party's  
nomination for a third presidential run. But many waved Perot 
placards and hooted with approval during his 40-minute, 
campaign-style speech at the party's national convention Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the American people to understand what real democracy  
is all about,'' he said, waving his arms toward about 580 
conventioneers. ``I want them to understand that you have worked 
your hearts out since 1992 for one reason: that you love this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perot said the country must return to a moral foundation, saying  
the party should never nominate a candidate ``that could not be a 
good role model for our children and grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for tax reform, a complete overhaul of Medicaid,  
Medicare and Social Security and shorter election campaigns that 
would cost less. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also seemed to recognize those in the party who have said  
they don't want him to make another presidential run in 2000, 
promising to stay ``as long as I am helpful to the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want is what I see in the papers day in and  
day out, about catfights and what have you that have nothing to do 
with fact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot, a Dallas billionaire, has been the party's most famous  
face since his 1992 presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	But some party members, including influential Minnesota Gov.  
Jesse Ventura, say Perot's diminishing returns in the 1996 
presidential race have convinced them he should step aside and let 
someone else run. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Reform Party members announced plans to draft retired  
Gen. Colin Powell for the 2000 presidential campaign, even though 
it's a job Powell says he doesn't want. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Shaffer, 53, an Illinois construction worker dressed like  
Uncle Sam, said he supports Ventura for the 2000 nomination despite 
prior votes for Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ross Perot is the most honorable founder of our party, a good  
citizen who founded something that will last a lifetime,'' Shaffer 
said. ``But based on the performance in Ventura's election, I have 
a feeling he could do that nationwide.''

<HEADLINE> Checks on Grain Elevator Were Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety inspectors had not visited the  
nation's biggest grain elevator for 15 years when explosions ripped 
through the half-mile long facility in Kansas last year, killing 
seven workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a panel of experts who investigated the accident says more  
such incidents among the nation's 14,000 elevators may be 
inevitable unless the federal government tightens its standards for 
handling grain and does a better job of enforcing existing 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is the fine powder, or dust, produced when kernels  
of corn, wheat or other grain rub against each during shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The dust is highly explosive. It long has been known that if the  
dust is allowed to accumulate inside an elevator, a spark, or an 
overheated piece of equipment, can trigger a deadly blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haysville, Kan., elevator ``may not be an exception in the  
grain industry of America. And there is no known method to identify 
the thousands of other elevators in equally hazardous condition,'' 
according to the panel's one-inch thick report, which The 
Associated Press recently examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which  
commissioned the study, has declined to release the report. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA imposed safety standards on the industry in the early 1980s  
that have made elevators much safer than they used to be, according 
to statistics. The death rate from elevator explosions averaged 
about 5.5 per year into the 1980s but has been declining since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the agency's lack of oversight in the Kansas  
case raised questions about the industry as a whole. Several of the 
panel's six members also served on a National Academy of Sciences 
commission that studied the industry in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing OSHA has to do is to be sure they get the  
inspectors into the places that need inspection,'' said Robert 
Hubbard, a retired industry executive who served on both panels. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA conducted 209 elevator inspections from 1994 through 1998  
and cited facilities for 520 violations it deemed serious. State 
safety agencies conducted another 149 inspections during that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators blamed last year's explosion on sloppy  
maintenance by the elevator's owner, DeBruce Grain Inc., and OSHA 
has proposed fining the company $1.7 million for 25 safety 
violations. The investigators said the explosions erupted when a 
bearing overheated, igniting thick accumulations of dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials deny the findings and are appealing the  
proposed fine. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for OSHA, Bill Wright, declined to comment on the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	But OSHA started a review of its grain-handling standards before  
the 1998 accident, and recommendations are due later this year. The 
grain industry is one of only a handful of industries that the 
agency is looking at, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, has agreed to report to  
OSHA when its grain inspectors find dangerous dust accumulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wichita elevator was last inspected in 1983, and even then  
for reasons unrelated to grain dust, according to the report. OSHA 
ordinarily does not inspect such facilities unless there is an 
accident or a complaint from employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the workers did not seem to know what danger they  
were in, said Vern Grose, a former National Transportation Safety 
Board member who served on the OSHA panel. ``It's a sleeping giant 
waiting to go and they just don't know it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident is certain to be the subject of debate in the  
industry, which is constantly looking for ways to improve its 
safety, said David Krecji, executive vice president of the Grain 
Elevator and Processing Society, a professional organization for 
elevator managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the millions of tons of grain handled every day at  
thousands of facilities ... and considering the nature of the 
hazard everyone is doing a pretty good job,'' he said. ``But when 
something like the DeBruce explosion occurs it's an 
attention-getter.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton tried to put a little  
bounce in a couple of political speeches over the weekend by 
telling Democratic supporters Republicans now regard him less as a 
``bad guy'' and more as a Michael Jordan of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton meant that, in his view, the GOP hopes it can write off  
Clinton as an extraordinary successful Democrat the likes of whom, 
like His Airness, probably won't be seen again soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're now basically saying, 'Oh, well, Bill Clinton is like  
Michael Jordan -- he just jumps higher than the other guys,''' 
Clinton told well-heeled Democrats Saturday at a red-checked 
tablecloth picnic in this chic mountain town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans, ``after telling everybody for 6 1/2 years what a  
bad guy I was,'' are now looking forward to the time 18 months from 
now when Clinton leaves office, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans figure that at that point, ``he's gone, so we'll  
put them in the cellar again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech also included a lengthy list of things Clinton  
considers successes of his tenure -- he cites advances in elementary 
education, a cleaner environment and a booming economy, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made a similar speech and a similar reference to the  
retired Chicago Bulls great on Friday night, during a fund-raising 
stop in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	He paraphrased Republican thinking this way: ``Clinton's like  
Michael Jordan, he just jumps higher than the other Democrats now 
(but) the natural order of things will reassert itself and we 
Republicans will rule America again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton skipped the Jordan reference when he gave an otherwise  
comparable address later Saturday, and told reporters he is no 
political Air Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``one of my Republican friends'' made the Jordan analogy,  
Clinton said he replied: ``No one in their right mind could compare 
me to Michael Jordan. ... I can't jump four inches.''

<HEADLINE> 15 Hurt in Gay Pride Parade Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A tear gas canister was thrown into the crowd  
watching a Lesbian and Gay Pride parade Saturday, injuring more 
than a dozen people, a city fire spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests were made.  
</P>
<P>
	About 15 people were treated at the scene for eye and skin  
irritations. Three others, including a woman with asthma, were 
taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, fire spokesman Bob 
Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people were watching the 25th annual parade when a  
big puff of smoke erupted at about 1 p.m., sending people 
scurrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was just smoke, some kind of fire,'' said Steve  
Danaemiller, who was treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade was delayed about 15 minutes as police unsuccessfully  
tried to find the attacker.

<HEADLINE> AOL Blocks Microsoft Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. responded to the release of  
instant messaging software from Microsoft Inc. by electronically 
jamming messages that users of the Microsoft software tried to send 
to people who use AOL's service. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service, released Thursday, works  
through the Microsoft Network site, allowing instant message 
exchanges with the 40 million users of MSN Hotmail. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messengers allow Internet users to chat in ``real time''  
by sending messages that recipients see instantly, without having 
to go through e-mail. While common enough on the Web, few messenger 
programs are compatible with others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft program was designed to allow messages to be sent  
to users of the popular AOL Instant Messenger System, or AIM. That 
aspect of the new software angered AOL, which late Thursday blocked 
MSN users from interacting with AIM users, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Microsoft said it had revised its program late  
Friday to get around the AOL block. But Dulles, Va.-based AOL 
responded within hours by issuing a second block, the Times said. 
The story also was reported today by The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine which AOL users are online, Microsoft's product  
enters AOL's servers in a way that the company says violates its 
copyrights and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among AOL's complaints is that Microsoft requires AOL users to  
enter their password, AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the new software as a key step in the  
ever-escalating battle among Internet companies to obtain Web 
traffic to help them sell advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	By designing its messaging service to work with AOL's system,  
Microsoft Network could position itself to draw more users to its 
Web site and keep them there longer, said Emily Meehan, an analyst 
with The Yankee Group research firm of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Sanford, MSN lead product manager, said Messenger was  
just one of the services MSN wanted to offer its users and wasn't 
directed towards competing with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just part of our continuing efforts to provide  
consumers with a place they can go to get information no matter 
where they are,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Henninger Leads Deere Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COAL VALLEY, Ill (AP) -- Brian Henninger, winless on the PGA Tour  
since 1994, carved out a 6-under-par 64 in Saturday's third round 
for a three-stroke lead after three rounds of the John Deere 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain overnight made the greens accessible and the players took  
advantage with 299 birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	Henninger, one of 31 players called off the course because of  
threatening weather Friday night, came back early Saturday morning 
and completed a second-round 63 to trail leader Mike Brisky by one 
stroke. His 64 Saturday afternoon allowed him to tie the 
tournament's 54-hole record of 193 set by Blaine McCallister in 
1987. The 72-hole record is 21-under by David Frost in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Henninger dropped three strokes behind Brisky with a bogey at  
the par-4 fourth hole, then strung together three birdies and an 
eagle over a five-hole stretch beginning at the par-4 seventh, 
where he made a 3-foot putt for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Henninger got within two strokes of Brisky with a short birdie  
putt at the par-4 ninth and tied for the lead with a chip-in from 
behind the green for eagle at the par-5 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Birdies at Nos. 11 and 13 got him to 16-under and he capped his  
round with a birdie at the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	Brisky shot a 68 and was at 14-under. He birdied Nos. 3 and 7  
but was unable to generate much on the back nine, playing even-par 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Damron and J.L. Lewis each shot 65s and joined Brisky at  
196. 
</P>
<P>
	Damron birdied Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 17. His lone bogey came  
at the par-4 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, who had one birdie and one bogey on the front, got going  
on the back nine with birdies at Nos. 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Perry, who shared the 18-hole lead, made one of the  
biggest moves of the day by matching Henninger's 64. He was at 198, 
joined by David Peoples, who shot 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry went out in 31 and chopped three more strokes off par  
before closing with a bogey at 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Jordan and Mike Standly also shot 64s and were at 11-under  
199. Chris Perry's whose 63 was the best score of the third round, 
was at 201. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Steve Jones was nine strokes back after a 68  
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Headed to Familiar Terrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Tony Stewart is going back home to Indiana  
next month to run for the first time in the Brickyard 400. But he's 
no novice when it comes to racing at the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	He competed four times in the Indianapolis 500 during his days  
in the Indy Racing League. When asked what he could tell everyone 
about his experience, NASCAR's best rookie and top quipster was 
ready: 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you where to eat and the easiest way to get in and  
out of the race track,'' he said Saturday. ``I'll have them all 
drawn up and ready for you guys at Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a recent test for the Brickyard 400, Stewart said  
things didn't go as well as he would have preferred. But they could 
have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left without hitting the wall,'' he said of his laps around  
the 2 1/2-mile rectangle. ``And you've got four chances to hit that 
wall there instead of two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who starts 12th Sunday in the Pennsylvania 500, was  
asked just how hard he planned to run in the Brickyard 400 on Aug. 
7. He bemoaned that the difference between the heavy Winston Cup 
cars and light Indy cars will keep him from employing his old IRL 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get to run wide open around there, I'll kill them guys,''  
he said. ``Then we'll have a hell of a celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he learned a great deal about the real payoff of racing  
when he began competing in Indiana as an 8-year-old go-kart driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you won you always got the good-looking girl in school that  
week,'' he said. ``And the next week, somebody else won, and they 
got the girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	AND THE REST: Rookie Elliott Sadler will have to drop from 40th  
position to the rear of the field on the pace lap Sunday before the 
Pennsylvania 500 because he will be in a backup car. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadler totaled the Wood Brothers' Ford while attempting to  
qualify Saturday at Pocono International Raceway. X-rays on his 
left foot proved negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has probably been the worst weekend of racing I've had,''  
said Sadler, who blew two engines during practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Shepherd, who lost his chance to race when Joe Falk's car  
failed to qualify, drove the car some for his former team during 
the final practice session Saturday, and he'll stand by in case 
Sadler needs relief Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other car that failed to make the 43-car field was the  
Pontiac of Derrike Cope. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	AND THE WINNER: Blaise Alexander, from nearby Mountoursville,  
Pa., showed plenty of aggression while winning the ARCA Pepsi 200 
on Saturday at Pocono International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	He bumped Jeff Finley aside of the 64th of 80 laps, then held on  
to beat Frank Kimmel by nearly a half-second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was too happy with me,'' Alexander said of  
Finley. ``But we weren't racing for 25th. We were going for the 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finley wound up fourth.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT STOPS: Stanton Barrett, who will drive Junie Donlavey's Ford  
on Sunday in the Pennsylvania 500, spent part of Saturday working 
on the crew of old friend Barry Owen's car in the ARCA Pepsi 200. 
... Starting at or near the front is advantageous at Pocono 
International Raceway. The winner has come from the first two rows 
in 25 of 43 Pocono NASCAR races. ... Hendrick Motorsports leads all 
teams in victories at Pocono with eight. Jeff Gordon and the late 
Tim Richmond won three times apiece for Hendrick, and Geoff Bodine 
and Terry Labonte once each. ... No one has won consecutively at 
the track since June 1987, when Richmond got the last of his three 
straight victories. ... Despite Bobby Labonte's victory five weeks 
ago in the Pocono 500, the triangle on the mountain has not been a 
good track for Pontiac. The winner has been in a Pontiac only four 
times in 43 races since stock cars began running on the track in 
1974. ... Michael Waltrip is winless in 412 Winston Cup starts. 
Older brother Darrell got the most recent of his 84 career 
victories in 1992, making the Waltrip family 0-for-624 since. ... 
Dave Marcis has gone 457 races since his last victory, in 1982.

	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Alex scored twice as a young  
Brazilian team scored four goals in the second half to beat Germany 
4-0 in the opening game of the Confederations Cup Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first goal came in minute 16 of the second half. An  
off-balance Ronaldinho headed the ball into the center of the 
field, and Ze Roberto hit a drive straight off goalie Jens 
Lehmann's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes later, Ronaldinho scored on a rebound of his own  
penalty kick. Alex, a 21-year-old, scored the final two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany had few scoring opportunities, and most were shot wide.  
Its best chance came in minute 39 of the first half, when a long 
shot bounced off the hands of Brazilian goalie Dida and Michael 
Preetz tried to tap the ball in. Brazilian defender Evanilson 
cleared it.

<HEADLINE> Ryan, Brett, Yount Head for Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- One last stop for the Ryan Express.  
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Ryan, who played longer than anyone in major league  
history and surely frightened more hitters than any other pitcher, 
will take his place in the Hall of Fame on Sunday as a humble 
Texan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the final chapter of my career,'' Ryan said.  
``It's the highest honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slugger Orlando Cepeda, and George Brett and Robin Yount, part  
of the 3,000-hit club and the greatest players of their franchises, 
will join Ryan in a parade of seven for the induction ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest Cooperstown class since 1972 also includes late  
umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leagues ace Smokey Joe Williams and 
19th-century manager Frank Selee. 
</P>
<P>
	A record crowd of more than 40,000 is expected to jam this quiet  
village of 2,300 where baseball is believed to have originated. A 
record 39 Hall of Famers, among them Ted Williams, Hank Aaron and 
Bob Feller, are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend festivities wrap up Monday with the annual Hall  
exhibition game. Appropriately, it matches Ryan's Texas Rangers 
against Brett's Kansas City Royals at Doubleday Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much of it falls into place as it was scripted that way,''  
said Yount, who got his 3,000th hit for Milwaukee three weeks 
before Brett reached the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Brett was unquestionably my favorite player to watch  
play. And Nolan Ryan is one of the all-time great pitchers the game 
has ever seen. And Orlando Cepeda was one of the game's great 
hitters of the 1960s. It's really is amazing that we all can go in 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda said: ``To hear those words -- `Hall of Famer' -- and know  
I'm one of them. It means so many things to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And seeing is believing, Ryan said.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you walk into the Hall, and you look at the plaques and  
the displays there with all the great players like Ruth, Gehrig, Cy 
Young, Walter Johnson and those guys, and they show you where your 
plaque is going to hang, you realize that you are going to be 
thought of on that level. 
</P>
<P>
	``During my career, I didn't give much thought to it,'' Ryan  
said. ``When I went up there and saw where I stood all time -- the 
wins, innings pitched and strikeout lists and being the all-time 
walk leader -- it was nice to see. Then to walk by the no-hit 
display, it was really something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Squeezing all of Ryan's accomplishments onto one bronze plaque  
won't be easy. He held or shared more than 50 records when he 
retired in 1993, including most no-hitters (7) and strikeouts 
(5,714). 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan went 324-292 in a 27-year career with the Mets, Angels,  
Astros and Rangers. A special assistant to the Rangers president, 
he will enter the Hall wearing a Texas cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, incidentally, struck out 28 Hall of Famers, including  
Brett, Yount and Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitting all the plaques into the main gallery at 25 Main Street,  
meanwhile, presented another problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven newcomers raised the total Hall membership to 244.  
Going into this year's votes -- the Baseball Writers' Association of 
America election in January and the Veterans Committee meeting in 
March -- there was space for only 240 plaques to be properly 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	So, for now, the last three spots will go to the first three  
players picked this year -- Brett, Ryan and Yount. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four plaques will hang through next summer in an  
adjacent rotunda that houses a home-run chase exhibit. After that, 
an expansion will make room for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, his family and about 150 people from Texas were to arrive  
in upstate New York on, fittingly, the ``Nolan Ryan Express,'' a 
plane in the Southwest Airlines' fleet that was dedicated to him in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and Yount also were expected to bring large contingents.  
And Chylak, who died in 1982, was to have 20 busloads of supporters 
from his native Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett's son, Robin -- named for Yount -- was to attend. Robin  
turned 3 on the day Brett and Yount were elected to the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robin was the guy I most enjoyed playing against in my entire  
career,'' Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, a 13-time All-Star third baseman, hit .305 in a 21-year  
career spent entirely in Kansas City. He is 13th with 3,154 hits 
and tops the Royals' list in hits, doubles, triples, home runs 
(317), RBIs (1,595) and runs. 
</P>
<P>
	A big-game player and 1980 AL MVP, Brett led the Royals to their  
only World Series championship in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``George put Kansas City on the map,'' said former teammate  
David Cone, who pitched a perfect game last Sunday for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before he came, Kansas City was only known for the Negro  
leagues and the Monarchs, and as a farm team for the Yankees. 
George Brett made it credible, a big league town,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount ranks 15th on the hits list with 3,142. He played all 20  
years in Milwaukee and batted .285, and is the Brewers' leader in 
hits, doubles, triples, home runs (251), RBIs (1,406) and runs. 
</P>
<P>
	He won AL MVP awards in 1982 at shortstop and 1989 in center  
field, joining Stan Musial and Hank Greenberg as the only players 
to win at two positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, who played most of his career with the San Francisco  
Giants, hit 379 home runs with 1,365 RBIs. An NL rookie of the year 
and MVP at first base, he played in nine All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak is one of eight umpires in the Hall. He worked in the AL  
from 1954-78 and called five World Series and six All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee, one of 15 managers enshrined, guided Boston and Chicago  
to a .598 winning percentage in the NL. He put together the Cubs' 
famed Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who starred for the Homestead Grays and several other  
teams before retiring in 1932, was picked in a 1952 poll by the 
Pittsburgh Courier as black baseball's greatest pitcher, edging out 
Satchel Paige.

<HEADLINE>  Minnesota Hires Gonzaga's Monson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Monson was hired Saturday as men's  
basketball coach at Minnesota, a month after the school bought out 
the contract of former coach Clem Haskins following an academic 
fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, 37, led Gonzaga to a 52-17 record and consecutive West  
Coast Conference titles in two seasons as coach. His last Gonzaga 
team eliminated Minnesota from the NCAA tournament last season, 
then advanced to the regional final before losing to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson will receive a seven-year base salary of $150,000 per  
year and an outside package worth another $340,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson signed a 10-year deal with Gonzaga in April, but he  
assured Gophers fans that he wouldn't take the next available 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was well known there with my administration that if I had  
an opportunity of a lifetime, that I have certain goals in my 
profession to move up, and I feel that this is one of those 
opportunities of a lifetime,'' Monson said during a news conference 
at Williams Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who had been in Portugal and Majorca during the last  
month while Minnesota was conducting its coaching search, said the 
move's timing is ``terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, it doesn't get much worse for me  
personally,'' he said. ``But there is no good time to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson takes over just weeks before Minnesota takes an  
exhibition trip to Europe, and less than three months before 
practice begins Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball program also faces an uncertain future. The  
academic fraud investigation by independent investigators is 
expected to wrap up in September, and the university could face 
NCAA probation or sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson seemed resigned to some type of penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know with this probation, the next coach here has to do  
things the right way,'' he said. ``In that regard, I know I'm 
coming into a place that expects me to run my program the only way 
I know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said he was confident Monson  
could restore respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coach Monson is outstanding and he's the right person  
to grow the basketball program, and take us where we want to go and 
take us there what I'll call `the right way,''' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota bought out Haskins' contract June 30, the coach  
walking away with $1.5 million.

<HEADLINE>  Minnesota Hires Gonzaga's Monson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Monson was hired Saturday as men's  
basketball coach at Minnesota, a month after the school bought out 
the contract of former coach Clem Haskins following an academic 
fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, 37, led Gonzaga to a 52-17 record and consecutive West  
Coast Conference titles in two seasons as coach. His last Gonzaga 
team eliminated Minnesota from the NCAA tournament last season, 
then advanced to the regional final before losing to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson will receive a seven-year base salary of $150,000 per  
year and an outside package worth another $340,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson signed a 10-year deal with Gonzaga in April, but he  
assured Gophers fans that he wouldn't take the next available 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was well known there with my administration that if I had  
an opportunity of a lifetime, that I have certain goals in my 
profession to move up, and I feel that this is one of those 
opportunities of a lifetime,'' Monson said during a news conference 
at Williams Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who had been in Portugal and Majorca during the last  
month while Minnesota was conducting its coaching search, said the 
move's timing is ``terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, it doesn't get much worse for me  
personally,'' he said. ``But there is no good time to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson takes over just weeks before Minnesota takes an  
exhibition trip to Europe, and less than three months before 
practice begins Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball program also faces an uncertain future. The  
academic fraud investigation by independent investigators is 
expected to wrap up in September, and the university could face 
NCAA probation or sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson seemed resigned to some type of penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know with this probation, the next coach here has to do  
things the right way,'' he said. ``In that regard, I know I'm 
coming into a place that expects me to run my program the only way 
I know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said he was confident Monson  
could restore respectability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coach Monson is outstanding and he's the right person  
to grow the basketball program, and take us where we want to go and 
take us there what I'll call `the right way,''' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota bought out Haskins' contract June 30, the coach  
walking away with $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Rick Majerus, Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders  
and Virginia athletic director Terry Holland were also reported to 
be candidates for the job. Each turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson said he didn't mind that he wasn't the school's initial  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that it's what choice I was,'' he said. ``It's

<HEADLINE> Famed Civil Rights Judge Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Frank M. Johnson Jr., a federal judge  
whose civil rights rulings made him a hero to blacks and a hated 
figure among Southern segregationists, has died. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson died of pneumonia at his Montgomery home Friday  
afternoon, said Curtis Caver, a longtime court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of his most dramatic orders, Johnson, who was white,  
cleared the way for Martin Luther King Jr. and swelling ranks of 
voting rights marchers to make their historic 1965 march from Selma 
to Montgomery despite then-Gov. George C Wallace's attempt to block 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous loss,'' said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.,  
who led that march. ``The nation owes him so much. I can't imagine 
what the state of Alabama, the South and the nation would be like 
without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's rulings thrust him into the racial firestorm of the  
1950s and 60s and in some ways made him a social outcast in 
Alabama's capital. A cross was burned on his lawn and his mother's 
Montgomery house was bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, he stood against greater odds than any other  
person,'' said the Rev. Randel Osburn, executive vice president and 
chief operating officer of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a Republican appointee who served 25 years on the  
Montgomery U.S. District Court, made a pivotal 1956 decision that 
marked a victory for the Montgomery bus boycott, outlawing 
segregation across a wide spectrum -- on public transportation and 
in parks, restaurants, libraries and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he signed the original order to integrate the  
University of Alabama, and he participated in the decision that 
ultimately became the ``one man, one vote'' principle established 
by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite accolades from civil rights groups, Johnson insisted  
throughout his career that he was simply following the law and was 
hardly a liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helped shape the course of this state and this country  
through his staunch defense of the rule of law,'' Gov. Don 
Siegelman said. ``His loss will be felt by many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking slowly with a country, gravel-voiced drawl, Johnson  
could strike fear in lawyers as he looked down from the bench, 
peering steel-eyed over reading glasses and issuing no-nonsense 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's rulings also led to sweeping overhauls in the state's  
mental hospitals, declaring them ``human warehouses,'' and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was nominated to be FBI director by President Carter in 1977  
but eventually withdrew because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, he was named to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,  
which later became the 11th Circuit, where he finished his judicial 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson attended the University of Alabama Law School, where he  
became friends with the man who later would become the most 
outspoken foe of his court -- Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace fueled his rise to the governor's office with verbal  
attacks on Johnson -- once calling the Alabama-born judge an 
``integrating, carpetbagging, scalawagging, race-mixing, bald-faced 
liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, after Johnson's orders for statewide desegregation of  
schools and the sweeping reforms in mental hospitals and prisons, 
he became known to many as ``the real governor of Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was appointed by President Eisenhower to the district  
court in Montgomery in 1955, Johnson was 37 and the youngest 
federal judge in the country. Barely a year later, he joined in the 
2-1 ruling that outlawed segregation of public transportation, 
giving King and the bus boycott in Montgomery a victory that helped 
jump-start the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``My pride as an Alabamian is a matter of roots,'' Johnson said  
at an event honoring him in 1984. ``But it is a pride that has been 
enhanced, and continues to be enhanced, by the enormous progress in 
the past 25 to 30 years in Alabama ... the securing of 
constitutional rights of all Alabamians regardless of race, creed, 
color or sex.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins Trade Hernandez to Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Livan Hernandez leaned on his locker Saturday, eyes  
red from crying and his voice breaking as he spoke in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	No translation was necessary.  
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins parted with another piece of their past  
Saturday, trading the 1997 World Series most valuable player to the 
San Francisco Giants for two minor-league pitchers, Jason Grilli 
and Nathan Bump. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest move in the Marlins' dismantling was more emotional  
than most, because Hernandez didn't want to go. The younger brother 
of New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Livan 
defected from Cuba in 1995 and became a fan favorite in South 
Florida. He won his first nine decisions as a rookie and summed up 
the Marlins' World Series celebration when he shouted, ``I love 
you, Miami!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 24, cried when general manager Dave Dombrowski told  
him about the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say much,'' Dombrowski said. ``You could tell he was  
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, when Hernandez met with reporters, he was still  
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's emotional, but you just have to move on,'' Hernandez said  
through a translator. ``I'll miss my teammates and the city of 
Miami. This is still my home. I'll be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez might still be with Florida if he had pitched better  
the past two seasons, but the breakup of the championship team 
clearly bothered him. This year he's 5-9 with a 4.76 ERA, and the 
Marlins decided he needed a change of scenery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't pitched as well for us as he did in '97,''  
Dombrowski said. ``That little something extra is missing. I think 
he'll benefit from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez's mood will likely improve once he joins the Giants.  
He earned a reputation for thriving in big games as a rookie, and 
now he's on a contending team again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Livan Hernandez truly fits our needs -- present and future,''  
San Francisco general manager Brian Sabean said. ``With what he has 
accomplished already at the age of 24, it's obvious that he's not 
only young, but he's talented with a proven track record, including 
in the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez will be able to make an immediate contribution. Hours  
after acquiring Hernandez, the Giants learned right-hander Chris 
Brock will be sidelined six to eight weeks with a torn anterior 
cruciate ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez will take Brock's place in San Francisco's rotation  
and make his first start for the Giants on Wednesday against St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was a 22-year-old rookie in 1997 when he won both  
starts against the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. He also 
was MVP of the National League Championship Series, going 2-0 with 
an 0.84 ERA against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good deal for the Giants,'' San Francisco outfielder  
Ellis Burks said. ``He's been in pressure situations before and 
come through. He's not having a great year this year, but you have 
to consider that they pretty much got rid of everybody over there. 
That plays a part in a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants outbid nine other teams for Hernandez by giving up  
their first-round draft picks from 1997 and `98. Grilli, 22, was 
7-5 with a 5.54 ERA at Triple-A Fresno, and he'll be assigned to 
Florida's Triple-A affiliate in Calgary. Bump, who turned 23 
Saturday, was 4-10 with a 3.31 ERA at Double-A Shreveport. He'll 
pitch at Double-A Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins began the weekend with the second-worst record in  
baseball, but they're loaded with prospects and hope to be 
competitive in 2001. Grilli and Bump could be in the majors by 
then, Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are tremendous talents,'' he said. ``You're making  
building-block steps, and we're very close to having those building 
blocks in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, meanwhile, are battling Arizona for the lead in the  
NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly understand the price of giving up two former  
first-round picks, but we are dealing from a position of strength, 
given our stockpile of top young pitching prospects,'' Sabean said. 
``The 1999 Giants deserve the best possible chance to advance to 
the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the departure of Hernandez, only two players remain from  
the Marlins' 1997 World Series roster -- outfielder Cliff Floyd, who 
is on the disabled list, and reliever Antonio Alfonseca. Ace Alex 
Fernandez, who pitched for Florida in '97 but missed the World 
Series because of an injury, could be the next player traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we do not have any ongoing conversations with  
anybody,'' Dombrowski said. ``We're not looking to trade him, but I 
don't know what'll happen in the next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deadline is July 31. Fernandez's market value is  
questionable because he's coming back from a serious shoulder 
injury and still has 2 1/2 years remaining on a contract that pays him 
$7 million annually. Hernandez is a relative bargain at $850,000 
this year, and he doesn't become eligible for arbitration until 
after next season.

<HEADLINE> Surfers Ride Wave of a New Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Tan and grinning, surfer Randy French  
holds chunks of foam in each hand. In his left, a dense, crumbly 
foam that is tougher but not unlike the kind used by florists. In 
his right, a puffy, Styrofoam-like material that resembles the 
stuff used to make cheap ice chests. 
</P>
<P>
	``This foam,'' he says, holding up the puffier variety,  
``represents the first time in 30 years surfboards have been made 
in a new way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French and other surfboard builders are making waves with epoxy  
boards, which look the same as those made with standard materials 
but are stronger, lighter and less environmentally damaging. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first major industry change in a long time,'' said  
Brad Nadell, owner of Foam E-Z, a leading surfboard material 
supplier based in Westminster. ``Surfing is a traditional industry. 
These new boards may just be too hard, too light. I'm not sure 
they'll catch on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Innovative surfboard makers have been experimenting with epoxy  
components, and other space-age materials including Kevlar, for 
about 10 years, but only recently have they gained commercial 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The first modern surfboards, designed in the 1920s, were made of  
wood, but those boards were heavy and sometimes difficult to 
maneuver. Then came a surfing revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, board makers discovered polyurethane foam and  
fiberglass technologies. Suddenly boards were lighter, fast, and 
easier to make. The new boards helped fuel a surfing boom that 
stretched from coast to coast -- and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Most board builders still use almost exactly the same materials  
and process. A polyurethane foam core, known as a blank, is cut and 
shaped to desired length and thickness. Then it's wrapped with 
fiberglass and resin. 
</P>
<P>
	While nimble and snappy on the waves, regular boards can break  
in big surf, are easily nicked by contact with other boards, rocks 
or the ground, and are damaging to the environment while being 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Epoxy boards are different in two ways: the blank is made from  
nontoxic expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam -- similar to the stuff 
that filled bean bag chairs a few decades ago -- and the coat is an 
epoxy, a hard, slow drying glue. 
</P>
<P>
	At Point Blanks, a Ventura, Calif., company making epoxy boards  
for recreation gear retailer Patagonia, managers say their boards 
are 70 percent stronger and 10 percent lighter than standard 
polyurethane boards. They're also about 25 percent more expensive, 
starting at more than $400. 
</P>
<P>
	Epoxy resin has two-thirds fewer volatile organic compounds than  
polyester resins, whose fumes can be overwhelming. And because they 
last longer, fewer are ending up in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the advantages, the boards are just now breaking into  
the mass market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surf Industry Manufacturers Association estimates that about  
400,000 surfboards will be sold in the United States this year. Of 
those, about 6,000 will be epoxy boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just a speck, but it's historic in that what we're doing  
is completely a first in making a surfboard successfully with 
alternative technology,'' French said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surfer Ken Gallione says higher-tech doesn't necessarily mean  
higher performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true, those new boards are not going to snap in big  
surf,'' he said, ``but I get a way better response, in my feet, on 
an old school board when I'm carving, doing hard curves, dropping 
in, setting rails, hard sharp turns. It's hard to replace something 
that's been around for decades.''

<HEADLINE> Rosewood Massacre Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As a child, Sandra Maxwell heard hushed stories  
about women and girls forced to hide for a week in a cold Florida 
swamp with only palmetto brush to keep their nightgown-clad bodies 
warm. 
</P>
<P>
	It was then she began to learn about the tragedy in Rosewood,  
where at least six blacks were killed and the town destroyed when a 
white mob set upon the predominately black enclave in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-six years later, the wounds of the attack still remain,  
even for those who did not live through it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I feel now and I was not even there,'' said Mrs.  
Maxwell, now 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of descendants, survivors and relatives, some in their  
80s and 90s, still meet each year to remember the massacre, and to 
honor those who helped win reparations for remaining victims. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, the annual reunion is being held in Miami. The  
mood of the gathering is characterized by the logo emblazoned on 
the red T-shirts worn by attendees: ``Although justice was slow, 
victory is sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1923 horror began New Year's morning 1923, when a married  
white woman, Fannie Taylor, emerged bruised and beaten from her 
home and accused a black man of beating her without giving a name, 
descendants said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses Sarah Carrier and her 11-year-old granddaughter,  
Philomena Goins, watched silently as a white man, believed to be 
Mrs. Taylor's lover, left the house. They told a sheriff, but he 
admonished them and told them to go back home to Rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
	As word spread, angry whites besieged the town of about 120,  
burning nearly every structure in week of destruction. The number 
of people killed during the massacre remains controversial. State 
records say six blacks and two whites were killed while descendants 
speak of mass graves containing as many as 37 bodies of women and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Rosewood is little more than a marker on State Road 24,  
southwest of Gainesville, although it once was a place where black 
families owned acres of land, black women taught school, and black 
men worked as engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the luxury life that a lot of blacks would like to  
have today,'' said Mrs. Maxwell. ``And then for all of it to be 
taken away for a lie. Totally wiped out on a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Mrs. Maxwell, Rosetta Bradley Jackson, was born a year  
after the massacre, and also heard whispers when she eavesdropped 
on adult conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't answer her questions: Why did her brother have  
only one eye? Why did her father have such a distrust of white 
people? 
</P>
<P>
	She would not know the answers nor the extent of the killings  
until some 50 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out he had a reason,'' she said of her father.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jackson learned her brother had been shot in the eye at the  
Carrier home. He died never even telling his own children what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Goins grew up and became a mother, she told the story  
of Rosewood to her 5-year-old son Arnett Doctor in 1948, against 
the wishes of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then Doctor has kept true to what he said has been his  
duty: remembering Rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctor, along with other families, helped fight for state  
hearings that resulted in the Florida Legislature approving a $1.5 
million bill that awards nine survivors as much as $150,000. The 
remaining money was used for scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctor has traveled the world telling people the story his  
mother gave to him. He now heads the Rosewood Justice Center in 
Spring Hill, funded in part by donations from the 1997 John 
Singleton film ``Rosewood'' that depicted the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be about the business of ensuring that our youth know  
who they are and where they come from,'' Doctor said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Knocks GOP Tax-Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- President Clinton, mingling with big-money  
Democratic donors, described the Republicans' tax-cutting plan in 
doomsday terms Saturday, saying it would ``imperil the future 
stability of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense,'' Clinton said, asserting that the GOP  
program would soak up money needed to fix Social Security, Medicare 
and other social programs. He said Republicans were engaged in a 
childish tax-cut bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like the arguments we used to have when I was at  
school,'' the president said. He mocked the Republicans as saying, 
``Our tax cut is bigger than your tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president attacked the GOP plan in fund-raising speeches and  
his weekly radio address 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, a top Republican praised the $792 billion tax cut  
passed last week as returning surplus federal money to the people 
to keep it from being spent in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived early Saturday morning in this swank resort town  
for what was supposed to be a leisurely weekend of hobnobbing with 
contributors who gave at least $50,000 to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president decided to cut the Colorado weekend short --  
compressing two days of schmoozing into about five hours -- to fly 
overnight to Morocco for Sunday's funeral of King Hassan II. He was 
to be accompanied by his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Hassan as ``a great friend of the peace  
process'' and a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan, who helped forge Middle East peace and ruled Morocco for  
38 years, died Friday of a heart attack at age 70. He was succeeded 
by his son, Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' weekend retreat gave donors a chance to rub  
elbows with Clinton, the first lady and members of his Cabinet. It 
was expected to raise $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Republicans have changed their tune about him,  
saying they can reclaim the White House when he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``After telling everybody for 6 1/2 years what a bad guy I was,  
they're now basically saying, `Oh, well, you know, Bill Clinton is 
like Michael Jordan, he just jumps higher than the other guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, however, Clinton told reporters, ``no one in their right  
mind could compare me to Michael Jordan ... I can't jump four 
inches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Clinton said the Republicans hope that when he's  
gone, they can put the Democrats ``in the cellar again. There's a 
sort of a cynical, political thing. ... I could not have done 
anything, anything in the last six years if our ideas hadn't been 
right and if I hadn't had the help of Al Gore and Hillary and 
Dianne Feinstein,'' the Democratic senator from California. 
</P>
<P>
	The president mixed with donors at a sprawling cedar ``cabin''  
owned by Feinstein and her husband, Dick Blum. Under a brilliant 
sun, guests listened to a Western band and strolled among aspen 
trees and wild flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the radio, the president opened up a new line of attack  
against the Republicans' 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their reckless tax plan would threaten law enforcement across  
the board, forcing reductions in the number of federal agents and 
cutting deeply into support for state and local law enforcement,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced the award of $50 million in Justice Department  
grants to hire 680 law enforcement officers in 64 communities. In 
addition, the District of Columbia will get $15 million to hire 200 
new community police officers and 40 new federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the grants, Phoenix will receive $7.5 million to hire 100  
officers; Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., $10.8 million to hire 144 
officers; Detroit $9 million to hire 120 officers; and Austin, 
Texas, $3.7 million to hire 50 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' own radio address credited Americans with  
producing the economic bounty that enables a tax cut at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan helps fix an unfair tax system by making it  
financially easier to get married and save money for children's 
education or other long-term needs, House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would ease taxation on interest accrued from savings  
and reduce the ``marriage penalty,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosperity you created brought us the first budget surplus  
in 39 years,'' he said. ``We must return that money to you so it 
isn't spent in Washington on more big government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an almost straight party-line vote Thursday, the House  
approved a measure that would cut taxes over 10 years. Senate 
Republicans plan to pass a tax cut next week that is the same size 
as the House bill but differs in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has threatened to veto such deep cuts and instead favors  
a tax cut in the range of $250 billion.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The cauldron burned and the athletes  
beamed as the 13th Pan American Games officially got under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes from 42 nations paraded into Winnipeg Stadium on Friday  
night in a colorful opening ceremony that showcased music, dance 
and local tradition as thousands of flag-waving spectators cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven aboriginal athletes banned from the 1967 Pan Am Games in  
this prairie city carried the flame into Winnipeg Stadium for the 
torch lighting that signals the official start of competition, 
which actually had been going on for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Kayaker Alwyn Morris and rower Silken Laumann, both Olympic  
medalists for Canada, carried the torch up the final steps and, 
together, lit the cauldron. 
</P>
<P>
	The flame made its appearance after the delegations of athletes  
paraded leisurely into the stadium, ranging from the Brazilian 
contingent that stretched the length of the football field to the 
one athlete from tiny St. Kitts and Nevis. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd roared for Cuba, whose athletes wore black tie, but  
the biggest cheers -- naturally -- went to the Canadian team, which 
marched in to a standing ovation and blinding bursts of flashbulbs 
from throughout the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before, native Canadian marchers paraded in protest of  
what they say are third-world conditions for their people in 
Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps 200 marchers, including native drummers, were on hand  
for the start of the walk and then headed to the stadium. They 
promised to remain outside and not disrupt the official opening of 
the games being attended by Princess Anne and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the intention of this demonstration at all, we are  
not protesting the Pan Am Games,'' said organizer Gerald McIvor. 
``My people are living in third-world conditions in the country 
that's been voted No. 1 again in the world as the best country in 
the world to live in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ceremony followed an outstanding day for U.S.  
athletes, who bagged six medals in canoe-kayak and dominated on the 
field and in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither American soccer team gave up a goal and the men's water  
polo team also blanked its opponent. The women allowed two goals in 
water polo, but it didn't matter because they scored 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Schumacher scored four goals as the men beat Colombia 18-0  
in water polo, setting the tone with a defense that closed off its 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have one of the best defenses in the world,'' defender  
Craig Kredell said. ``We showed Colombia and all the competitors in 
this tournament what they can expect from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women, making their Pan Am debut, got their offense together  
after a slow start and defeated Puerto Rico 16-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we should come out a little sharper offensively,'' said  
Courtney Johnson, who had three goals. ``But it's not a bad result 
for one of the early games of the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the soccer fields, the U.S. men defeated Cuba 1-0 and the  
women downed Costa Rica 6-0. The women, an under-20 team, struck 
about as quickly as possible, getting a goal from Marcia Wallis in 
the first minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The men had to play into the 57th minute to get their goal, Pete  
Vagenas angling in a kick from 10 yards. Tim Howard stopped six 
shots in a rough game marred by seven yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good first game for us,'' coach Clive Charles said.  
``We had to work hard, but in the end, we produced a result we 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein Jorgensen of San Diego and John Mooney of Eugene, Ore.,  
captured their second gold medals in kayaking, winning the 
500-meter doubles. They were part of the four-man 1,000 squad that 
won on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Colin of Kailua, Hawaii, got silver in both singles and  
doubles kayak. She finished behind Canada's Karen Furneaux in the 
500 singles and teamed in the 500 doubles with Tamara Jenkins of 
Seattle. They also finished behind host Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Two showcase events, track and gymnastics, highlighted today's  
schedule. In track, medals were to be awarded in the men's shot put 
and 5,000 and women's long jump and hammer throw. Team titles were 
decided in gymnastics, with the U.S. women favored for the gold.

<HEADLINE> Cherokees Elect New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) -- Members of the nation's second-largest  
Indian tribe voted out a chief on Saturday whose tenure was marred 
by months of turmoil within the tribal government, according to 
unofficial returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenger Chad Smith received 7,197 votes, or 56 percent in the  
Cherokee elections, to incumbent Joe Byrd's 5,550 votes, or 44 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith alleged that during Byrd's tenure, the coffers of the  
200,000-member Cherokee nation slid from a $3.4 million surplus to 
a projected $18 million deficit. Byrd administration officials 
countered that the chief inherited a $1.3 million deficit and has 
reduced it to less than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're humbled, we're honored and we're going to have to take  
into consideration the very solemn charge the Cherokee people have 
put on our shoulders,'' Smith said. ``The turmoil is over. The 
healing begins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd comforted supporters, some in tears.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a load off my shoulders. I'm not sure President  
Clinton went through as much as I did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's runoff followed a May primary in which Byrd received  
32 percent of the vote and Smith gained 19 percent, with the 
remainder split among seven other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	About 26,000 of the Cherokees are registered voters. Only about  
half of them voted in the primary. Smith estimated a 20 percent to 
30 percent drop in voter turnout from the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal member Pamela Bacon said mudslinging by both sides kept  
voters away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to settle anything, no matter who  
wins,'' said Bacon, who wouldn't say who she voted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations of misspending have overshadowed much of Byrd's  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 audit by the U.S. Department of Interior found the tribe  
had improperly charged the government $88,000 for legal services 
and transferred $16.1 million in federal money to its operating 
fund without proof the transfers were reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	Turmoil started in February 1997 when Byrd fired tribal marshals  
who executed a search warrant for financial documents tied to a 
criminal investigation of his office. His supporters on the tribal 
council later impeached the three tribunal justices, and lawsuits 
and federal probes followed. 
</P>
<P>
	That summer, Smith was arrested as he tried to stop Byrd's  
administration from closing the tribal courthouse, and a crowd 
clashed on the steps a month later when two rival groups of tribal 
marshals fought over its control. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 45, ran television ads showing Smith being wrestled to the  
ground by a deputy and urged voters to choose ``responsible 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a 48-year-old lawyer, said he would provide the tribe  
with honest leadership, promote culture and improve health care. He 
called upon voters to remove Byrd ``while there's still time to 
save our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cherokee nation is second in size only to the Navajo tribe.

<HEADLINE> Many Wait for Navy Burial at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- When Howard Michael Novak, a Navy veteran of  
27 years, died in January, his last wish to be buried at sea by the 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later, his ashes remain -- along with those of 35  
others who died with the same request -- in a room at the Naval 
Medical Center in Portsmouth, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	While the USS Briscoe was used to bury the ashes of John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law at sea in private 
ceremonies Thursday, some wondered why their loved ones have had to 
wait so long for the same respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here they pick up JFK Jr. yesterday morning and buried him  
this morning, and they take another Navy ship up there to do it. 
It's just very upsetting,'' Novak's ex-wife, Joyce Novak, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last four months the Navy has been telling me no ships  
were available because all of them were in Yugoslavia, or in a 
shipyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After calling Navy officials again on Thursday, Mrs. Novak said  
she was told her ex-husband, who retired from the Navy in 1969, 
will be buried next month, in conjunction with services for two 
other men. 
</P>
<P>
	The burial-at-sea option is available to anyone who left the  
military with something higher than a dishonorable discharge. Also 
entitled are U.S. civilian personnel of the Military Sealift 
Command, dependents of members of the military and ``other U.S. 
citizens who are determined eligible by the chief of naval 
operations ... due to notable service or outstanding contribution 
to the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr.'s father, President Kennedy, was a veteran of the Navy.  
</P>
<P>
	The Portsmouth medical center, one of five Navy sites that  
handle the remains of individuals who qualify for burial at sea, 
conducts about 200 services a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy does not ordinarily dispatch a ship just to bury a  
body. It holds such ceremonies generally in the normal course of a 
ship's departure from port. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog is higher than normal, officials concede.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have fewer ships, and the increase in recent operational  
commitments provide fewer opportunities for the burials at sea,'' a 
Navy spokesman said. ``We do our very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, there is a one- to two-month wait  
between the time the hospital receives the remains and when a 
burial at sea can be scheduled, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, family members are not present on board for the  
formal service. Instead, a videotape is sent to the family, along 
with the flag, a letter from the ship's captain and occasionally 
shell casings from the ceremonial gun salute. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Novak said she does not begrudge naval hospital officials  
for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been very nice to me and said I can call them every  
day,'' she said. ``But here I'm living in a Navy town and see those 
ships going in and out every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not right.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Blocks Microsoft Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. responded to the release of  
instant messaging software from Microsoft Inc. by electronically 
jamming messages that users of the Microsoft software tried to send 
to people who use AOL's service. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service, released Thursday, works  
through the Microsoft Network site, allowing instant message 
exchanges with the 40 million users of MSN Hotmail. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messengers allow Internet users to chat in ``real time''  
by sending messages that recipients see instantly, without having 
to go through e-mail. While common enough on the Web, few messenger 
programs are compatible with others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft program was designed to allow messages to be sent  
to users of the popular AOL Instant Messenger System, or AIM. That 
aspect of the new software angered AOL, which late Thursday blocked 
MSN users from interacting with AIM users, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Microsoft said it had revised its program late  
Friday to get around the AOL block. But Dulles, Va.-based AOL 
responded within hours by issuing a second block, the Times said. 
The story also was reported today by The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine which AOL users are online, Microsoft's product  
enters AOL's servers in a way that the company says violates its 
copyrights and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among AOL's complaints is that Microsoft requires AOL users to  
enter their password, AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the new software as a key step in the  
ever-escalating battle among Internet companies to obtain Web 
traffic to help them sell advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	By designing its messaging service to work with AOL's system,  
Microsoft Network could position itself to draw more users to its 
Web site and keep them there longer, said Emily Meehan, an analyst 
with The Yankee Group research firm of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Sanford, MSN lead product manager, said Messenger was  
just one of the services MSN wanted to offer its users and wasn't 
directed towards competing with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just part of our continuing efforts to provide  
consumers with a place they can go to get information no matter 
where they are,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Begin Post-Elway Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- John Mobley unpacked his belongings and  
brashly shouted, ``Time for No. 3,'' symbolizing the Denver 
Broncos' readiness to pursue their Super Bowl victory No. 3 without 
the services of No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The post-John Elway era officially began Friday as Denver opened  
training camp at the University of Northern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Shannon Sharpe, one of the retired quarterback's  
favorite targets, was so anxious to get to Greeley that he got a 
speeding ticket -- his fourth in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to get pumped up when you've won the last two Super  
Bowls, and no one is conceding there won't be a third straight just 
because Bubby Brister, and not Elway, will be the guy throwing the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely have to go on,'' Sharpe said. ``I'm not going to  
sit here and try to kid anybody and say that we don't wish that he 
was back, because we do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bubby now has to prove that he can throw the football, that he  
can beat people. If Bubby can't throw the football, we're in 
trouble. He knows that. We know that. There's no sense in me trying 
to sugarcoat it, but I think Bubby can get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did last season, guiding the Broncos to five victories when  
Elway was sidelined by injuries. Nobody expects Brister to put up 
Hall of Fame statistics, but there will be no shortage of pressure. 
A crowd of cameras and reporters greeted him as he arrived Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can deal with it for a year or two and then let  
somebody else take over,'' Brister, 36, said. ``I'm excited about 
it. I'm ready to do some talking with my body instead of my 
mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are his teammates, who throughout the day pulled to the curb  
outside the dorm in luxury sedans and shiny sport-utility trucks to 
unload quilts, pillows and video disc players. 
</P>
<P>
	While his former teammates prepared for training camp, Elway was  
vacationing with his family, far removed from the spotlight he held 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an Elway at camp, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm filling any void, but it's different,'' said  
John Elway's father, Jack Elway, the team's director of pro 
scouting. ``His time had to come eventually. It's here, and I'm 
sure he doesn't have any reservations that he had to change gears 
and go in another direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback's absence drew as much attention as his presence  
ever did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be different for everybody,'' coach Mike  
Shanahan said, ``but his spirit is still here. How competitive John 
was and what he's meant to this organization, it's still in every 
player on this football team. Even though he's gone, his spirit's 
still within us.''

<HEADLINE> 'Unruly' Passenger Held for Fracas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- An airline passenger roaming the aisles became  
unruly when asked to return to his seat, injuring four people and 
forcing the plane to divert course, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those hurt on the Delta Airlines flight that left Los  
Angeles late Friday was a 17-month-old child who suffered minor 
burns from spilled coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The unidentified passenger, described only as a Vietnamese  
national in his 30s, was taken into custody by Las Vegas police, 
said McCarran International Airport spokesman John Hanks. The man's 
brother was held for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 194 was initially bound for Atlanta, but diverted course  
to Las Vegas to remove the passenger and treat the injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual who had the altercation was up and moving  
around when he wasn't supposed to be and they tried to seat him. He 
tried to get past the beverage cart and just got violent,'' Hanks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline beverage and food carts typically block the entire  
aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy burned by coffee was treated at University Medical  
Center and released. The others hurt, a flight attendants and two 
female passengers, were treated at the scene for minor cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight resumed its trip to Atlanta after more than a  
three-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Airlines did not immediately returned a phone call from  
The Associated Press seeking comment this morning.

<HEADLINE> Scandal, Shocks Bedevil UC System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Congress wants to know why its graduate  
researchers are being paid so much, investigators want to know how 
nuclear secrets walked out of the national lab it manages, and 
everyone wants to know how someone could quietly abstract $4.5 
million from its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	It looks like a long, hot summer at the University of  
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always had difficulty with these kinds of very high  
profile gaffes,'' says Bill Pickens, director of the California 
Citizens Commission on Higher Education. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials say the current wave of trouble looks more  
like a ripple when viewed in the context of the huge UC system -- 
nine campuses, 170,000 students and a $12 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think it's that much out of the ordinary  
considering the size of the institution and the public nature and 
the scrutiny that we are properly given,'' says UC Provost C. 
Judson King. ``Lots more opportunities exist to look at UC's warts 
than to look at Stanford's or Cal Tech's or Harvard's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, inspection of UC's potential blemishes has intensified  
over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlights:  
</P>
<P>
	--Questions about the two national nuclear laboratories UC  
manages, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos in New Mexico, arose 
earlier this year with revelations of the apparent theft of nuclear 
secrets at Los Alamos. A Los Alamos scientist was fired in March, 
but no criminal charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	--In March, it was revealed that the merged hospitals of UC San  
Francisco and private Stanford University, a controversial move 
pushed as a moneysaving measure, lost $10 million in May. 
</P>
<P>
	--A June report from the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative arm of Congress, found that UC overcharged the 
federal government by millions to reimburse graduate students doing 
government research. 
</P>
<P>
	--This month, regents demanded system-wide audits after learning  
that $4.5 million had been embezzled from UC San Francisco over a 
period of five years. No one has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Friday, the government said a scientist formerly with the  
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory -- managed by UC -- faked his 
data in a 1992 study linking high-voltage power lines to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The current crop of contretemps comes four years after a  
controversial 1995 vote to drop affirmative action, and seven years 
after revelations that departing president David Gardner got a $1 
million golden handshake at a time when the university was boosting 
student fees to cover state funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``UC will go for quite a while without major scandals and then  
there will be several in a row,'' observes Pickens, a former 
associate vice president for administration at California State 
University who has taught at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems come at a time when admissions are booming,  
minority enrollment is climbing back to affirmative action levels 
(although not so much at the top campuses of Berkeley and UCLA), 
the budget is healthy after some lean years and work is in motion 
on a tenth campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of good stuff going on here,'' says King.  
</P>
<P>
	As for the problem areas, corrective action is under way, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UC President Richard Atkinson has commissioned a panel of  
experts to review nuclear lab security. This week, the Senate voted 
near unanimously to create a new agency responsible for nuclear 
weapons development and security at the weapons labs, but UC 
officials aren't interpreting that as a sign that they may soon 
lose the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, King points out that the GAO report on graduate  
research pay cleared UC of tax fraud charges that prompted the 
investigation. And Friday, members of the UC San Francisco-Stanford 
hospital board met to discuss the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators and regents are particularly upset over the  
embezzlement at UC San Francisco, which apparently had gone on 
without anyone noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It amazed many of us that such a thing could happen,'' King  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Pickens calls UC ``an organizational nightmare,'' he  
adds that the same things that make it a complicated institution to 
run also make it a strong university overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you really look at any other state ... there is not  
another state (university) that even comes close to the enormous 
size and prestige of the University of California.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Include Hope, Holdouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Training camp in the NFL is two-H time -- hope and holdouts.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lions haven't heard from Barry Sanders, who's threatening to  
retire. Marshall Faulk is still negotiating with the Rams, to whom 
he was traded in April because the Colts didn't want the contract 
hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman, one of the league's top receivers, is still  
negotiating with the Packers. And rookie quarterback Cade McNown, 
who's expected to start for the Bears, was a no-show when Chicago 
opened camp Thursday, waiting until contract negotiations are 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	But veterans, even those with their own squabbles, have some  
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as me and all of the other players in the NFL don't  
like training camp, I don't want to miss any time,'' says Jamal 
Anderson, who gained 1,846 yards as Atlanta made its surprise run 
to the Super Bowl last season and is now trying to renegotiate his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every intention of remaining a Falcon. Where else am I  
going to go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By next weekend, all the NFL's camps will be open -- with some  
big holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver, for example, opens camp without John Elway, who retired  
after leading the Broncos to two straight Super Bowls titles. Green 
Bay won't gave Reggie White, who left on a high note as NFL 
defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the old go out, there are always the new, players and  
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is the Cleveland Browns, replacing the one Art Modell  
took to Baltimore after the 1995 season. Like Carolina and 
Jacksonville, who began play in 1995, the Browns should be 
respectable: Free agency allowed them to get a number of solid 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	And for all teams, there are those high hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of year, I've never felt as good about what we  
have to do and what we have to do it with,'' says coach Dick 
Vermeil of the Rams, who are 9-23 in his two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Indianapolis, which finished 3-13 last season, is looking  
forward to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always excited at the beginning,'' team president Bill  
Polian says. 
</P>
<P>
	Who could blame him? The Colts have Peyton Manning, who finished  
his rookie season looking like he could be the next Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more on the horizon.  
</P>
<P>
	Five quarterbacks were drafted in the first round last April.  
Two, McNown and Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia, might be instant 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, who's  
the Saints' only draft choice. Mike Ditka gave up the rest of his 
picks because he thinks Williams can carry the ball and his 
otherwise shaky team all the way to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other running backs in the spotlight were Sanders,  
Anderson and Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interesting is Sanders, who will break Walter Payton's  
career rushing record when he runs for 1,458 yards, a little less 
than a normal season's work for him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lions haven't heard from him since early May. He missed  
training minicamp, and the last word Detroit had was from his 
father, William, who said his son was tired of playing with a 
losing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Lions say (hope?) they'll see him in Saginaw Valley,  
Mich., when camp opens Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a holdout has been Barry's MO,'' Detroit coach  
Bobby Ross says. ``If you look at his past history, he's been 
pretty much doing this year what he's done in previous years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams obtained Faulk from the Colts because they assumed they  
could work out the contract hassles that prompted Indianapolis to 
trade him. But they opened camp last Thursday without him. 
</P>
<P>
	But as high as most teams' hopes are, they can be dashed  
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, for example, has been scrambling to find a new  
running back after learning that the ankle Garrison Hearst broke in 
the playoffs last season, may not be healthy until late this year, 
if ever. It will probably be running-back-by-committee until then. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego, which last year went into camp with high hopes for  
Ryan Leaf, taken second to Manning in the draft, is now looking at 
things from a totally different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	As Manning flourished last season, Leaf struggled. He'll would  
have begun the season as the Chargers' third-string quarterback 
behind two veteran free agents, Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer. But 
he injured his shoulder on the first day of camp and could miss the 
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway gone, Denver won't be favored to win a third straight  
Super Bowl, even though Bubby Brister, who will start the season at 
quarterback, was 4-0 last season when Elway was out. 
</P>
<P>
	One good omen for the 36-year-old Brister: Last year's best QBs  
included Randall Cunningham, Chris Chandler, Steve Young and Doug 
Flutie, were all well in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Broncos are rated no higher than third in the AFC behind  
the Jets, whom they beat in the AFC title game last season, and 
Jacksonville, which has been a contender for three of its four 
years in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, which went 15-1 last year only to lose at home to  
Atlanta in overtime of the NFC title game, is probably the favorite 
in the conference. Although the Vikings have lost two of their four 
starters in the secondary and some other key players, they still 
have Cunningham and his wide receivers -- Randy Moss, last year's 
brilliant rookie, and Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta? For whatever reason, their 14-2 record is viewed as  
something of a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost their only deep threat, Tony Martin, who was released  
after being indicted on money-laundering charges and signed by 
Miami. So many things went their way last season that some things 
have to go sour this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they're a good playoff contender.  
</P>
<P>
	After those two, the NFC is anyone's guess. Dallas, Arizona or  
the New York Giants could all win the East, but all are flawed. 
Green Bay has lost a lot but still has Brett Favre, the game's best 
quarterback, which means they're a threat. And San Francisco will 
probably win 10 or more games for the 17th straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there another 1998 Atlanta out there?  
</P>
<P>
	It's training camp. And where there's a camp, there are hopes.  
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Polian, Ditka and Vermeil.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 1, MetroStars 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Edwin Gorter scored on a 30-yard  
free kick in the 84th minute to lift the Miami Fusion to a 1-0 
victory over the struggling New York-New Jersey MetroStars on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorter's second goal of the season sailed into the upper right  
corner of the net after MetroStars midfielder Mike Sorber had 
fouled Welton. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Miami's third in a row, tying a club record set  
last year. The Fusion is now 7-12 with 17 points in the MLS Eastern 
Conference. The MetroStars have lost three straight and 12 of their 
last 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars, who have the fewest goals scored and most goals  
allowed in MLS, have a league low nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars debuted two new foreign players in Columbian  
striker Henry Zambrano and Yugoslavian midfielder Sasa Curcic, but 
couldn't generate much offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Their two best chances came in the second half. Lawrence  
Lozzano's long shot was stopped by Miami goalkeeper Garth Lagerwey 
in the 74th minute and a hard shot by Brian Kelly from Curcic that 
was turned away by Lagerwey in the 83rd minute.

<HEADLINE> Most AL Umps Seem Likely To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than two-thirds of American League umpires  
probably will stay on the job rather than resign. Nearly all NL 
umps still plan to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	While four more AL umpires withdrew their resignations Friday,  
baseball went ahead and hired 10 more replacement umps from the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 12 of 32 AL umps have changed their mind about quitting,  
and 11 never quit in the first place, according to a count by The 
Associated Press. In the National League, 33 of 36 umpires have 
resigned, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not one or two. This is a big group out there now who  
have rescinded their resignations,'' said Mike Reilly, one of the 
AL umpires who withdrew Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision was based on my family and what I can do best to  
support them. I have four kids, 12 to 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Friday's reversals, 26 of the 68 major league umpires  
now say they're staying, more than one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	The replacements, now totaling 20, are from Triple-A and will be  
added to the major league staff on a permanent basis starting Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Reilly, Rick Reed, Tim Tschida and Larry Young  
also withdrew their resignations Friday, according to several 
management officials who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the difficulties of the last week, we have simply  
decided to honor the present terms of our contract,'' Reed, 
Tschida, Young and Al Clark said in a joint statement after their 
game in Chicago. Clark withdrew his resignation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires union head Richie Phillips said, ``There's a lot of  
behind-the-scenes stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was en route to Cooperstown for this weekend's Hall of  
Fame induction ceremonies, which commissioner Bud Selig also will 
attend, but no talks were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only news I heard today is that dialog could open the  
whole thing up, when people get off the position that they won't 
talk to our counsel,'' NL umpire Bruce Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, minor league umpires will ask the National Labor  
Relations Board to hold an organizing election, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips has said 220 of 228 minor league umps voted to  
form a union, it hasn't been recognized by the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors. 
The only way to force the association to deal with the union is to 
have the NLRB conduct a vote by secret ballot, a process that 
usually takes a month or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the request for an election will be filed with the  
NLRB's Philadelphia office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced mass resignations last week. Bound by a  
no-strike clause, they chose the tactic because they thought owners 
would lock them out after their labor contract expires Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Moving Co. Sues Wal-Mart Heiress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A moving company is taking one of  
America's richest women to court over a $14,000 unpaid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	United Van Lines, which filed the suit here Wednesday, claims  
Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton refused to pay them for moving 
property from her New York City apartment to a ranch 50 miles west 
of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walton, the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, is  
disputing the moving bill because some of her belongings were 
damaged, said Jay Allen, a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen was not specific, but said some of the items were of  
significant value. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Missouri-based moving line would not comment  
on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walton and her mother are the country's richest women, with  
an estimated $16 billion apiece.

<HEADLINE> Driver Who Hit King Had Poor Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Sheriff's investigators continue to  
investigate the accident last month that left horror writer Stephen 
King with several broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Smith, 42, the driver of a van that struck King on June 19  
along a rural road, maintains he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Although authorities filed no charges, they have pointed to a  
list of previous driving offenses against Smith and kept the case 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the world looking at something we're putting  
together. I think it was in our best interest to go a little bit 
further,'' said Capt. James Miclon of the Oxford County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who said he was distracted by his pet dog in the van just  
prior to the crash, said the authorities are wasting their time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to investigate. I was in an accident that had  
no cause,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State driving records indicate Smith has several offenses over  
the past decade or so. Among them, convictions for: driving to 
endanger; failing to stop upon the signal of a police officer; 
failing to produce evidence of insurance; operating under the 
influence; and four speeding violations -- two in 1988 and two in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``His record has been poor, and that's cause for concern,'' said  
Maine Secretary of State Dan Gwadosky, who oversees the Bureau of 
Motor Vehicles 
</P>
<P>
	The accident near King's vacation home in North Lovell has  
forced the author to undergo five operations to set the broken 
bones in his right leg and hip. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suffered broken ribs, a punctured lung and a skull  
laceration in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	While King is moving around his home in a wheelchair under  
round-the-clock nursing supervision, rehabilitation has put his 
writing on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's writing, he doesn't want any interference,'' said  
his secretary, Julie Eugley. ``He knows that the physical therapy 
part of it is more important than the writing.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins Re-Sign LB Ken Harvey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Ken Harvey  
agreed to return to the Washington Redskins as a backup Friday, 
signing a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey was bothered by hamstring and knee injuries last season  
and had only two sacks in 11 games. He was due to count $2 million 
against the salary cap this season and would have been released had 
he not agreed to a new contract with a substantial pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
	His new contract will pay him $500,000, but he could earn as  
much as $2 million in incentives if he regains his starting role 
and has another Pro Bowl season. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey, who first signed with Washington as an unrestricted free  
agent in 1994, will be used primarily as a third-down pass rusher. 
Third-year player Greg Jones will replace Harvey as the starting 
strong side linebacker.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Updated Air Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore tried Saturday to breathe  
fresh air into the nation's 2-decade-old air quality index system, 
saying the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to give more 
detailed health warnings so vulnerable people can protect 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the announcement at the groundbreaking for a children's  
hospital in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	A new category added to the air quality index will bring relief  
to 6 million children with asthma and others with respiratory 
conditions, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new index will provide specific, more detailed  
information, included warnings for those with special health 
conditions such as asthma,'' the vice president added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said local forecasters would deliver a ``uniform, clear,  
understandable measure of daily air quality and the health risks 
associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The new air quality index is a critical tool Americans need to  
protect their health,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many local weather forecasters since 1976 have reported daily on  
the Air Quality Index, which measures the health effects of air 
pollution. Pollution measurements are divided into ranges, and a 
health advisory is given based on the day's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said it wanted changes to the index  
in part because people are not adequately told how to protect 
themselves on days when the air can adversely affect their health. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised model is meant to provide a consistent format for  
weather forecasters to explain when air pollution poses a health 
risk and what precautions can be taken. The new index measures five 
major air pollutants: smog, soot, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide 
and nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats to health from unsafe levels of any or all of these  
pollutants can trigger a health protection warning for that day.

<HEADLINE> Gardenburger Reports Sales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Slumping sales pulled second quarter  
earnings for Gardenburger Inc. down 69 percent from the same period 
last year, when the maker of veggie-burgers achieved record sales 
following a nationwide advertising blitz that included a spot on 
the final episode of ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it was disappointed with the results it  
released Friday and scaled back its sales projections for this year 
and next. It said it lacks the funds for a national television ad 
campaign for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, Gardenburger fell by 20 percent, or by $1.50, to an  
all-time closing low of $5.87 1/2 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives also said that even if last year's sales were not  
sustained, they did not regret a gamble last year that bet the 
company's advertising budget on a quirky TV commercial blitz that 
immediately pumped up business. 
</P>
<P>
	The $17 million campaign included a series of animated  
commercials, narrated by actor Samuel L. Jackson. One of the 
earliest ads in the series ran during the highly rated final 
episode of ``Seinfeld.'' It helped put 140,000 burgers on store 
shelves in 1998, compared with the 20,000 it had on the market in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardenburger reported Friday that sales for the second quarter  
of this year dropped to $22.2 million from $25.7 million in the 
same quarter last year, when the ad ran on ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland-based company posted a loss of $10.4 million, the  
equivalent of $1.29 a share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared 
with a loss of $6.2 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year is a pretty tough comparison,'' said Richard Dietz,  
the chief financial officer. ``We generated a lot of publicity with 
the 'Seinfeld' ad and really had skyrocketing sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with sales sagging a year later, Dietz says the campaign  
was well worth it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our repeat rate is about 40 percent,'' he said. ``So of all  
the consumers that we brought in with the ads, many are staying 
with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some marketing analysts said last year's campaign was a  
financial bungle that Gardenburger is still paying for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got them a small bump in sales,'' said Gary Stibel, of the  
Westport, Conn.-based New England Consulting Group. He said good 
advertising sustains a long-term improvement in the bottom line and 
shouldn't give way to steady decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``They absolutely didn't get their money's worth,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dietz admitted the company used the same ad this year and failed  
to generate the same kind of success. But he blamed that, in part, 
on a flat market for all vegetarian burgers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the overall market declined by 1 percent, although  
Gardenburger's share of the market rose by 2 percent, Dietz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardenburger has no plans to advertise nationally in the short  
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're constrained financially right now from advertising until  
we can do it and make money at the same time,'' Dietz said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the slowdown in business, Gardenburger lowered its sales  
expectations for 1999 and 2000, Dietz said. Instead of focusing on 
aggressive market growth, the company will emphasize profitability 
and cash flow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed by our second-quarter results,'' said Lyle  
Hubbard, Gardenburger's chief executive officer. ``Our aggressive 
growth plan was dependent upon our ability to accelerate consumer 
trial of the Gardenburger brand and the veggie burger category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company now distributes its flagship meatless  
hamburger-shaped patty to more than 35,000 food service outlets 
throughout the United States and Canada and employs approximately 
300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of this year, losses widened by almost 52  
percent as sales fell nearly 8 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardenburger reported a loss of just under $16 million, or $1.92  
a share, in the first six months of 1999, compared with a loss of 
$10.5 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier. Sales slid to 
$35.8 million from $38.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Decathlete Gets Ultimatum From Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Decathlete Chris Huffins' wife,  
Monique, is putting a lot of pressure on him at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `If you don't come home with the gold, don't come  
home,''' Huffins said with a laugh Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning should be no problem for Huffins, the world's  
fifth-ranked decathlete. He is an overwhelming favorite against a 
weak field of four in the 10-event, two-day competition that began 
today at the University of Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor should he have any difficulty smashing the Pan Am Games  
record of 8,078 points by American Bob Coffman in 1979. Huffins has 
a career-best of 8,694 last year in the USA Championships at New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic holds the world record of  
8,994, set earlier this month at Prague, a performance Huffins 
closely tracked on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four events, I said to my wife, `He's going to break the  
world record,''' Huffins said. ``Then, after nine events, I said he 
was going to break 9,000 points. I'm glad he just missed because I 
want to be the first over 9,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins will get his shot at Dvorak and the world record next  
month in the world championships at Seville, Spain, where the heat 
and humidity are expected to take a heavy toll on the athletes. 
Huffins thinks the adverse weather, with the temperature usually 
over 100 degrees in the summer, will be to his benefit, because he 
is used to training in warm climates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't convince me there's any place hotter than New  
Orleans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heat means fluids. While everyone else in Seville will be  
complaining about the heat, I won't. My best three marks have been 
in temperatures over 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's cold and rainy, that's a big problem, because you  
don't have to deal with that at home when you're training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Huffins' final tuneup before the worlds, and he  
wants to make a strong impression. He would rather be competing 
than practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't sit at home and train for eight weeks for one meet,''  
he said. ``In practice, I can get to competition readiness and then 
get stale. I can only match by PRs (personal records) so many times 
in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to put up a good mark here. I would like to have the  
Pan Am Games record after nine events. That's no disrespect to the 
other decathletes. When I compete, it's me against the scoring 
tables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A solid performance would make Huffins, the two-time U.S.  
champion, a strong contender to dethrone Dvorak as world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have beaten Dvorak more than once,'' Huffins said. ``After  
the (1997) world championships, he got trounced by me at Talence 
(France). I had something people don't often get, and that's a 
chance at redemption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1997 worlds in Athens, Huffins led through seven events,  
then fouled three times in the javelin, killing his chance for the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffins is a consummate student of track and field. He trains up  
to 60 hours a week, participates in a track and field fantasy 
league and has more than 200 videotapes of various meets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be the best decathlete that ever lived,'' he said.  
``World's greatest athlete is probably the most glamorous title on 
the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Huffins completes the testing decathlon in Winnipeg, he  
might have an added job -- running on the U.S. 400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's coach Ralph Lindeman of the Air Force Academy said he  
might draft Huffins for the relay because of a shortage of quality 
sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why shouldn't we use a guy who can run 10.20?'' Lindeman said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 400 relay final is Friday, meaning Huffins would have to  
stay an extra five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good chance I'm running,'' Huffins said, ``much to  
my wife's chagrin. My wife told me if I stay, I better run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another ultimatum.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Naturalist's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel maintenance man  
wanted for questioning in the decapitation of a 26-year-old 
naturalist in Yosemite National Park was taken into custody 
Saturday morning at a nudist colony, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, was last seen Thursday night by friends and  
coworkers at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, where he works as a 
handyman. He was taken into custody by federal authorities Saturday 
morning at a nudist colony in Wilton, Calif., near Sacramento, a 
Sacramento County source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park rangers found the 26-year-old naturalist's body on  
Thursday, about four miles from Cedar Lodge. The FBI would not 
release her identity because not all of her close relatives had 
been notified. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not immediately confirm whether Stayner had been  
taken into custody. But Patty Sailors, whose husband manages the 
Laguna Del Sol clothing-optional resort, said a man identifying 
himself as Stayner checked in last night. 
</P>
<P>
	A visitor recognized Stayner from news reports and called the  
FBI, Mrs. Sailors said. Stayner, who was not a member of the resort 
but had visited there several times, was taken into custody about 9 
a.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what charges, if any, Stayner was being held  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not comment on any potential suspects at this early  
stage of the investigation,'' said Special Agent Nick Rossi of the 
FBI office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is the brother of Steven Stayner, a kidnap victim who  
made national headlines in 1980 after he escaped from Kenneth 
Parnell, a convicted child molester. Steven Stayner, who was held 
and sexually abused for seven years, died in a 1989 motorcycle 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Delbert Stayner, Steven and Cary's father, told the San  
Francisco Chronicle that he's sure his son was not directly 
involved in the woman's death, but worries that he may have been a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``My little boy Stevie Stayner went missing for seven and a half  
years. ... Now my oldest son is missing. I'm kind of torn up over 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was discovered a few hundred yards from the park  
housing she shared with a man and woman, who were away at the time. 
A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The 
Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was initially reported overdue by a friend she was  
driving to visit in Sausalito, just north of San Francisco. Her 
loaded car was found outside her quarters, ready for the trip. The 
friend called Sausalito police at 3 a.m. Thursday to file the 
missing-persons report. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was described as a freckled, red-haired educator  
beloved among children for the enthusiasm she showed on nature 
hikes over 800 miles of trails in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	The area where the naturalist was found on the west side of the  
park is relatively unknown to tourists. It's just a few miles from 
El Portal, the town where three Yosemite sightseers were last seen 
alive in February before their bodies were found about a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there was no connection between that case and  
the slain naturalist.

<HEADLINE> AOL Blocks Microsoft Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. responded to the release of  
instant messaging software from Microsoft Inc. by electronically 
jamming messages that users of the Microsoft software tried to send 
to people who use AOL's service. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service, released Thursday, works  
through the Microsoft Network site, allowing instant message 
exchanges with the 40 million users of MSN Hotmail. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messengers allow Internet users to chat in ``real time''  
by sending messages that recipients see instantly, without having 
to go through e-mail. While common enough on the Web, few messenger 
programs are compatible with others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft program was designed to allow messages to be sent  
to users of the popular AOL Instant Messenger System, or AIM. That 
aspect of the new software angered AOL, which late Thursday blocked 
MSN users from interacting with AIM users, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Microsoft said it had revised its program late  
Friday to get around the AOL block. But Dulles, Va.-based AOL 
responded within hours by issuing a second block, the Times said. 
The story also was reported today by The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine which AOL users are online, Microsoft's product  
enters AOL's servers in a way that the company says violates its 
copyrights and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among AOL's complaints is that Microsoft requires AOL users to  
enter their password, AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the new software as a key step in the  
ever-escalating battle among Internet companies to obtain Web 
traffic to help them sell advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	By designing its messaging service to work with AOL's system,  
Microsoft Network could position itself to draw more users to its 
Web site and keep them there longer, said Emily Meehan, an analyst 
with The Yankee Group research firm of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Sanford, MSN lead product manager, said Messenger was  
just one of the services MSN wanted to offer its users and wasn't 
directed towards competing with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just part of our continuing efforts to provide  
consumers with a place they can go to get information no matter 
where they are,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Juror Found Guilty of Taking Bribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Shortly after two reputed drug smugglers were  
acquitted, the trial jury's foreman and his family bought a 
$200,000 home in the Florida Keys, jewelry, furniture, vacations, 
season tickets to the Florida Marlins and a sports car. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday agreed with prosecutors who said the riches  
Miguel Moya suddenly had came from nearly $500,000 in bribes he 
took from defendants Augusto ``Willie'' Falcon and Salvador 
Magluta. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya was convicted of money laundering, witness tampering  
conspiracy, bribery, obstruction of justice and filing a false tax 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Thomas Sclafani said he planned to appeal the  
verdict. Moya faces a total of 138 years in prison at sentencing, 
which was set for Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Moya accepted money for his vote and for  
persuading the panel to acquit Falcon and Magluta. Not long after 
the acquittal, Moya's parents retired and began living in luxury, 
buying a home in the Florida Keys and taking a two-week vacation in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Moya family said the money came from cousin  
Ramon ``Ray'' Perez, a convicted drug smuggler and former Miami 
policeman. He testified he gave his relatives $485,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya's father, Jose, pleaded guilty to witness tampering and  
will be sentenced Sept. 24. Moya's mother, Rafaela, pleaded guilty 
to making a false statement to the FBI and was sentenced to one 
year probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Magluta, reputedly the top drug traffickers in the  
United States in the 1980s, were charged with smuggling 75 tons of 
cocaine from Colombia and making $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 1996 acquittal was an embarrassing defeat for federal  
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men are now imprisoned on lesser, unrelated charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors had deliberated for three days when they sent a note to  
the judge saying they were locked in a ``personal conflict'' and 
``could not reach a verdict.'' Hours later, they returned the 
acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second trial for Moya. His first ended in a  
mistrial in February after jurors deliberated for five days without 
reaching a verdict.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A motel maintenance man wanted for  
questioning in connection with the beheading death of a Yosemite 
National Park naturalist was arrested early today, according to a 
radio report. 
</P>
<P>
	KFBK radio reported that Cary Stayner, 38, was arrested in  
Wilton, Calif., southeast of Sacramento. Further details were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento County sheriff's officials would not confirm the  
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner disappeared after being interviewed Thursday by FBI  
agents, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. He works as a 
handyman at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, about four miles from 
where the woman's body was found Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers found the 26-year-old woman's body along a stream a few  
hundred yards from the park housing she shared with a man and 
woman, who were away at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The  
Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Brian Muller of the Mariposa County Sheriff's Department  
told the Chronicle on Friday that authorities were searching for 
Stayner and that sheriff's officials were to notify the FBI and 
Yosemite park police if he was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was initially reported missing by a friend she was  
due to visit in Sausalito, just north of San Francisco. Her loaded 
car was found outside her quarters, ready for the trip. The friend 
called Sausalito police to file the missing-persons report. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent James Maddock said ``a large, very large'' area was  
carefully searched Friday for clues. The search was to continue 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities do not believe the woman's death is related to those  
of three sightseers, who were last seen at the Cedar Lodge a month 
before their bodies were found in March, Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman worked at the Yosemite Institute, a nonprofit group  
that runs education programs through a partnership with the park 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was one of the finest naturalists and science teachers I  
ever met,'' said John Carlstroem, executive director of the 
Headlands Institute, the Yosemite Institute's sister campus.

<HEADLINE> Text of Eulogy for Lauren Bessette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the eulogy given by Dr. Jack Messina during the memorial  
service for Lauren Bessette. He is her uncle, the brother of her 
mother, Ann Freeman. 

</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette was born on Nov. 5, 1964, followed three minutes  
later by her twin sister, Lisa. Fifteen months later, Carolyn 
Bessette entered the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 16, 1999, two of these remarkable women, along with  
Carolyn's beloved husband, John Kennedy, unexpectedly left us. 
Their departure has left an enormous void in all our lives and has 
touched the lives of millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Carolyn and John were meaningfully eulogized by Hamilton  
South and Senator Ted Kennedy at yesterday's memorial service. It 
was no easy task for them to reflect on the lives of Carolyn and 
John within a limited time frame, and I find it equally daunting to 
share with you in the short time we have together the essence of my 
niece, Lauren, an enormously complex woman whom we all loved. 
</P>
<P>
	As I began to think of what I would say, it became clear that  
this could not be accomplished from just my perspective. Lauren's 
character and personality was so rich, vibrant and multifaceted 
that I turned to other family members to share their thoughts and 
feelings. From the children, Kristin, Matthew, Courtney, Kyle and 
the four Floyd 'Killer Bees' -- Brittney, Bobby, Billy and Buddy -- 
we collected these words'': 
</P>
<P>
	She fit into our kid world -- she was more like a friend and a  
sister than a grown-up. She was really fun. We remember the day she 
played miniature golf in the back yard in her pajamas and high 
heels. She knew so much about so many things and was always 
teaching us things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Her goddaughter told me she is saving every beautiful thing  
Lauren ever gave her so she can pass them on to her children. We 
are comforted in knowing that Lauren is still with the children in 
memory and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving on to her friends, I learned more about Lauren. They  
described her as someone always there to find that piece of elusive 
information that was wanted so desperately, to introduce them to 
the exact person they needed in their lives to say a good word when 
it was really needed and to always boost them up when things were 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren had a far-reaching spiritual side. She honored the  
beliefs of many religious heritages and was not above consulting 
Chinese fortunetellers. From a packet of angel cards recently given 
to her, a friend selected a few cards that captured the spirit and 
colors of Lauren -- strength, compassion, tenderness, adventure, 
beauty, courage, responsibility, power, abundance, enthusiasm, 
grace and love. 
</P>
<P>
	A close friend shared a few e-mail communications he had  
received from Lauren, and one so reflected her sense of humor that 
I felt compelled to share it. To put it mildly, Lauren was never 
much of a sports fan. Until recently, she had never attended a 
professional sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after attending her first prize fight, in typical  
Lauren fashion, she began to enthusiastically embrace all 
professional sports. She e-mailed the following: `I am now 
considering to be such an avid sports fan that the invitations just 
keep rolling in. Off to the Knicks game tonight and I can only 
imagine what tomorrow will bring. I am the envy of my male 
colleagues, all of who are extremely bitter, which naturally 
enhances my enjoyment of these events. Thanks again to the 
introduction to boxing.' Lauren's personality to a T. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren was an adoring grandchild. Her love for her Nana knew no  
bounds. I know she'll continue to keep a protective eye out for 
her. Lauren's mother, my sister Ann, reflected on the light and joy 
her daughter brought into her life. She was pleased with what 
Lauren accomplished professionally, but she was most proud of who 
she was and who she was becoming. She loved Lauren's sense of 
personal entitlement, the view she held of the world as her own and 
her ability to convince the world this was true. 
</P>
<P>
	To me, Lauren was fascinating as all the Bessette woman are and  
were. She was breathtakingly intelligent. Her intellect and sense 
of aesthetics allowed her to appreciate art, literature, opera, 
economics and world events. Everything was interesting to her. It 
was a marvel to be around her and see if you could catch up and 
keep up. Conversation with her was lightning-quick, broad-based, 
often irreverent, filled with repartee and always witty. Just 
listening to her I felt a sense of pride, a hope in the future 
because of our young people and maybe just a little bit old. 
</P>
<P>
	I can still see Lauren, tall and gracefully talking with those  
adorably quirky hand gestures. I see her tossing that long shiny 
hair and hear her laughter. I sense her vitality and her strength 
and her love. We shall miss her. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite our losses, our family's grateful to have Lisa with us.  
Like my other two nieces, she possesses the gifts of intelligence, 
wit, compassion and drive. We cherish her for those qualities that 
remind us of Lauren and Carolyn, but in particular for those that 
make her a unique and special individual in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
	If the events of these past eight days have taught us anything,  
it is to honor the moment. Cherish those around you. Try to find a 
balance between work and family. Contribute something to your 
community and above all, share the love you feel for others each 
and every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren loved opera, but her taste in music was eclectic. Amongst  
her favorite songs was ``She's a Rainbow'' by Mick Jagger. I now 
know why.

<HEADLINE> Public Bids JFK Jr. Final Goodbye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like thousands of others who waited outside the  
private memorial mass for John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy, Linda Simidian never met the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Which is why this is all so surreal,'' said Simidian, 37. ``I  
didn't know him. So why do I care so much that he's gone?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't have an answer; nor did many others. They just wanted  
the chance to say a final goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to be here today to support the family in their grief  
and to let them know they're not alone,'' said a tearful Julia 
Clegg Sansevere, 43, said Friday. She held a sign that read: 
``John, Carolyn and Lauren, Rest in peace with God in heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sansevere was a girl in Texas when President John F. Kennedy was  
killed. ``I felt like I lost a father, and now I've lost a 
brother,'' she cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, his wife, 33, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, 34,  
died July 16 when the single-engine plane Kennedy piloted crashed 
into the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard. Their cremated remains 
were committed to the ocean Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's memorial mass was by invitation only, but people from  
around the world flocked to Manhattan's Upper East Side for their 
own sense of closure and in support of the Kennedy family, to which 
they all felt connected. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the Queens mother who mourned the family JFK Jr. and  
his wife would never have; the nanny who once said hello to 
Jacqueline Onassis on a Manhattan street; the Harlem woman who 
shook hands more than three decades ago with Robert F. Kennedy; and 
Ms. Simidian, who had a poster of a young JFK Jr. in her college 
dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a couple of years older than me and I had a real  
crush on him,'' said Ms. Simidian, who came with her 5-year-old 
niece to the small gothic Church of St. Thomas More, where the mass 
was held. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Clark and her dog, Cocoa, came to honor Kennedy's uncle,  
Robert F. Kennedy, whose hand she shook during a campaign swing 
through Harlem 31 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good dude, a good guy,'' Clark said. ``He came to  
Harlem before anyone else and I've followed the Kennedys ever 
since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators were kept blocks from the church and couldn't see  
much. But that didn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to see anyone,'' said Jessica Rigul, 39, of  
Queens, who arrived hours before the service began. ``I just want 
to stay until I feel some peace inside of me for this tragedy. ... 
Here we are the same age, and I'm dropping my daughter off at 
summer school; he didn't even get the chance to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the week since his death, thousands have filed past the  
Kennedys loft apartment, leaving bouquets of flowers, poems, 
stuffed animals, heartbreaking letters and candles. A local charity 
picked up three vanloads and ``that didn't even touch the surface,' 
said Leslye Schneider, executive director of Variety-The Children's 
Charity. 
</P>
<P>
	A much smaller memorial appeared outside the church where the  
private service was held. A few summer bouquets of violet, red and 
yellow flowers, and a purple balloon, were left in a decorative 
railing about a half block away. 
</P>
<P>
	Tere Perez, who carried a homemade vase decorated with pictures  
of Kennedy, felt she had a real Kennedy connection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him playing football in Central Park a couple of times  
and once said hello to Mrs. Onassis on a Manhattan street. 
</P>
<P>
	``She smiled and waved at me,'' the 43-year-old nanny recalled.  
``This is just my way of paying my respects.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzales Sits After Jamming Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Texas outfielder Juan Gonzalez sat  
out of the Rangers' game at Tampa Bay on Saturday night after 
jamming his right wrist the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, hitting .310 with 25 homers and 85 RBIs, was hurt  
sliding into third base in the fourth inning of the Rangers' 11-8 
win Friday night against the Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's ready tomorrow (Sunday), fine,'' Texas manager Johnny  
Oates said. ``If not, hopefully he'll be ready for Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oates said pitcher Mike Morgan, who left Friday's game with a  
bruised right forearm after being hit by Bubba Trammell's line 
drive in the second, should make his next scheduled start Thursday. 
However, Oates did not completely rule out the right-hander missing 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, the Rangers recalled right-hander Jonathan  
Johnson from Triple-A Oklahoma and optioned right-hander Danny Kolb 
to the Pacific Coast League club.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Nears Tour de France Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FUTUROSCOPE, France (AP) -- With one stage to go, a final  
triumphant ride from Arpajon to the grand Champs-Elysees in Paris, 
the Tour de France all but belongs to American Lance Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan covered Saturday's 35-mile segment in 1 hour, 8  
minutes, 17 seconds -- 9 seconds ahead of Alex Zulle of Switzerland, 
who moved into second place in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong leads Zulle by a commanding 7 minutes, 37 seconds, and  
is 10 minutes, 26 seconds ahead of Fernando Escartin, who is third 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Sunday's 89 1/2-mile leg to go and his victory a near  
certainty, Armstrong had time to think about the reasons for his 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were two: He wanted to show cancer victims they  
can fight back and he wanted to make those who doubted him eat 
their words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty percent is for the cancer community,'' he said after  
winning his third straight time trial. ``Those who survive and 
those who aren't so fortunate. Twenty-five percent is for myself 
and my team, and 25 percent is for the people that didn't believe 
in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the 27-year-old cyclist learned he had testicular  
cancer that spread to his lungs and brain, requiring surgery and 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong made it clear at a news conference that he's still  
angry at those who thought he couldn't return to top-level cycling 
after his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know what team didn't believe in me,'' he said,  
referring to the French team, Cofidis. ``I don't want to name 
names, but they have always been in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When the world was listening, they said they wanted Lance  
Armstrong back in the Tour. Three months later they were breaking 
the contract. Now, Lance Armstrong is going to win the Tour de 
France,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said his current team, U.S. Postal, has done much to  
boost his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled an e-mail he received last year from team director  
Johan Bruyneel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It said: `I look forward to seeing you on the podium in Paris  
next year.' I thought he was crazy,'' Armstrong said. ``But he was 
passionate and that was infectious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to win the Tour,'' he added. ``It would have  
been a very different race if Alex Zulle hadn't lost six minutes in 
a crash on day two. But I will finish a happy man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to a crucial stage during which a number of  
riders crashed on a roadway that links a small island to the 
western coast of France. Zulle and a few other top riders were 
caught behind the crash and lost crucial minutes, essentially 
wrecking their chances. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning the 19th and penultimate stage, Armstrong looked as  
confident and dominant as he has throughout his amazing run. 
</P>
<P>
	As holder of the yellow jersey, he was last to ride, and after  
45 minutes, he overtook Escartin, who began three minutes before 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	With Armstrong already more than 6 minutes ahead before the  
start of this stage, the real battle was for the podium. Zulle's 
performance meant he leapt above Escartin into second place. 
</P>
<P>
	This stage of the three-week race was a flat ride around the  
science and technology park of Futuroscope in central France. 
Having ridden nearly 2,175 miles so far, the riders were drawing on 
their last reserves of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	They also had to withstand steamy conditions and a troublesome  
headwind at the start of the course. Early riders, who faced the 
strongest gusts, looked for shelter by cycling close to cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine weather brought out thousands of spectators, who watched  
the cyclists race through pretty medieval villages and winding 
streets with sharp, hairpin turns. 
</P>
<P>
	As suited the science-fiction park's theme, there was plenty of  
futuristic gear on show, especially the teardrop-shaped aerodynamic 
helmets.

<HEADLINE> Speeds Sizzle at Michigan Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Max Papis vividly remembers cruising  
around Michigan Speedway's 2-mile oval last year, watching most of 
the action go by him. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when there were a CART FedEx Series-record 62 lead  
changes, Papis was basically a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I was just running around and not having much  
fun,'' Papis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, after last July's U.S. 500, fellow Italian Alex Zanardi  
kidded Papis about how slow he was in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zanardi told me he thought I was running with two cars because  
he was passing me every 15 or 16 laps. I hope it won't be like that 
this year,'' Papis said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Papis was driving for Arciero-Wells, a team working  
hard to develop the Toyota engine and still well behind the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Papis is racing for Team Rahal, driving a Ford-powered  
Reynard and hoping to contend for a victory in Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Juan Montoya, who took over Zanardi's seat after he left  
for Formula One this season, was fast on Friday, the opening day of 
practice, turning a lap of 231.258 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Close behind were Mauricio Gugelmin at 230.740 and Papis at  
230.518. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked hard in testing here to get a comfortable car,''  
Papis said. ``It's completely different from what I have felt in 
the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting speeds like this can be somewhat disconcerting to the  
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like a video game at times out there at Michigan  
because things happens so slowly. That is, until you hit 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no less an authority than Mauricio Gugelmin, the driver who  
set the open-wheel qualifying record of 240.942, says CART's 
year-old Handford wing, an aerodynamic device that slows the cars 
down, is working very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I did 240, that was a great number; it was a great  
feeling,'' said Gugelmin, who set the record at California Speedway 
in the fall of 1997. ``But to do that all the time is pushing your 
luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winglike device, devised by Swift engineer Mark Handford,  
was used last year in both the U.S. 500 and the season-ending 
Marlboro 500 in California, slowing the cars by about 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you run on your own, it's almost boring, like running on  
rails,'' Gugelmin said. ``But, when you get other cars around you, 
you can have some big surprises, and that's not much fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti, a two-time Michigan winner, doesn't enjoy  
racing at Michigan Speedway, but not because of the sizzling 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to hold your breath all weekend here,'' said  
Andretti, who was 10th in practice at 228.964. ``The Handford 
Device makes it more like Talladega type racing. You have to rely 
on drafting more with this wing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who came to CART this season from the European Formula  
5000, a road-racing series, says the speeds on Michigan oval take 
some getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty exciting,'' the fearless 23-year-old Colombian  
said. ``The first time I drove here, I did about 40 laps in testing 
and that helped. I actually got a nice rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the two rookies who will race here on Sunday --  
Montoya and Cristiano da Matta of Brazil -- had the track all to 
themselves for the first 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was good because once the other cars got out there,  
everything changed,'' Montoya said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Nears Tour de France Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FUTUROSCOPE, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong captured his third  
straight time trial in the Tour de France today, and was on the 
brink of winning cycling's premier race with only Sunday's stage 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	The American covered the 35-mile run today in one hour, eight  
minutes, 17 seconds, which was nine seconds ahead of Alex Zulle of 
Switzerland, who advanced to second place in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong leads Zulle by 7 minutes, 37 seconds in the standings,  
and is 10 minutes, 26 seconds ahead of Fernando Escartin, third in 
the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Tyler Hamilton, took third place in today's  
stage, one minute, 35 seconds behind Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour ends Sunday with an 89 1/2-mile ride into Paris, and will  
wind up on the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his big lead, Armstrong remained cautious.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very very tired -- kaput!'' he said after the stage  
finished. ``Anything is still possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong made no mistakes during Friday's 18th stage, a run  
from Jonzac to Futuroscope, finishing 31st but protecting his 
overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The American who has made a remarkable recovering from  
testicular cancer, excels in time trials. He won races against the 
clock in the prologue and eighth stage, so he went into today full 
of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Following unsubstantiated drug accusations in some of the French  
media, he decided against appearing at postrace news conferences 
Thursday or Friday, but did receive backing from race director 
Jean-Marie Leblanc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did they express doubt about Miguel Indurain's five  
victories?'' Leblanc told the newspaper Le Figaro. ``Never! Did 
they interview him, even one day, with the same impudence with 
which they are questioning Armstrong? Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, with the information at my disposal, I find these  
accusations scandalous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong hasn't let the accusations get in the way of his bid  
to be the first American to win the race since Greg LeMond in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he took no chances, stayed safely in the pack and  
came in 31st, not losing a second of his lead of 6 minutes, 15 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tactic is to protect the yellow jersey from danger,'' said  
Johan Bruyneel, director of Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. 
``We're in an ideal situation, but we have to be careful there 
isn't an accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the perfect scenario play out here,'' he said. ``I  
couldn't have made it up myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, American fans have cheered him on. Penny Zim of  
Peoria, Ill., is in France on a cycling trip and likes what is 
happening to her sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a huge spread on cycling in the hometown paper,  
that's progress,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	French fans aren't as ebullient. Their countrymen haven't won a  
stage on this tour. The last time the French were shut out was in 
1926, and a Frenchman hasn't won the tour since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Jean-Cyril Robin came close Friday with a second-place  
finish, but it was Italy's Gianpaolo Mondini who won the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the riders pass from Bordeaux's wine country into  
cognac country. ``Cognac Loves Armstrong,'' read a banner in the 
town's main street. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief pause when workers from Cognac, angry at the  
multinational corporations they say are making huge profits off 
them, briefly disrupted the start of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cognac protesters were clearly race fans. They handed  
cups of brandy to drivers passing ahead of the cyclists -- in full 
view of smiling gendarmes.

<HEADLINE> Bessettes Memoralized in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Friends and family on Saturday  
remembered Lauren Bessette, the Kennedy plane crash victim the 
world knew least, as a brilliant daughter, a loving sister and a 
fun-loving aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still see Lauren, tall and graceful with those adorably  
quirky hand gestures,'' her uncle Dr. Jack Messina told about 400 
guests who attended a private candlelight service for the 
34-year-old investment banker and her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see her tossing that long shiny hair and hear her laughter.  
I sense her vitality and her strength and her love. We shall miss 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hour and a half long service, attended by many Kennedys, was  
a final, heartfelt farewell to the two sisters who perished with 
John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly, the candlelight service was held in the name of  
Lauren -- the ``other Bessette'' -- although prayers were also 
offered for Carolyn, 33 and John, 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Brilliant and beautiful, Lauren earned her business degree from  
the prestigious Wharton School of Business at the University of 
Pennsylvania. She rose rapidly in the world of international 
finance and worked for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York for 
eight years. She specialized in Asian investments and was based in 
Hong Kong until about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a good friend, a very dear friend,'' said Krista  
Trattnig, who studied Chinese with Lauren in Hong Kong and flew in 
from Austria for the service. What do you think when your friend 
dies?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would probably never have been buried at sea -- in a stately  
ceremony aboard a Navy destroyer with a folded American flag -- 
except for the fact that her glamorous 33-year-old sister had 
married a Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In tribute, and recognition, the Kennedy clan flocked to the  
service, described as ``tearful and joyful'' by the Rev. Rev. Hugh 
Tudor-Foley, one of three celebrants. Mourners included JFK Jr.'s 
sister Caroline Kennedy, uncle Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, aunts Ethel 
Kennedy and Jean Kennedy Smith, cousins Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 
Maryland's lieutenant governor, Douglas Kennedy, Maxwell Kennedy, 
Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo as well as Rory Kennedy and her 
fiance, Mark Bailey, whose wedding was postponed by the tragedy.

<P>
	Ann Freeman, the Bessette sisters' mother, and Dr. Richard  
Freeman, their stepfather arrived early, along with Lisa Ann. The 
parents attended a separate service for Kennedy and his wife in New 
York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The services included brief tributes from friends and hymns that  
reflected Lauren's love of opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their departure has left an enormous void in all our lives and  
has touched the lives of millions,'' Messina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Christ Church, people gathered to show support for the  
family, leaving bouquets and hand-written notes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Dall, a former high school classmate of Lauren's, placed  
flowers on a makeshift memorial. Although he hadn't seen her since 
they graduated from Greenwich High School in 1982, he felt 
compelled to pay his respects. ``We're here to show the family our 
hearts are with them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were beautiful people,'' said Idoline Kearns of  
Larchmont, NY, who arrived mid-afternoon with her husband, Richard. 
``We feel we have an obligation to sit here, three or four hours. 
We're here for both families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others reflected on the unspeakable sorrow of parents forced to  
bury two children at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``Devastating,'' said Chuck Morrell, the chief sexton of Christ  
Church, as he helped with preparations at the 90-year-old Gothic 
building earlier in the day. ``Two daughters who were living life 
to the full. No parent should have to bear such a loss,'' Morrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the arched red wooden doors, a hand-scribbled card lay  
beside a bouquet of carnations. 
</P>
<P>
	``John, Carolyn and Lauren,'' the note read. ``Our thoughts and  
prayers are with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to it, a bunch of wildflowers lay over a child's drawing of  
Winnie-the-Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, in a brief, poignant statement, the family  
said it had drawn comfort from the fact that Carolyn and John 
``will comfort Lauren for eternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement added, ``Nothing in life is preparation for the  
loss of a child.''

<HEADLINE> Reggae, Eulogies for JFK. Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The memorial Mass for John F. Kennedy Jr. and  
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy included an eclectic mix of readings and 
music, ranging from Shakespeare to a reggae anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were not admitted, but mourners said the ceremony, at  
the Church of St. Thomas More in Manhattan, opened with the hymn 
``All Creatures of our God and King.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other songs performed by the O Freedom Gospel Choir included  
``On Eagle's Wings,'' ``Forever Young'' and a rendition of ``Swing 
Low, Sweet Chariot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean sang the reggae anthem ``Many Rivers  
to Cross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy's mother, Ann Freeman, read from Henry Scott  
Holland's meditation ``Facts of Faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though it was not known which part she read, the piece includes  
this passage: ``Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have 
only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened. 
Everything remains exactly as it was. I am, and you are, and the 
old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. 
... I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, 
just around the corner. All is well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy, read from Act IV, Scene 1 of  
Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mass was celebrated by the Rev. Charles J. O'Byrne, the Rev.  
John Boehning and Monsignor George F. Bardes. O'Byrne married JFK 
Jr. and Carolyn in 1996 at a clandestine ceremony off the coast of 
Georgia and presided over their burial at sea Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Nears Tour de France Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FUTUROSCOPE, France (AP) -- With one stage to go, a final  
triumphant ride from Arpajon to the grand Champs-Elysees in Paris, 
the Tour de France all but belongs to American Lance Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan covered Saturday's 35-mile segment in 1 hour, 8  
minutes, 17 seconds -- 9 seconds ahead of Alex Zulle of Switzerland, 
who moved into second place in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong leads Zulle by a commanding 7 minutes, 37 seconds, and  
is 10 minutes, 26 seconds ahead of Fernando Escartin, who is third 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	With only Sunday's 89 1/2-mile leg to go and his victory a near  
certainty, Armstrong had time to think about the reasons for his 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were two: He wanted to show cancer victims they  
can fight back and he wanted to make those who doubted him eat 
their words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty percent is for the cancer community,'' he said after  
winning his third straight time trial. ``Those who survive and 
those who aren't so fortunate. Twenty-five percent is for myself 
and my team, and 25 percent is for the people that didn't believe 
in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the 27-year-old cyclist learned he had testicular  
cancer that spread to his lungs and brain, requiring surgery and 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong made it clear at a news conference that he's still  
angry at those who thought he couldn't return to top-level cycling 
after his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know what team didn't believe in me,'' he said,  
referring to the French team, Cofidis. ``I don't want to name 
names, but they have always been in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When the world was listening, they said they wanted Lance  
Armstrong back in the Tour. Three months later they were breaking 
the contract. Now, Lance Armstrong is going to win the Tour de 
France,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said his current team, U.S. Postal, has done much to  
boost his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled an e-mail he received last year from team director  
Johan Bruyneel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It said: `I look forward to seeing you on the podium in Paris  
next year.' I thought he was crazy,'' Armstrong said. ``But he was 
passionate and that was infectious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to win the Tour,'' he added. ``It would have  
been a very different race if Alex Zulle hadn't lost six minutes in 
a crash on day two. But I will finish a happy man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to a crucial stage during which a number of  
riders crashed on a roadway that links a small island to the 
western coast of France. Zulle and a few other top riders were 
caught behind the crash and lost crucial minutes, essentially 
wrecking their chances. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning the 19th and penultimate stage, Armstrong looked as  
confident and dominant as he has throughout his amazing run. 
</P>
<P>
	As holder of the yellow jersey, he was last to ride, and after  
45 minutes, he overtook Escartin, who began three minutes before 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	With Armstrong already more than 6 minutes ahead before the  
start of this stage, the real battle was for the podium. Zulle's 
performance meant he leapt above Escartin into second place. 
</P>
<P>
	This stage of the three-week race was a flat ride around the  
science and technology park of Futuroscope in central France. 
Having ridden nearly 2,175 miles so far, the riders were drawing on 
their last reserves of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	They also had to withstand steamy conditions and a troublesome  
headwind at the start of the course. Early riders, who faced the 
strongest gusts, looked for shelter by cycling close to cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine weather brought out thousands of spectators, who watched  
the cyclists race through pretty medieval villages and winding 
streets with sharp, hairpin turns. 
</P>
<P>
	As suited the science-fiction park's theme, there was plenty of  
futuristic gear on show, especially the teardrop-shaped aerodynamic 
helmets.

<HEADLINE> Man in Custody for Decapitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A motel maintenance man  
was detained for questioning Saturday in the decapitation of a 
naturalist in Yosemite National Park, and the FBI hinted at a 
possible link with the slaying of three park sightseers earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, was taken into custody by federal authorities  
Saturday morning at a nudist colony in Wilton, Calif., near 
Sacramento, said a Sacramento County source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. Stayner was last seen Thursday night by friends and 
coworkers at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, a community at the 
western edge of the park where he works as a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
	Park rangers on Thursday found the body of 26-year-old Joie Ruth  
Armstrong about four miles from Cedar Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	James Maddock, FBI agent in charge, confirmed at a news  
conference Saturday that someone had been detained in connection 
with the case, but would not identify who it was or provide further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said no arrests had been made but he anticipated a  
``significant announcement'' to be made at a news conference Sunday 
at Sacramento's FBI headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	He also backed off of a statement he made Friday that there was  
no evidence linking this case the slayings earlier this year of 
three Yosemite sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to comment on whether there is a link at this  
time,'' he said. ``In the last 24 hours I have received additional 
information that may cause me to modify my statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on the matter further.  
</P>
<P>
	Patty Sailors, whose husband manages the Laguna Del Sol  
clothing-optional resort, said a man identifying himself as Stayner 
checked in Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A visitor recognized Stayner from news reports and called the  
FBI, Mrs. Sailors said. Stayner, who was not a member of the resort 
but had visited there several times, was taken into custody about 9 
a.m., she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is the brother of Steven Stayner, a kidnap victim who  
made national headlines in 1980 after he escaped from Kenneth 
Parnell, a convicted child molester. Steven Stayner, who was held 
and sexually abused for seven years, died in a 1989 motorcycle 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Delbert Stayner, Steven and Cary's father, told the San  
Francisco Chronicle that he's sure his son was not directly 
involved in the woman's death, but worries that he may have been a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``My little boy Stevie Stayner went missing for seven and a half  
years. ... Now my oldest son is missing. I'm kind of torn up over 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Armstrong was discovered a few hundred yards from  
the park housing she shared with a man and woman, who were away at 
the time. A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
told The Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was initially reported overdue by a friend she was  
driving to visit in Sausalito, just north of San Francisco. She was 
last seen alive Wednesday at the park offices of Yosemite 
Institute, where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was a dedicated educator who was beloved among  
children, said institute director Mike Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joie was a bright light to all who knew her,'' Lee said at the  
FBI's news conference Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said there was no indication that the victim knew the  
person who was detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Hanson, who works rents bicycles in Yosemite's Curry  
Village, said Armstrong was concerned about someone stalking her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very uncomfortable,'' Hanson said. ``I didn't know the  
guy. She just said there was this person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yosemite Institute's main offices are in El Portal, and the  
organization has held conferences at the Cedar Lodge and takes 
groups there to eat before heading to the park. 
</P>
<P>
	El Portal is the town where Eureka residents Carole Sund, her  
daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso of Argentina were 
last seen alive in February during a sightseeing trip. Their bodies 
were found a month later. No one has been charged in connection 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The three sightseers stayed at the Cedar Lodge, where Stayner  
rents a room above the restaurant. He did not work at the lodge at 
the time the women vanished. El Portal is about 190 miles southeast 
of Sacramento.

<HEADLINE> On a Soapbox Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New York (AP) -- Jerry Bailey continued his recent domination of  
Belmont Park's $350,000 Coaching Club American Oaks when he rode On 
a Soapbox to a 4 1/4 length victory in Saturday's 83rd running of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time in its last four runnings that Bailey rode  
the CCAO winner. He took the 1996 running aboard My Flag, then 
guided Banshee Breeze to her victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in three starts this year for On a  
Soapbox, a daughter of Mi Cielo from the Stage Door Johnny mare, 
Makin a Statement. It was also her first stakes win in six lifetime 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	On a Soapbox covered 1 1/2 miles in 2:29:1 on the fast track to  
earn $210,000 and return $11.80, $3.20 and $2.10. Dreams Gallore 
paid $2.30 and $2.10 and Strolling Belle was $2.10 to show.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, AOL Battle Over Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The latest battle between Microsoft Corp. and  
America Online is shaping up over software allowing instantaneous 
message exchanges. And there's a twist: This time it's Microsoft 
that's pushing for an industry standard while AOL is trying to 
maintain its proprietary dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging -- which is as immediate as a phone  
conversation -- is fast becoming one of the hottest ways to 
communicate on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's version, AIM, is currently provided to the company's 17  
million subscribers and also is offered free to other Internet 
users who can download it from the AOL Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	AIM and ICQ (as in ``I seek you''), another instant message  
service AOL bought for $235 million last year, have a combined 80 
million users. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the computer industry have asked AOL to make its instant  
messaging technology an ``open standard'' which would allow other 
companies to write software that would interface with the AOL 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The company so far has refused, mostly for economic reasons,  
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, AOL pretty much owns the instant message service,''  
said Rob Enderle, an electronic communications consultant with Giga 
Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Thursday, Microsoft released MSN Messenger Service,  
which offered instant messaging with AIM users via the Microsoft 
Network site. 
</P>
<P>
	That allowed any Internet user to get a free Hotmail account and  
a free AIM account for instant messaging through MSN or AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike AIM, MSN Messenger carries no advertising and has no  
immediate plans for any, but there is room for ads in the MSN 
window, said Deanna Sanford, a lead products manager in MSN's 
marketing division. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first day of its release, the software was downloaded by  
200,000 users, second only to the 202,000 downloads of Internet 
Explorer 5.0 on the Web browser's release day, Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL electronically blocked Microsoft's program but MSN posted a  
revised version. AOL retaliated with another block on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of midday Saturday, Sanford said Microsoft's latest revision  
was getting around the AOL blocks again. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL officials did not return messages left at their homes and  
offices Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill said that to  
determine which AOL users are online, the Microsoft product enters 
AOL's servers in a way that violates its copyrights and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	She also noted that Microsoft requires AOL users to enter their  
screen name and password. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford denied any wrongdoing or privacy risk, saying the screen  
name and password are not retained in Microsoft server computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is among about 40 companies -- AOL not among them --  
that proposed a standard within the Internet Engineering Task Force 
about two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Birth Control Program Goes National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Drug-addicted women are being offered $200 to get  
sterilized or use long-term birth control under a controversial 
program that is gaining momentum in several cities across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``IF YOU ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS get birth control -- get $200  
cash. Stop the cycle of addicted newborns now!'' read two 
billboards in Chicago, where social worker Lyle Keller is trying to 
establish the program known as CRACK, Children Requiring a Caring 
Kommunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called the Anaheim, Calif.-based program  
short-sighted, racist and a source of drug money for users. But 
founder Barbara Harris calls it a response to a system that often 
fails to punish women who give birth to drug-addicted babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe that these women are able to stop by the local  
hospital yearly, drop off a damaged baby and walk away,'' Ms. 
Harris, who has adopted four children born with cocaine in their 
systems, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	To get the cash, women must have a form signed by doctor  
detailing the form of birth control they are using. CRACK does not 
pay for the procedures, but Ms. Harris said they often are covered 
by state-funded health-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the acceptable forms of long-term birth control are  
Norplant, which are capsules that are inserted under the skin in 
the upper arm, and the IUD, or intrauterinve device. Tube-tying is 
the most controversial method because it is not always reversible. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, CRACK has paid $200 each to 57 California women who  
had given birth a total of 262 times. Ms. Harris said some men have 
inquired about vasectomies but never followed through. 
</P>
<P>
	CRACK gets funding from private donations. Among Ms. Harris'  
financial backers is Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the tough-talking 
radio host who pushes personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is catching on in Chicago, Minneapolis, Fort Pierce,  
Fla., and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller, who is using his own money to advertise the campaign  
with fliers and billboards in Chicago, said he has received two 
responses so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trombley, president of Planned Parenthood in Chicago, who  
calls the program a form of bribery, said he doubts most addicts 
have the judgment to make such a big decision. 
</P>
<P>
	And Constance Jackson, president of Altgeld Health Clinic, which  
serves poor patients on Chicago's South Side, questioned whether a 
program like CRACK would be gaining momentum if most drug-addicted 
babies were white. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at adoptions,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``White babies are more  
precious than platinum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harris, who is white, countered that most of the mothers who  
have been paid in California are white. ``Race shouldn't even be 
the issue,'' she said. ``It's about child abuse -- and black babies 
matter, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Adams, 38, is one of the California mothers who decided  
to have her tubes tied -- in her case, after having her 14th child. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured it was about time to do it, and the $200 motivated  
it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now drug-free for two years, she is working as a pizza delivery  
driver, caring for one of her children and trying to regain custody 
of two others. Four of her children died because of complications 
caused by drugs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harris does not deny some mothers will simply use the  
payment to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they're already going to find the money for drugs  
anyway,'' she said. ``That's one less person to rob or a few less 
tricks to turn.''

<HEADLINE> Page Retains WBA Welterweight Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- James Page successfully defended his WBA  
welterweight title for the third time by knocking out of Freddie 
Pendleton in the 11th round of their scheduled 12-round bout 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first boxing card held at the Flamingo Hilton.  
</P>
<P>
	Page, 25-3 with 19 knockouts, punished Pendleton early in the  
11th round with a left to the body. The final blow was a right 
uppercut and left hook to Pendleton's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``My jab is one of my best punches,'' Page said. ``If I use my  
jab, I can beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pendleton, meantime, hurt Page in the ninth with a looping right  
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to try to let him show how tough I was and I got hit  
with a big right hand. I was stunned,'' Page said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the strongest boxer I've faced,'' said Pendleton, who is  
44-24-4 with 32 knockouts. ``He's nothing but pure power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another bout, Terron Millett retained his IBF junior  
welterweight title when he stopped Virgil McClendon at 1:50 of the 
final round of their scheduled 12-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Millett used a barrage of punches in the final round and referee  
Richard Steele stopped the fight at 1:50 of the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Millett improved to 22-1-1 with 17 knockouts in his first title  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	McClendon, 21-2 with eight knockouts, staggered Millett in the  
second round and had the champion in trouble again in the third.

<HEADLINE> FBI Cancels Headquarters Tours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI halted the popular public tours of its  
headquarters building Friday for an indefinite period in response 
to an unconfirmed, nonspecific threat against bureau facilities in 
this city, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC News reported that the threat concerned possible terrorist  
attacks by followers of Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Islamic 
radical who is charged in this country with masterminding last 
August's bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that 
killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials, requesting anonymity, would say only  
that ``recent events suggest it's fairly evident Bin Laden's 
followers would be the prime suspects.'' 
</P>

	FBI spokesman Tron Brekke said the tours, now taken annually by  
250,000 people, would be suspended ``indefinitely, until we can do 
a security assessment to ensure the safety of our employees and 
tourists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a threat against FBI facilities in Washington,  
D.C.,'' Brekke said. But he added the threat is ``nonspecific and 
uncorroborated,'' that is, no specific target was identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, we have to take it seriously,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The threat was not conveyed directly to the government by  
letter, telephone call or other communication, Brekke said. Rather 
it was discovered by intelligence means. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began opening its headquarters to public tours in 1937  
when the bureau occupied part of the Justice Department building on 
Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, the tours moved across the street to the new FBI  
headquarters in the J. Edgar Hoover Building. The tours are 
highlighted by agents demonstrating the firing of a submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
	People on the tour also get to see, through glass partitions,  
the FBI laboratory.

<HEADLINE> Report: Japanese Bankers Hid Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Former executives of a failed Japanese bank said  
they hid huge losses to try to make it look like a government 
bailout was working, Kyodo News agency reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. executives, including the former  
chairmen and president, were arrested Friday on suspicion of 
covering up more than $830 million in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives claimed they concealed the problem to avoid  
having to report that the bank had lost money for a third straight 
year, Kyodo said, citing unidentified sources close to the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives said another year of massive losses would have  
shown that a plan by the Ministry of Finance to make the bank 
healthy had failed, Kyodo reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the ministry pressed other financial institutions  
to pitch in $2.1 billion in emergency loans and gave $500 million 
in taxpayers' money in an effort to keep the bank afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Phones rang unanswered at the bank and at prosecutors' offices  
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run broadcaster NHK said Friday the investigation could  
spread to the Finance Ministry, which allegedly knew the bank was 
not disclosing the full extent of its problems but took no steps 
out of fear of provoking a collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests at NCB came a month after prosecutors arrested three  
former top executives of another failed lender, the Long-Term 
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks were taken over by the government last year after  
regulators determined they were insolvent.
