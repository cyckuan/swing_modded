EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE ANATOMY OF A COLOMBIAN TERROR ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colombians have every reason to believe the worst about their
largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC. It has profited from the drug trade and killed
civilians. The group often kidnaps the wealthy and kills those who
will not pay. So most Colombians had little reason to doubt the
government claim that the FARC was behind an especially horrible
extortion and bombing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn on May 15, armed men broke into Elvia Cortes' house
in a rural area 50 miles north of Bogota and demanded the
equivalent of $7,500. They placed a collar around her neck and told
her that if she did not pay, it would explode. Bomb-disposal
experts worked for hours to defuse the device. It exploded,
decapitating Cortes and killing a local technician.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Colombia's police, military and government,
including President Andres Pastrana, immediately blamed the FARC.
Police photographs of a desolate Cortes, wearing pearl earrings and
the terrifying collar, ran in newspapers all over the world, often
with captions identifying the FARC as responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb's political effects have been significant. Pastrana
canceled an important session of the government's peace talks with
the FARC. Colombians' revulsion at the bomb has led many to
conclude that the government should not be trying to make peace
with the FARC. The bombing provided a chance for journalists and
editorialists in Colombia and the United States to revisit the
FARC's crimes, and to endorse, with graphic and emotional urgency,
a military aid package for Colombia now before the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Colombian government changed its mind. On May 31,
Attorney General Alfonso Gomez said it was increasingly clear that
the FARC was not responsible for the crime, a statement echoed by
other officials. There has been an arrest, reportedly of a family
member of a neighbor who had a personal dispute with Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   Since war has existed, combatants have sought to invest
atrocities with a politically convenient interpretation. They can
use the pressures of a wartime climate and journalists' conventions
about what is news to manipulate coverage. The effects of the spin
often remain after it has been discredited _ as it was in the case
of Elvia Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the government had changed its view were not
featured prominently, even in Colombia. The reversal was gradual
and deliberately undramatic. Moreover, Colombian reporters work in
a climate of political pressure and personal risk. Many of the
nation's better journalists are in exile. The FARC's exoneration
was not reported by some U.S. newspapers that had published news
accounts about the incident or editorials blaming the group. Three
days after the attack, The Los Angeles Times ran a passionate
editorial detailing the crime, condemning the FARC and arguing for
military aid. ``A FARC spokesman denied responsibility, but that's
hard to believe,'' the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the bombing, Pastrana suspended a meeting in
which the government, FARC and ambassadors from most members of the
European Union were going to examine peasant coca production. The
FARC's goal was to persuade the Europeans not to back fumigation.
Since coca cultivation in FARC-controlled territory is one of the
main justifications for Washington's military aid package, the
meeting was important and controversial. It still has not been
rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which has increasingly distanced
itself from the peace process in Colombia, supported Pastrana's
decision. ``These barbaric acts have to cease'' if the rebels are
serious about peace, Richard Boucher, the State Department
spokesman, said on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's war has a long history of crimes that were not what
they seemed. When the FARC murdered three U.S. environmentalists
last year, the guerrillas first accused the right. On the other
side, the guerrillas were wrongly accused of murdering a prominent
conservative politician, Alvaro Gomez, in 1995. Eventually military
men with ties to the right-wing paramilitaries were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Acts of war in Colombia today are carried out for the hearts and
minds of not only Colombian peasants, but also Bogota's burghers
and the U. S. Congress. Those who immediately concluded that the
guerrillas were at fault may have lent their services to a
distortion of fact that could reverberate in Colombia, and
Washington, for years to come.

GORE'S PLAN WILL OFFER VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS TO SOME
TAXPAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ky.) (DELETES ``refundable'' from 5th graf)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore plans in a speech on Tuesday
to propose a $200 billion program to help low- and middle-income
taxpayers build retirement accounts separate from what they will
receive from Social Security, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Gore aides, the program would work the way
401(k) savings plans work, but instead of employer contributions,
the federal government would make contributions in the form of tax
credits, providing in some cases up to a 3-to-1 match.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``retirement savings plus,'' the plan would offer tax
relief for couples with combined annual incomes of up to $100,000,
or individuals making up to $50,000. Gore's program would provide
the greatest benefit for couples with incomes of less than $30,000.
The program would cost the government $200 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary program, designed to compete with Gov. George W.
Bush's proposal for individuals to invest an unspecified portion of
their Social Security payroll tax in the stock market, would create
a fund for each participant that could expand by a maximum of
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple making up to $30,000 a year could contribute up
to $500 annually. They would then receive a tax credit of $1,500,
bringing their account to $2,000. A couple making $100,000 could
contribute $1,500 to their account and earn a tax credit of $500.
</P>
<P>
   Like IRAs and 401(k) plans, contributions to the accounts would
be tax deducible, accounts would grow tax-free and withdrawals
would be taxed. Private financial institutions would manage the
accounts. According to Gore aides, participation in the program
over 35 years of work would yield an individual about $200,000 for
retirement over and above Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does two things that Gore had earlier criticized in
the plan offered by his Republican rival. One, it allows people to
invest taxpayer money in the stock market through the account
managers. Two, it substantially increases the amount of the federal
budget surplus that Gore would devote to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been fiercely critical of Bush for
devoting 1.3 trillion dollars of the surplus to an across-the-board
income tax cut over 10 years. But now, with this new savings plan,
Gore's total of targeted tax cuts clocks in at $500 billion over 10
years, twice what he had proposed before, and half of Bush's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers, in interviews Sunday, said that the Gore plan is
a hedge against what they see as the risky alternative that Bush is
proposing. They said financial institutions would be limited to
offering investment options based on broad-based mutual funds for
equities, bonds and government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore intends to lay out the plan in a speech on Tuesday in
Lexington, Ky. The speech comes at the beginning of the second week
of his three-week ``progress and prosperity tour'' (sometimes
called the ``prosperity and progress tour'' by Gore) in which he is
traveling to key battleground states to try to get credit for the
nation's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement plan is a vivid example of how Gore is trying to
take advantage of the burgeoning federal budget surplus by spending
it on targeted groups of voters whom he needs to win over in
November _ in this case, low-income and middle-income working
families, the core Democratic base that polls have indicated are
slipping from Gore's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Gore's proposal revealed a weakening of his
stance against putting taxpayer money in the financial markets and
would thus contribute to an overall impression of Gore as someone
without reliable core values.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week the vice president will flip flop flip by coming out
for the use of tax money to be invested in the market to help
people retire,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's campaign spokesman.
``It's his third position in six months on the soundness of using
tax money to invest in markets to secure people's retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer pointed to the Clinton administration's now abandoned
position laid out in this year's budget proposal to allow
government-controlled investments in the markets, and then to a
Gore speech in May when he criticized Bush's plan to allow people
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing this to blunt Governor Bush's approach to allow
people to invest in the markets to help them retire with more
money,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer was talking about Gore's retirement plan, but he was
not the only one suggesting Sunday that Gore was perhaps going
through multiple reinventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new campaign chairman, William Daley, the commerce
secretary, made the rounds of the television talk shows Sunday and
was asked repeatedly about the vice president's continually
evolving personas.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Russert posed the question on the NBC program ``Meet The
Press'': ``Fairly or unfairly, there's a perception that Al Gore
has changed positions on abortion, on gun control, Elian Gonzalez,
wearing earth tones, wearing sports shirts, wearing coats and ties,
changing campaign chairmen, moving from Washington to Nashville,
suddenly in favor of a $500 billion tax cut _ that Gore has no
center, that he flips and panders as a politician. Is that a
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Daley replied, ``There's a problem because those are all
misconceptions that have been developed by either the opposition or
by media who aren't really following this day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The fact of the matter is, Al Gore has been
consistent about working for the average man and woman out there
and trying to address their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor has been tepid lately toward Gore, both for
his support for a bill to make normal trade relations permanent
with China and for naming Daley as his chairman to replace the
ailing Tony Coelho. Daley led the administration's fight on Capitol
Hill to pass the trade bill, which labor vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Sunday that he had talked with several labor leaders
over the last few days, including John Sweeney, president of the
AFL-CIO, who met with Gore on Friday to complain about the Daley
appointment. Daley suggested his talks with labor leaders had been
fruitful and said he expected to meet with Sweeney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other Gore aides spent the day briefing reporters on the
retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   They said that while the chief goal of the plan would be to
provide a cushion for retirement nest eggs, participants could
withdraw their savings at any time without penalty for three
specific purposes: to cover catastrophic health expenses, to help
buy a first home, or to pay for a child's college education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan would encourage the rate of personal
savings, which has plunged to more than half the previous total
over the last decade. And they said that at a rate of return of 5.3
percent, an account for an individual could grow to $202,000 over
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that the program would be simplified by
having the Internal Revenue Service create a mechanism to deposit
people's tax credit and a share of their tax refunds directly into
the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' according to briefing paper prepared by the Gore
campaign, ``with a simple check-off on your tax return, workers
could see up to $2,000 each deposited in the `retirement savings
plus' each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan is based on the universal savings accounts
proposed in the 1999 State of the Union address by President
Clinton, a complex proposal that never made it through Congress.

UNARMED RED SOX PUNCHED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Long after Sunday's 5-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays,
the door to manager Jimy Williams's office remained closed. Team
medical director Arthur Pappas, trainer Jim Rowe, pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan, and vice president of baseball operations Mike Port
were all inside. Meanwhile, the pitcher whose immediate future they
were discussing lingered just outside.
</P>
<P>
   Was Jeff Fassero awaiting word about whether he was being placed
on the disabled list?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm just waiting for (a clubhouse attendant) to get the
umbrella from my golf bag,'' Fassero said. ``It's spitting pretty
good out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was obviously more going on than just pillow talk
regarding Fassero. He said he hurt his neck sleeping badly because
of an oversized pillow in his Atlanta hotel room last weekend,
flip-flopped turns with Pete Schourek, then complained of no
strength in his arm while lasting just two innings Sunday against
the Blue Jays, his shortest start of the season. Fassero had no
explanation for what he called a ``dead arm,'' but the word in the
Toronto clubhouse was that Fassero's back was bothering him.
</P>
<P>
   While Fassero said he would be surprised to go on the DL, he
conceded that he might have to miss a start. ``It's a wait-and- see
thing,'' he said. ``For sure, I don't want to, but I don't want
what happened today to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the Red Sox, who didn't score until they were down to
their last out in the rubber match of this three-game set with the
Blue Jays and who remain in first place only by default, as the
Yankees are matching them loss for loss. The Yankees, who come in
Monday night after being swept in a four-game series at home by the
White Sox, remain a half-game back in the AL East. The Blue Jays,
four games over .500 for the first time this season, closed to
within a game of the top and can look forward to playing the Sox
again next weekend in SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Eight pitches into the game, the Sox were down, 3-0, as the Blue
Jays went bloop single, bunt single, and Raul Mondesi's 14th home
run into the left-field screen to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight game in which a Blue Jay had homered
in the first inning. Mondesi, who later homered off Rheal Cormier
in the eighth for the final Toronto run, hit a two-run home run off
Schourek Friday night, and Tony Batista took Ramon Martinez deep
for a three-run home run Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When Brad Fullmer, a lefthanded hitter, pounded a fastball into
the right-field stands leading off the second, it was 4-0 and
Hipolito Pichardo was taking off his jacket in the bullpen. When
the Sox came out for the third, Fassero remained in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't right,'' Williams said. ``I thought it better to
take him out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been placing early calls to the bullpen with
alarming frequency. In the last 11 games, nine have been started by
pitchers other than Pedro Martinez. In all but one, Sox starters
have failed to make it into the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Blue Jays, who have now homered in a club-record 17
straight games, starters Schourek, Ramon Martinez, and Fassero
stuck around for a total of only 8 2/3 innings. But that was
sufficient time for the Blue Jays to inflict some serious damage:
20 hits, 15 earned runs, 6 walks, 4 home runs. That comes out to an
earned run average of 15.58.
</P>
<P>
   Can Sammy Sosa pitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pitch,'' said Williams when asked if he might consider
some alterations in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids put us in the particular position we're in. Hang
with 'em. Believe in 'em. They can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have physical ailments, that's a different story. But
as long as they are healthy and feel good about themselves, I'm
putting them out there every fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   Another superb job by the Sox' pen _ Mondesi's home run off
Cormier was one of just three hits allowed in seven innings by
Pichardo, Rich Garces, Cormier, and Rod Beck _ gave a sellout crowd
of 32,925 a reason to endure the raindrops that came with greater
insistence in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox were held to just three hits in seven scoreless
innings by journeyman Frank Castillo, who in three previous starts
against the Sox had been cuffed around for 13 runs in 13 innings.
They didn't advance a runner to third until they loaded the bases
against reliever Paul Quantrill in the ninth, and didn't score
until Scott Hatteberg delivered a pinch single off closer Billy
Koch.
</P>
<P>
   But Koch induced Jose Offerman to tap into a force play to end
the game, and the Sox were left to ponder the meaning of losing
their fourth straight series at home, not counting Pedro's mastery
of Cleveland in that rain-made, one-night stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to keep playing,'' Williams said. ``You fight through
this, keep going. You don't drop your head. Nobody's going to feel
sorry for you.''
</P>

WILL TIGER EVER BE SATISFIED? 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ What's really frightening is that you
know he's not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Do me a favor. Spread your hands about 6 inches apart. That's
the approximate cumulative distance of six shots that constituted
the difference between Tiger Woods's bogey-free 67 in the final
round of the US Open Sunday and a round of 64 or so. If he had made
only half of those shots, there's your 7 under. And it wasn't too
far back in his mind, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible, but not too realistic, to go out there and
shoot 10 under par,'' he said, wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Book this, here and now. Tiger Woods will shoot that 61 in a
major. Nothing that has ever been said about the limitations that
apply to every other golfer who has ever lived applies to Tiger
Woods. He is a relentless, single-minded, magnificently talented
workaholic who will simply not be stopped. He was raised to be the
greatest golfer of all-time and he will fulfill his promise.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me as he walked up the fabled 18th at Pebble
Beach Sunday that even Tiger Woods might take pains to savor a
moment such as this, because even Tiger Woods is unlikely to stride
up the fairway on the 72d hole of a US Open with a 15-stroke lead
more than once in his career. Then I thought about the putt that
stopped about an eighth of an inch in front of the hole on No. 3,
the bunker shot that came verrry close to holing out on 17, and the
very makable birdie putts that just slid tantalizingly to the left
on 1, 2, 8, or maybe one or two others that could just as easily
have gone in as not and I realized that it is foolish to make any
such assumptions when the person in question is the most supremely
gifted human being ever to participate in this particular form of
human endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   He won this Open by 15, yeah. Oh, I understand the millimeter
nature of this game well enough, but it doesn't change the fact
that under only slightly different circumstances he could easily
have won it by 20, and that's without even factoring in the
aberrational triple bogey he took at No. 3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Tiger allowed himself a moment of satisfaction
on No. 18. It was, he said, after he deposited his 4-iron on the
fairway that he allowed the fact that he really was going to win
this tournament to sink in. Incidentally, Tiger's club selection
did not meet with the overwhelming approval of gallery members
assembled along the right side of the hole, right in front of
Padres owner John Moores's new ostentatious mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting three hours,'' wailed one fellow. ``I want
to see a wood come out of that bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' advised his companion. ``He didn't go to Stanford for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of the driver he hit into the rocks Saturday was all
Tiger needed to go into a play-it-safe mode on 18. He wasn't going
to stain what had been, by his own admission, a fairly wonderful
afternoon of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Had he gone out and shot a reasonably efficient 72 or 73, his
image would not have been tarnished in the slightest. But that's
not the Tiger way. Tiger had a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a day of golf with no bogeys,'' he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   In order to accomplish that goal, he only needed three
par-saving putts, the best of which was a 15-footer on No. 16.
``That was one of the biggest highlights of the day,'' he beamed.
``I had worked so hard all day to avoid bogeys, and to make that
felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the record, or records, that motivated him. To this
moment, he probably doesn't have a full grasp of everything he
accomplished during this blissful week of golf. He went out Sunday
to play golf properly for golf's sake, to build on his first three
days with yet another demonstration of total golf. He did exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else in the 156-man field either flat-out stunk or
fluctuated severely in an attempt to tame Pebble Beach. The other
nine men in the top 10 had a cumulative total of nine subpar
rounds. Tiger was under par three times and even par once. John
Huston was the only other man to submit two subpar rounds and in
between he spit out a 75 and a 76.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, Pebble Beach was a classic US Open course,
intimidating and downright unneighborly. For Tiger Woods, Pebble
Beach was a moderate challenge, but little more. Narrow fairways,
firm greens, menacing rough, wind, fog, famine, pestilence,
locusts, photographers, the moneyed scent of all those RRWPs (Rich
Retired White People) walking around. All these had an effect on
155 of the 156 competitors. Some very legitimate people had trouble
breaking 80. Tiger was 12 under.
</P>
<P>
   This is what can, and will, happen when Tiger Woods puts it all
together, and it is not good news for the rest of the golfing
world, not when he's only 24 years old. He drives better than
everyone most of the time. He can do things with his irons no one
else can. His short game is jaw-dropping. And when he putts the way
he did this week, it's like Shaq making his free throws. It's just
plain unfair, is what it is.
</P>
<P>
   What he did by winning this tournament by 15 strokes leaves us
with very few remotely comparable analogies. Help me out. Winning a
Wimbledon final by love, love, and love? A Super Bowl, 100-0? Who
knows? What we do know is that they've been swatting at the little
ball with sticks for a few centuries now and during that time only
one man has won two majors by double figures and that man is Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   It's beyond even talking about ``Tiger has raised the bar,'' and
these other pros know it, even if they don't want to admit it. The
problem is he is the only golfer in the world who can actually
humiliate people, and there is no doubt that he will continue to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always try to get better,'' he said. ``Whether it's new
techniques or new equipment, there are always things you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't upset he failed to birdie the 18th as a
fitting dramatic flourish, but I don't believe him. That would have
been a perfect ending, but if you're Tiger Woods, the good news is
now you have unfinished business. Now you have yet another goal.
And he'll do it, too. He'll win that major with a birdie on 18, and
we all know what he'll want then.
</P>
<P>
   Eagling the 18th to win his record-breaking 19th major would be
a nice touch, don't you think?

   EL SEGUNDO - Kobe Bryant has his mind on a championship ring and
an engagement ring but sounds ready to skip any involvement with
Olympic rings this summer.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball has made overtures toward him as a possible
replacement for the injured Grant Hill on the Olympic team. But the
Lakers' star swingman is leery of the schedule - which runs from
practices in late August through the Games in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is getting married this summer and also plans to spend
time in Italy, where he grew up and now is part-owner of a pro
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm kind of leaning towards not going,'' he said
Sunday, as the Lakers prepared for Game 6 of the NBA Finals, ``but
to be honest with you I haven't given it that much thought. I'm
just concentrating on this, and focusing on the game (Monday) and
just take it from there. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things I'd like to do this summer,'' he said.
``Spend time with my family, get married, and relax, just take some
time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also cited the awkward timing of the event - the team
returns to the U.S. just before NBA training camps open, the first
week of October.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson supported Bryant's decision. Asked whether
Bryant should play, Jackson said: ``Absolutely not. Kobe's getting
married this summer, it's his personal time, this is something that
should be special for him. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they had an opportunity to get to Kobe long before
this and before guys backed out of it, relatively speaking. If they
wanted him as an alternate, they probably should have asked him
last summer to be an alternate, if they have such things. But he's
made plans in his own personal life, and he's got to honor that.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes: Earlier in the playoffs, veteran Ron Harper bemoaned
the Lakers' lack of killer instinct and said they weren't ``hard
enough'' as a team. But he believes the rough road they've
traveled, losing eight times in 22 playoff games, has had a
positive effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has hardened us up real well, I think,'' he said. ``Believe
me, we saw this four times (in playoff series) now, I think, so it
comes I guess. It comes and goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said: ``It's a physical matter. It's not just a mental
matter. What happened to us (the Pacers) just physically came at
us. ... There were sequences where we just had to stop penetration
through making a charge an obvious call, that you can't overrun us
here, we're just going to get in your way and play basketball in a
defensive posture. And in the process, we were playing a little bit
slip-hardy, kind of what we call a French style of basketball which
is grab-ass ball and as a consequence cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy explanation: Robert Horry has heard enough about the
Lakers' playoff miscues and said the losses are not just about
failing to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen us slip yet,'' he said. ``People expect since
we're up, we're just supposed to come out and step on people, that
the teams we're playing are just the Clippers. But it's not that
way. These teams got a lot of star players on their team, and they
come through when it's pressure time. It's not the fact that we
slipped, the other team just steps up and performs a little bit
better than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Bryant continues to play on a sprained left ankle
but said it's not affecting his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I can't stop on a dime like I want
to, but for the most part it's fine.''

DE LA HOYA TALKS RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 LA HOYA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was supposed to be a coronation Saturday night
at Staples Center, but it may have turned into a violent retirement
party for Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   What boxers say 90 minutes after losing a world title fight by
the thinnest of margins has to be taken not with a grain of salt
but with a salt lick. Yet, an obviously troubled and downcast De La
Hoya made clear losing the WBC welterweight title by split decision
to ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley had convinced him of what so many people
outside the sport already believe.
</P>
<P>
   It convinced him boxing is a place where business decisions can
influence ringside decisions. Can, and too often do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to live with what goes on around boxing,'' De La
Hoya said after judges Lou Filippo (116-112) and Pat Russell
(115-113) scored what had been a marvelous clash of skills and
wills for Mosley, while judge Marty Sammon had it 115-113 for De La
Hoya. The Globe card made Mosley a 115-113 victor by virtue of his
winning the final five rounds both tactically and physically. Yet
De La Hoya saw it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things go through your mind after a fight like
this,'' De La Hoya said. ``You start to think, `What happens if
they do give me the decision?' Then there's no rematch. No third
fight. For a lot of people, this is a business. People wanted a
rematch to make more money, but I'm not looking at it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed with that. I just don't feel I can
continue on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As De La Hoya spoke, his trademark smile was gone. So, too, was
his habit of translating every answer he made from English to
Spanish or the reverse, a courtesy to his bilingual fan base. But
this was not a time for courtesies. It was a time for curt answers
and barely controlled anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a (expletive) business,'' muttered Joel De La Hoya,
the fighter's brother, as the now former champion repeated his
reservations about what had just happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Hoya was careful to take nothing away from
Mosley, he also conceded him nothing. When he finally arrived at
the postfight podium nearly two hours after the decision had been
announced, De La Hoya wore a bruised right eye and a broken heart.
One had been caused by Mosley. The other had been caused by his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to rethink my career over the next few days,'' De La
Hoya said. ``Think about a lot of things, including retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to rethink my whole game plan in life. It takes a lot
of courage to take on all comers the way I have. Fighters have to
be careful. They can be very stubborn and take on more and more and
more until they cross the line (and pay dearly for it). I have to
decide where I cross that line. There's life after boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 27, De La Hoya would seem to have years of life left in
boxing as well as a fruitful life without it, but he has carried
the disappointment of his controversial defeat to Felix Trinidad
inside him for nearly a year, and now it seems to have eaten away
at his soul.
</P>
<P>
   When, only two fights later, he felt he had fought another close
fight and been denied victory not by his opponent but by the
judges, his emotions poured out like a summer thunderstorm, anger
and accusation barely hidden in the shower of words.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, at one point, he did say he ``had no problem'' with
Mosley being handed the decision because ``he deserved it.'' But
five minutes later, he said he thought he had won by one point.
Then he said the judges should have declared a draw. ``To take it
from me like that, I just don't feel it's justice.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya piled up an early lead against Mosley, as he had
against Trinidad, but then began to tire. As he waned, Mosley's
purported speed advantage finally surfaced, and he began to wax De
La Hoya with lead right hands and a stinging jab, switching to
southpaw several times to confuse his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya never backed down and seldom backed up, but the jab
he'd used to bother and even daunt Mosley was less and less in
evidence as the fight wore on. That allowed the challenger to do
just a little bit more in most of the final five rounds, which De
La Hoya lost on two of the three judges' cards.
</P>
<P>
   Against Trinidad, De La Hoya had seemed to build an
insurmountable lead through the first eight rounds before he began
to tire. That night, he chose to box (some would say run) the final
four rounds, and it cost him a heavily disputed decision. This
time, he stalked Mosley throughout the night until the two came
together in the final three minutes and went toe to toe as the
crowd leapt to its feet and let loose a primordial roar of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Both men fought furiously for what they wanted. Not the WBC's
plastic belt, but simple mastery of the other. Neither got it
fully, but twice Mosley nailed De La Hoya solidly _ solidly enough
to drop a less-focused and fierce opponent. When the final bell
tolled, the two embraced, great warriors who had earned the other's
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close fight,'' conceded Mosley (35-0), whose face was
bruised and knotted on the right side from the repeated pounding of
De La Hoya's jab and left hook. ``We went toe to toe for 12 rounds.
We showed we're both great warriors. Two great warriors. Oscar is a
great champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really sharp. There were a lot of sharp punches. I had
to make sure I had enough energy left to close the show in that
12th round. I felt I outpointed him. I was just the better man
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the consensus at Staples Center, as was the belief that
viewers had witnessed one of the best fights in years between two
equals. Yet De La Hoya was still lingering on the Trinidad fight,
which he has always believed he won handily.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days leading up to Saturday night's clash with
Mosley, De La Hoya talked incessantly of Trinidad, and after the
defeat, his promoter, Bob Arum, claimed there had been two secret
meetings between members of the Nevada Athletic Commission without
any De La Hoya representative present, meetings he said paved the
way for De La Hoya's first defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Whether true or not, Arum insisted it was that experience, not
the loss to Mosley, that had his franchise fighter talking of
moving into a business in which he could make his own decisions
without relying on others at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may very well be that the last time anyone sees Oscar De La
Hoya is tonight,'' Arum said. ``But you would not have seen him
take this position if the Trinidad thing hadn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar is a good sport. If he heard the same decision without
the Trinidad decision before it, he wouldn't be talking the way he
was talking.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not be talking that way a week from now, either, but for
one more night, Oscar De La Hoya held the boxing world enthralled.
He had lost, but he was still the headline maker. He had lost, but
now he was threatening his sport with a bigger loss.
</P>
<P>
   Himself.

TIGER WOODS SHATTERS STORIED RECORDS IN OPEN ROMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Break out the industrial-size eraser.
Tiger Woods has rewritten golf's history book.
</P>
<P>
   Not just at the U.S. Open, where he lapped the field by 15
strokes in Sunday's final round at Pebble Beach Golf Links and
shattered more records than frenzied fans at a disco-demolition
night promotion.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about a rout of all-encompassing, global
proportions. We're talking about eclipsing any whipping
administered by anyone who has ever teed up in one of golf's major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods drained his final putt at the 18th hole, he did more
than finish further under par (12 under) than any player in Open
history. He did more than match the tournament's lowest scoring
total (272) by closing with a bogey-free 67. He did more than tie
or break seven Open scoring records.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, pushed aside the 138-year-old mark of Tom Morris Sr.,
winner of the 1862 British Open, for the most lopsided winning
margin at one of golf's major championships. Morris pounded Willie
Park by 13 strokes. Woods subdued his closest Open pursuers, Ernie
Els and Miguel Angel Jimenez, by 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play as solidly as I did all week, it's hard to describe
the satisfaction. I never had a low point,'' said Woods, who
finished 72 holes without three-putting a green and struck the ball
more crisply _ in his estimation _ than during his 12-stroke
victory at the 1997 Masters. ``It was neat walking up 18 knowing
that, if you just stay alive, you'll win the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods finished as a living, breathing testament to flawless
golf, in the estimation of Els, his final-round playing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome to watch, just a dominating performance. He was
never in any kind of trouble,'' Els said of Woods' closing round,
when he stretched a 10-stroke lead to a 15-stroke romp and grabbed
a slice of history. ``Whatever I say is an understatement. Just the
perfect display of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   If Morris, who reigned for 138 years as the most dominant
performer in a major championship, had been in the 2000 Open field,
Els said Woods ``would have beat him by 80 shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, was more pleased by becoming the first player in
Open history to finish double-digit deep in red numbers at the
Open. Before Woods posted Sunday's 12-under total, the best
previous mark had been 8 under, by Jack Nicklaus and Lee Janzen. To
Woods, that stands as a greater accomplishment than bumping aside
Morris in the domination department.
</P>
<P>
   ``To finish a U.S. Open this many under par, you know you've
played well,'' Woods said. ``You know it's something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Peers were quick to second that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt for the longest time that someone was going to
come along who could drive the ball 300 yards and putt like (Ben)
Crenshaw,'' Nick Price said. ``Well, this guy drives the ball
better than anyone I've seen and putts better than Crenshaw. He's a
phenomenon, no doubt about it. When he's on his game, I don't see
anyone challenging him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, who played three practice rounds with Woods before
the tournament, said he saw this coming before Woods struck his
first shot _ or broke his first tournament record _ during
Thursday's round of 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him miss one shot in three days,'' O'Meara said. ``At
that point, I thought, `If there's not much wind, he'll set the
record.' Jack Nicklaus has the greatest record in golf. But Tiger
Woods is the greatest player I've seen. He has all the shots. He
has mental toughness. If you built the perfect golfer, you'd build
Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite said he was struck by the surgical precision with which
Woods removed all drama from the event during the weekend rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most sedate crowd I've ever seen for the final
day at the Open,'' Kite said. ``There was so little excitement, it
was almost disappointing. It was like the tournament was already
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it was. Woods began the day with a 10-stroke lead.
He ended it with 14 pars, four birdies, a slice of history, a U.S.
Open trophy and extreme satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out here this week and perform the way I did, on one
of the greatest venues there is in golf, it doesn't get much better
than that,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, no one else who has ever played major
championship golf can comprehend the feeling. nn

RIVALS TREADING LIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a dreary afternoon on Yawkey Way, it was the only
measure of comfort for the still-in-first-place-but-oh-so-shaky Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeff Fassero, Sunday's losing pitcher who may be headed to
the disabled list, noticed when the man inside the Green Monster
hung a 9 beside CHI in the first inning, before NY had taken its
first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it and said, `You've got to be kidding me,''' Fassero
said of the first sign that the Yankees would also be in for a long
day, one that wouldn't end until the Chicago White Sox finished a
17-4 demolition and sweep of the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel good,'' Fassero said of the Bronx bombing, one
in which the Yankees were outscored, 42-17, in the four-game set on
their own turf.
</P>
<P>
   Sox designated hitter Brian Daubach was paying attention, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing, especially since it was El Duque,'' Daubach said,
noting that it was the Yankees' Cuban ace, Orlando Hernandez, who
absorbed the first-inning beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure when they come here tomorrow they're not going to be
real happy, either. It's going to be a tough series.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in a span of 25 days, the Sox and Yankees
come together with first place on the line. The Sox already have
traveled twice to New York; this will be the Yankees' first visit
this season to Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   But for what is supposed to be a showdown between the best teams
in the division, both the Sox and Yanks are playing like teams that
won't be occupied come October.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 19, when the Sox beat the Tigers in Fenway Park to
move 12 games above .500, their high-water mark, they have a record
of 10-16. They've lost six of eight series, including their last
four series at home, while splitting a rain-shortened two-game set
in the Bronx last week.
</P>
<P>
   But remarkably, the Yankees, who have won three of the last four
World Series, have matched the Sox nearly loss for loss, going
10-15 in that same time.
</P>
<P>
   You think the Sox have problems? Last week, the Yankees placed
Roger Clemens on the DL with a strained groin and hoped he isn't
out a month. Their second baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, took himself
out of a game last week after making three throwing errors and
followed that up by conking the mother of FOX resident wise guy
Keith Olbermann behind the Yankees' dugout on Saturday. He's a
basket case (Knoblauch, not Olbermann).
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after being lit up for nine runs, including Jose
Valentin's grand slam, while recording just two outs, El Duque was
taken to the hospital for X-rays after complaining of elbow pain.
He was diagnosed with a right elbow sprain and is day to day.
Yankee starting pitchers are 21-25 with a 5.08 ERA. Since May 19,
the staff ERA is 5.26. So far this month, the ERA has soared to
6.31, due in no small part to a White Sox offense that scored in
double figures in three of the four games.
</P>
<P>
   A long-time baseball man from Toronto took one look at the
scoreboard Sunday and imagined the reaction of Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner. ``You know the smoke signals are traveling back and
forth from New York to Tampa right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Steinbrenner's track record, who would be surprised if the
Yankees show up Monday night with Sammy Sosa or Juan Gonzalez in
tow, with pitchers Brad Radke and Scott Erickson not far behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not feeling too good about ourselves,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre told New York reporters Sunday, ``but we keep checking
the standings and we're only a half-game behind. It's amazing to be
in this position with what has happened to us this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange four weeks for the four teams that made the
playoffs in the AL last season. It's not just the Sox and Yankees.
The injury-battered Indians, the five-time defending AL Central
champs, are a game above .500 (14-13) in that time but a startling
7 1/2 games back of the surprising White Sox, who are 21-7 since
May 19 and have the majors' best record. The Rangers, who won the
West, are 10-16 since May 19, including a nine-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who have taken two out of three from the Sox on
both trips into the Fens, are three games over .500 (15-12) in that
span but have closed to within a game of the Sox in the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew they'd be good,'' Daubach said. ``They got off
to a slow start, but they've been scoring runs all year. They
probably have the best offense in the league. We've got to score
more than five to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach said it's become tougher to play most everybody. ``There
are no pushovers this year,'' he said. ``You've got to play every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox closer Derek Lowe agreed. ``There's not a dominant team like
there was before,'' he said. ``There are so many good teams this
year, it's hard to pull away from anybody. Everyone is so used to
seeing the Yankees win 100 games a year, so when they're not ahead
by five or 10 games, you want to say they're going to go on a run.
But that's not easy with so many good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   What it really says, of course, is that the Yankees, while
retaining much of their former splendor, are finally revealing some
of the same flaws that bedevil good teams that in the past have
fallen short of the Bombers. Like the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you do before the All-Star break,'' Lowe said,
``what really matters is what you do in the last two months. You
just want to be in it at the All-Star break. That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees treading water right alongside them, staying
within striking distance may not be quite as hard as it's been in
the past. That's assuming, of course, someone can cool off those
go-go White Sox.

CASTILLO KEEPS RED SOX IN PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
 JAYS-CASTILLO-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Things are starting to fall into place for Frank
Castillo and the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, despite a host of quality starts, was saddled with a
2-5 record and 4.71 earned run average entering Sunday's game. But
he is now pitching as the Jays hoped he would when they signed him
as a free agent last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Fenway Park, he had his best outing of the season,
pitching seven strong innings of three-hit shutout ball as the Jays
thumped the Red Sox, 5-1, and thrust themselves into the AL East
race.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Castillo superb back-to-back starts. Last week in
Detroit, he went seven innings and held the Tigers to five hits and
two runs in Toronto's 4-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who before landing in Toronto pitched for the Cubs,
Rockies, and Tigers, had the Sox eating out of his hand. The
veteran righthander was touched for a leadoff single by Manny
Alexander in the third, a one-out double by Carl Everett in the
fourth, and a leadoff single by Jeff Frye in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed no runner beyond second base before turning his 4-0
lead over to Paul Quantrill and Billy Koch. Quantrill had a 1-2-3
eighth inning but got into trouble in the ninth and was bailed out
by Koch, who notched his second straight save over the Sox and 15th
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Castillo's) pitched very well for us of late, and to shut the
Sox down in this ballpark was quite an effort,'' said Blue Jays
manager Jim Fregosi. ``He threw 120-plus pitches in seven innings
and I just thought he did a heck of a job to get us as far as he
got us.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo hasn't pitched badly of late and his record coming in
was deceiving. In six of his previous eight starts, he pitched six
or more innings, and his last two efforts _ both on the road _ had
been gems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good trip,'' said Castillo. ``It started in
Detroit on Monday and ended today. It was a fun week for me.
Location was the key, that and keeping the guys off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonzo (Alex Gonzalez) made a great play in the first and Mondy
(Raul Mondesi) a great play in the second and they went out and
scored runs for me. That made it a little bit easier for me to just
go out there, keep the ball down, and throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo issued just two walks, both with two outs in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking for trouble when you do that in this park,'' he
said, ``but fortunately, I got (Darren) Lewis on a ground ball and
that was the end of that. Things are coming around. I've been
throwing well and the team has been scoring some runs for me and
we've been winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning so much lately, that the Jays are now just a game out of
first place with a six-game homestand on tap. Toronto (37) actually
has won more games than both the Sox (35) and Yankees (34), and
with those two teams about to begin a four-game series Monday
night, the Blue Jays could reach the top before too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good ball right now,'' said Koch. ``You've got
us, Boston, and New York. Three quality teams atop the AL East
battling it out. It's going to be a close race all year. Hopefully
we can piece something together, play like we've been playing, and
take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi hasn't lost sight of the closeness of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every club in our division has had problems this year,'' he
said. ``At one time or another every club has lost some key
players. No team in the division has really put a streak together
and that's why we're as close as we are. I think it's going to stay
that way all season.''

REVOLUTION LOOKING VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Though the Revolution appear to be on
the verge of adding striker Jorge Cadete, other weaknesses are
becoming obvious despite the team's first-place standing.
</P>
<P>
   A proven goal scorer should be a priority for the Revolution,
who completed the first half of the MLS season with one of the
least-productive forward lines in the league. Wolde Harris
converted his sixth goal of the season in a 4-2 loss to the
MetroStars Saturday, but his strike partners have been ineffective
and/or inefficient except for a brief stint by Jamar Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution's 7-5-4 mark is on a pace to set a team
record for points. And the Revolution appear to be far better
prepared to progress than in past seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But potential vulnerabilities persist.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic, experienced strikers have been able to take advantage
of the Revolution's inexperience in central defense. Mauricio
Wright derailed Adolfo ``El Tren'' Valencia in the second half
Saturday, but Valencia had already done his damage, outmaneuvering
Brian Dunseth for the tying goal late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fernando Clavijo might also have to reconsider his options
off the bench. Some of the young players have made important
contributions, the most recent being Beasley's two-goal performance
in a 3-0 win over San Jose June 10. But Carlos Parra and William
Sunsing both remained in reserve for the MetroStars game,
reinforcing the sense of diminished confidence in them after a 1-0
loss to the Mid-Michigan Bucks in a US Open Cup match last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Imad Baba and Ted Chronopoulos have injected effectiveness into
the offense from their wing midfield positions, but Baba appeared
to be slowed by a leg injury and Chronopoulos was out with a
strained back against the MetroStars. Now the Revolution must
prepare to meet San Jose without suspended midfielders Leonel
Alvarez and Ivan McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Ramos returned from Japan to provide a midfield point
of reference. But if the Earthquakes concentrate on marking Ramos
out of the game in San Jose, the Revolution will struggle to find
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   These are problems Cadete will not be in a position to resolve,
even if he arrives next week. The earliest he could be expected to
play for the Revolution would be July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to the MetroStars began a five-game road trip the
Revolution seem ill-prepared to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough loss to take (against the MetroStars) because
it was a 6-point turnaround,'' Chronopoulos said. ``If we had won,
we would be 10 points ahead of them and feeling very confident
going into San Jose. But it's not the end of the world. We are
still in first place, and we will go on from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad I wasn't out there, but it was better to rest. I'll
be ready by Wednesday.''

IT'S ARBOR DAY AT LOUDON 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Although rain postponed the featured Chevy Trucks
Superbike race of the 77th American Motorcyclist Association's
Loudon Classic _ it is rescheduled for 11 a.m. Monday at New
Hampshire International Speedway _ it hardly put a damper on Chris
Arbor's day.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old native of Salem, N.H., who works as a service
manager at Riverside Motorsports in Somerville, Mass., successfully
negotiated a wet and slippery racing surface at NHIS to score his
first career victory in Sunday's Buell Pro Thunder race.
</P>
<P>
   Arbor used his knowledge of the 12-turn road circuit and his
supreme confidence in wet race conditions to wrest the lead away
from runner-up Shawn Conrad of Sheboygan Falls, Wis., with one lap
remaining in the 24-lap race. Arbor captured a $5,000 winner's
purse, which had been doubled by NHIS track owner Bob Bahre as a
means of enticing 22 out of 40 Pro Thunder riders to brave the foul
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it ranked as his biggest payday, Arbor did a double
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, biggest?'' he asked incredulously. ``It's
like my only payday.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbor's only mistake of the day came when he fell out of the
lead on Lap 16 as he skidded off course and into a tire wall near
Turn 3. He was able, however, to remain in the saddle and keep his
Ducati ride from hitting the ground, allowing him to jump back into
the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay loose and not get overtired,'' he explained.
``I had a knee injury last year and it's not quite right yet, so I
had my leg off (the bike) going into 3 and tried to stretch my
knee. I locked the front wheels, went into the tire barriers, and
barely saved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got back on the track and took two laps to calm myself
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he did, Arbor was able to chase down Conrad. On Lap 23,
Arbor ripped off his fastest lap of the race (1 minute 31.547
seconds) and passed Conrad at the same spot in Turn 3 where he had
gone off the course earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know I had the lead,'' Conrad said. ``I was just
riding around comfortably and giving lap traffic plenty of room. I
made the mistake of looking at the scoring tower to see what lap we
were on, but I didn't see what position I was in. It's my mistake
that I didn't do that. I think I could've gone faster there at the
end if I knew I had the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   That might have posed a problem for Conrad, especially since ``I
haven't had any wet laps here ever,'' he said. But that wasn't the
case with Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee I had more confidence out there in the wet than
anybody racing today,'' said Arbor, who had four years of racing
experience in the Loudon Road Racing Series at NHIS but only two
weekends as an AMA-licensed professional. ``I was in no rush to get
the lead. I just tried to stay smooth and stay under control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Filice of Modesto, Calif., took the checkered flag in the
MBNA 250cc Grand Prix over runner-up Charles Sorensen, who extended
his lead in the standings, and third-place finisher Jeff Wood of
Mansfield, Mass. The 37-year-old Filice, who came out of a
five-year retirement this season, recorded his fourth 250 GP
victory at NHIS and 23d overall in the series. ``I always wanted to
come back to racing,'' said Filice. ``When I did this year, I
wanted to do it right. I didn't want to be a backmarker because
that wouldn't be racing to me.'' . . . Jocelin, the 29-year-old
female Yamaha rider from Winslow, Maine, finished 23d in the 250cc
race, her best effort of the season. She crashed in the season
opener at Daytona March 12 and recorded a DNF after a mechanical
failure in her first race back at Road Atlanta this month . . .
Aaron Yates won the Pro Hondo Oils 600 Supersport Race, the first
event, over runner-up Jamie Hacking and third-place finisher Eric
Bostrom.

L.A. ISN'T TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Upon taking the city's helm seven years ago,
millionaire businessman Richard Riordan pledged to make Los Angeles
a business-friendly place.
</P>
<P>
   But as he enters his final stretch as mayor of the nation's
second largest city, economists and community leaders think the
city has woefully failed to reach its potential as a pivotal
business center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the city has watched large corporations move their
headquarters to other cities; business tax receipts have declined
in the past decade when adjusted for inflation; nine major
corporations are suing the city alleging double taxation; and
experts brand the city among the most expensive places to do
business in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the most potentially powerful economic bases in
the United States, but getting it to function on all cylinders is
very difficult,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders and economists don't blame the mayor. Rather, they
applaud his effort to resuscitate the city's standing as an
international business and industry hub but note he has been unable
to move many needed reforms through the political processes at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But they say the city has struggled to recover from the 1992
L.A. Riots and the 1994 Northridge Earthquake while witnessing a
decade of unprecedented U.S. economic growth sail by with little to
show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think the Riordan administration, working with the
council, has done a masterful job in attempting to rebuild, we've
had a long way to come,'' said City Controller Rick Tuttle. ``When
you look at it in terms of real dollars, we still have a ways to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took in $260 million in business tax receipts in
1990. This year, the city is expected to collect $310 million,
which Tuttle's office said translates to a decline when adjusted
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles metropolitan area, anchored by the city of Los
Angeles, ranked 120th in a Forbes magazine list of the best areas
in the nation to do business. And the entire county still has
117,000 fewer jobs than at its peak in 1989, despite a diving
unemployment rate nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The number of businesses paying taxes in the city has increased
since Riordan's election in 1993. But that total includes many
small businesses and, according to some observers, could include an
unknown number of established enterprises that only began paying
city taxes as the city announced it intended to step up collection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the city is defending itself against the very types
of powerhouses it aims to woo. Nine major corporations, including
Eastman Kodak and the owners of five department stores, have sued
the city, alleging that its business tax system unfairly benefits
locally based businesses while discriminating against companies
based elsewhere that do business in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get a better report card,'' said Carol Schatz,
president of the Central City Organization, which advocates for
downtown business interests. ``As you move through business circles
... you still hear from too many business people that L.A. is a
difficult city to do business in.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's economic development staff members said they are
confident that the city's ability to keep and attract businesses
will surge after his initiative to improve the city's business-tax
system is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the mayor has proven that he has some real vision,
and when he proposed tax reform more than a year ago, it was the
right thing to do,'' said Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo.
</P>
<P>
   A key component to reform is simplifying the convoluted business
tax system, Delgadillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can solve the business tax situation, I think we will be
a real powerhouse in the region and people won't be making
decisions to move across the street,'' Delgadillo said in a
reference to companies relocating to adjacent cities with lower
business taxes and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The city's business tax advisory committee, which has been in
place for five years, plans to make its recommendations in October
to simplify the business tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Also crucial, officials say, is targeting tens of thousands of
businesses that are believed to be operating without paying city
business tax. The city - which estimates some 60,000 businesses
aren't paying the levy - is supporting state legislation to help
municipalities identify the scofflaws.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser pointed to other reasons for the city's difficulty in
attracting business. Some business owners are dismayed, he said, by
strife in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the relative
shortage of city land available for building, and political
infighting between council members representing different areas of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers will frequently make the comment that they get
caught between two sort-of-competing groups,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Councilman Mike Hernandez, who chairs the council's
Community and Economic Development Committee, thinks the city is on
the verge of a renaissance. Its ability to bounce back from the
riots and earthquake will only make it stronger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to survive some major catastrophes that have
shown the willpower,'' he said. ``I don't think there's any other
city like ours.''

CORA MAKES MOST OF SECOND CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alex Cora couldn't earn the Dodgers starting
shortstop job in spring training, but he's taking advantage of his
second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Since being recalled from Albuquerque on May 31, Cora has
received significant playing time and prompted manager Davey
Johnson to go with a platoon of the left-handed hitting Cora and
original starter Kevin Elster, a right-hander whose hitting has
cooled off after a fast start. Cora started again Sunday against
St. Louis right-hander Darryl Kile.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, 24, entered Sunday's game batting .272 and had hit in
seven consecutive games earlier in the month. Elster's average has
dropped to .222. He batted just .176 during the 10-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Elster, and I told him I'd be doing a little
platooning,'' Johnson said. ``Not necessarily straight platooning,
he could still be in there against some right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna use this time to get Alex comfortable. I think
we've accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting better After a shaky beginning, second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek is settling in at his new position and providing solid
defense. His error-free game Sunday was his 13th in a row. The
converted shortstop has just one error in his last 31 games and six
in 64 games played this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers remain near the bottom of the National League in
fielding. Only Florida and San Diego had more errors than the
Dodgers' 57 entering Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Raising awareness: Players wore temporary blue ribbon tattoos
Sunday as a sign of solidarity in support of finding a cure for
prostate cancer. All major-league players were to have worn the
tattoos while umpires, coaches and some players wore blue
wristbands.
</P>
<P>
   The accessories were part of CaP Cure's annual Home Run
Challenge in which fans pledge donations based on the number of
home runs hit in games during Father's Day week.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Shawn Green's single in the third inning Sunday
marked the 49th consecutive game he reached base safely. He has
reached base in 64 of the Dodgers' 67 games, 45 of which he got on
at least twice.... After an off day today, the Dodgers start a
six-game trip to Houston and St. Louis on Tuesday. In the National
League, only the Cardinals have more wins on the road than the
Dodgers, who are 19-14 away from home this season.

PACERS NOT READY TO CONCEDE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers are scheduled to win the NBA title late
Monday night or early Tuesday morning. Almost anyone here without
Indiana ties will tell you that. Angelenos talk about the title as
if it were a flight in perpetual holding pattern, circling LAX
before being cleared for a runway.
</P>
<P>
   When the title arrives, there will be a party on Figueroa
Street. Commentators will regale you with Six Degrees of Michael
Jordan (``Well, if you do a word scramble on `Michael Jordan,' you
can find either `O'Neal' or `LA,' so this is destiny . . . `Bryant'
has six letters and Michael won six titles, so Kobe must be the
next Michael . . . A young Michael signed with Phil Knight of Nike,
Nike is in Oregon, Ahmad Rashad went to college in Oregon, Rashad
is one of Michael's best friends, and, right now, Ahmad is
interviewing Phil Jackson, who coaches Shaq and coached
Michael!''). ``Dynasty'' will be used about 325 times.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of parties sometimes forget a few details, and this
is no exception. Has anyone considered what will happen if guys
named Jalen, Reggie, and Mark crash the party? Has anyone factored
in the obvious? That, you know, the Pacers can still win this
thing?
</P>
<P>
   I know I didn't before coming here. Part of the reason is that
the NBA hasn't had a true Super Bowl III-type upset in the 1980s or
'90s. The closest you can get is the Celtics' win over the Lakers
in '84. But do you really want to say a team that had both Larry
Bird and an '81 title on the shelf upset someone? There were no
gasps when the Rockets, Bulls, Spurs, Lakers, Pistons, and 76ers
won titles, either.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that history, it's easy to become absorbed in the
current LA hype. Check that: It's easy to become absorbed from
afar. At close range, these Lakers scare me. I saw them Sunday, and
they had a monks-in-meditation aura about them, which would be fine
if they were monks in meditation. They had such a flower-child calm
that I had a vision of them huddling before Game 7. That's a real
problem since, according to the itinerary, they're supposed to win
the title in Game 6. These Lakers don't exude the kind of calm of a
parent in a crisis; peel away the top layer of their calm, and
you'll find arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. They expect to win it. But they also lost their last game
by 33 points. There are three explanations for a performance like
that in a championship series. One is that you had a bad day, which
everyone has. Two is that you gave up. Three is that the other team
did something for which you have no answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers know they can always get 30 or 40 points from O'Neal.
Bird knows the Pacers don't have anyone who can guard the league's
MVP, so the coach prays Shaq won't go for 50. Next year, Bryant
will be a consistently dominant player. He is the one player in the
league who is capable of winning the MVP and Defensive Player of
the Year trophies in the same season, something that hasn't been
done since 1988 (a guy named MJ pulled it off). I like Bryant a
lot. He is smart, charismatic, and beautiful to watch. He is also _
unlike Shaq _ guardable.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a Laker fan, I would be buoyed by a couple of
historical endorsements. I would know my team didn't lose three
games in a row all year and, as the memorable refrain of the
most-recited June stat tells us, I would know no team has ever come
back from a 3-1 deficit to win a title. I would also know this is
not a great Laker team, and I would realize the Pacers knew it,
too. Shaq and Kobe are the best guard-center combination in the
league. Glen Rice's game, though, is an echo of what it was. Robert
Horry, Ron Harper, Rick Fox, and Brian Shaw are all inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   This team is beatable. Its difficulty in closing games has been
traced to a lack of focus, although that's not the real weakness.
LA is a classic first-impression team. Glance at it, and you are
blown away. Study it for five or six games, and you can decode it.
</P>
<P>
   Really, why have we already given the title to the Lakers? They
lead this series, 3-2, and it could easily be reversed. That point
was made to Bird Sunday, and the coach responded with a dry, ``But
it's not.'' The Pacers certainly have their flaws. Their best
post-up player is a slow, 6-foot-2-inch point guard (Mark Jackson).
They have a point guard playing small forward (Jalen Rose) and a
7-4 center (Rik Smits) who has the soul of a shooting guard. They
have an old, 3-point shooting center (Sam Perkins) who was drafted
after retiree Jordan and before retiree Charles Barkley. Chris
Mullin, who is on the bench, was drafted in the same year as
bygones such as Keith Lee and Ennis Whatley.
</P>
<P>
   They are aged and also wise. They are much better shooters than
the Lakers. And, trust me, they are hungrier than the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a completely different team than we were at the
beginning of the series,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that his team knows what to expect now. No one is
shocked when scenes such as Sunday's develop: A quiet media pack
suddenly begins to sprint to a corner, as if it is being chased
through Jurassic Park. You soon learn that Phil Jackson will be
speaking in that corner, and the rush is for prime camera and
microphone position.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is exaggerated during the Finals. The games are
longer, the commentary is more intense, and the premature
dismissals of a team come much more, well, prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But step back for a moment. Remember the Trail Blazers had the
Lakers down by 15 points in Game 7 at home. They lost. They didn't
lose because Jackson found a way to merge pop culture with
mysticism. He didn't combine the triangle offense with Zen and
``Shaft'' to vault past the Blazers. His team won because its
opponents became tense and missed easy shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers won't do that. They all recite the mantra that is
tattooed onto Jalen Rose's left arm: Nothing to Lose. The words
have been on Rose's arm since his senior year in high school, but
the message seemed more visible Sunday. The Lakers had better end
the series Monday night. If they don't, the Pacers will win it,
giving the NBA its first ``upset'' champion in two decades.

WATSON STRUGGLES IN FINAL ROUND
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH - Tom Watson took a ride in the time machine Sunday
afternoon and it helped ease a disappointing final round in which
he failed to qualify for an automatic return for his 29th U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's trip down memory lane came when his tee shot landed in
the rough left of the flagstick on No. 17 at Pebble Beach Golf
Links. It was almost the same spot from where he launched his
miraculous birdie chip-in to defeat Jack Nicklaus in the 1982 Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball ended up left of the green, Bruce (Edwards), my
caddie (who also caddied for Watson in '82), said, 'No! I can't
believe that - not again!'
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a little different situation, obviously,'' Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   A different result, too.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Watson did as Edwards suggested 18 years ago - he
merely got it close but not close enough to avoid bogey. And
although Watson birdied 18 - as he also did in '82 to lock up the
two-stroke win over Nicklaus - the final-round 73 left him 296 and
three strokes shy of automatic qualifying for next year's Open.
</P>
<P>
   The top 15 finishers and ties in each Open get to return the
following year. Watson finished in a tie for 27th Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there with the idea of trying to shoot 3-under par
to try to get exempt next year,'' said Watson. He added that,
health permitting, he would try to qualify for the 2001
championship at Southern Hills if the U.S. Golf Association did not
extend him another exemption as it did this year - ``for which I'm
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his first birdie try from that spot on No. 17 since he
sank one of the most-memorable shots in Open history, Watson said,
``I was thinking about holing it - that would have been a birdie to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   More Watson: In talking about that tournament-clinching shot
earlier this week, Watson remembered that ``probably in the stands,
there were probably close to 1,500 people. But I've had, over the
course of 18 years, probably 6,000 to 10,000 people saying they
were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Open schedule: Next year's U.S. Open will be played at Southern
Hills in Tulsa, Okla., followed by trips to Bethpage Black in New
York (2002), Olympia Fields near Chicago (2003), New York's
Shinnecock Hills (2004) and North Carolina's Pinehurst No. 2 in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Woods a wonder: Winner Tiger Woods, only the fifth player to win
three different USGA championships, moves into a tie for fourth in
all-time USGA titles with seven. He previously won three U.S.
Junior Amateur titles and three U.S. Amateur titles - all
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the only player to win those three USGA titles, joins
Johnny Miller as the only player to win the Open and Junior
Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   With this win, Woods becomes only the 13th player to lead the
Open start to finish and the fifth to do so without being tied at
the end of any round.
</P>
<P>
   He exits Pebble Beach Golf Links with Open records for low
36-hole score (tied at 134), largest lead after 54-hole (10
strokes, to break a 79-year-old standard) and lowest Open
tournament score (72, to tie Jack Nicklaus and Lee Janzen).
</P>
<P>
   He also has the record for largest 54-hole lead in any major
(tied with Henry Cotton in 1934 British Open). His 15-stroke
winning margin breaks a 138-year-old record for any major, set by
Old Tom Morris, who won the British Open by 13 strokes over Willie
Park in 1862. In the modern era, Woods held the winning margin
record with his 12-stroke victory Tom Kite in the 1997 Masters.

TIGER'S TALE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Yellowed, frayed, and covered with a
century's dust, the pages of golf's history books were scattered to
the Pacific winds Sunday, rendered senseless by a young man whose
genius brought the game as close to the edge of perfection as ever
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods did more than shoot 4-under-par 67 and win the 100th
playing of the US Open on the fabled holes of Pebble Beach Golf
Links with records for score (12-under 272) and margin of victory
(15 shots); he dominated a major championship in a manner the sport
has not seen since the days of Old Tom Morris. And we are talking
138 years ago, folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My words probably can't describe it, so I'm not even going to
try,'' said Ernie Els, whose willingness to help the United States
Golf Association fill out a field that Woods could knock silly,
earned him a reward of $390,150 for sharing second place with
Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (71_287).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, second place in the 2000 US Open means you were as
close to Woods as the folks strolling the beach hundreds of feet
down the cliffs from where he was creating his masterpiece. Woods
had won this US Open, for all intents and purposes, with an opening
65 as foundation for ensuing trips of 69 and 71, but since 72 holes
is dictated, the 24-year-old maestro decided to close it out with a
clinic to earn his $800,000 and become just the eighth wire-to-wire
winner of this championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods found 10 of Pebble Beach's 14 narrow fairways, navigated
his way to impossible greens 15 of 18 times, and wore the look that
his beleaguered group of challengers dread. ``He meant business,''
said Els, Woods's playing partner who felt more rundown than
runner-up. ``I'm kind of embarrassed. Finishing second is good, but
15 shots behind?''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how those 20, 30, even 40 behind felt, for during a
tournament in which the field averaged 75.355 and no one else was
able to get under par, Woods was able to put up a performance that
reminded of his 1997 Masters triumph by 12 shots. (Indeed, he's the
only player in history to win two major championships by
double-digit margins.)
</P>
<P>
   Augusta was nice, but ``to win our national championship, being
American,'' said Woods. ``It's a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   So utterly dominating was Woods that you need a time tunnel for
perspective. Only three previous times had a major championship
winner prevailed by double digits _ Old Tom Morris at the 1862
British Open (13 shots), Young Tom Morris in that event eight years
later (12), Willie Smith (11) in the 1899 US open _ a reality so
chilling that even today's players of great skill were praying for
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to shoot 85,'' said Lee Westwood (71_289, T-5th), when
asked how someone could overtake Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a 10-shot lead, Woods could have afforded an 81,
but that's the type of negative thought that has no chance of
penetrating his mind. ``I knew if I went out there and made no
bogeys, if I was patient, I knew I'd make a putt here and there and
maybe increase the lead,'' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a plan carried out to perfection, for Woods missed
just one green in going out with nine straight pars. He was stuck
at 8 over and his cushion had been trimmed to nine shots, but Woods
had very little reason to panic because every PGA Tour's worst
nightmare was on display _ Tiger Woods putting well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at each and every round,'' said Woods, ``I
made important par putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Like at the par-5 sixth hole, which he played sloppily after a
fairway-splitting drive. His second shot, as it had done in Round
3, ended up in hay next to a bunker and Woods didn't have much of a
shot. He punched out through the green and into more thick stuff,
and his fourth shot left him a 6-foot putt for par, which he
drained.
</P>
<P>
   A birdie at the 10th broke his string of pars, then he became
just the second player in US Open history to reach double digits
under par when he poured in an 18-footer at the par-3 12th. Heading
in that direction felt good, so Woods knocked a sand wedge to 1
foot on the par-4 13th and made that birdie. At the par-5 15th he
lofted another sand wedge to 8 feet and made that to get into an
area of red numbers that has never been negotiated in 100 rich
years of this event.
</P>
<P>
   Nice, said Woods, but what really got him pumped was the 16th, a
15-foot putt that saved par. ``I had worked so hard not to make a
bogey, if I had missed that putt, I would have been ticked at
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   No fear of that, because he drained that putt just as he had
drained every other big putt that got in his way. His march to his
first US Open and third major championship, said Woods, was won
with his putting and a short game that always gave him chances to
make par.
</P>
<P>
   And the best thing, it was suggested, was that next month's
British Open is at St. Andrews, a course that sets up nicely for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Woods paused, but didn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records are great, but you don't really pay attention to
that. You pay attention to the fact that I got my green coat
(Masters win) and here this week, I got the trophy. Now I get to go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where most of the world's best players wish he would
stay.

LAKERS CONFIDENT ENTERING GAME 6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Glen Rice did not order the Dom Perignon.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson didn't ponder the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   And Ron Harper certainly did not study the backs of his hands to
determine which of his seven ringless fingers should get the next
diamond-encrusted beaut.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Lakers were mostly business Sunday, as they prepared for
tonight's Game 6 of the Finals, and a possible date with official,
NBA-licensed championship confetti. But there was no mistaking
their confidence that the celebration is near.
</P>
<P>
   Now and again, they flashed signs of humility over the 33-point
pounding they took Friday from the Indiana Pacers. But dismissing
the pain of Game 5 proved as easy as saying goodbye to sleepy
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, back in their comfort zone, the Lakers sounded ready
to finish this series tonight at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city is going to be pumped up, I think the fans
will be pumped up and the team is going to be pumped up. I look
forward to the game,'' Shaquille O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' Jackson said, ``to win a basketball game, and
we're going to do it on Monday night, and that's what we want to
do. That's the only game there is right now for us is Monday's
game.''
</P>
<P>
   No mention of a Game 7 on Wednesday. No hint that the Lakers are
taking the win-one-of-two approach. And no lack of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember, the last game we got our butts kicked,
so we're definitely going to come out and play hard,'' Rice said.
``Once we win the ring, (things) will be more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-town reporter wanted a clarification on that last
sentiment. ``Like I said, once we win the ring,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Lakers spent Sunday morning reviewing film from
their 120-87 Game 5 loss, digesting how the the Pacers could shoot
57 percent and take 36 free throws, how Kobe Bryant could miss 16
of 20 field goals and how they could be outrebounded by 12.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was brief. All the Lakers figure they need is a
return to the aggressiveness that got them a 3-2 lead in this
series. That trait was clearly lacking as the Pacers freely drove
the lane Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see how you perform sometimes to understand what
happens to you,'' Jackson said. ``There's a lot of things that
happen in the course of aggressiveness. When you take the ball, or
you take the game towards somebody, everything seems to fall in
place. And that happened with the Pacers just coming harder at us
than we went at them. As a consequence, all the things fell in
their direction, and we had to see that to remedy it, so to
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the only Lakers showing an obvious edge were O'Neal
(35 points) and Rick Fox (one flagrant foul, one technical foul,
several scrums and a lot of elbows).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't put your foot down,'' Fox said, ``then guys are
going to walk over you, teams are going to have less respect for
you. And in the past, that's been the case with us. No one has
respected us as a team that's willing to go out and take a game.
And until you show a team that you're willing to do whatever it
takes and you're not going to be walked over, as we have been in
the past, being swept 4-0 each year, they're going to continue to
do it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about winning the game,'' he said. ``And my whole
attitude is simply do whatever it takes to win, that's what Game 6
will have to be about. There is no, 'Oh, I wish I could have done
this,' 'I wish I would have stepped up to Jalen Rose,' or 'I wish I
would have been more aggressive with Rik Smits or boxed this one
out' or 'I wish my energy would have been a lot higher than Austin
Croshere's.' There is none of that. So you don't meet it, you bring
an energy that's greater than theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the Lakers often misplace that energy when
they leave town. They have failed in all five elimination games on
the road, often badly.
</P>
<P>
   But then they come home and produce routs and miracles: A
27-point rout of Sacramento to win the first round, a 22-point
demolition of Phoenix to win the second round, a fourth-quarter
comeback from 15 points down to defeat Portland in the conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when we take a whuppin' like that, we respond well,''
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, give the Lakers a few minutes of embarrassment,
and they'll respond with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talking about stuff like that because I'm a
little superstitious,'' Robert Horry said, ``but hopefully,
everything will stay true to form. Every time we play bad, really
bad, we usually come out and play well. Hopefully, we can keep it
the same.''

TIGER LEAVES PEERS IN WOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There goes the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's old neighborhood. And Watson's. And Hogan's.
</P>
<P>
   Golf, not to mention its storied links at Pebble Beach, will
never seem the same anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, golf's fresh prince, gave the grand game a four-day
makeover this past weekend. Par, the official language, never
sounded so plain.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers are not supposed to win the U.S. Open by 15 strokes.
Golfers are supposed to hack their way around a U.S. Open course,
lose a dozen Titleists and pray the rosary for pars.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was Sunday for all to see. It was Secretariat
again, charging alone down the home stretch at the Belmont. It was
Joe Montana, lapping the Broncos. It was Bush, steamrolling
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who refuse to sit still for televised golf, it
became riveting TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling how he could lap the field like that,'' Dr.
Trey Holland, president of the U.S. Golf Association, said at
Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, perhaps, dads will tell their sons how on
Father's Day, 2000, they sat in front of the family Sony and
watched the great Tiger Woods run rings around the best golfers in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, Tiger does it again. Which he well might.
</P>
<P>
   There goes the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods began the final round Sunday with a 10-stroke lead,
it broke a record that had been on the U.S. Open books for 79
years. Had Tiger simply toured the Pebble Beach, Calif., course in
par, his closest pursuer, Ernie Els, would have had to shoot a 60
to overtake him.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Nor did young Woods, who closed with a 4-under 67
and, in the process, made a mockery of everyone else's 72-hole
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Nick Faldos, the Vijay Singhs, the Colin Montgomeries. While
Woods was making 21 birdies, the best score that any of the mere
mortals in the field could shoot for the four days was 3 over par.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Woods talked about the ``sense of calmness'' that he felt
all week.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe he did. But his fellow pros looked like fawns caught
in the headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was golf, not a Don King weigh-in. What you saw, though,
was a psych job, an intimidation the likes of which golf has never
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III said it back at the Bay Hill tournament in March
and was promptly shussed by his fellow pros. The best players in
the world don't get intimidated by anyone, they tsk-tsked.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. And why did they all seem to wet their Dockers this
week when they saw Tiger begin to pull away at Pebble Beach?
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, many seem to remain gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magical,'' pro Bobby Clampett said. ``But nothing he does
surprises me.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tom Watson: ``He has set a standard only he can reach. And
it's a great thing for the popularity of golf. He brings to the
game youth, diversity and commitment _ and it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some pros might even share Watson's sentiments. But I
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Does golf need the weekly competition to be successful? History
suggests that golf, indeed, thrives when it boasts a dominant
player _ a Ben Hogan, an Arnold Palmer or a Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   But it also thrived, in part, because Palmer was challenged by
Nicklaus, who in turn had to vie each week with the likes of Lee
Trevino, Gary Player and eventually Watson.
</P>
<P>
   After last week, who is Tiger Woods' Trevino?
</P>
<P>
   David Duval? Get serious.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia? Check back in two years.
</P>
<P>
   When he played at Colonial in 1997, Woods was 21 and
temperamental. With a chance to win on the tournament's final day,
he swan-dived to a 72, making double bogey twice. All day long, he
muttered. He cussed. On the ninth fairway, he got admonished by a
playing partner for rudely walking ahead while the player was still
shooting. Woods left Colonial that day in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   But the Woods we see now is three years older and three years
wiser. His well-chronicled outburst Saturday morning was quelled
quickly with an apology and an afternoon of birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Replaced, he said, by the ``sense of calmness.''
</P>
<P>
   Calmness? Easy for Tiger Woods to say.
</P>
<P>
   There goes the neighborhood. Wow. nn

DODGERS BEAT CARDINALS AT OWN GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fans with tickets for the outfield seats knew
better than to follow the Los Angeles tradition of arriving late.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour before Sunday's game against the St. Louis
Cardinals, both the left- and right-field bleachers at Dodger
Stadium were filled with more fans than usual through the first few
innings of a game. The chance to see Mark McGwire take batting
practice prompted the early arrivals, but there was no shortage of
power hitting early in the game either - and it wasn't all from
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, McGwire hit a two-run home run to right
field that went an estimated 425 feet, but home runs by Eric Karros
and Adrian Beltre helped the Dodgers to a 6-3 victory in front of
50,713 and prevented the Cardinals from sweeping the three-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' leadoff home run to left field in the second inning was
his 20th of the season. It marks the quickest Karros has reached
the mark and makes him the fourth player in Dodgers history to have
at least six consecutive 20-home run seasons, tying him with Ron
Cey and trailing only Gil Hodges (11) and Duke Snider (nine).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's home run was his 25th of the season and second in as
many days, giving him 546 for his career, one shy of Mike Schmidt
for seventh on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Shawon Dunston came close to adding another home run
when he led off the third inning with a drive that bounced back
into fair territory after hitting the top of the fence in left
field. Dunston was thrown out trying to advance to third on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   No extra-base hits were required to give the Dodgers the lead an
inning after Karros brought them within one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When E.K. hit it, hit that home run, it made them come down,''
Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park said of the shift in momentum he felt.
</P>
<P>
   Park started the four-run third inning with a single and Todd
Hollandsworth reached on a fielder's-choice grounder. Mark
Grudzielanek followed with a single to right field that drew a
throwing error, which brought in the tying run and advanced
Grudzielanek to third. Grudzielanek scored the go-ahead run by
beating Ray Lankford's throw to the plate on a sacrifice fly by
Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre extended the lead to 6-2 with a two-out, two-run home run
to left center, after which only one player from either side
advanced past second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging, but we're still not swinging up and down the
lineup like I'd like us to,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Park (9-4) faced the minimum three batters in the third, fourth
and sixth innings. He earned his fifth consecutive win and finished
with nine strikeouts and no walks in seven innings. The
right-hander was removed after the seventh inning because of
cramping in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other time, I'd let him keep going,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis starter Darryl Kile (10-4) did not allow a hit in his
final three innings before being replaced by Heathcliff Slocumb in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw retired the side in order for the Dodgers in the ninth
to earn his first save since May 19.

RANGERS FINISH WORST ROAD TRIP SINCE '86 WITH A THUD
</HEADLINE>
 RAYS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The lineup squandered scoring
opportunities and failed to produce an extra-base hit for only the
second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh-inning error allowed four unearned runs to cross the
plate, and, of course, the offense grounded into two more double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Texas Rangers put the finishing touches on their worst
road trip in 14 seasons with Sunday's 6-1 loss to the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing good ball right now,'' right-hander Rick
Helling said, ``and I don't think you can single out any one
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Rangers' nine-game swing through Colorado,
Baltimore and Tampa Bay produced one victory. That leaves the
Rangers' 0-for-7 run through Detroit and New York in July 1986 as
the franchise's undisputed champion of unproductive travel.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the defending division champions returned to Texas
last night trailing the American League West-leading Oakland
Athletics by 71/2 games after their 10th loss in 11 contests.
</P>
<P>
   The events of Sunday's seventh inning condemned Helling (7-6) to
his fifth consecutive loss in as many starts despite surrendering
only two earned runs and few well-hit balls through 6 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   A double-play ground ball off the bat of center fielder Gabe
Kapler ridded Devil Rays right-hander Rick White (2-4) of the
potential tying run on base in the seventh inning after Mike Lamb's
leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   Matters only worsened during the bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Luis Alicea owned the league's third-best fielding
percentage (.979) among second baseman entering Sunday's game, but
his one-out throwing error opened the floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays shortstop Ozzie Guillen hit a ground ball toward the
middle of the infield with Bobby Smith running on the pitch.
Smith's presence near second base forced Alicea to rush his feed to
shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea's back-handed toss sailed over Clayton's head and into
left field, and Smith scored the Devil Rays' third run all the way
from first.
</P>
<P>
   The out not recorded also granted the Devil Rays an extra at-bat
during the inning, and it proved even more costly. Helling pitched
around switch-hitting outfielder Quinton McCracken after falling
behind in the count. The walk loaded the bases for left fielder
Bubba Trammell, who had struck out swinging on a curveball in his
previous at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Two curveballs from Helling put Trammell at an 0-2 hole, and
fastballs on the next two pitches set up another curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was down and away,'' Helling said. ``It might not even have
been a strike. It was the first one he touched all day. He just got
enough of the bat on it to put it in play. It was a good pitch. It
was right where I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trammell hit the pitch off the end of the bat and dumped it into
shallow left-center field. Left fielder Rusty Greer sprinted and
dived in vain, and Trammell strolled into second base with a
three-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time before he really got me on a curveball,'' Trammell
said. ``I knew I was going to get it again. Fortunately, I got it
out of the infield, and it fell in. Rusty made a great try.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, though, out of Greer's reach, much like victories for
Helling of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everything that can go wrong is going wrong for
me right now,'' Helling said. ``It gets frustrating. You get tired
of going out there and feeling like you're doing the job and have
nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rangers returned home with little to show for this road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make it,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``We go through streaks like this every year. We'll get the
starting pitching straightened out, and we'll get home, regroup and
it will be fine.'' nn

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-U.S. (Prague, Czech Republic) _ The Clinton
administration is exploring with some of its NATO allies and Russia
the possibility that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia be
allowed to leave office with guarantees for his safety and his
savings, senior U.S. and NATO officials say. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ Much has changed in Mexico to
make the current race for the presidency the fairest and most
competitive in the country's history. What has not changed,
opposition and election officials say, is the ruling party's
long-entrenched system of vote-buying and coercion. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ By relaxing rules and applying only a
spotty enforcement of travel restrictions, the Clinton
administration is opening Cuba to American travelers at a rate not
seen in more than 40 years. While administration officials deny
that the increased travel is intended to undermine the 38-year-old
embargo against Cuba, the new flow has given rise to a flurry of
business, personal and political contacts and there is a renewed
push in some circles _ both Democratic and Republican _ to relax
the commercial boycott, one of the last relics of the increasingly
distant Cold War. By Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-COAL (Datong, China) _ The harsh face of coal mining in
China _ a country that, its own alarmed officials admit, has the
world's worst record of mine safety. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-VIOLENCE (Harare, Zimbabwe) _ Zimbabweans have been
looking hopefully toward neighboring South Africa as the waves of
political violence and lawlessness wash across this beleaguered
country. By Rachel Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS-ALAMOS-SECURITY (Los Alamos, N.M.) _ The government was
already facing hurdles in its efforts to prosecute a scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, but last week's disclosures that two hard drives filled
with highly sensitive weapons data had inexplicably vanished have
potentially made it far more difficult for prosecutors in what had
once been described as a major national security case. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has insisted from the time he was indicted
last year that security breaches at the laboratory are common, and
that the kind of downloading he did -- moving classified data, in
the open, from a secure to unsecured computer, then downloading it
to tapes -- was done frequently by other experts protecting data
from an unreliable computer system. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   VT-HEALTH-BENEFITS (Cowtown, Vt.) _ With health insurance for
nearly all children and prescription drug coverage for many people
on Medicare, Vermont is in the vanguard in terms of providing
medical benefits. The array of health benefits Vermont affords its
citizens _ not just the elderly but also children and low-income
adults _ is unmatched by any other state. And while many of
Vermont's programs would not work in larger, more urban, more
racially and ethnically diverse states, other aspects could serve
as a pattern elsewhere. Today, 93.5 percent of all Vermonters have
health insurance, including essentially all children. By contrast,
only 63 percent of low-income children in Texas and 60 percent in
Arizona are insured. What it all means, based on interviews with
the governor, doctors and ordinary folks who depend on the
benefits. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-TAKESHITA (Undated) _ Former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, who reigned as one of Japan's top kingmakers long after
he was driven from office by scandal in 1989, died on Monday after
an extended illness, a hospital official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   CULT-KIDS (Island Pond, Vt.) _ In June 1984, state police raided
a cult called the Northeast Kingdom Community Church and rounded up
all the children to examine them for evidence of child abuse.
Stories about the alleged abuse were rampant at the time. A judge
disallowed the raid and the examinations, but the case made a big
splash nationally. The children who were rounded up in the raid
will hold a `teach-in' on Sunday in the town beach in Island Pond.
The list of invited speakers includes both the children, some of
the key law-enforcement officials who conducted the raid, the man
who was commissioner of child-protective services at the time, and
presumably some of the church members. By Sally Johnson.

   GORE (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore plans in a speech on
Tuesday to propose a $200 billion program to help low- and
middle-income taxpayers build retirement accounts separate from
what they will receive from Social Security, his aides said. By
Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BIO-III (New Haven, Conn.) _ Born at the earliest fringe of
the baby boom, Bush was pressed during his years at Yale to take
sides in the great battles then unfolding over politics, civil
rights, drugs and music. Mostly he was a noncombatant in those
upheavals, but when forced to choose he ultimately retreated to the
values and ideals established by his parents' generation. Unlike
others of his generation, like Clinton or Gore, Bush never wore his
hair long, agonized over Vietnam, wrestled with existentialism or
cranked up Rolling Stones songs to annoy his parents (instead of
hard rock music, he listened to soul). Even today, Bush thunders in
his stump speeches against boomer-style self-indulgence and appeals
for a ``responsibility era'' that in some respects sounds like the
1950s; he likes values as clean-cut as his hair. By Nicholas D.
Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-VP (Austin, Texas) _ With little more than a month to go
before Gov. George W. Bush, the de facto Republican presidential
nominee, settles on the person with whom he wants to share the
ticket, the list of possibilities seems to be getting shorter. But
that does not mean it is getting a whole lot clearer, because Bush
is holding his cards so close to the vest that even his most
trusted advisers insist they have not been able to sneak a peek. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-MEDIA (Scranton, Pa.) _ A series of incidents last week
illustrates what is, in the view of some Democrats and Republicans
alike, Al Gore's surprisingly tough struggle to get out a message
that clicks with voters. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   COVERDALE-PROFILE (Washington) _ Ask just about anyone in the
U.S. Senate and they will say this about Paul Coverdell, the
Republican senator from Georgia: If you want something done, and
done well, and you don't want the person hogging all the glory,
call Coverdell. It is one reason he ascended into the Senate
Republican leadership so quickly, as a mere freshman. By Lizette
Alvarez.

<P>
   TV-SURVIVIOR-RATINGS _ ``Survivor,'' a breakout hit in every
way, has stunned the television industry by generating for CBS the
kind of ratings with young viewers that normally are associated
with shows on the Fox network or ABC. Last week, ``Survivor''
pulled in the most viewers under the age of 50 of any series CBS
has played on a Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in the entire 13-year
history of the Nielsen people-meter system. By Bill Carter and

   TALENT-AGENT (Los Angeles) _ Since taking the president's job at
the Beverly Hills headquarters of William Morris last August, the
talent agent Jim Wiatt has not just sought to fix William Morris
but has shaken up the talent agency business with a relentless
effort to lure stars from his old employer, only two miles away.
Even by the brass-knuckle standards of two former William Morris
agents, Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, who used similar tactics 20
years ago to turn Creative Artists into the town's dominant agency,
Wiatt's efforts have been surprising, dramatic and fast-moving. By

   INTERNET-MESSAGES (San Francisco) _ Despite the explosive
popularity of instant-messaging programs on the Internet, it became
apparent last week that one facet of the service may not be instant
at all: It may be a year or more before users of competing
instant-message services can send missives to one another. By Matt
Richtel.

<P>
   NORTEL-CANADA (Undated) _ Nortel, the Canadian
telecommunications equipment giant, has become a company for the
Americas. It is growing so rapidly outside Canada that doubts are
being expressed at home about its corporate citizenship. Its
headquarters remains in Brampton, Ontario, but more of its 75,000
employees live and work south of the Canada-U.S. border than north
of it. And these days, just 9 percent of its $18 billion in
revenues comes from Canada. By Anthony DePalma.

machines, uses humor to exhort consumers to dump the contents of
their piggy banks into the company's machines and become empowered
by their ``newfound'' money. By Courtney Kane.
</P>
<P>
   PC-FUTURE (San Francisco) _ As Microsoft prepares to announce
its Next Generation Windows Services initiative this week, an
influential computer scientist is circulating a thesis that must be
music to Bill Gates' ears. Countering the industry's common wisdom
that we're entering the post-PC era, David Galernter of Yale

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH - The other Open, now (begin ital)that(end ital)
was a thriller.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiger Woods was playing one-on-one with history in his
runaway victory at the U.S. Open, the best competition in the
centennial national championship was the race for second place at
Pebble Beach Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els of South Africa and Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez
prevailed in that 62-man shootout, tying at 3-over-par 287 for a
score that matched other notable winning efforts at other notably
difficult Open courses.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Hale Irwin shot in 1974 at Winged Foot, when he won
his first of three Open championships. It's what Jack Fleck shot
when he upset four-time Open winner Ben Hogan in 1955 at The
Olympic Club. And it's what's Hogan hammered out at Merion and
Oakland Hills, when he won his back-to-back titles in 1950 and '51.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' record-setting victory might have flattened the field,
but many of his closest pursuers were playing solid golf. They were
undone not just by Woods' brilliant play but by the way already
difficult Pebble Beach was set up by the U.S. Golf Association -
which doesn't like to see its championships won at under par.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA accomplished its goal with everyone but Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played different tournament after two rounds, you know?''
said Jimenez, who was 3-under-par before going bogey-bogey on his
final two holes to finish ever-par 71 ``And I feel very - I feel
like I had to play a different tournament. It was a great
performance. It was great to finish second.''
</P>
<P>
   Els liked much of his own effort, as well, after he and Jimenez
topped the tournament within the tournament by a stroke over John
Huston. Seven others were within four strokes of Els and Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I played good enough to get myself in great figures,''
Els said after a closing 70. ``It was a bit disappointing when I
saw there was no chance of catching Tiger,... I wanted to play a
solid, good round of golf, which I did from tee to green, but just
missed a lot of putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Huston, who finished fourth alone at 288.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I feel like I played pretty well,'' he said. ``It
doesn't look very well compared to what Tiger is doing, but neither
does anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston, 39, was optimistic after his best Open finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'm getting better as I'm getting older,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's Padraig Harrington, who wound up tied for seventh with
England's Lee Westwood at 289, two strokes off the second
tournament lead, called it ``a great week up until the seventh hole
today.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Harrington was 3-under par for his round but went
bogey-bogey on Nos. 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' he said, ``I seemed to lose it, lost the
adrenaline and lost focus.... But I certainly learned a few things
today that will help me in my future.''
</P>
<P>
   England's Nick Faldo was a stroke back at 290, followed by Vijay
Singh of Fiji, Stewart Cink, David Duval and Loren Roberts - all at
291.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, the reigning Masters champion, was the sharpest of Woods'
pursuers on Sunday, shooting a closing 68 for second-best score of
the final round. But he wound up disappointed for his overall
effort after shooting 80 in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play well,'' he said. ``Obviously, my goal was to
win. I guess that didn't materialize.... I'm very, very
disappointed. I'm a little a lot more disappointed than I ever was.
So that's the way it goes.''

WOODS WINS U.S. OPEN BY (GASP) 15 SHOTS

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ At the 100th U.S. Open, golfer after
golfer raised a white flag and surrendered. In the end, all that
was left flapping in the stiff ocean breeze was stars and stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at attention were 32,000 golf fans at Pebble Beach,
plus millions more in front of their TV screens, all in awe of a
record-breaking, history-making and Open-defying four days by Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess I won,'' he said coyly. ``It was a great week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Open is meant to punish, leave lasting scars. Woods, more
than the elements, had the world's best players sobbing and
cowering, scoring a 15-stroke victory _ the largest winning margin
in a major championship; the second-largest, by a stroke, in a PGA
Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   He stumbled on just seven of 72 holes. He didn't three-putt all
week.
</P>
<P>
   He simply treated some of golf's oldest records as if they were
flagsticks, and hit it stiff every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully he'll tell us he used his `A' game this week,''
Irish golfer Padraig Harrington said. ``We'd believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot 12-under-par 272, tying an Open record previously set
by Jack Nicklaus in 1980 at Baltusrol and Lee Janzen in 1993 at
Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first wire-to-wire Open winner since Tony Jacklin
in 1970 at Hazeltine.
</P>
<P>
   His 15-stroke victory in a major tournament surpassed by two a
century-old record set by Tom Morris in the 1862 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot 4-under 67 Sunday, leaving him bogey-free in his
first and fourth rounds at Pebble. The victory was the 20th of his
career, his third major and worth $800,000, giving him season
earnings of $4,949,731 and career earnings of $16,264,860.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt for the longest time that someone was going to
come along who could drive the ball 300 yards and putt like (Ben)
Crenshaw,'' Nick Price said. ``Well, this guy drives the ball
better than anyone I've seen and putts better than Crenshaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Players joked that the Open was hosting two tournaments this
time: one for Woods and one for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez and South African Ernie Els shot
287 to split runner-up money, each receiving $390,150. At the top,
it was two foreigners and a player from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finishing second is good,'' Els said. ``But I'm kind of
embarrassed finishing 15 strokes behind the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the USGA implements 8-foot rough, 10-foot
wide fairways and greens shaved to the sand level for the 2001
Open. If nothing else, golf's governing body should consider a
separate set of Tiger tees.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, hold those changes. The Open might have
trouble finding someone for Woods to play with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they try taking him out of his game, they'll make it
impossible for the rest of us,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by 10 strokes over Els entering the final round, Woods was
greeted by a rock concert roar when he stepped on the first tee.
Yet he wasn't about to do anything foolish.
</P>
<P>
   He parred his first nine holes, keeping the ball in play and
hitting every green. The plan was simple.
</P>
<P>
   Patience brought rewards. Woods birdied the 10th, 12th, 13th and
14th holes, dropping putts from a foot to 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with bogey only at the par-4 16th, when he overshot
the green and ran a chip out of the deep grass 15 feet past the
pin. But he calmly curled the ball into the cup to save par and let
go with one of his trademark fist pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have a day where I made no bogeys,'' he said. ``I
went up and buried that putt and it felt so good to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods easily strode up the 18th fairway, boats sounded their
horns in the bay and the boisterous crowd leaned hard on the ropes,
threatening to overrun deputies and security guards. A few unruly
people were even chased down in the stands and escorted out.
</P>
<P>
   When he putted out for par on the final hole, Woods wearily
plucked his ball from the cup, hugged his caddy, Steve Williams,
and Els, removed his hat and smiled and waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made important par putts,'' Woods said at the media center.
``I kept telling you guys every time I came in here that I made
those big par putts. You have to make them in the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, winner of the 1997 Masters and 1999 PGA Championship,
needs only a British Open to complete a personal grand slam. Only
four other golfers have accomplished this feat: Ben Hogan, Jack
Nicklaus, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will get his chance in a month. A Union Jack would hang
nicely with the checkered flag he got for lapping the field.

WEARY SPARKS HOLD ON

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Under the circumstances, Coach Michael
Cooper said he was pleased with the way his Sparks played.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, but what do you expect after back-to-back
games and having to board a plane at 4 a.m. on Sunday to make the
trek back from Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to perform at a maximum level, but a win
is a win and we saw some good things tonight,'' Cooper said of his
team's 70-62 win over the Charlotte Sting on Sunday evening before
a crowd of 4,847 at the Forum. ``We had just played a tough game up
in Portland where we could have lost, but we came back with another
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve turnovers and .397 shooting percentage clearly revealed
that the Sparks (6-2) were tired, but their efforts were good
enough for the win over bottom-of-the-barrel Charlotte (1-8).
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Sparks played to the level of their competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the Sparks' slow start and subpar numbers, both
halves were clearly dominated by Mwadi Mabika and Co.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, Mabika led the Sparks in scoring,
this time with 21 points and five rebounds. Against Portland the
night before, the starting forward sizzled with a career-high 26
points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's definitely raised it up a notch,'' Cooper said. ``We're
looking to do some things to get her more shot opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabika has turned things around after a five-point performance
against Seattle on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've just been trying to be more aggressive, trying to
penetrate more,'' Mabika said.
</P>
<P>
   And Lisa Leslie, of course, added the rest of the offense needed
to get the job done, tallying 20 points, six blocked shots and five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, on the other hand, struggled. The Sting turned the
ball over 22 times, which Los Angeles in turn cashed in for 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the one area we did not do so good in,'' Coach T.R.
Dunn said. ``We turned the ball over way too much and a lot of
those turnovers were unforced.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, nine of those turnovers resulted in an eight-
point Sparks run, and in the second half, similar sloppy play
enabled Los Angeles to keep its comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch, the Stings' Summer Erb, a first-year WNBA
player, scored 16 of her 21 points. But that wouldn't be enough to
come close to the Sparks even on an apparent off night.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles faces a much bigger task on Tuesday night, when the
Sparks play host to the three-time defending WNBA champion Houston
Comets at the Forum at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, however, believes his team will be ready for that test
against the Western Conference leaders after a good day and a half
of rest.

CAMPBELL DESERVING AS STORM'S FOCAL POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From all different sections of KeyArena Sunday night,
you could hear a few enlightened refrains from Storm fans eager for
the home team to build itself a lead:
</P>
<P>
   ``Set a screen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the ball to Edna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, Edna.''
</P>
<P>
   And out on the floor, where the Storm could not seize an
opportunity against a Utah team missing star players Jennifer Azzi
and Natalie Williams, the calls seemed just about right.
</P>
<P>
   The ball in Edna Campbell's hands is a reassuring thing.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, with that cool and control and the funky little
hitch-step at the start of her dribble, is a sight that can inspire
hope that something good might happen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Storm is going to make any noise this inaugural season,
it's because Campbell is the focal point of this expansion team
that coach Lin Dunn correctly calls a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Natalie Williams special? Hell yes. Is Edna Campbell
special? Absolutely,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edna Campbells don't come along in a lifetime. People like her
having something they're just born with. She has tremendous heart.
She can't stand to lose. She's a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Storm roster turnover has been furious since the first game
of the season. Dunn has used the waiver wire like it was a jump
rope, sending players skipping back and forth across the country in
an effort to bring in new blood, fresher legs, quicker hands and,
most importantly, more offensive firepower.
</P>
<P>
   But while Dunn two-stepped to get unsigned free agent Stacy
Lovelace into a Storm uniform, and while Dunn cajoled the Cleveland
franchise to deal starting guard Michelle Edwards to Seattle, it is
Campbell who is holding up the torch for where and how the Storm
must play to win.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, in a 56-53 loss to the Starzz, it was Campbell
alone who could uncork any sort of offense, especially in the first
half, where the Storm's reliance on Campbell was both correct and
yet alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we relied on Edna in the first half,'' Dunn said. ``We
rely on Edna always. Before the game. During the game. After the
game. All the time. Edna's definitely our go-to player. We're
starting to help her share the load, but we've got to start getting
some productivity from our inside people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of natural talent. We've got Edna. We've
got Michelle, but our post players are a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   When Campbell was lifted for a substitution with 8:13 left in
the half, the Storm was leading 10-8 in an abysmal shooting game.
Campbell, who scored a game-high 21 points, was 4-for-4 for eight
points at that point while the rest of the Storm was 0-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Dunn made an attempt to get better ball
movement. But when it came down to crunch time, after the Starzz
had pulled away from a tie at 47 and something needed to be done,
the ball was back in Campbell's hands.
</P>
<P>
   She is the lone shooter on a team aching for some more offensive
talent.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 seconds left, Campbell hit a 6-foot jumper to pull the
Storm within three, 54-51. She hit a 5-foot running jumper with 7.8
seconds left to close the gap to 55-53.
</P>
<P>
   After Kate Starbird went to the line to make it 56-53, it was
Campbell who hoisted a 25-footer with about 1 second left to end
the game _ another game that told Campbell something about her
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ice the cake,'' Campbell said. ``We're not
finishing the job. We need to dig down deep and believe we can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an impossible wish, certainly. But what the Storm needs is
one more Edna Campbell. Maybe even two, but let's not get piggish.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Storm is lucky enough to have the original Edna
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, a nine-year pro who has played in Brazil and Poland and
the ABL and one year with the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA, Campbell
is everything Dunn promised: Edna the Engine. Edna the scorer. Edna
the heart and soul of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Although Campbell is entirely too humble to make much ado about
her contributions, it is impossible to say where the team would be
right now without her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Storm's atrocious shooting Sunday night, Campbell
has been a treasure to watch so far this season. And during the
three-game homestand that the Storm completed Sunday night against
Utah, the one thing that consistently shined for the Storm was
Campbell, whose game-high 22-points Tuesday night led to a Storm
upset of the L.A. Sparks in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lights up the room with her smile. She lights up the arena
with her intensity and her effort. She lights up the community when
she goes into a school to talk about breast health awareness or
drug abuse or whatever. She's just a tremendous person,'' Dunn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is her third system she's had to learn in three years.
She was in the ABL. She was in the Phoenix system. Now she's thrust
in the Seattle Storm system. And we knew it would take a little
time for her to adapt to what we wanted her to do and she needed
some help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Storm is lucky to have Campbell in the house. But Dunn is
right. Campbell needs help. Someone to set her some good screens. A
post player inside she can feed or pick and roll with.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Storm fans have identified Edna Campbell as the go-to
woman. Now she just needs some more players to go with her.

 CONTROLLER FAILED TO REPORT NEAR-COLLISION AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT  
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A US Airways Airbus and a smaller turboprop plane
came within 100 feet of colliding at La Guardia Airport last week,
but the air traffic controller responsible for the incident never
reported it to the Federal Aviation Administration as required, the
FAA said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that the controller, whose name was not
released, committed an operational error and then compounded it by
failing to report it, an FAA official said. The controller has been
decertified and may be fired, said the FAA official, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The near-collision early last Monday, just after midnight,
between an Airbus A-320, which had just landed, and a Beech King
Air turboprop that was taking off, came as air safety regulators
are focusing increased attention on near-collisions and on
conditions at La Guardia in particular.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board released a
study that found that the risk of collisions on the ground between
airplanes had been growing lately because of increasing air
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, the National Transportation Safety Board told
the FAA that La Guardia's rules for spacing between planes landing
and taking off on intersecting runways, which allow a plane to
depart as long as no large plane is within two miles of landing, do
not allow enough space. The board's recommendation was prompted by
a near-collision at La Guardia in April 1998 in which a landing
DC-9 missed a departing Airbus A-320 by as little as 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, too, was never reported by La Guardia
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   In last Monday's incident, which was first reported in Monday's
Washington Post, the controller cleared the Airbus to land on La
Guardia's Runway 4 at 12:18 a.m., the FAA official said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Airbus touched down, the controller cleared the turboprop
to take off on Runway 31, which intersects Runway 4 at a right
angle. The turboprop passed less than 100 feet above the Airbus,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was reported by the Airbus's pilot on Thursday, the
FAA official said, although the controller was required to report
the incident to supervisors and to the FAA immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The controller failed to report another near-collision that
occurred on Dec. 2, 1998, the FAA official said. After that
incident, which was found to be the controller's fault, the
controller was decertified, retrained and put back on the job, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the controller may be dealt with more harshly, the
FAA official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real crime is not reporting it,'' the official said. ``If
you make a mistake, that's fine, we're all human, and it can be
corrected. But when you fail to tell your supervisor, that's a
no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   The controller, the official said, ``could be canned.''

MARINOVICH LEADS AVENGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not logical for a team with a 2-8 record to
talk about making the playoffs, but the Avengers might have a
reason to start thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   The team is beginning to take shape after a month full of roster
moves, and the Avengers earned their second victory in three games
by beating the Florida Bobcats 63-49 in front of 8,578 at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers won for the first time in front of the home fans,
set a new franchise high for points in a game and completed their
longest play from scrimmage, a 45-yard touchdown pass from Todd
Marinovich to Anthony Rice in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The recent success is thanks in large part to the continued
improvement of quarterback Marinovich, who completed 13 of 22
passes for 200 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to definitely get the hang of it,'' Marinovich
said. ``A lot of it is that I'm getting the time to throw back
there, which I didn't have much of before. ... We're talking about
the playoffs, definitely. Right now, we feel like we can beat
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Playoff talk is a little premature, even though 12 of the
league's 17 teams will advance to the postseason and the Avengers
continue to improve on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter was the best indicator of that improvement.
The Bobcats (3-6) tied the game 42-42 on a 40-yard field goal by
Joe O'Donnell as the buzzer sounded to end the third quarter, but
the Avengers responded with perhaps their most impressive drive of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking from arena football decorum, the Avengers gave the ball
to fullback Andy Chilcote four times in a nine-play, 43-yard drive
that took six minutes, eight seconds off the clock. Marinovich
found Chris Jackson in the corner of the end zone for a 49-42 lead
and the Avengers led the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can run the ball, it makes it harder for the
secondary to cover the receivers, because they never know where the
ball is going to go,'' Chilcote said. ``When you have a six-minute
drive ... the guys look at each other in the huddle, and no matter
how tired we are, we just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida quarterback Jim Arellanes misfired on three consecutive
pass attempts, and the Avengers had the ball back less than two
minutes after their long drive against an obviously winded Bobcats
defense. The Avengers pushed the lead to 56-42 three plays later
when Marinovich found former USC teammate Travis Hannah for a
23-yard touchdown pass with 4:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Florida got to within seven points with 47 seconds remaining on
a 2-yard scoring run by Steve Gorrie, but Victor Hall recovered the
onside kick at the Florida 6. Chilcote capped the scoring with a
4-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said he believes the Avengers have a realistic chance to
make the playoffs if they win their four remaining games, three of
which are against teams with sub-.500 records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing right now,'' said Rice, who caught two touchdown
passes, ``is to keep going forward, and not go backward.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ANGLOMANIA: A European Love Affair &LR;  By Ian Buruma. Vintage,
$14. The author, whose Jewish great-grandparents left Bismarck's
Germany to settle in England, examines an idea that has taken many
forms in the European imagination over the centuries: the idea of
Britain. ``His own and his family's story is artfully woven''
through the book, ``making this both a memoir and a work of
intellectual history,'' Alexander Stille wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLLECTED POEMS: 1920-1954 &LR;  By Eugenio Montale. Translated by
Jonathan Galassi. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $18. This bilingual
version of the three major books of one of Italy's greatest poets
(1896-1981) is filled with verse ``of an unignorable kind'' and
features ``Galassi's superb translation ... and commentary,''
Nicholas Jenkins wrote last year. Montale was ``an unequaled
chronicler of the seedy but meaningful edges of modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; REPAIR &LR; , by C.K. Williams
($12), a Pulitzer Prize-winning collection by an American poet
known for his ``exact, bewildering, slant rendering of raw emotion
and careful thought,'' as one critic put it in 1999. ``Williams
spares neither himself nor the reader anything. This is his
singular genius and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEANOR ROOSEVELT. The Defining Years: Volume 2, 1933-1938 &LR;  By
Blanche Wiesen Cook. Penguin, $17.95. In her continuing account of
the iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners first lady, the author
``continues her diligent pentimento, getting at the tender,
sprightly creature behind the starchy, strident image, chronicling
how the timid housewife ... shed her chrysalis and turned into the
New Deal's relentless `Eleanor Everywhere,''' Maureen Dowd wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HANNIBAL &LR;  By Thomas Harris. Dell, $7.99. The third part of the
author's horror trilogy about the far reaches of abnormal
psychiatry involves a rematch between the intrepid FBI agent
Clarice Starling and her nemesis, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, aka Hannibal
the Cannibal. Last year the reviewer Stephen King called this ``one
of the two most frightening popular novels of our time, the other
being `The Exorcist.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LETTERS FROM YELLOWSTONE &LR;  By Diane Smith. Penguin, $12.95. In
1898, a young medical student and avid botanist becomes the sole
woman on a Smithsonian-backed expedition to Yellowstone National
Park. Last year one critic called this ``a thoroughly enjoyable,
intriguingly offbeat epistolary novel'' with ``a host of memorable
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ART OF THE MOVING PICTURE &LR;  By Vachel Lindsay. Modern
Library, $14.95. In one of the earliest books of serious film
criticism, the poet champions the silent films of D.W. Griffith and
others. ``He is eloquent in his repudiation of whatever slur there
be in the term `canned drama,''' The New York Times Book Review
said in 1916. Lindsay ``has a vision of the nation remade by this
new art form which cuts deeper than the newspaper or the public
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern Library, as part of a series on the movies, has also
reissued  &UR; AGEE ON FILM: Criticism and Comment on the Movies &LR; , by
James Agee ($14.95), a collection of reviews that originally
appeared in Time magazine and The Nation in the 1940s, and several
other essays, including ones on John Huston and silent comedy
written for Life magazine. ``Each of his reviews brings the movie
before you, alive and whole,'' Richard Griffith wrote here in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; MEMO FROM DAVID O. SELZNICK &LR; , selected and edited by Rudy
Behlmer ($15.95), the legendary producer of ``Gone With the Wind''
and ``Rebecca'' is given flesh though his voluminous
correspondence, primarily his private letters, telegrams and
memorandums. ``Selznick was at once a brilliant man and an
unmitigated interfering nuisance,'' Charles Higham wrote in 1972,
and his memos ``make harrowing reading.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREEMPTING THE HOLOCAUST &LR;  By Lawrence L. Langer. Yale
University, $12.95. In these essays, a scholar argues that the
Holocaust was an act of pure evil ``beyond guilt and atonement,''
with no redeeming lessons and without heroes or martyrs, only
victims. ``Always thoughtful and provocative, he writes about
complex moral issues in a lucid and forceful style,'' Lore
Dickstein wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE BREAD OR I'LL APPEAR &LR;  By Emer Martin. Anchor, $12. In this
novel about an Irish family struggling to stay connected, a young
woman journeys to Japan and Central America in search of her older
sister, who fled home 14 years earlier. Her ``odyssey movingly
reveals the harm of clinging to the past, even in the name of
family,'' Megan Harlan wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE METAPHYSICAL TOUCH &LR;  By Sylvia Brownrigg. Picador USA, $15.
This first novel uses a weird online romance between a lonely
graduate student in philosophy and a suicidal, possibly
nonexistent, author to explore the nature of being and the
intersection of the physical and metaphysical worlds. The result is
``a serious and intelligently wrought piece of fiction,'' Geoff
Nicholson said in 1999.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 10, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To each religion its own articles of faith, but when the
denomination is as large as the Southern Baptist Convention -- the
600-pound gorilla among American Protestants -- and a policy is as
retrograde as the one the recent convention adopted, matters of
faith can ripple out into consequences beyond the ken of the
faithful alone.
</P>
<P>
   The messengers that's Baptist for ``delegates'' -- to the
Orlando convention voted to disallow women as pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Other faiths also bar women from their pulpits, most notably,
thanks to agitation within the ranks, the Roman Catholic Church.
The Southern Baptists, however, recanted a practice that had been
traditional. If the Catholics are stuck in their policy, the
Southern Baptists are not. They are going backwards.
</P>
<P>
   The policy continues the convention's 20-year drive toward
paired theological and social conservatism. Attitudes accumulate
consequences: the 1998 convention adopted a statement on marriage
which held that ``a wife is to submit herself graciously to the
servant leadership of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   It follows logically enough from that -- at least in the
hermetics of reactionary Baptism _ that women are born to a destiny
of subservience. If that is so, then with what possible authority
could a woman pastor address congregants? A sermon in the female
octaves can be little better that pretty piping.
</P>
<P>
   The formal impact from this will not be large. Something under
100 women lead or co-pastor Southern Baptist congregations, and
since Southern Baptists shun dogma _ though they've been slipping
near it -- individual churches are free to act contrary.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be little point in the convention's seminaries
continuing to ordain women and the congregations that resist can be
ostracized by their state conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Can so dramatic a disavowal of gender equity as the utterances
of the last two Southern Baptist conventions fail to color, however
subtly, the attitudes of its adherents as they turn from issues of
faith to social issues in which gender is implicated?
</P>
<P>
   A denomination of 41,000 churches with nearly 16 million members
_ and many of whose activists are vivacious in conservative
politics _ is not without wallop.
</P>
<P>
   If women are unfit for the pulpit, are they fit to pronounce
from the bench? If by birth they are theologically incompetent, can
they be competent for medicine, architecture and other professions?
If they are to submit graciously to husbands, by what rationale may
they aspire to the executive offices of businesses?
</P>
<P>
   No, the Southern Baptists are certainly not the throwback
Taliban on Afghanistan, and most will not _ not consciously at any
rate _ extrude the implications of the disenfranchisement of women
pastors into secular conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is impossible not to suppose that the long effort to
perfect a female equality in this country that is so familiar it
goes without saying has just been undermined.

CONSUMER ADVOCATE TAKES AIM AT CORPORATE-SPONSORED DEBATES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attempting to derail the fall's presidential
debates, Ralph Nader will file a complaint in Boston's US District
Court Monday, charging that the Federal Election Commission is
violating the law by allowing corporations to underwrite an
important aspect of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch, AT&AMP;T, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo, 3Comm, and other
businesses are helping pay for the fall debates, the first of which
will take place in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, since 1907, federal law has prohibited corporations
from contributing financially to candidates for Congress and
president. Even so, the FEC issued regulations making an exception
for corporations to fund the debates through the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a nonprofit corporation that has run the
candidate forums the last three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a Green Party presidential candidate, is asking the court
for an injunction to invalidate the FEC regulations, an injunction
he hopes will ultimately force the debate commission to return all
of its corporate contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't write that check for Bush directly and they
couldn't write that check for Gore directly, but they're allowed to
write a check to a collaborative Bush-Gore effort to advance their
own campaigns and to exclude competitors to advance their own
campaigns,'' Nader said in an interview. ``It's like a
double-header. They get tremendous media out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The first debate, between Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Governor George W. Bush, is scheduled to take place Oct. 3 at the
John F. Kennedy Library. Nader and other candidates for president,
such as Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, have been
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   A second debate is scheduled at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and a third will take place at Washington
University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The major party vice presidential candidates will square off at
Centre College in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Nader will be successful at derailing the debates
remains to be seen. A similar lawsuit was filed in New York by the
Libertarian Party. At the Commission on Presidential Debates,
executive director Janet H. Brown called the lawsuit ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been challenged every cycle and our position has
prevailed every cycle,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Nader say they will succeed where others have
failed because they are sticking to a narrow but clear point of
law. Also, they point out that when Ross Perot challenged the
debates in 1996, the US Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington said
the claim against the FEC regulations was not properly brought and
a decision on the merits would have to be left for another day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nader legal team also hopes to bolster its case by pointing
to a 1980 warning by the FEC to the League of Women Voters. Then,
the FEC said the League could not use corporate donations to put on
the presidential debates unless they included every candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Luke, a lawyer for Nader and the Green Party at the
National Voting Rights Institute in Cambridge, said the reason
corporate money should be excised from the debates is because it
gives corporations undue influence over the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kidding ourselves if we think industries that give all
this money to support major party candidates don't have a
disproportionate say in shaping the laws that affect us all,'' said
Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Scott P. Lewis, an attorney at Palmer and Dodge who is also
representing Nader, likened the debates to a ``Bud bowl,''
referring to a publicity campaign for Anheuser-Busch's top product,
Budweiser beer.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said the only thing corporate sponsors receive for
their donations is a few tickets to sit in the audience and watch
the debates as they take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``No donor who contributes to us has anything to do with the
debates themselves, the format, the decision on candidate
participation, or any other substantive issue,'' said Brown. She
also said the amount of the contributions is still being
negotiated, although the lawsuit puts the price tag in the millions
of dollars.

 &HT;    You rarely see them quoted in news stories. Their advice is not
sought by candidates running for state or national office. For the
most part, they research and publish in obscurity. Thus, we hardly
hear from some of the most brilliant political minds in the country
and their work is not widely disseminated. They are the nation's
Black political scientists, with expertise ranging from American
government to the politics of hip-hop.
 &HT;    ``At least give us a say,'' says Robert T. Starks, a political
scientist at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago.
 &HT;    Michael Preston, an expert on urban and racial politics at the
University of Southern California, agrees. ``If Jesse Jackson is
running, everybody wants to talk to you. If Bush and McCain are
running, nobody wants to talk to you,'' he says.
 &HT;    Linda Faye Williams, associate professor of government and
politics at the University of Maryland, put it this way. ``Many
journalists don't know any Black experts, period. So, what you
really see are the same old people quoted over and over.''
 &HT;    There also is a pecking order in academia that limits the
exposure of many Black scholars.
 &HT;    ``Unless you're at one of those Ivy League schools and you're
Comel West or Skip Gates, you're likely to be overlooked,''
Williams says.
 &HT;    The insights of the country's Black political intelligentsia
were on full display in Washington recently at the National
Conference of Black Political Scientists' annual meeting. They
discussed the growth of Black nationalists as a political force,
judicial politics, race and the digital revolution. The group is an
outgrowth of a 1969 meeting in Baton Rouge, La., where 35 Black
political scientists met to share problems they faced in their
work. They later agreed that Blacks needed their own organization.
In May 1970, they held their first meeting.
 &HT;    Joseph McCormick, a political scientist at Howard University and
an expert on Black public opinion research, says we are now on the
fifth generation of Black political scientists. They first taught
at Black colleges in the late 1940s and early '50s. Some of the
pioneers are still sharing their knowledge: Twiley Barker, an
expert in judicial politics at Howard, and Jewel Prestage, a
political science professor at Prairie View, and one of the first
Black women to earn a doctorate in political science.
 &HT;    McCormick views the development of the conference in the context
of the two periods in which Black organizations sprouted. The first
period, 1905-12, produced such groups as the NAACP, the National
Bar Association and Black fraternities.
 &HT;    ``Black people were responding to segregation,'' McCormick says.
 &HT;    In some cases, they were trying to combat the forces of White
supremacy. In others, they were responding to being excluded by
White professionals.
 &HT;    The second period, the '60s and early '70s, produced groups
whose missions were rooted in the Civil Rights Movement and the
Black Power struggle. ``We took the position that we needed to
speak in a more authentic voice, define issues for ourselves.''
Some Black professional groups _ sociologists, economists, to name
a few _ operated within the mainstream groups. Black political
scientists chose to break away.
 &HT;    It is more than ironic that almost all of the Black groups have
``national'' in their names.
 &HT;    ``They didn't get American because all of the White folks
monopolized that,'' McCormick points out, referring to such
examples as the American Historical Association and the American
Political Science Association.
 &HT;    In the millennium's first political season, it is long past time
for Black political scientists to get their due. The media should
focus on Nick Nelson, an expert on Black mayors at Ohio State,
Sarita McCoy, who has worked on the Black gender gap at the
University of Chicago and F. Carl Walton, chairman of the
conference's program on electoral and legislative politics.
 &HT;    This year the organization decided to compile a directory of
Black political scientists, including their areas of specialty and
contact numbers for U.S. media outlets.
 &HT;    Then, instead of seeing the same old tired mugs on the political
talk shows, and the same old predictable comments in news articles,
we might finally be treated to some fresh faces and some new
voices.

   &UR; By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Way out here in the hinterlands I believe we have a much better
perspective on America than those living right next to the
powers-that-be on the banks of the Potomac or in the city
considered to be the center of the universe _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Indian reservations we often are puzzled at problems
that should have simple solutions and yet become unsolvable because
of the nature of politics. For instance, there appears to be a real
problem among the voters in New York State about the senate
candidacy of Hillary Clinton. There is also a question of why she
is still with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   I always believed that the way politicians solve the problems of
their home states in the house or the senate is by the political
connections they have established among their peers in Washington.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to seek out the problems and
needs of any state. So why are New Yorkers so concerned that
Hillary is not a native New Yorker? They didn't raise such a ruckus
when another outsider, Robert F. Kennedy ran for the senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that many New Yorkers are attaching all the baggage
of Bill Clinton to the apron strings of Hillary? How many voters
really cared if Franklin D. Roosevelt loved Eleanor and if he did,
why?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton proved to be a very poor husband to Hillary in one
respect: he cheated on her. Hillary forgave him his transgressions
and continues to love him. Hasn't that ever happened in the
families of those who would chastise her for this? I would think
she should be admired and respected for holding her marriage
together in the face of such public ridicule. At one time in my
life I wish I had had her courage.
</P>
<P>
   I have observed Hillary to be a caring, compassionate and honest
person. Isn't that what leadership is all about? The wolves of
Washington did everything in their power, honestly and dishonestly,
to discredit her and she survived. And in my mind, she came out of
it a much better person. If I was a New Yorker I know I would vote
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the power in America: the people or the special
interests? Of course the answer should be the people, but that
answer is much too simple. We sit out here in Indian country and
see the power and money brokers control the government. Politicians
cannot survive without money. They get the bulk of their money from
the special interest groups. The National Rifle Association and big
oil for instance, have some politicians in their hip pockets. What
does that tell us about the land of the free and the home of the
brave?
</P>
<P>
   It's like a Catch-22. Politicians will not install campaign
reform because they need this glitch to get re-elected. And yet the
people who vote want campaign reform but they keep electing people
to office who have the power to bring about reform and will not. It
is a national disgrace to see a George W. Bush raise millions to
get elected or a Bill Clinton raise millions for his party even
though he can never run for president again. What it tells the
young people out here is that money makes the world go around.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with gun control laws. States with the toughest
gun laws, Massachusetts for example, have reduced the death by gun
shot wounds among children by 50 percent. Coincident or reality? I
own a hunting rifle and I would not mind at all having to register
it or get a license for it or get a trigger guard installed. If I
wanted to buy another rifle I wouldn't mind having to go through a
background check to get it whether it took one week or two months.
What's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we have never had an American Indian boy or girl walk
into a school and gun down teachers and fellow students. This seems
to be the dominion of teenage white boys.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the subject, I polled a few of my friends and relatives
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and asked them who they
believed Al Gore would pick as a running mate. The person most
mentioned out here in Indian country is Sen. Tom Daschle, (D-S.D.)
Just thought I'd throw that in just in case it becomes a reality.
You can then say you read it here first and it could prove how
astute us country folks can be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it doesn't, one can always say that the hicks out
here in the hinterlands really don't know a darned thing about the
real world.

perspective on America than those living right next to the
powers-that-be on the banks of the Potomac or in the city
considered to be the center of the universe _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Indian reservations we often are puzzled at problems
that should have simple solutions and yet become unsolvable because
of the nature of politics. For instance, there appears to be a real
problem among the voters in New York State about the senate
candidacy of Hillary Clinton. There is also a question of why she
is still with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   I always believed that the way politicians solve the problems of
their home states in the house or the senate is by the political
connections they have established among their peers in Washington.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to seek out the problems and
needs of any state. So why are New Yorkers so concerned that
Hillary is not a native New Yorker? They didn't raise such a ruckus
when another outsider, Robert F. Kennedy ran for the senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that many New Yorkers are attaching all the baggage
of Bill Clinton to the apron strings of Hillary? How many voters
really cared if Franklin D. Roosevelt loved Eleanor and if he did,
why?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton proved to be a very poor husband to Hillary in one
respect: he cheated on her. Hillary forgave him his transgressions
and continues to love him. Hasn't that ever happened in the
families of those who would chastise her for this? I would think
she should be admired and respected for holding her marriage
together in the face of such public ridicule. At one time in my
life I wish I had had her courage.
</P>
<P>
   I have observed Hillary to be a caring, compassionate and honest
person. Isn't that what leadership is all about? The wolves of
Washington did everything in their power, honestly and dishonestly,
to discredit her and she survived. And in my mind, she came out of
it a much better person. If I was a New Yorker I know I would vote
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the power in America: the people or the special
interests? Of course the answer should be the people, but that
answer is much too simple. We sit out here in Indian country and
see the power and money brokers control the government. Politicians
cannot survive without money. They get the bulk of their money from
the special interest groups. The National Rifle Association and big
oil for instance, have some politicians in their hip pockets. What
does that tell us about the land of the free and the home of the
brave?
</P>
<P>
   It's like a Catch-22. Politicians will not install campaign
reform because they need this glitch to get re-elected. And yet the
people who vote want campaign reform but they keep electing people
to office who have the power to bring about reform and will not. It
is a national disgrace to see a George W. Bush raise millions to
get elected or a Bill Clinton raise millions for his party even
though he can never run for president again. What it tells the
young people out here is that money makes the world go around.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with gun control laws. States with the toughest
gun laws, Massachusetts for example, have reduced the death by gun
shot wounds among children by 50 percent. Coincident or reality? I
own a hunting rifle and I would not mind at all having to register
it or get a license for it or get a trigger guard installed. If I
wanted to buy another rifle I wouldn't mind having to go through a
background check to get it whether it took one week or two months.
What's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we have never had an American Indian boy or girl walk
into a school and gun down teachers and fellow students. This seems
to be the dominion of teenage white boys.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the subject, I polled a few of my friends and relatives
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and asked them who they
believed Al Gore would pick as a running mate. The person most
mentioned out here in Indian country is Sen. Tom Daschle, (D-S.D.)
Just thought I'd throw that in just in case it becomes a reality.
You can then say you read it here first and it could prove how
astute us country folks can be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it doesn't, one can always say that the hicks out
here in the hinterlands really don't know a darned thing about the
real world.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    It would be the largest number of Latino votes ever cast in a
U.S. presidential election: 6 million.
 &HT;    And the number could go even higher still.
 &HT;    Led by the efforts of the Southwest Voter Registration Project
and the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, Latino groups and
activists across the country are mounting ``Latino Vote 2000,'' an
aggressive campaign to register hundreds of thousands of Hispanic
voters in the coming weeks and months.
 &HT;    Latino voter-drive efforts are not new. What is new is that
election-day turnout this fall by Latinos might well decide
countless local, state and federal races _ including the
presidency.
 &HT;    Raising the stakes even higher are predictions that an
unprecedented number of Latinos may shift their support from
Democratic to Republican candidates.
 &HT;    Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats still have strong
support among Latinos, but Texas Gov. George W. Bush is making real
headway. If he plays his cards right, I think he could match _ or
even exceed _ the nearly 40 percent support that Reagan received
from Latinos in his 1984 landslide re-election.
 &HT;    With Republicans holding just a six-seat majority in the House,
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle know just how critical a
Latino swing vote could be. And a strong victory by Bush can only
help down-ticket candidates, namely those in voting districts where
Latinos abound.
 &HT;    Consider the results of a recent survey by the Tomas Rivera
Policy Institute, a national think-tank that studies Latino
political trends. The non-partisan group found that in three Los
Angeles-area congressional districts each candidate's margin of
victory in 1998 was smaller than the number of registered Latino
voters who did not cast a ballot.
 &HT;    Put another way, a higher turnout by Latino voters could very
well have meant victory for the losing candidate.
 &HT;    For instance, Republican Congressman James Rogan, a member of
the House team that fought for President Clinton's impeachment, was
re-elected in California's 27th District by 6,800 votes in 1998.
Yet 21,000 registered Latino voters did not cast a ballot,
according to Matt Barreto, a Tomas Rivera researcher.
 &HT;    This tells us that getting Latinos registered to vote is only
half the battle. Along with voter registration drives, Latino
leaders of every political ilk should be mounting get-to-the-polls
drives.
 &HT;    Incidentally, it isn't that Latinos don't care about elections.
It's just that for most of our nation's history, our vote hasn't
really mattered to the cast of mostly non-Latino politicians
running for office.
 &HT;    Things could be different this year. The trends are all tilted
in the right direction. Latinos today are better educated. More
Latinos are starting new businesses, moving into management jobs
and even taking roles in the upper ranks of corporate America. And,
most significantly, there are simply more Latinos _ about 31
million by the latest estimates.
 &HT;    As a result, the growth in the number of Latinos who have
registered to vote has been striking. Juan Andrade, head of the
U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, says the number of registered
Latino voters nationwide jumped by 164 percent from 1976 to 1996,
compared to 31 percent in the general population.
 &HT;    Latino voter-registration efforts received an unexpected boost
in the 1990s in the wake of ``anti-Latino'' initiatives, according
to Russell Jauregui, an attorney in Pasadena, Calif., and a former
volunteer organizer for Southwest Voter.
 &HT;    Most Latino voters angrily rejected the sharp conservative shift
in Congress on the issues of welfare and immigration legislation
during the Gingrich years. And several California ballot
initiatives managed to wound the GOP image in the Latino community.
 &HT;    As a result, hundreds of thousands of Latino voters had little
trouble deciding to pick Democrats over Republicans in 1996 and
1998. Clinton, for instance, won more than 70 percent of the Latino
vote in 1996.
 &HT;    But there isn't a similar ``negative force'' pushing Latinos to
the polls this campaign season, Andrade said. Ironically, that has
some Latino leaders worried. While they appreciate the GOP's
kinder, gentler attitude toward our community, many Latinos may
feel that because the ``threat'' has subsided they can stay home on
election day.
 &HT;    ``We need another Pete Wilson,'' jokes Andrade, referring to the
former California governor who still draws the wrath of many
Latinos for his support of a ballot initiative barring illegal
immigrant children from public schools.
 &HT;    Hopefully, Latinos won't need another Pete Wilson to get us to
the polls in November. Latinos should know that with 6 million-plus
votes to wield in the general election, politicians across the
country and the political spectrum will think twice before
repeating Wilson's mistakes. All we have to do now is cast our
ballots.

 By DERRICK K. BAKER  
 &HT;    Solely because I have been robbed at gunpoint, an interminable
episode years ago that scared me nearly to death, my opinions about
the absolute necessity of background checks for people who want to
buy guns are not up for debate.
 &HT;    A certain firmness to your convictions results when the cold
barrel of a Saturday-night-special has been pressed to your sweaty
temple and you've been admonished by some weasel about how easy it
would be to scatter your teen-age brains over the storage room of a
variety store.
 &HT;    That searing flashback aside, while the U.S. Justice
Department's success in blocking 204,000 of the more than 8.6
million prospective gun sales last year won't in any way ultimately
stop guns from falling into the hands of criminals, it's reasonable
to guess that within that number of blocked sales lay more than a
few sub-moronic dolts who had no business having access to guns.
 &HT;    To paint a more detailed picture about the positive and
immediate effects of the Brady Act, which was instituted in
February 1994 and required the background checks, last year the
number of purchase rejections numbered 536,000 out of nearly 22.3
million applications. That's a lot of law-abiding citizens and
certified nut jobs alike who might have had his or her former
co-workers squarely sighted in the crosshairs that are the mind's
eye.
 &HT;    Moreover, numbers from the Department of Justice reveal that
state and local police rejected an even higher percentage of
would-be gun buyers than the FBI: The rejection rate among state
and local agencies was 3 percent compared with 1.8 percent for the
FBI.
 &HT;    Is this to imply that the Barney Fifes of the country are more
efficient in keeping guns out of the hands of evildoers than the
highly trained bunch at the FBI?
 &HT;    As a matter of fact, President Clinton and his minions long have
contended that the states are better equipped than the FBI to
conduct background checks, but some states don't want to pay the
costs.
 &HT;    According to the Justice Department, all state agencies had
access to computer databases that record past felony convictions,
and many accessed databases with other disqualifying information
such as fugitive status, court restraining orders, mental illness
and domestic-violence misdemeanor convictions.
 &HT;    The counter contention is true _ that all too often, criminals
don't walk into Billy Bob's Gun Shop to purchase a gun to rob a
7-Eleven or the 80-year-old church deacon. But far too many guns
purchased by law-abiding citizens end up without serial numbers and
in the hands of Pookie Jenkins, who gets a cheap thrill sticking up
people who look and live like him.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, here's a memo to the reluctant decision makers in
those states reluctant to pay for background checks: Take a second
_ and close _ look at your moral compass, before too many
legislators like yourself wind up the victims of violent crimes
committed with guns possessed by some of the very same people who
would have been blocked.
 &HT;    Joining those legislators is the National Rife Association, that
conglomeration of mostly self-righteous ostriches who can't see the
forest for the trees, who want more enforcement of existing gun
laws.
 &HT;    Who better than them to have a problem with accepting the rather
direct correlation between application rejections and the decrease
in firearm-related crimes since 1992?
 &HT;    Granted, the use of firearms has fallen from 31 percent in all
violent crimes eight years ago to 25 percent just two years ago.
But a crime is a crime, and we can reduce the frequency of those
crimes, particularly if we enjoy life.
 &HT;    So if I sound a bit angry at those who would fight the
productivity and constitutionality of background checks for
prospective gun owners, please bear with me. My anger and cynicism
and incredulity have something to do with being among the millions
of Americans who've had the experience of staring life _ and death
_ squarely in the face, courtesy of a firearm.

 By ROBERT KUNZIG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A great guitar is like a beautiful woman _ no, really, it is.
Antonio de Torres Jurado, the 19th-century Spanish carpenter who
gave the acoustic guitar its modern form, is said to have been
inspired by the figure of a young woman in Seville.
 &HT;    Torres made the guitar much larger than it had been before,
especially in the hips, and thus made it loud enough to compete at
a time when it was rapidly losing market share to the piano. He
stiffened the vibrating top plate of the guitar, the thin and
all-important soundboard with internal struts that fanned out from
the sound hole like the pleats of a skirt.
 &HT;    Today the finest classical guitars are still made according to
Torres' basic design, by individual craftsmen toiling in
garden-shed workshops that smell of sawdust and shellac.
 &HT;    Like living organisms, no two guitars are the same, and each one
is made of living material: wood.
 &HT;    ``That's the problem,'' says physicist Joe Wolfe of the
University of New South Wales in Sydney. ``Wood is not a
predictable material.''
 &HT;    A guitar is very much like a woman, then (oh, all right, or a
man) _ but it is also, to a physicist, like a bunch of pendulums
connected by springs: It is a system of coupled oscillators.
 &HT;    The first oscillator is the string, but a plucked string doesn't
move enough air to emit much of a sound. So the bottom end of a
guitar string is attached to a hardwood bridge, which transmits the
vibration to the top plate, which transmits it to the rest of the
guitar, which transmits it to the air in and around the instrument.
Together these oscillators augment the string's feeble output and
make it audible.
 &HT;    Their coupled motion patterns are very complex, and each note on
the guitar corresponds to a particular pattern. But each vibration
pattern is made up of a sum of simpler vibrations, called modes.
 &HT;    Play an F sharp on the bass E string, for instance (or a G, or G
sharp; it depends on the guitar), and the whole instrument will
swell and contract like a balloon, albeit indiscernibly, with the
top and back plates moving a few microns closer and then apart,
roughly a hundred times a second.
 &HT;    About an octave higher _ at the fourth, fifth or sixth fret of
the D string _ the top and back plates move roughly twice as fast,
at 215 hertz or so, but now they move in parallel, forward and back
at the same time. Another octave or so higher and the bottom end of
the soundboard inflates, while the neighboring area next to the
sound hole deflates, and vice versa.
 &HT;    The soundboard is the most important source of sound on a
guitar, and so selecting the wood for it takes care. It has to be
so light that a vibrating string can move it, and stiff enough so
that it won't pollute the sound with a wobbly mess of overtones. it
is usually spruce, sometimes redwood or cedar.
 &HT;    A tree that has grown slowly on cold mountain slopes works best,
because slow growth, with its closely spaced rings, ensures more
even properties. A good luthier picking a board will flex it with
his hands and rap it with his knuckle; the sound it makes is an
indirect indication of its density.
 &HT;    But even the best luthier will not get perfectly consistent
results. ``Each piece of wood is a bit different,'' Wolfe says.
``One piece turns out to be a bit stiffer than the last piece from
the same tree. You make something exactly the same shape and size,
using the same techniques, and you measure it and one of the
resonance frequencies is up 10 hertz, and another one is down 10
hertz. And it's a completely different instrument.''
 &HT;    This lack of reproducibility makes it difficult to do a
controlled experiment in luthiery _ you can never be sure of
changing just one thing about a guitar and holding all the other
variables constant. That's one reason luthiers as a bunch are not
scientifically inclined; another is that a lone craftsman producing
only one or two guitars a month can't afford to do a lot of
experimenting.
 &HT;    ``The way guitars are made is to formula,'' says Rob Armstrong,
a luthier in Coventry, England. ``There is nobody questioning
what's going on.''
 &HT;    Armstrong is an exception; he has been helping Owen Pedgley, an
industrial designer at Loughborough University in England, design a
guitar made of injection-molded polycarbonate.
 &HT;    Another, more controversial freethinker is Michael Kasha, a
chemical physicist at Florida State University and a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.
 &HT;    Kasha got interested in guitars 35 years ago, when he looked
inside his 8-year-old son's instrument with a bicycle mirror and
was horrified by what Torres had wrought _ specifically, by the
symmetrical fan of internal struts that are glued to the inside of
the top plate.
 &HT;    ``The traditional soundboard, which was arrived at by accident
and never changed,'' Kasha explains, ``has no tuning from bass to
treble.''
 &HT;    Kasha's theory is that a soundboard vibrates in local modes: The
treble strings stimulate more vibration on the treble side of the
plate, and ditto for the bass.
 &HT;    ``People say the whole soundboard vibrates together, but it's
not true,'' he says. ``When you drive it locally, it vibrates
locally in the predominant pattern.''
 &HT;    It follows that you should be able to tune the soundboard to
respond optimally at a range of frequencies by dividing it into
resonating zones of varying diameters.
 &HT;    Torres' fan bracing doesn't do that; it divides the soundboard
into more or less equal areas. The result, Kasha says, is that many
notes are not brilliant: The fundamental frequency of a note
doesn't dominate the overtones.
 &HT;    Kasha's radically asymmetrical design, in which the struts are
in a herringbone pattern and the sound hole leers from one corner
of the guitar like the eye of a Cyclops, is designed to be
brilliant.
 &HT;    Although a few luthiers have followed Kasha's precepts, and at
least one stirring recording has been made with his guitars _ Kurt
Rodarmer's guitar version of Bach's ``Goldberg Variations'' _ Kasha
has not really shaken the Torres tradition in three decades of
trying.
 &HT;    And he certainly hasn't convinced other physicists. They
question his basic theory (``The notion that there's a bass side
and a treble side to the top plate _ there isn't any such thing,''
says Bernard Richardson, a physicist and guitar-maker at the
University of Cardiff, Wales) and fault him for publishing no
experimental evidence.
 &HT;    Lately, Kasha has been testing guitars, including those of top
luthiers, in an anechoic chamber, and he says he will soon publish
measurements that will demonstrate the superiority of his design.
One famous maker is going to be especially shocked, Kasha thinks:
``His basses are woofy. They have no fundamental at all.''
 &HT;    That particular luthier has said that the inspiration for his
successful design came to him in a dream _ which is perhaps an
indication of one of the obstacles faced by anyone hoping to
organize a scientific revolution in luthiery.
 &HT;    Last August, Kasha spoke at a guitar festival in Healdsburg,
Calif., that was attended by many luthiers.
 &HT;    ``There was a panel discussion,'' he recalls, ``and one of the
guys on the panel was a pure mystic. He said, `These are things
beyond man's ken _ only God can understand these things. We have to
go by the spirit of the music.' Well, I'm not a mystic.''
 &HT;    Even if it were possible to banish mystics, there is another
reason luthiery will always remain more of a craft than a science:
Tastes differ. Kasha may have succeeded in making guitars sound
more brilliant, but some people find his guitars loud.
 &HT;    There is no such thing as a perfect guitar, Richardson says:
``Saying that you're going to produce the perfect guitar is like
saying you're going to produce the perfect wine from a batch of
chemicals.''
 &HT;    Beauty, after all, is in the ear of the beholder.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A great guitar is like a beautiful woman _ no, really, it is.
Antonio de Torres Jurado, the 19th-century Spanish carpenter who
gave the acoustic guitar its modern form, is said to have been
inspired by the figure of a young woman in Seville.
 &HT;    Torres made the guitar much larger than it had been before,
especially in the hips, and thus made it loud enough to compete at
a time when it was rapidly losing market share to the piano. He
stiffened the vibrating top plate of the guitar, the thin and
all-important soundboard with internal struts that fanned out from
the sound hole like the pleats of a skirt.
 &HT;    Today the finest classical guitars are still made according to
Torres' basic design, by individual craftsmen toiling in
garden-shed workshops that smell of sawdust and shellac.
 &HT;    Like living organisms, no two guitars are the same, and each one
is made of living material: wood.
 &HT;    ``That's the problem,'' says physicist Joe Wolfe of the
University of New South Wales in Sydney. ``Wood is not a
predictable material.''

 By ROBERT KUNZIG 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    A great guitar is like a beautiful woman _ no, really, it is.
Antonio de Torres Jurado, the 19th-century Spanish carpenter who
gave the acoustic guitar its modern form, is said to have been
inspired by the figure of a young woman in Seville.
 &HT;    Torres made the guitar much larger than it had been before,
especially in the hips, and thus made it loud enough to compete at
a time when it was rapidly losing market share to the piano. He
stiffened the vibrating top plate of the guitar, the thin and
all-important soundboard with internal struts that fanned out from
the sound hole like the pleats of a skirt.
 &HT;    Today the finest classical guitars are still made according to
Torres' basic design, by individual craftsmen toiling in
garden-shed workshops that smell of sawdust and shellac.
 &HT;    Like living organisms, no two guitars are the same, and each one
is made of living material: wood.
 &HT;    ``That's the problem,'' says physicist Joe Wolfe of the
University of New South Wales in Sydney. ``Wood is not a
predictable material.''
 &HT;    A guitar is very much like a woman, then (oh, all right, or a
man) _ but it is also, to a physicist, like a bunch of pendulums
connected by springs: It is a system of coupled oscillators.
 &HT;    The first oscillator is the string, but a plucked string doesn't
move enough air to emit much of a sound. So the bottom end of a
guitar string is attached to a hardwood bridge, which transmits the
vibration to the top plate, which transmits it to the rest of the
guitar, which transmits it to the air in and around the instrument.
Together these oscillators augment the string's feeble output and
make it audible.
 &HT;    Their coupled motion patterns are very complex, and each note on
the guitar corresponds to a particular pattern. But each vibration
pattern is made up of a sum of simpler vibrations, called modes.
 &HT;    Play an F sharp on the bass E string, for instance (or a G, or G
sharp; it depends on the guitar), and the whole instrument will
swell and contract like a balloon, albeit indiscernibly, with the
top and back plates moving a few microns closer and then apart,
roughly a hundred times a second.
 &HT;    About an octave higher _ at the fourth, fifth or sixth fret of
the D string _ the top and back plates move roughly twice as fast,
at 215 hertz or so, but now they move in parallel, forward and back
at the same time. Another octave or so higher and the bottom end of
the soundboard inflates, while the neighboring area next to the
sound hole deflates, and vice versa.
 &HT;    The soundboard is the most important source of sound on a
guitar, and so selecting the wood for it takes care. It has to be
so light that a vibrating string can move it, and stiff enough so
that it won't pollute the sound with a wobbly mess of overtones. it
is usually spruce, sometimes redwood or cedar.
 &HT;    A tree that has grown slowly on cold mountain slopes works best,
because slow growth, with its closely spaced rings, ensures more
even properties. A good luthier picking a board will flex it with
his hands and rap it with his knuckle; the sound it makes is an
indirect indication of its density.
 &HT;    But even the best luthier will not get perfectly consistent
results. ``Each piece of wood is a bit different,'' Wolfe says.
``One piece turns out to be a bit stiffer than the last piece from
the same tree. You make something exactly the same shape and size,
using the same techniques, and you measure it and one of the
resonance frequencies is up 10 hertz, and another one is down 10
hertz. And it's a completely different instrument.''
 &HT;    This lack of reproducibility makes it difficult to do a
controlled experiment in luthiery _ you can never be sure of
changing just one thing about a guitar and holding all the other
variables constant. That's one reason luthiers as a bunch are not
scientifically inclined; another is that a lone craftsman producing
only one or two guitars a month can't afford to do a lot of
experimenting.
 &HT;    ``The way guitars are made is to formula,'' says Rob Armstrong,
a luthier in Coventry, England. ``There is nobody questioning
what's going on.''
 &HT;    Armstrong is an exception; he has been helping Owen Pedgley, an
industrial designer at Loughborough University in England, design a
guitar made of injection-molded polycarbonate.
 &HT;    Another, more controversial freethinker is Michael Kasha, a
chemical physicist at Florida State University and a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.
 &HT;    Kasha got interested in guitars 35 years ago, when he looked
inside his 8-year-old son's instrument with a bicycle mirror and
was horrified by what Torres had wrought _ specifically, by the
symmetrical fan of internal struts that are glued to the inside of
the top plate.
 &HT;    ``The traditional soundboard, which was arrived at by accident
and never changed,'' Kasha explains, ``has no tuning from bass to
treble.''
 &HT;    Kasha's theory is that a soundboard vibrates in local modes: The
treble strings stimulate more vibration on the treble side of the
plate, and ditto for the bass.
 &HT;    ``People say the whole soundboard vibrates together, but it's
not true,'' he says. ``When you drive it locally, it vibrates
locally in the predominant pattern.''
 &HT;    It follows that you should be able to tune the soundboard to
respond optimally at a range of frequencies by dividing it into
resonating zones of varying diameters.
 &HT;    Torres' fan bracing doesn't do that; it divides the soundboard
into more or less equal areas. The result, Kasha says, is that many
notes are not brilliant: The fundamental frequency of a note
doesn't dominate the overtones.
 &HT;    Kasha's radically asymmetrical design, in which the struts are
in a herringbone pattern and the sound hole leers from one corner
of the guitar like the eye of a Cyclops, is designed to be
brilliant.
 &HT;    Although a few luthiers have followed Kasha's precepts, and at
least one stirring recording has been made with his guitars _ Kurt
Rodarmer's guitar version of Bach's ``Goldberg Variations'' _ Kasha
has not really shaken the Torres tradition in three decades of
trying.
 &HT;    And he certainly hasn't convinced other physicists. They
question his basic theory (``The notion that there's a bass side
and a treble side to the top plate _ there isn't any such thing,''
says Bernard Richardson, a physicist and guitar-maker at the
University of Cardiff, Wales) and fault him for publishing no
experimental evidence.
 &HT;    Lately, Kasha has been testing guitars, including those of top
luthiers, in an anechoic chamber, and he says he will soon publish
measurements that will demonstrate the superiority of his design.
One famous maker is going to be especially shocked, Kasha thinks:
``His basses are woofy. They have no fundamental at all.''
 &HT;    That particular luthier has said that the inspiration for his
successful design came to him in a dream _ which is perhaps an
indication of one of the obstacles faced by anyone hoping to
organize a scientific revolution in luthiery.
 &HT;    Last August, Kasha spoke at a guitar festival in Healdsburg,
Calif., that was attended by many luthiers.
 &HT;    ``There was a panel discussion,'' he recalls, ``and one of the
guys on the panel was a pure mystic. He said, `These are things
beyond man's ken _ only God can understand these things. We have to
go by the spirit of the music.' Well, I'm not a mystic.''
 &HT;    Even if it were possible to banish mystics, there is another
reason luthiery will always remain more of a craft than a science:
Tastes differ. Kasha may have succeeded in making guitars sound
more brilliant, but some people find his guitars loud.
 &HT;    There is no such thing as a perfect guitar, Richardson says:
``Saying that you're going to produce the perfect guitar is like
saying you're going to produce the perfect wine from a batch of
chemicals.''
 &HT;    Beauty, after all, is in the ear of the beholder.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Belted into the seat of a Toyota Land Cruiser piloted by a
friend, 78-year-old Joan Wiffen heads for the outback on a sunny
morning. She hangs on tight as she bounces through the heavily
forested New Zealand countryside. Then, out of the car, she grabs a
walking stick and tramps through shady glades.
 &HT;    Finally she stops at the edge of rushing Mangahouanga Stream and
tentatively dips in a sneaker-shod foot. ``You have to be very
strong or totally insane to keep coming back here for 27 years.''
 &HT;    Wiffen keeps coming back because the place is full of fossils.
She fell in love with them three decades ago and has been hunting
them here ever since.
 &HT;    Wiffen never attended a university or got a single research
grant. However, professional paleontologists call this amateur
``the dragon lady'' for her work excavating the fossils of four
previously unknown sea monsters, including a voracious lizardlike
mosasaur bigger than a killer whale and as fierce as Tyrannosaurus
rex.
 &HT;    But Wiffen's contribution to the understanding of prehistory
goes well beyond unearthing frightening predators. She was the
first person to find dinosaur fossils in New Zealand. Before her
work, paleontologists thought New Zealand was one of the least
likely places for dinosaurs to have lived.
 &HT;    Wiffen never thought she'd become famous. She grew up on farms
in a conventional family and expected to become a housewife. She
did.
 &HT;    Her late husband Pont, an electronics technician who died in
1992, worked at radio stations. They lived in the country, and
Wiffen cooked, cleaned and looked after the sheep, the goats and
the two children, Christopher and Judith.
 &HT;    ``I only heard about dinosaurs when I started buying books for
my own kids,'' she says.
 &HT;    The family hobby was rock collecting. The Wiffens belonged to
rock and mineral clubs, attended night classes in geology and for
seven months in the late 1960s drove all over Australia collecting
opals, topazes, sapphires and garnets and turning them into
jewelry.
 &HT;    Then one day she bought a trilobite fossil at a roadside shop
for 50 cents. Something about the fact that this weird-looking
creature had been alive millions of years before resonated in her:
``I was hooked,'' she says.
 &HT;    She wanted to know what these creatures were, where they lived,
how they came to be and what their lives were like. With her family
in tow, she tramped all over New Zealand, collecting fossil shells
from Motunau, ammonites from Kawhia, belemnites from Port Waikato.
 &HT;    And she read. There were no universities or natural-history
museums in Hawke's Bay _ where her family lived _ so she haunted
libraries and mail-ordered textbooks and articles from journals.
She read everything from basic encyclopedias to specialized texts.
 &HT;    ``The cretaceous reptiles just caught her attention,'' says
paleontologist Gorden Bell of the U.S. National Park Service. ``She
knew there wasn't a lot of information, and she may have realized
the contribution she could make.''
 &HT;    Slowly, Wiffen became convinced dinosaurs could have lived in
New Zealand. There was fossil evidence of forests existing during
the Jurassic period _ 190 million to 135 million years ago _ and a
record of marine reptiles extending nearly that far back.
 &HT;    Snakes and marsupials hadn't evolved at the time New Zealand
split off from Gondwana _ the southern supercontinent that about 85
million years ago divided into South America, Africa and Australia
_ so those species aren't native to the two islands.
 &HT;    But dinosaurs had existed for some 150 million years at the time
of the split, so why hadn't their remains been found in New
Zealand?
 &HT;    The conventional wisdom was that dinosaurs never migrated to
Wiffen's part of Gondwana before the split, or that the climate had
turned too cold for them to survive.
 &HT;    Wiffen didn't buy it. ``I didn't know a huge amount _ nobody did
at that time in New Zealand _ but I couldn't see any reason why
they couldn't be there.''
 &HT;    So she decided to keep looking.
 &HT;    The search was expensive, so the Wiffens began seeking fossil
sites close to Hawke's Bay. Her big break came in 1972, when she
found an old geological map in the back of a village toy shop. The
map was based on oil exploring, and in a legend down one side, she
read: ``Reptilian bones in beds of brackish water in the Te Hoe
Valley.''
 &HT;    Six months later Wiffen found the site, a remote stream 70 miles
inland and 1,500 feet above sea level. The area had been an estuary
in the Late Cretaceous period. Now fossils were literally bursting
out of the rocks: fish teeth, fish scales and vertebrae, shark
teeth, shells and turtle parts. But no dinosaurs.
 &HT;    Wiffen's whole family became involved in her fossil search and
was joined by a widening circle of friends recruited as much for
brawn as dedication. Wiffen let them feel important, and they were,
but she was the one who learned the names of the bones, understood
how a marine reptile's limbs differed from those of a land reptile
and studied how to get fossils out of rocks.
 &HT;    Her gang prospected up and down Mangahouanga Stream. Sometimes
the crew blew apart the bigger rocks with dynamite, a practice
Wiffen now regards as excessive. But one such explosion in 1974
produced a major discovery _ her first mosasaur specimen.
 &HT;    Four years later she started the process of extracting the bones
from the sandstone surrounding them. For two years, Wiffen toiled
in her garage workshop, sawing at sandstone to reveal more bone,
soaking the bone in an acid bath to eat away more rock, and then
coating the exposed bone with protective resin. Then she repeated
the process until the bone was fully revealed.
 &HT;    In 1980 her long labor was rewarded with the skeleton of what
turned out to be a new genus and species of mosasaur, a massive
carnivorous marine reptile that grew to be as long as 45 feet. The
creatures had powerful sinuous bodies, broad, webbed paddles for
limbs, and long, conical, tooth-filled heads like those of
alligators.
 &HT;    Had she found nothing more than this single creature, her place
in history would be secure, Bell says. But the new genus represents
a specific, separate, unknown lineage of mosasaur and sheds light
on the development of marine reptiles in general. Before long
Wiffen had discovered three more.
 &HT;    But she wasn't just digging up sea creatures. Without knowing
it, she had also found dinosaurs. One day in 1975, Pont found a
piece of petrified wood sticking out of a football-sized
concretion. He broke the rock open with his hammer, saw nothing
interesting and turned it over to his wife. When she inspected it,
fragments of a fossil caught her eye.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was a vertebra, but I didn't know,'' she says.
``I just knew that it was different.'' She couldn't identify it
precisely, and it joined her other unidentified fossils in a locked
cabinet.
 &HT;    In 1979, she and Pont took a holiday in Brisbane and stopped at
the Queensland Museum. There she met Ralph Molnar, an American
paleontologist working as the senior curator of vertebrate fossils.
She noticed some fossil bones on his desk that looked familiar.
 &HT;    ``I have a vertebra like that at home,'' Wiffen said,
remembering the one she'd found back in 1975. ``What is it?''
 &HT;    A dinosaur bone, he said.
 &HT;    Back in Hawke's Bay, Wiffen made casts and photos of her find
and sent them off to Molnar. He phoned two weeks later. ``You've
got yourself a dinosaur.''
 &HT;    ``It was the first dinosaur found in New Zealand,'' Molnar says
today. It belonged to a theropod _ a carnivorous, large-headed
creature resembling a smaller T rex. The bone proved Wiffen's
central point _ that dinosaurs had roamed New Zealand.
 &HT;    Today nobody disputes Wiffen's conclusions. ``She put New
Zealand on the map with respect to Mesozoic reptile discoveries,''
says John Long, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Western
Australian Museum in Perth and the author of ``Dinosaurs of
Australia and New Zealand.''
 &HT;    The more Wiffen has learned, the more she sees how even the
tiniest finds improve our understanding of an ancient world.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Belted into the seat of a Toyota Land Cruiser piloted by a
friend, 78-year-old Joan Wiffen heads for the outback on a sunny
morning. She hangs on tight as she bounces through the heavily
forested New Zealand countryside. Then, out of the car, she grabs a
walking stick and tramps through shady glades.
 &HT;    Finally she stops at the edge of rushing Mangahouanga Stream and
tentatively dips in a sneaker-shod foot. ``You have to be very
strong or totally insane to keep coming back here for 27 years.''
 &HT;    Wiffen keeps coming back because the place is full of fossils.
She fell in love with them three decades ago and has been hunting
them here ever since.
 &HT;    Wiffen never attended a university or got a single research
grant. However, professional paleontologists call this amateur
``the dragon lady'' for her work excavating the fossils of four
previously unknown sea monsters, including a voracious lizardlike
mosasaur bigger than a killer whale and as fierce as Tyrannosaurus
rex.
 &HT;    But Wiffen's contribution to the understanding of prehistory
goes well beyond unearthing frightening predators. She was the
first person to find dinosaur fossils in New Zealand. Before her
work, paleontologists thought New Zealand was one of the least
likely places for dinosaurs to have lived.
 &HT;    Wiffen never thought she'd become famous. She grew up on farms
in a conventional family and expected to become a housewife. She
did.
 &HT;    Her late husband Pont, an electronics technician who died in
1992, worked at radio stations. They lived in the country, and
Wiffen cooked, cleaned and looked after the sheep, the goats and
the two children, Christopher and Judith.
 &HT;    ``I only heard about dinosaurs when I started buying books for
my own kids,'' she says.
 &HT;    The family hobby was rock collecting. The Wiffens belonged to
rock and mineral clubs, attended night classes in geology and for
seven months in the late 1960s drove all over Australia collecting
opals, topazes, sapphires and garnets and turning them into
jewelry.
 &HT;    Then one day she bought a trilobite fossil at a roadside shop
for 50 cents. Something about the fact that this weird-looking
creature had been alive millions of years before resonated in her:
``I was hooked,'' she says.
 &HT;    She wanted to know what these creatures were, where they lived,
how they came to be and what their lives were like. With her family
in tow, she tramped all over New Zealand, collecting fossil shells
from Motunau, ammonites from Kawhia, belemnites from Port Waikato.
 &HT;    And she read. There were no universities or natural-history
museums in Hawke's Bay _ where her family lived _ so she haunted
libraries and mail-ordered textbooks and articles from journals.
She read everything from basic encyclopedias to specialized texts.
 &HT;    ``The cretaceous reptiles just caught her attention,'' says
paleontologist Gorden Bell of the U.S. National Park Service. ``She
knew there wasn't a lot of information, and she may have realized
the contribution she could make.''
 &HT;    Slowly, Wiffen became convinced dinosaurs could have lived in
New Zealand. There was fossil evidence of forests existing during
the Jurassic period _ 190 million to 135 million years ago _ and a
record of marine reptiles extending nearly that far back.
 &HT;    Snakes and marsupials hadn't evolved at the time New Zealand
split off from Gondwana _ the southern supercontinent that about 85
million years ago divided into South America, Africa and Australia
_ so those species aren't native to the two islands.
 &HT;    But dinosaurs had existed for some 150 million years at the time
of the split, so why hadn't their remains been found in New
Zealand?
 &HT;    The conventional wisdom was that dinosaurs never migrated to
Wiffen's part of Gondwana before the split, or that the climate had
turned too cold for them to survive.
 &HT;    Wiffen didn't buy it. ``I didn't know a huge amount _ nobody did
at that time in New Zealand _ but I couldn't see any reason why
they couldn't be there.''
 &HT;    So she decided to keep looking.
 &HT;    The search was expensive, so the Wiffens began seeking fossil
sites close to Hawke's Bay. Her big break came in 1972, when she
found an old geological map in the back of a village toy shop. The
map was based on oil exploring, and in a legend down one side, she
read: ``Reptilian bones in beds of brackish water in the Te Hoe
Valley.''
 &HT;    Six months later Wiffen found the site, a remote stream 70 miles
inland and 1,500 feet above sea level. The area had been an estuary
in the Late Cretaceous period. Now fossils were literally bursting
out of the rocks: fish teeth, fish scales and vertebrae, shark
teeth, shells and turtle parts. But no dinosaurs.
 &HT;    Wiffen's whole family became involved in her fossil search and
was joined by a widening circle of friends recruited as much for
brawn as dedication. Wiffen let them feel important, and they were,
but she was the one who learned the names of the bones, understood
how a marine reptile's limbs differed from those of a land reptile
and studied how to get fossils out of rocks.
 &HT;    Her gang prospected up and down Mangahouanga Stream. Sometimes
the crew blew apart the bigger rocks with dynamite, a practice
Wiffen now regards as excessive. But one such explosion in 1974
produced a major discovery _ her first mosasaur specimen.
 &HT;    Four years later she started the process of extracting the bones
from the sandstone surrounding them. For two years, Wiffen toiled
in her garage workshop, sawing at sandstone to reveal more bone,
soaking the bone in an acid bath to eat away more rock, and then
coating the exposed bone with protective resin. Then she repeated
the process until the bone was fully revealed.
 &HT;    In 1980 her long labor was rewarded with the skeleton of what
turned out to be a new genus and species of mosasaur, a massive
carnivorous marine reptile that grew to be as long as 45 feet. The
creatures had powerful sinuous bodies, broad, webbed paddles for
limbs, and long, conical, tooth-filled heads like those of
alligators.
 &HT;    Had she found nothing more than this single creature, her place
in history would be secure, Bell says. But the new genus represents
a specific, separate, unknown lineage of mosasaur and sheds light
on the development of marine reptiles in general. Before long
Wiffen had discovered three more.
 &HT;    But she wasn't just digging up sea creatures. Without knowing
it, she had also found dinosaurs. One day in 1975, Pont found a
piece of petrified wood sticking out of a football-sized
concretion. He broke the rock open with his hammer, saw nothing
interesting and turned it over to his wife. When she inspected it,
fragments of a fossil caught her eye.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was a vertebra, but I didn't know,'' she says.
``I just knew that it was different.'' She couldn't identify it
precisely, and it joined her other unidentified fossils in a locked
cabinet.
 &HT;    In 1979, she and Pont took a holiday in Brisbane and stopped at
the Queensland Museum. There she met Ralph Molnar, an American
paleontologist working as the senior curator of vertebrate fossils.
She noticed some fossil bones on his desk that looked familiar.
 &HT;    ``I have a vertebra like that at home,'' Wiffen said,
remembering the one she'd found back in 1975. ``What is it?''
 &HT;    A dinosaur bone, he said.
 &HT;    Back in Hawke's Bay, Wiffen made casts and photos of her find
and sent them off to Molnar. He phoned two weeks later. ``You've
got yourself a dinosaur.''
 &HT;    ``It was the first dinosaur found in New Zealand,'' Molnar says
today. It belonged to a theropod _ a carnivorous, large-headed
creature resembling a smaller T rex. The bone proved Wiffen's
central point _ that dinosaurs had roamed New Zealand.
 &HT;    Today nobody disputes Wiffen's conclusions. ``She put New

says John Long, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Western

 &HT;    The more Wiffen has learned, the more she sees how even the
tiniest finds improve our understanding of an ancient world.

 By DERRICK K. BAKER  
 &HT;    Solely because I have been robbed at gunpoint, an interminable
episode years ago that scared me nearly to death, my opinions about
the absolute necessity of background checks for people who want to
buy guns are not up for debate.
 &HT;    A certain firmness to your convictions results when the cold
barrel of a Saturday-night-special has been pressed to your sweaty
temple and you've been admonished by some weasel about how easy it
would be to scatter your teen-age brains over the storage room of a
variety store.
 &HT;    That searing flashback aside, while the U.S. Justice
Department's success in blocking 204,000 of the more than 8.6
million prospective gun sales last year won't in any way ultimately
stop guns from falling into the hands of criminals, it's reasonable
to guess that within that number of blocked sales lay more than a
few sub-moronic dolts who had no business having access to guns.
 &HT;    To paint a more detailed picture about the positive and
immediate effects of the Brady Act, which was instituted in
February 1994 and required the background checks, last year the
number of purchase rejections numbered 536,000 out of nearly 22.3
million applications. That's a lot of law-abiding citizens and
certified nut jobs alike who might have had his or her former
co-workers squarely sighted in the crosshairs that are the mind's
eye.
 &HT;    Moreover, numbers from the Department of Justice reveal that
state and local police rejected an even higher percentage of
would-be gun buyers than the FBI: The rejection rate among state
and local agencies was 3 percent compared with 1.8 percent for the
FBI.
 &HT;    Is this to imply that the Barney Fifes of the country are more
efficient in keeping guns out of the hands of evildoers than the
highly trained bunch at the FBI?
 &HT;    As a matter of fact, President Clinton and his minions long have
contended that the states are better equipped than the FBI to
conduct background checks, but some states don't want to pay the
costs.
 &HT;    According to the Justice Department, all state agencies had
access to computer databases that record past felony convictions,
and many accessed databases with other disqualifying information
such as fugitive status, court restraining orders, mental illness
and domestic-violence misdemeanor convictions.
 &HT;    The counter contention is true _ that all too often, criminals
don't walk into Billy Bob's Gun Shop to purchase a gun to rob a
7-Eleven or the 80-year-old church deacon. But far too many guns
purchased by law-abiding citizens end up without serial numbers and
in the hands of Pookie Jenkins, who gets a cheap thrill sticking up
people who look and live like him.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, here's a memo to the reluctant decision makers in
those states reluctant to pay for background checks: Take a second
_ and close _ look at your moral compass, before too many
legislators like yourself wind up the victims of violent crimes
committed with guns possessed by some of the very same people who
would have been blocked.
 &HT;    Joining those legislators is the National Rife Association, that
conglomeration of mostly self-righteous ostriches who can't see the
forest for the trees, who want more enforcement of existing gun
laws.
 &HT;    Who better than them to have a problem with accepting the rather
direct correlation between application rejections and the decrease
in firearm-related crimes since 1992?
 &HT;    Granted, the use of firearms has fallen from 31 percent in all
violent crimes eight years ago to 25 percent just two years ago.
But a crime is a crime, and we can reduce the frequency of those
crimes, particularly if we enjoy life.
 &HT;    So if I sound a bit angry at those who would fight the
productivity and constitutionality of background checks for
prospective gun owners, please bear with me. My anger and cynicism
and incredulity have something to do with being among the millions
of Americans who've had the experience of staring life _ and death
_ squarely in the face, courtesy of a firearm.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another ``read my lips'' from a Bush?
 &HT;    For release June 21, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think George W would have learned from daddy's mistake.
But when the presidential candidate, seeking to participate in the
GOP's newest anti-administration, politically motivated maelstrom,
told a Florida audience last weekend that our nuclear secrets will
be secret again in his administration, he was mirroring his
father's ``read my lips, no new taxes'' boast that came to bury his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely: ``I'll bring this sorry chapter to a close. In my
administration, our national labs will be secure again, our vital
information will be sealed again, our nuclear secrets will be
secret again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some campaign promises just can't be kept and George W ought to
know better than to vouch that no similar problem will haunt his
presidency _ if he's elected. Say you'll do everything possible to
ensure that it doesn't happen but don't guarantee it; it's
foolhardy to do so, as the senior Bush found out.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the Super Bowl and George W isn't Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the misplaced computer hard-drives at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory has brought drool to the lips of the
political savages of Capitol Hill. They are calling for the head of
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, I presume in the context of ``the
buck stops here'' guideline set down by Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   But if that be the case, then how come Caspar Weinberger
remained secretary of defense for Ronald Reagan when 247 U.S.
Marines were blown to bits in a horrific breach of security in
Lebanon? And that's not the only one the GOP guard dogs ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when it became public that security had been breached
in the theft of nuclear secrets being passed to China, the GOP
mercenaries targeted the Clinton administration as being jelly when
it came to nuclear secrets. What was odd about it was that the
secrets were stolen during the Reagan and Bush presidencies as
well.
</P>
<P>
   As GOP senators and representatives harangued the Clinton
administration for not cracking down on something that had been
investigated for almost three years, someone reminded Sen. Trent
Lott that it was on Reagan's and Bush's watch that most of the
thefts took place. He responded, incredulously, that he was not
going to dwell on the past, but wanted to know what's being done
now about correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how serious is the Los Alamos crisis, and neither
did all those Republicans who spent last weekend bellowing on
network TV, including Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) who called for
Richardson's resignation. There is much more to be learned,
including whether the secrets were compromised at all.
</P>
<P>
   But we are in an era of intense political fury. In a capital
where no secret is ever safe, where leaks are more like waterfalls,
partisan politics will turn on the slightest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As if money-raising and slush funds were not enough to sicken
the general public, the political combat is getting more disgusting
by the moment. There is no working bi-partisan government anymore,
just partisan acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   There is little the Democratic administration has done, or has
not done, that has not resulted in some call by the GOP for an
investigation or a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does get elected, can we expect a similar reaction from
the Democratic partisans during his administration? I'm afraid so.
They likely will watch his every step -- and misstep -- and clamor
for investigations in an act of political revenge; a vicious chain
that may have its eye-for-an-eye roots in the partisan-driven 1987
Democratic rejection of Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And should Gore reach the presidency, then Lott and his folks
will continue to behave as they do today.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the real examination of breaches such as happened
at Los Alamos (if it happened) is driven not by professional
inquiry but more by political penchant, by public opinion based on
poisoned positions _ and by obtuse statements by presidential
candidates who should know better.
</P>
<P>
   We know where the buck stops _ Harry told us so _ but how many
are passing it around maliciously on the way up?

THE DINO FORMERLY KNOWN AS T. REX? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would a Tyrannosaurus rex by any other name be as fearsome?
</P>
<P>
   It's no idle primordial question.
</P>
<P>
   T. rex, the world's most famous dinosaur, whose toothy visage
has adorned everything from blockbuster movies to children's
bedspreads, could be in for a name change to Manospondylus gigas.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't have quite the same imposing ring, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Even the translation from Latin doesn't compare: Manospondylus
gigas means ``giant, thin vertebrae,'' while Tyrannosaurus rex
means ``tyrant lizard king.''
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself in the place of prehistory's preeminent land-based
killing machine. Would you rather be remembered as a piece of bone
or the baddest reptile on the planet?
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not T. rex fans like it, the ancient predator's tag
has been in question since earlier this month, when about 10
percent of a dinosaur skeleton was unearthed at a South Dakota
ranch by the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, the same
company that in 1990 dug up Sue, the most complete T. rex fossil
ever found.
</P>
<P>
   The South Dakota bones could be part of an earlier fossil dug up
in the same general area in 1892 by paleontologist Edward Drinker
Cope, who dubbed his find Manospondylus gigas. But Cope didn't
extract enough of the fossil for his name to stick in the
scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902 a more complete specimen was discovered in Montana by
Barnum Brown and later named Tyrannosaurus rex by paleontologist
Henry Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Larson, president of the Black Hills Institute of
Geological Research, suspects that his company's South Dakota find
_ including ribs, vertebrae, the jaw and parts of the skull _
belongs to the same colossal carnivore Cope found more than a
century ago. If so, according to the rules of paleontology, the
first name would take priority.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Larson recently told the Associated Press: ``That puts the
name Tyrannosaurus rex in peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, said Christopher Brochu, a paleontologist at the
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where the T. rex called
Sue was unveiled May 17. It would take overwhelming evidence to
unseat the name Tyrannosaurus rex from the zoological nomenclature,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do not think that the name Tyrannosaurus rex is in
any danger,'' Brochu said. ``Larson would have to demonstrate that
he's got the original animal. I doubt that this can be done. If it
can, I'll eat my words. But I'm skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the worst comes to pass and we have to sink
Tyrannosaurus rex, I'm sure the public would still call it that
because that's what everybody knows it as.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Evans, educator and curator of natural science at the
Children's Museum of Indianapolis, where T. rex is an unofficial
mascot, believes that kids would be especially confused by a name
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the validity of the find, but I'm sure the
rules of paleontology will have to bend with this one,'' Evans
said. ``T. rex is ingrained in our culture. It's a definite icon.
You get kids to mention any dinosaur and the first thing they say
is T. rex. Any 4-year-old would pretend to be the `tyrant lizard
king' but none would want to be the `giant, thin vertebrae.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Evans said, Larson probably wouldn't be unhappy if the
name just stayed Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dug more T. rexes than anybody on the planet,'' Evans
said. ``So I'm sure he's the last one who would feel good about
calling it something else. He's pretty attached to it.''

HI-LINE DIRECTOR HAS SOUND FOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actors become directors. Screenwriters become directors. Film
editors and directors of photography become directors.
</P>
<P>
   But sound guys?
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade as a production sound mixer for Steven
Spielberg, Ron Judkins decided it was time to make his mark. He put
his flourishing career on hold, coughed up his life savings (it
helped that the 40-something-year-old isn't married), scrounged
additional dollars from investors and shot ``The Hi-Line,'' a moody
coming-of-age film and love story.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rachael Lee Cook (``She's All That'') and newcomer Ryan
Alosino, it's the story of a bored young woman in small-town
Montana. Her life is turned around with the arrival of a young
Chicago man who claims to be recruiting employees for a proposed
department store. But the stranger has another agenda, and the
young woman discovers she was adopted; she demands that the
Chicagoan take her on a search for her birth mother.
</P>
<P>
   The film also stars Margot Kidder, Stuart Margolin and Tantoo
Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direction is something I always wanted to do,'' Judkins said
in a phone interview from Austin, Texas, where ``The Hi-Line'' was
receiving a commercial run. ``I only got into sound because I
needed money to survive, and I was seduced by success. After all, I
worked with Spielberg on every film he's made since `Hook.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But after 20 years in the business, I realized I was getting
older and needed to return to my original dream to make my own
movie. I'd been writing scripts the whole time, and a couple even
went into development, which meant several rewrites and lots of
meetings, and in the end I wasted two years and the movies never
got made. So I decided to get whatever resources I could and put
together my own film.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``The Hi-Line,'' Judkins said, is in no way
autobiographical. ``But growing up I'd think, `Hey, these can't be
my real parents.' I was waiting for the real ones to show up and
take me away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then on Thanksgiving five years ago, I was in my garage going
through some old photos, and here was a shot of the girl I had a
crush on in third grade. And I entertained this fantasy of tracking
her down but without her knowing I'm looking for her. So I started
playing with that idea, inventing a situation where someone comes
from your past with information about you that even you didn't
know, information that could change your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise also raised questions about what makes us who we
are. Is it how we were brought up? Or is it genetics, who are
parents really are?''
</P>
<P>
   As a production sound mixer, Judkins is familiar with movie
sets; his primary job is to record the dialogue spoken by actors.
But being a director was a big leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, I'd watch my mother drive the car, and I'd
figure it couldn't be that difficult. But it's terrifying your
first day behind the wheel. It's like that the first day on the
set. I'm waiting for someone to tell us what to do, and then I
realize, `Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I realized I had learned something from watching other
directors work, things about taking control. I'm glad I came to
directing after being on the set. I've worked with several
first-time directors who were editors or writers, and they're
really bewildered because they don't know the protocol, they don't
know all the individual jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   For a first-time effort, ``The Hi-Line'' has a real sense of
style, much of it stemming from Judkins' insistence that his actors
take time with the delivery of their lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first days of rehearsal, they would race through the
dialogue; they'd been taught that in acting school. But that's very
unrealistic to me. In real conversation, you hear somebody say
something, and it takes a second to think about it and formulate a
response. I told them not to speak until they had really heard what
the other person said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted there to be space. Having been a sound person, people
expected me to create a film heavy on sound design, with a lot of
noise. But it's just as important not to have sound, to have those
pauses. I think the film's sound parallels what the characters are
going through, this bleak emotional landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Line'' has found a distributor and continues to make
the rounds of festivals. Meanwhile, Judkins has three projects on
the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that it's an uphill battle for indy films.
Everyone thinks you go to Sundance and sell your movie. But there
are hundreds that don't get shown or picked up by a distributor.
Lots of really good little films don't get sold, and it's
heartbreaking.''

FLORIDA SUFFERS FROM KUDZU DEFICIENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have always felt that there was something missing from this
part of Florida and now I think I know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   Other states in the south are positively wallowing in kudzu and
their citizens seem happier and more prosperous as a result.
Residents of kudzu-intensive states like Georgia and Alabama make
baskets out of kudzu as well as jams, jellies, tofu and a kind of
wine that not only goes well with seafood but also doubles as a
particularly high-octane stock-car fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the kudzu-deficient plains of west-central Florida,
on the other hand, spend their free time complaining about the
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu is so scarce in these parts that some people may not even
know what it is. This is unfortunate because kudzu is not only
beautiful to look at, it is extremely easy to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   In her essay ``How to Grow Kudzu,'' Thelma Mable Cooper points
out that kudzu grows equally well on concrete as it does in dirt.
She does suggest, however, that you plant you kudzu at night
because if you plant it by day, ``angry neighbors might see you and
throw rocks at you.''
</P>
<P>
   (I suspect that this is just the natural jealousy that people
who can't grow nice gardens have for people who can.)
</P>
<P>
   For fertilizer, Cooper recommends using 40-weight non-detergent
motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kudzu actually doesn't need anything to help it grow,'' Cooper
writes, ``but the motor oil helps to prevent scraping the underside
of the tender leaves when the kudzu starts its rapid growth. It
also cuts down on the friction and lessens the danger of fire when
the kudzu really starts to move. Change oil once every thousand
feet or every two weeks, whichever comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other plants, kudzu can profit from a good mulch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that a heavy mulch for the young plants produces a
hardier crop,'' Cooper writes. ``For best results, as soon as the
young shoots begin to appear, cover the kudzu with concrete blocks.
Although this causes a temporary setback, your kudzu will accept
this mulch as a challenge and will reward you with redoubled
determination in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Tree-huggers will be happy to know that kudzu is the perfect
plant for organic gardening. Advocates of the scorched-earth
approach to gardening will also find kudzu to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kudzu is oblivious to both chemicals and pests. Therefore, you
can grow organically and let the pests get out of the way of the
kudzu as best they can, or you can spray any commercial poison
directly on your crop. Your decision depends on how much you enjoy
killing bugs. The kudzu will not mind either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper also recommends growing kudzu close to your house,
especially if your house is not in very good condition and you want
to sell it. In a short time (five minutes), the kudzu will cover
your house completely, concealing minor flaws like broken windows,
cracked shingles, missing roof, etc. that might ``turn off''
prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   This quality of kudzu might be especially useful in Sarasota
where architecture nags complain about the lack of a unifying theme
in our public buildings. An impenetrable, green, leafy verdure
covering all buildings, including those that haven't even been
built yet, would not only provide such a theme, it would also
provide our many local artists with a free and abundant supply of
basket-weaving material.
</P>
<P>
   As if this were not enough, kudzu is extremely drought-resistant
to the point that blasting it with a flame-thrower only makes it
sprout more vines.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, those of us who live in this part of Florida have spent
too much time arguing about bridges and too little time touting the
joys of kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, if it's good enough for Georgia, it's good enough
for us.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for ``The Perfect Smile'' tooth whitening
system, distributed by Guthy-Renker Corp. Also, how can I get Lance
Armstrong's autograph?
</P>
<P>
   _ Linsey J.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Perfect Smile is no longer distributed by Guthy-Renker.
The system is available from ProHealth Laboratories ($24.58) at
(800) 520-1906. Unfortunately, Lance Armstrong does not mail
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Monday's child is fair of face, and Tuesday child is full
of grace, what are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   _ L. Smith A: Wednesday's child is full of woe, Thursday's child
has far to go, Friday's child is loving and giving, Saturday's
child works hard for a living, and the child born on the Sabbath
day is blithe and bonny and good and gay.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm moving into a smaller home and am interested in a Murphy
bed. Do you know where I can buy one?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bev D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact the Murphy Bed Co. at (800) 845-2337 or visit
www.murphybedcompany.com to purchase a system. Prices begin at $550
(mattress not included). The brainchild of San Franciscan William
L. Murphy this wall bed was invented out of desperation for more
space in a tiny apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Friends flew us to Matagorda Island, and while beachcombing,
my husband found a wine bottle with a note inside, plus a $1 bill
dated 1995. The note is mostly faded and printed in German. Do you
know of anyone who could bring out the printing?
</P>
<P>
   _ Flo Nix
</P>
<P>
   A: Not an old note, but a curious one. Try this recommendation
from the specialists at the University of Texas' Preservation and
Conservation Studies program. Attempt to raise the writing with a
high contrast copier or a black light.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The water dripping from my air conditioner looks like good,
clean water. Is it drinkable? Is it distilled?
</P>
<P>
   _ Tommy H.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I wouldn't do it,'' admits Jay Fox, natural resource
specialist, who added, ``It is no more safe than drinking the water
off a metal roof.'' Think about it. The metal surface of the unit
could be full of dust, dirt and algae. The water could contain
leached metal (not a healthy additive). At the very least (if
forced by catastrophe _ natural or otherwise), treat the water. Add
one teaspoon of bleach per gallon of water before consuming it.
Maybe using it on the lawn is a better idea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Back in the mid- to late 1970s, there was a tabloid called
the Austin Sun. The sportswriter was Big Boy Medlin. His columns
were hilarious. Is he still writing somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: James ``Big Boy'' Medlin is special projects director for E!
Entertainment Network. His last special project was 1999's ``Search
Party,'' in which celebrities and viewers traveled to beach resorts
for ``crazy athletic events and off-the-wall scavenger hunts.'' A
far cry from his writing credit for ``Roadie.'' Write to him in
care of the network, 5750 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif.
90036.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the airport, during a U.S. Customs check-in, my daughter
playfully snapped a picture of her friend's suitcase being
searched. To her surprise, the customs officer confiscated her
film. Is it really illegal to take a picture of a customs officer?
</P>
<P>
   _ Debbie Mullins
</P>
<P>
   A: It is not allowed. Customs inspectors have about as much
humor about photographs as they do about bomb threats. ``For
security and safety purposes, photographs are not allowed in this
non public area,'' says U.S. Customs spokeswoman Layne Lathram.
Criminal elements may take more than a passing interest in the
identities of these officers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a recipe that calls for 2 cups of Milnot. What is it,
and where can I find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Nia Meissler
</P>
<P>
   A: Milnot is a canned evaporated milk product in which the fat
has been removed and replaced by soybean oil. Milnot is cholesterol
free. You can purchase the milk from the Milnot Co. by calling
(800) 877-6455. Of course, you will have to buy a case (24 12-ounce
cans).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a pair of fiddler crabs. The female is carrying a
sponge containing several thousand eggs. The sponge appeared nine
days ago. How long before the eggs are laid? Can they survive in
fresh water? How many can I expect to survive? What should I feed
them?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The eggs have been laid, says Don Harper of the Texas A&AMP;M
Marine Lab. Female crabs generally carry their eggs attached to the
abdominal appendages until they hatch. If the crabs were collected
from a marine environment, they need a marine environment. Harper
warns that a very small percentage will survive. And the preferred
menu? Fiddlers scrape the surface layer of the mud where they live
and ``extract detritus and small living organisms with their
mouthparts,'' so the rich mud will provide the food.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best oil to use after sanding a kitchen butcher
block table.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Mineral oil is the best to recondition the wood and help
prevent it from absorbing other juices (e.g. raw meat). Some
experts recommend heating the oil slightly before application (20
seconds in the microwave). Slather. Let the oil sit 5-10 minutes.
Wipe. Reapply if necessary. Q: Is there any place to order the
``Muggles for Harry Potter'' shirts that were sold at the Chicago
BookExpo?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but you will have to wait _ these popular T-shirts ($15
children's sizes, $18 adult, plus shipping) are back-ordered. A
``muggle,'' for those of you who are Harry Potter-challenged, is a
non magical person.
</P>
<P>
   Muggles shirt sales raise money for the American Booksellers
Foundation for Free Expression. The group is concerned that the
J.K. Rowling books have been challenged in 13 states. Want to help
spread the word that First Amendment challenges will be fought?
Pick up 100 Muggles for Harry Potter buttons for $40 ($30 for
members).
</P>
<P>
   Call ABFFE at (212) 587-4025 to put your name on the waiting
list for a shirt or to purchase the buttons now. Q: I have a friend
in California who has an 1840 Republic of Texas $3 bill, with a
serial number 10. Does it have any monetary value?
</P>
<P>
   _ William J. Robinson
</P>
<P>
   A: The Republic produced $3 bills along with $1, $2 and $5
bills. According to Calvin Burgin at Larry Spence Rare Coins, this
bill, depending on condition and authenticity, could be worth $25
to $150. The most valuable Republic of Texas currency? The $500
bill
</P>
<P>
   Q: I sent off for tickets to the David Letterman show in
December 1998. To ensure I would get tickets, I also sent a request
for my mother and my sister. It's been a year and a half and no
tickets. I'm ready for another trip to the Big Apple. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your previous requests could have been construed as multiples
and therefore discarded. The Letterman ticket team does not take
kindly to multiple ticket requests. Try again. Send a postcard to
Late Show Tickets, Ed Sullivan Theater, 1697 Broadway, New York
10019. Two tickets per postcard. The wait could be nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Standby tickets are issued by phone (no more waiting in line) on
the day of taping. Call (212) 247-6497 at 11 a.m. To try for
tickets due to cancellations, visit
www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/lateshow/pantsnews/tickets.shtml.
Audience members must be 18 or older. Q: Can you please tell me who
the attorney was for Ruiz in Ruiz v. Estelle and how to get in
touch with him/her?
</P>
<P>
   _ L. P.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are looking for William Bennett Turner of Rogers, Joseph,
O'Donnell &AMP; Quinn, 311 California St., San Francisco, Calif. 94104.
A graduate of Harvard Law School and Northwestern University, civil
rights attorney Turner was born in Fort Worth. Turner represented
the prisoners in a number of suits consolidated by Federal Judge
William Wayne Justice into Ruiz v. Estelle, which resulted in
radical improvements in the Texas prison system.
</P>
<P>
   David Ruiz wrote his petition for improved prisoner's rights on
toilet paper. W.J. Estelle was the director of the department of
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar: Etymologists have several theories about
the derivation of the popular American phrase ``OK.'' Some
attribute it to that well-intentioned phonetic speller Andrew
Jackson, who marked texts with ``Oll Korrect''; others to the
Democratic O.K. Club supporting the candidacy of Martin Van Buren.
O.K. stood for Old Kinderhook, a Van Buren title referring to the
Hudson Valley village of his birth. Mino by Guthy-Renker. The
system is available from ProHealth Laboratories ($24.58) at (800)
520-1906. Unfortunately, Lance Armstrong does not mail autographs.

feel about all this?

 &HT;    News fast? Why not try dieting?
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A few weeks ago, the mellow, accentless
voice of Dr. Andrew Weil came out of my car radio, courtesy of
National Public Radio, and told me to turn off the news.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weil is a holistic, New Age, alt-medicine practitioner with
an auralike ring of white hair and beard around his face and a book
in the stores, ``Eight Weeks to Optimum Health.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is filled with health tips. Like drinking filtered
water, trying breathing exercises, drinking ginseng teas and eating
your broccoli. He also prescribes a ``news fast.'' No newspapers,
no radio, no TV.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on this would be a fairly transparent conflict of
interest. If too many people fast figuratively, I would fast
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea that I might not be good for your optimum health
gets me down. It suggests that in the feast of knowledge, I'm a
mere glazed jelly donut.
</P>
<P>
   But Weil has a point. A lot of news taken indiscriminately and
without a sense of humor could make someone view the world as a
loud, stupid and dangerous place.
</P>
<P>
   People who expect horrible things because they think real life
is like the crime-o-rama of local TV news probably would be
cynical, unhappy, unlikely to feel optimum.
</P>
<P>
   I have been on extended news fasts. I did this when I was on
vacation or at a university. In other words, at times when little
was expected from me.
</P>
<P>
   But a news fast is an extreme measure. What's called for instead
is a better news diet. And it's not hard to read healthy, get your
daily minimum dose of irony, and still feel as good as realist
would dare.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are the strata of the news-intake pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   AVOID LIST:
</P>
<P>
   Child actors, celebrities with causes, people who interpret Alan
Greenspan, Donald Trump, gun nuts, anyone associated with any
prosecution that vied for the title ``trial of the century.'' In
particular avoid: People who have unsuccessfully run for president
twice or more, people who have run for any office more than three
times, rock musicians on a comeback after drug-abuse and personal
scandal, second-tier shock jocks, profess
</P>
<P>
   ional doomsayers, sound-bite moralists and anyone not in uniform
carrying any kind of flag. And car wrecks. You would know they
happen whether they were in the paper or not. Anything additional
is mere variation on the theme.
</P>
<P>
   READ SPARINGLY
</P>
<P>
   You should count to three before reading: A crime story more
than 50 miles from your home. A story that announces a hot trend
based on a television show and what two guys from the office say. A
story with more than one unnamed source that take more than six
words to describe _ sources close to people familiar with those
involved in the case. A story about anyone's divorce or
child-custody fight (whether or not they are from Cuba). A story
using the phrase ``tech-heavy Nasdaq.'' Any political media event
that involves use of props. Political polls.
</P>
<P>
   READ AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE:
</P>
<P>
   Comics. You are not too old to read the comics. Columnists, of
course columnists. They are sterling but misunderstood and
underpaid people who bring humor and perspective to a confusing
world. Stories about the stupidity of criminals. They will enhance
your sense of personal safety. State Legislature stories. They can
be dull, but legislatures have more direct effect on folks than our
over-covered White House. Letters to the editor that don't involve
guns, abortion or the Social Security benefit notch. Anything about
someone actually accomplishing something.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of junk-news out there. I don't blame Dr. Weil for
wanting to chuck it all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is some danger that, in our ignorance of the world,
bad people with less-than-optimum designs on our health and welfare
would be left to do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   There probably were self-actualized people in optimum health who
were on news fasts in Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Optimum health will only take you so far.
</P>
<P>
   Being engaged in the outside world is stressful and trying. But
taking that on is part of what we laughingly call ``being an
adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I just report the news.

 &HT;    Common sense and government don't always mix
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A few columns ago I was complaining about the
new postmaster who came to town after our Mr. Reed retired, and as
good as accused me of trying to steal a mailing envelope when he
could see that all I was doing
</P>
<P>
   was stuffing my old blue dress into it to mail to a friend for
her yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   The new postmaster and I were the only folks in the place, so it
wasn't like I was going to make off with his envelope and get lost
in the crowd. Besides he knows my name, my face, and where I live.
And my picture isn't even on his ``WANTED'' wall.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he got a little pushy, and I got a little huffy _ for
all the good it did me, because he still made me pay for the
envelope separately before I finished stuffing it.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really think I was intending to knock over his post
office for a lousy red, white, and blue mailer? Apparently he did.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I wrote about it and as it turns out, a lot of folks
had something to add.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-year-old M.D. in California wrote: ``Your comments were on
target. Born and raised in Ballard/Clinton, Mo. After WW2 service
and finishing school, I moved to Rialto, Calif. (population 2800
and citrus groves). Now Rialto is 80,000-plus and one orange grove.
If I call the P.O., I get Denver, Colo. P.O. exchange. My mail
service is mostly borderline poor. Progress sometimes isn't all it
is cracked up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of reminds me of the conversation I overheard once in the
teacher's lounge at school. ``I need a repairman _ my washer won't
spin,'' my colleague wailed into the phone. There was a pause, then
she said: ``In Pemberville'' ... `` near Bowling Green'' ...
``Ohio! Where are you?'' She slapped a palm to her forehead and
repeated in absolute disbelief. ``You're telling me I have to talk
to somebody in Utah to have a washing machine repaired in northwest
Ohio?''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what they were telling her.
</P>
<P>
   In the small town of Woodville, Ohio, an insurance agency owner
has been having a little fun of her own. ``The IRS,'' she explains,
``sent us a letter stating they couldn't mail our return check to
us at a post office box and that every time they had mailed it to
our street address, the post office had sent it back to them. They
couldn't get the check to us anywhere _ but they could get the
letter to us at the street address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the post office where we've been doing business for
generations, and said, ``We have a problem here. One federal agency
(the IRS) is saying we can't use a post office box for taxes. The
other (post office) is saying if I have a post office box, I have
to use that box number. What do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went round and round on this for weeks. Then one day the
post office said the carrier could deliver mail to my street
address on Monday through Friday, but if it has the box number on
it, it stays at the post office until we pick
</P>
<P>
   it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no problem, I explained, since the post office is less
than a block away. But I asked if it wouldn't be easier on the
carrier if they just put all our mail in the box and let us pick it
up. Nope, they couldn't do that. ``I asked what they were going to
do with mail for the agency's street address on Saturday when we're
closed. The clerk said, ``Oh, we'll just throw that in your box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dumbfounded. It makes no sense that they can't put
street-addressed mail in my box Monday through Friday, but it's
okay on Saturday. I asked why, and the clerk said it was
``regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   From the looks of my mail, a lot of folks are confused by and
annoyed with the postal service. So am I. And I resent paying the
salary of some guy who sits in Washington cranking out silly
directives warning the Gibsonburg postmaster to be on the lookout
for grand theft _ envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to common sense?

 &HT;    Perfect Dark is a perfect follow-up
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Long awaited and, frankly, long overdue, Perfect Dark ($50;
www.nintendo.com; for the Nintendo 64) is finally here. The
follow-up to the smash hit ``Goldeneye 007'' _ which still is
praised as the best first-person sneaky shooter on any console _
Perfect Dark surpasses its predecessor with sophisticated
artificial intelligence, superior lighting and sound effects and
``secondary firing'' features for some 35 weapons _ all the while
remaining true to the immersive, story-driven gameplay of the James
Bond game. Lead heroine Joanna Dark is a stealthy, secret-agent and
tactician with a license to kill, which she uses extremely
liberally. Blocky and hazy graphics are easily forgiven as players
are immersed in an intricate series of commando mission of seek and
discover, sneak and destroy, and tiptoe through a rampage.
Alternately, gameplay includes a variety of multiplayer modes;
co-operative mini-missions, flat-out death matches or variants. A
lot of game, and well worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   For those who need constant Sim-stimulation, there is Sim City
3000 Unlimited ($40; www.simcity.com; for Windows), an expanded,
colossal version of the 1999 game. New features include a new set
of buildings _ Asian and European _ new scenarios, new disasters
(plague of locusts, anyone?), seasons, customizable trees and
terrain, and an architect tool that lets you design your own homes
and buildings. While some of us still prefer the more personal,
addictive ``The Sims,'' Sim City 3000 fans will get a dose of new
things with the game, although the price may be steep for what it
essentially the same game with a few new extras. Luckily, owners of
the original game can get a $10 rebate if they buy Unlimited before
June 24.

 &HT;    A DVD for the dollar-conscious
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Still leery about this new-fangled DVD technology? Leer no more.
Konka has sidled into the home entertainment market with the
KD1800U DVD deck ($199; www.konkausa.com), an ``affordably'' priced
unit that, nevertheless, still offers picture and sound quality
notably superior to a high-end VHS player. Respectably functional
with standard DVD features _ remote, multiple language options, CD
and S-Video compatibility, various screen sizes and ratios _ the
KD1800U has a fresh and stylish appearance, sleek and silver, which
belies the fact it's a low-end component. By the time this sexy
thing gives up the ghost, high-end DVD players will be similarly
priced, which makes the KD1800U the perfect starter DVD machine.
Still leery? You're still playing 8-track tapes, too, aren't you?

   'FIGHT CLUB' DVD A REAL PUNCH IN THE NOSE
</P>
<P>
   Disenfranchised, disgruntled and ultimately disassociated guys
from the IKEA Generation start a bare-fisted brawl society in order
to vent all that world-weary angst. Then things get interesting.
Then, when things start to get a little weird, they get extremely
weird. Targeted directly at the 30-year old male-without-an-outlet
demographic, Fight Club Special Edition DVD ($35; www.foxdvd.com)
is hemorrhaging with extras: optional feature length running
commentary _ thoughts and anecdotes from actors Brad Pitt, Edward
Norton, Helena Bonham Carter and director David Fincher, for
example, as well as craft secrets elucidated by the production
crew. This edition also includes a second DVD gushing with extra
footage, behind-the-scenes clips, beguiling stills and concept art
gallery, and much more. Also featured for the first time is the new
``THX Optimode'' that allows for individual calibration of audio
and video to optimize one's home theatre performance.

 &HT;    Origami meets two-wheeler
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Riding a bicycle is one of the most
energy-efficient ways to get around, but using a bike to travel is
sometimes impractical. Perhaps the route is too long or too steep,
or perhaps you don't have a secure place to stash your bike. The
Montague Corp.'s line of folding bicycles may help you get around
some of those obstacles. The Montague CX 21-speed Comfort Bike
($450; www.montagueco.com), one of the company's newest models,
comes with either an 18- or 20-inch aluminum frame. It weighs 30
pounds and folds to 36 inches by 28 inches by 12 inches. Montague
says its bikes are full-size vehicles that fold down to half their
size in less than a minute without the use of tools. To fold a
Montague bike, the rider loosens a quick release bolt to remove the
front wheel. Two quick-release bolts on the seat post are then
loosened, and the rear wheel swings around to fold over the middle
of the bike frame. Other models include a mountain bike, an
off-road bike, an urban bike, an electric bike and a tandem bike _
all of which fold for easy storage.

 &HT;    Sites teach how to understand Internet lingo, with Netiquette
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've used the Internet to get your daily horoscope,
to do marketing research for work, to check the weather for your
picnic next Saturday. Now it's only logical that you use the Net to
find out about the Net.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at a site that helps you learn the language of the
Internet. Before long you'll be speaking of TCP and IP and port
surfing with the big folks. Just drop in at Surf Lingo at
www.zdnet.com/yil/content/surfschool/lingo/lingotoc.html and you'll
soon know the language from Arpanet (the precursor to the Internet)
to zmodem (a now outdated data transfer method).
</P>
<P>
   A slightly more technical guide is the Internet Encyclopedia at
freesoft.org/CIE/index.htm where you'll learn about the technical
operation of the Net. It's a searchable database, and you'll find
help on almost any technical term, but you may come away as
confused as you arrived. For instance, here's the beginning of the
explanation of subnetting: ``Engineers gradually realized that the
original class-based addressing design was too inflexible for many
applications. In the mid-1980s, subnetting was introduced as an
extension to the original scheme. ... For example, 255.255.0.0 is a
standard class B subnet mask, since the first two bytes are all
ones (network), and the last two bytes are all zeros (host). In a
subnetted network, the network portion is extended.''
</P>
<P>
   The good thing is that you really don't have to understand
subnetting to impress others, just cut and paste several of the
explanations into the report your boss wants about the challenges
ahead for your company in e-commerce and you'll be an instant
Internet expert.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that most newcomers notice, almost immediately, is
that there is a different set of rules for polite behavior on the
Internet. When one of those rules is violated (something as simple
as typing in all capital letters), new users are almost certain to
hear about it, sometimes in a rude and abusive way. While that in
itself isn't great Internet etiquette, there are ways to avoid
these confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to learn the culture and etiquette of the Internet is
at a site called Netiquette at www.albion.com/netiquette/. If you
want a quick and basic course, there's a link to a section called
``core rules,'' but if you want even more, if you have aspirations
to become the Emily Post of the Net, then there is a link to a
complete guide to Netiquette too.
</P>
<P>
   Most old hands at the Net will be glad to see that _ included in
the complete guide _ there is a strong admonition not to pass on
electronic chain letters, or to naively send along dire warnings of
viruses that never lived outside phony e-mail warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know how to behave and can speak the language,
you'll want to visit a comprehensive site called Learn the Net at
www.learnthenet.com/english/index.html. You've graduated from basic
training and now it's time for advanced work. This is a site that
offers more depth and discusses some of the lesser known areas of
the Net such as newsgroups and listservs (which are discussion
groups carried on by e-mail _ make sure you read about them before
joining one, since you can end up with more e-mail than a normal
person would wish for).

 &HT;    Yahoo's treasures prove it's not just a search engine
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, here's a surprise from our friends at Yahoo
Internet Life magazine (www.yil.com). In its July issue listing 10
Internet essentials, Web portal Yahoo is the number one pick for
searching the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it's become much more than just a directory, Yahoo
remains the first place to look for Web sites on a particular
topic,'' the blurb for Yahoo says, along with the disclaimer
``(Yahoo) is our licensing partner but we're editorially
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But affiliation or no affiliation, Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) still
topped a list of essential Web sites that included a lot of sites
that actually are pretty useful, such as weather.com, tickets.com,
Excite's newstracker (nt.excite.com) and Careerbuilder's mega job
search (www.careerbuilder.com).
</P>
<P>
   So there is an off chance that maybe Yahoo Internet Life isn't
taking the easy way out by picking its licensing partner as the
best place to search the Web. It might be time to take a second
look at Yahoo and see how much service and utility it provides for
its legions of users.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is the oldest, the biggest and without a shadow of a doubt
the most jam-packed Web portal online. It's also one of the most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tom Filo and Jerry Yang founded Yahoo in the mid '90s, a
crop of really good Web portals such as Lycos, Snap and Excite have
cropped up offering a wide variety of features and services in
addition to just plain old Web searching.
</P>
<P>
   There are also great sites like Google that simply let you
search, no shopping, no stock quotes, just searching. So even
though Yahoo is no longer the only game in town, it's still one of
the most popular sites on the Web. After America Online, it's the
second most popular site on the Web, with approximately 49 million
unique visitors in April, according to Web measurement firm Media
Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   When people talked about Yahoo, they used to call it a search
engine, but Yahoo's very testy spokespeople always insisted that
Yahoo was much more than that, and, upon close inspection, it is.
Like it or not, Yahoo is a category killer when it comes to wading
through and ultimately finding the needle in the enormous Internet
haystack.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Yahoo's success is in the way it tries to organize
the Web, not just by category and subject but by country and
special interest areas for news hounds, sports fans, and financial
wizards. Name your category and Yahoo probably has a special area
set up just for you, with more links than you can count and enough
audio, video and links to Web sites around the world to keep you
happy and informed for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Yahoo's Finance section (finance.yahoo.com) is a
search/information engine that is strictly devoted to financial
news and information. Links to almost every financial site
imaginable, a partnership with Reuters, and the ability for users
to track their own stock portfolios make YahooFinance one of the
best financial portals on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is a global concern, as anyone who scrolls down to the
bottom of the start page will see. There are many other Yahoos in
many other countries and languages. This is one feature of Yahoo
that more Web searchers should take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Gladiators'' star Russell Crowe doesn't turn up
much on the American site, but a visit to Yahoo Australia and New
Zealand has reams of information about the Australian Oscar
nominee, including information and digital downloads of his very
obscure, very alternative rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Web users have already discovered Yahoo mail, a free
Web-based e-mail service, while many more use Yahoo to keep up on
current events with its news sections that attack national and
international news with the sort of depth of coverage you could
search for on your own if you had at least half a day and a
complete knowledge of the Web. Yahoo also has auctions and shopping
areas, but they're not the real reason people go to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But that said, users who visit Yahoo Travel shopping for
airfares will find that its online partner, Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) may suggest a substantially cheaper fare to a
nearby city. It's the value-added bonus of alliances like this one
that keep users coming back to Yahoo to do a lot more than search.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Yahoo is all about searching the Web and organizing
a seemingly endless stream of information into easy-to-find,
easy-to-digest bites. Yahoo organizes the Web in such a way that no
matter what obscure bit of information you want to find, it will
find a way to bring it to you.

 &HT;    An online grocery trip proves less than perfect
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I got a call on the weekend from a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it,'' she said. ``You've got to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is a new Internet grocery delivery service. ``It'' had
dominated a good portion of the conversation at a local coffee
house where three of us were attempting to knit together wits that
had been thoroughly unraveled by the Pandora's box that is the end
of school.
</P>
<P>
   We were swapping notes on summer plans when the conversation
took a sharp right. Commiserating on the upcoming need for more
food to feed children suddenly home all day led to tales of
``why-I-hate-going-to-the-supermarket.'' (The group consensus was
that food shopping is like housework, a necessary evil doomed to be
repeated and repeated and repeated.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said my friend, ''maybe not if you do it on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical. Would it really save time? Could you find
everything you need? What about preferred brands? (Morris the cat
could take lessons from my son in finicky eating.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As we talked I realized a sea change had occurred. As little as
a month ago, my friend had little to no interest in the Internet
beyond its ability to help her son with his homework. When I asked
for her e-mail address so I could send her some sites to look at
for summer camps, she couldn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she was raving about the joy of online grocery shopping.
The difference, of course, was that this use of the Internet had
function and meaning, immediate meaning, in her life. One
time-consuming weekly chore _ a physical trip to the grocery store
nutes.
</P>
<P>
   I settled in to do my shopping. I confess I didn't read the all
instructions. (I'd blocked out time but not that much.) It was
still a little cumbersome, but much less so than the earlier sites
I'd shopped on. About sixty-five percent of the time I found my
preferred brand, and I wasn't certain what the ``store brand'' was.
It did appear that using the site would become easier with
increased use.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from my friend, I saved pertinent items on a weekly
list as I did my shopping. A little over an hour later, I was
nearly done. ``Not bad,'' I was thinking. ``I could get used to
this. Call up my weekly list, add, subtract. ... I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   And I was, just not as I had planned. The server died and my
carefully almost completed virtual shopping list was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, that's technology.

 &HT;    WordPerfect vs. Word brouhaha keeps churning
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The uproar created by my discovery and disclosure of a
sinister underground network of DOS users has now evolved into a
frontal attack upon my choice of word processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a management consultant for a wide variety of large and
small firms and I have to be equally proficient in Word and
WordPerfect,'' writes Mike Atchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite things to do with Word-centric writers _
such as you appear to be _ is to challenge them to reproduce a page
out of any publication, and I'll do the same page in WordPerfect.
I'll beat them by almost 20 percent every time.''
</P>
<P>
   As I said last week in regard to a similar offer from the
redoubtable Miz Becker of Denver, I'm not accepting challenges
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find WordPerfect 9 to be just as easy to use and much faster
with complicated layouts. By the way, it still has the great
`reveal codes' feature that Word users never get a chance to
appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Atchison makes the same assumption as Becker did in last
week's column. It has obviously not occurred to either of them that
there may be some of us who don't want to be confronted with codes.
</P>
<P>
   Having a word processor that will reveal its codes implies that
the user wants to fiddle with them. This in turn inevitably implies
that the user knows what the codes mean. I don't know what they
mean. I don't want to know what they mean. I don't want to be one
of those men Who Knew Too Much.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to another, potentially more serious, issue with the
whole idea of a word processor that reveals its codes. It smacks of
Bring Your Child to Work Day at the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   What is a code for, if not to keep secrets? A word processor
that will blab its secrets to any Tom, Dick or Geeky who happens to
click his mouse in the right place is a low, treacherous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, obviously, is an outfit that knows how to keep a
secret, and it has instilled this sterling trait into its word
processor. I applaud that.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes J.B. McKoy, to compare Word unfavorably with
WordStar:
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of Word's bloatedness, I have yet to find the simple
but very useful block copy function in it that was present in
WordStar 18 years ago,'' he writes. ``This function allowed you to
mark the upper left and lower right corners of any block of text in
the body of a document, and copy it. There have been many times
I've wanted to just take a chunk of a page in Word, but it requires
you to take entire rows instead. This means a lot of manual work to
get the piece you wanted in the first place. Do you know why such a
simple but useful function would still be missing from Word?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. McKoy, imagination fails me. If I understand you
right, you want to be able to copy, let's say, only the right half
of a paragraph. The concept works with a spreadsheet, but I can't
see its use when dealing with text. Applying that idea to this
paragraph, you might have:
</P>
<P>
   ``me. Why would anyone want
</P>
<P>
   to copy, let's say,
</P>
<P>
   The concept works with a
</P>
<P>
   spreadsheet, but I
</P>
<P>
   Applying that idea to this para-
</P>
<P>
   graph, you''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt I'm missing something here. Perhaps that the right
techniques, probably involving a pair of pliers and a hypodermic
full of sodium pentothal, would persuade Word to reveal its codes
on the subject.

 &HT;    Cell phone insanity is spreading, so here are some rules

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man was obviously insane, maybe dangerously so,
waving his arms, speaking loudly as he walked alone along the
street on a dusky evening near the newspaper where I work.
</P>
<P>
   As near as I could tell he was either excited about a baseball
game or explaining t things. It's because of those danged low cell
phone rates and free airtime offers.
</P>
<P>
   I yearn for the days when the only people having monologues were
wearing three jackets and mismatched shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the only danger from cell phone addicts. If they
don't kill you on the road, they'll drive you crazy in the
elevator.
</P>

   Just this morning on the elevator at work, a fellow standing 8
inches away from me was explaining to his wife why his golf round
lasted 18 hours on Saturday. It was obvious, from listening to his

 &HT;    Buying a car online
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it came time for Julie Smith to buy a new car,
she wasn't sure exactly what she wanted. But she was sure she
didn't want to haggle over the price.
</P>
<P>
   After researching vehicles in publications such as Consumer
Reports and looking at them up close on dealer lots, the inside
sales representative for McKesson HBOC turned to the Internet to
price and purchase her 2000 Lexus RX 300 sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole buying experience was great. I didn't have to
dicker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She went first to Edmunds.com, a site that has car-buying tips
as well as the dealer invoice for pricing a vehicle. There Smith
found a link to Autobytel.com, a car-buying service that puts
prospective buyers in touch with local dealers for a no-haggle
price on the vehicle they want, from color choice to option
packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been the best deal, but I was getting a decent
price,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience is being shared by an increasing number of car
buyers who may feel intimidated by the car-buying process or who
want the convenience of car shopping from home.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of all used-car shoppers used the Internet
for assistance during the shopping process, according to an August
survey by J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the transaction, another Power study
showed the number of auto dealers working with online buying
services has doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Cyber Dialogue, an Internet consulting company, found
that 21 million people used the Net last year to get data on new
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 8.4 million reported that they bought vehicles, but
170,000 did so directly over the Internet, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, another dot-com company is adding a new
tool to the buyers' workbench. You'll find ways to find, price,
finance, insure and take delivery of a new or used car.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the first question a prospective buyer should ask:
Do I want a new or used vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is important. If you're buying a new car you must go
through a dealer. With used cars, there are varying paths to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   With new cars, state franchise laws require a dealer to be part
of the process, but there are no prohibitions on buying new cars
via the Internet or even from out-of-state dealers, noted Bill
Morie, president of the Georgia Automobile Dealers Association, a
trade group for new-car dealers. In most situations, Internet
buyers will sign the papers with a dealer in their area.
</P>
<P>
   Car buyers are embracing the Internet for buying all sorts of
things, noted Gayle Troberman, director of marketing for
Microsoft's CarPoint buying service. ``It's the first place to go
to get information at their fingertips and feel comfortable about
the money they are spending.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, price isn't the only factor, she said. ``They want
to get the right car for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet allows consumers to make comparisons between makes
and models, determine what tradeoffs they have to make and get a
fair price, which may not always be the absolutely lowest price,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealerships in the past have been more resistant to the Internet
than some other retailers. Despite the extensive consolidation
going on in the industry, most dealerships are owned by individual
entrepreneurs, many of whom have been in the auto business for
decades and are reluctant to accept new ways of doing business.
Still, there are some innovators.
</P>
<P>
   One who has embraced the Internet is Mark Bowen, general manager
for Hyundai, Subaru and Oldsmobile for the Ed Voyles automotive
dealership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing that ever happened to honest car
dealers,'' he said. ``The Internet has done for car selling what
the Model T did. It's that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can find the dealer's invoice amount easily, including
the base price and options packages. ``Everything's out there. Why
should we play games?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   From Internet traffic that was next to nothing last year, Bowen
says about 40 percent of his Subaru customers and nearly a third of
those looking at Hyundais have made contact online.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between the sites and the dealers is the key,
Bowen said: The Internet provides the contacts; the dealers provide
the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers in the J.D. Power survey reported that customers who
used an online service saved an average of $490 on a new car,
compared with traditional showroom shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, online customers usually are quoted a lower price
up front without having to make an offer, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Voyles dealership is not a no-haggle environment,
Bowen insists he's providing a fair price, usually a fixed amount
over the dealer invoice, to Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online services are particularly effective for shoppers
who feel intimidated by salespeople and want to find a dealer that
is willing to give them their best price right upfront,'' said
Chris Denove, J.D. Power's director of automotive
retail/distribution analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Most car-buying sites have links to other sources of
information, including Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), a pofor the
vehicle because it doesn't factor in ``holdback,'' an amount that
the manufacturer rebates to the dealer once the vehicle is sold.
The refund is meant to help offset the dealer's expenses for
keeping the vehicle in inventory. There also are other charges,
including freight, dealer back-office fees, sales tax and state
title fees. There may also be consumer or dealer rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers have gathered information on price, style and
options _ and maybe even arranged financing _ they may be directed
to a dealer's own Web site or e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of franchised new-car dealerships have
Internet sites, according to the National Automobile Dealers
Association. Of them, 93 percent allow customers to send e-mail,
order online or obtain financing. Of those without can create lists
of audio that can be digitally altered to your specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: OK, OK. Let's keep it simple. So, you wanna say ``hey'' to
your friend? A WAV (pronounced ``wave'') file is an uncompressed
computer recording. It can be heard by anyone using a Mac or PC. I
downloaded Ultra Recorder 2.4.1 (members.aol.com/ejc3/Ultra.html).
It's a Mac shareware application ($20). I also tested SoundBuilder
2.0.3 (freeware from MacWorld downloads). Both of these apps let
you record your voice quickly and easily. Once you record your file
with a standard microphone, it's a no-brainer to convert it to
Windows WAV and send it to a PC friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, I created several little annoying voice WAV files
within seconds. I told jokes, said ``hi'' and made weird little
noises.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I have a beautiful new background on my desktop, but I can't see
it because of all the icons. How can I remove icons from the
desktop? I still want the programs. I'll just go to ``Programs'' to
get them. I can't seem to find the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ April Coleman
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like you need to do a little spring cleaning and
organizing. It can be confusing and scary if you do not know what's
what on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: I'm the resident expert on how to manage a messy desktop.
I haven't seen my desktop picture in years. In order for me to find
files, I close my eyes and play pin-the-tail on the computer
screen. One thing I have learned on a Mac is that your desktop can
take a hike (become corrupt) and you can lose all your data. I'm
still recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Some people will never learn. An easy way to deal with this
is to create a folder on the hard drive (could be the C drive for
PC, Macintosh HD for the Mac). Next, alias or shortcut the folder
to the desktop. Then save your files, downloads and other documents
to that folder. If the desktop become corrupt, you only lose the
alias, not the contents of the folder.

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Sites teach how to understand Internet lingo, with Netiquette
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've used the Internet to get your daily horoscope,
to do marketing research for work, to check the weather for your
picnic next Saturday. Now it's only logical that you use the Net to
find out about the Net.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at a site that helps you learn the language of the
Internet. Before long you'll be speaking of TCP and IP and port
surfing with the big folks. Just drop in at Surf Lingo at
www.zdnet.com/yil/content/surfschool/lingo/lingotoc.html and you'll
soon know the language from Arpanet (the precursor to the Internet)
to zmodem (a now outdated data transfer method).
</P>
<P>
   A slightly more technical guide is the Internet Encyclopedia at
freesoft.org/CIE/index.htm where you'll learn about the technical
operation of the Net. It's a searchable database, and you'll find
help on almost any technical term, but you may come away as
confused as you arrived. For instance, here's the beginning of the
explanation of subnetting: ``Engineers gradually realized that the
original class-based addressing design was too inflexible for many
applications. In the mid-1980s, subnetting was introduced as an
extension to the original scheme. ... For example, 255.255.0.0 is a
standard class B subnet mask, since the first two bytes are all
ones (network), and the last two bytes are all zeros (host). In a
subnetted network, the network portion is extended.''
</P>
<P>
   The good thing is that you really don't have to understand
subnetting to impress others, just cut and paste several of the
explanations into the report your boss wants about the challenges
ahead for your company in e-commerce and you'll be an instant
Internet expert.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that most newcomers notice, almost immediately, is
that there is a different set of rules for polite behavior on the
Internet. When one of those rules is violated (something as simple
as typing in all capital letters), new users are almost certain to
hear about it, sometimes in a rude and abusive way. While that in
itself isn't great Internet etiquette, there are ways to avoid
these confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to learn the culture and etiquette of the Internet is
at a site called Netiquette at www.albion.com/netiquette/. If you
want a quick and basic course, there's a link to a section called
``core rules,'' but if you want even more, if you have aspirations
to become the Emily Post of the Net, then there is a link to a
complete guide to Netiquette too.
</P>
<P>
   Most old hands at the Net will be glad to see that _ included in
the complete guide _ there is a strong admonition not to pass on
electronic chain letters, or to naively send along dire warnings of
viruses that never lived outside phony e-mail warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know how to behave and can speak the language,
you'll want to visit a comprehensive site called Learn the Net at
www.learnthenet.com/english/index.html. You've graduated from basic
training and now it's time for advanced work. This is a site that
offers more depth and discusses some of the lesser known areas of
the Net such as newsgroups and listservs (which are discussion
groups carried on by e-mail _ make sure you read about them before
joining one, since you can end up with more e-mail than a normal
person would wish for).

 &HT;    Yahoo's treasures prove it's not just a search engine
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, here's a surprise from our friends at Yahoo
Internet Life magazine (www.yil.com). In its July issue listing 10
Internet essentials, Web portal Yahoo is the number one pick for
searching the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it's become much more than just a directory, Yahoo
remains the first place to look for Web sites on a particular
topic,'' the blurb for Yahoo says, along with the disclaimer
``(Yahoo) is our licensing partner but we're editorially
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But affiliation or no affiliation, Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) still
topped a list of essential Web sites that included a lot of sites
that actually are pretty useful, such as weather.com, tickets.com,
Excite's newstracker (nt.excite.com) and Careerbuilder's mega job
search (www.careerbuilder.com).
</P>
<P>
   So there is an off chance that maybe Yahoo Internet Life isn't
taking the easy way out by picking its licensing partner as the
best place to search the Web. It might be time to take a second
look at Yahoo and see how much service and utility it provides for
its legions of users.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is the oldest, the biggest and without a shadow of a doubt
the most jam-packed Web portal online. It's also one of the most
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tom Filo and Jerry Yang founded Yahoo in the mid '90s, a
crop of really good Web portals such as Lycos, Snap and Excite have
cropped up offering a wide variety of features and services in
addition to just plain old Web searching.
</P>
<P>
   There are also great sites like Google that simply let you
search, no shopping, no stock quotes, just searching. So even
though Yahoo is no longer the only game in town, it's still one of
the most popular sites on the Web. After America Online, it's the
second most popular site on the Web, with approximately 49 million
unique visitors in April, according to Web measurement firm Media
Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   When people talked about Yahoo, they used to call it a search
engine, but Yahoo's very testy spokespeople always insisted that
Yahoo was much more than that, and, upon close inspection, it is.
Like it or not, Yahoo is a category killer when it comes to wading
through and ultimately finding the needle in the enormous Internet
haystack.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Yahoo's success is in the way it tries to organize
the Web, not just by category and subject but by country and
special interest areas for news hounds, sports fans, and financial
wizards. Name y section (finance.yahoo.com) is a search/information
engine that is strictly devoted to financial news and information.
Links to almost every financial site imaginable, a partnership with
Reuters, and the ability for users to track their own stock
portfolios make YahooFinance one of the best financial portals on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is a global concern, as anyone who scrolls down to the
bottom of the start page will see. There are many other Yahoos in
many other countries and languages. This is one feature of Yahoo
that more Web searchers should take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   A search for ``Gladiators'' star Russell Crowe doesn't turn up
much on the American site, but a visit to Yahoo Australia and New
Zealand has reams of information about the Australian Oscar
nominee, including information and digital downloads of his very
obscure, very alternative rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Web users have already discovered Yahoo mail, a free
Web-based e-mail service, while many more use Yahoo to keep up on
current events with its news sections that attack national and
international news with the sort of depth of coverage you could
search for on your own if you had at least half a day and a
complete knowledge of the Web. Yahoo also has auctions and shopping
areas, but they're not the real reason people go to Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But that said, users who visit Yahoo Travel shopping for
airfares will find that its online partner, Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) may suggest a substantially cheaper fare to a
nearby city. It's the value-added bonus of alliances like this one
that keep users coming back to Yahoo to do a lot more than search.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Yahoo is all about searching the Web and organizing
a seemingly endless stream of information into easy-to-find,
easy-to-digest bites. Yahoo organizes the Web in such a way that no
matter what obscure bit of information you want to find, it will
find a way to bring it to you.

 &HT;    An online grocery trip proves less than perfect
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I got a call on the weekend from a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it,'' she said. ``You've got to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is a new Internet grocery delivery service. ``It'' had
dominated a good portion of the conversation at a local coffee
house where three of us were attempting to knit together wits that
had been thoroughly unraveled by the Pandora's box that is the end
of school.
</P>
<P>
   We were swapping notes on summer plans when the conversation
took a sharp right. Commiserating on the upcoming need for more
food to feed children suddenly home all day led to tales of
``why-I-hate-going-to-the-supermarket.'' (The group consensus was
that food shopping is like housework, a necessary evil doomed to be
repeated and repeated and repeated.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said my friend, ''maybe not if you do it on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical. Would it really save time? Could you find
everything you need? What about preferred brands? (Morris the cat
could take lessons from my son in finicky eating.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As we talked I realized a sea change had occurred. As little as
a month ago, my friend had little to no interest in the Internet
beyond its ability to help her son with his homework. When I asked
for her e-mail address so I could send her some sites to look at
for summer camps, she couldn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she was raving about the joy of online grocery shopping.
The difference, of course, was that this use of the Internet had
function and meaning, immediate meaning, in her life. One
time-consuming weekly chore _ a physical trip to the grocery store
_ could be eliminated. She had a permanent weekly list saved on the
site to which she could add and delete items. Yes, some items were
more expensive, but some were cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was tempting. I'd tried a couple of sites about a year ago,
and the list of products was so long and unwieldy that I stopped
four or five items into my shopping. It was too mind-numbing. But
maybe it was worth another try. I'd been hearing scattered reports
from lots of people:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy dog food and toilet paper in bulk and just have it
delivered to your house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get all my prescriptions online. It beats standing in line
at the drugstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon standing in line at the supermarket at the
precise moment that everyone else in a 25-mile radius decided to
shop persuaded me to give it another try.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, I logged on. First good sign _ it didn't take
45 tries to come up with a user name that wasn't taken and, most
importantly, that I could remember. The whole process took about
15-20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I settled in to do my shopping. I confess I didn't read the all
instructions. (I'd blocked out time but not that much.) It was
still a little cumbersome, but much less so than the earlier sites
I'd shopped on. About sixty-five percent of the time I found my
preferred brand, and I wasn't certain what the ``store brand'' was.
It did appear that using the site would become easier with
increased use.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from my friend, I saved pertinent items on a weekly
list as I did my shopping. A little over an hour later, I was
nearly done. ``Not bad,'' I was thinking. ``I could get used to
this. Call up my weekly list, add, subtract. ... I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   And I was, just not as I had planned. The server died and my
carefully almost completed virtual shopping list was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, that's technology.

 &HT;    Perfect Dark is a perfect follow-up
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Long awaited and, frankly, long overdue, Perfect Dark ($50;
www.nintendo.com; for the Nintendo 64) is finally here. The
follow-up to the smash hit ``Goldeneye 007'' _ which still is
praised as the best first-person sneaky shooter on any console _
Perfect Dark surpasses its predecessor with sophisticated
artificial intelligence, superior lighting and sound effects and
``secondary firing'' features for some 35 weapons _ all the while
remaining true to the immersive, story-driven gameplay of the James
Bond game. Lead heroine Joanna Dark is a stealthy, secret-agent and
tactician with a license to kill, which she uses extremely
liberally. Blocky and hazy graphics are easily forgiven as players
are immersed in an intricate series of commando mission of seek and
discover, sneak and destroy, and tiptoe through a rampage.
Alternately, gameplay includes a variety of multiplayer modes;
co-operative mini-missions, flat-out death matches or variants. A
lot of game, and well worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   For those who need constant Sim-stimulation, there is Sim City
3000 Unlimited ($40; www.simcity.com; for Windows), an expanded,
colossal version of the 1999 game. New features include a new set
of buildings _ Asian and European _ new scenarios, new disasters
(plague of locusts, anyone?), seasons, customizable trees and
terrain, and an architect tool that lets you design your own homes
and buildings. While some of us still prefer the more personal,
addictive ``The Sims,'' Sim City 3000 fans will get a dose of new
things with the game, although the price may be steep for what it
essentially the same game with a few new extras. Luckily, owners of
the original game can get a $10 rebate if they buy Unlimited before
June 24.

 &HT;    A DVD for the dollar-conscious
 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Still leery about this new-fangled DVD technology? Leer no more.
Konka has sidled into the home entertainment market with the
KD1800U DVD deck ($199; www.konkausa.com), an ``affordably'' priced
unit that, nevertheless, still offers picture and sound quality
notably superior to a high-end VHS player. Respectably functional
with standard DVD features _ remote, multiple language options, CD
and S-Video compatibility, various screen sizes and ratios _ the
KD1800U has a fresh and stylish appearance, sleek and silver, which
belies the fact it's a low-end component. By the time this sexy
thing gives up the ghost, high-end DVD players will be similarly
priced, which makes the KD1800U the perfect starter DVD machine.
Still leery? You're still playing 8-track tapes, too, aren't you?

   'FIGHT CLUB' DVD A REAL PUNCH IN THE NOSE
</P>
<P>
   Disenfranchised, disgruntled and ultimately disassociated guys
from the IKEA Generation start a bare-fisted brawl society in order
to vent all that world-weary angst. Then things get interesting.
Then, when things start to get a little weird, they get extremely
weird. Targeted directly at the 30-year old male-without-an-outlet
demographic, Fight Club Special Edition DVD ($35; www.foxdvd.com)
is hemorrhaging with extras: optional feature length running
commentary _ thoughts and anecdotes from actors Brad Pitt, Edward
Norton, Helena Bonham Carter and director David Fincher, for
example, as well as craft secrets elucidated by the production
crew. This edition also includes a second DVD gushing with extra
footage, behind-the-scenes clips, beguiling stills and concept art
gallery, and much more. Also featured for the first time is the new
``THX Optimode'' that allows for individual calibration of audio
and video to optimize one's home theatre performance.

 &HT;    Origami meets two-wheeler
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Riding a bicycle is one of the most
energy-efficient ways to get around, but using a bike to travel is
sometimes impractical. Perhaps the route is too long or too steep,
or perhaps you don't have a secure place to stash your bike. The
Montague Corp.'s line of folding bicycles may help you get around
some of those obstacles. The Montague CX 21-speed Comfort Bike
($450; www.montagueco.com), one of the company's newest models,
comes with either an 18- or 20-inch aluminum frame. It weighs 30
pounds and folds to 36 inches by 28 inches by 12 inches. Montague
says its bikes are full-size vehicles that fold down to half their
size in less than a minute without the use of tools. To fold a
Montague bike, the rider loosens a quick release bolt to remove the
front wheel. Two quick-release bolts on the seat post are then
loosened, and the rear wheel swings around to fold over the middle
of the bike frame. Other models include a mountain bike, an
off-road bike, an urban bike, an electric bike and a tandem bike _
all of which fold for easy storage.

 &HT;    WordPerfect vs. Word brouhaha keeps churning
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The uproar created by my discovery and disclosure of a
sinister underground network of DOS users has now evolved into a
frontal attack upon my choice of word processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a management consultant for a wide variety of large and
small firms and I have to be equally proficient in Word and
WordPerfect,'' writes Mike Atchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite things to do with Word-centric writers _
such as you appear to be _ is to challenge them to reproduce a page
out of any publication, and I'll do the same page in WordPerfect.
I'll beat them by almost 20 percent every time.''
</P>
<P>
   As I said last week in regard to a similar offer from the
redoubtable Miz Becker of Denver, I'm not accepting challenges
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find WordPerfect 9 to be just as easy to use and much faster
with complicated layouts. By the way, it still has the great
`reveal codes' feature that Word users never get a chance to
appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Atchison makes the same assumption as Becker did in last
week's column. It has obviously not occurred to either of them that
there may be some of us who don't want to be confronted with codes.
</P>
<P>
   Having a word processor that will reveal its codes implies that
the user wants to fiddle with them. This in turn inevitably implies
that the user knows what the codes mean. I don't know what they
mean. I don't want to know what they mean. I don't want to be one
of those men Who Knew Too Much.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to another, potentially more serious, issue with the
whole idea of a word processor that reveals its codes. It smacks of
Bring Your Child to Work Day at the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   What is a code for, if not to keep secrets? A word processor
that will blab its secrets to any Tom, Dick or Geeky who happens to
click his mouse in the right place is a low, treacherous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, obviously, is an outfit that knows how to keep a
secret, and it has instilled this sterling trait into its word
processor. I applaud that.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes J.B. McKoy, to compare Word unfavorably with
WordStar:
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of Word's bloatedness, I have yet to find the simple
but very useful block copy function in it that was present in
WordStar 18 years ago,'' he writes. ``This function allowed you to
mark the upper left and lower right corners of any block of text in
the body of a document, and copy it. There have been many times
I've wanted to just take a chunk of a page in Word, but it requires
you to take entire rows instead. This means a lot of manual work to
get the piece you wanted in the firsrchniques, probably involving a
pair of pliers and a hypodermic full of sodium pentothal, would
persuade Word to reveal its codes on the subject.

 &HT;    Learn to draw your favorite cartoonsBy Staff Reports

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.cartooncorner.com _ Learn the secrets of animation from
cartoonist Emmett Scott. For the beginning artist, there is an
easy-to-follow tutorial on the basics of drawing characters. He
starts with drawing the four parts of the face that show emotion:
eyes, eyebrows, eyelids and mouth. The site also features single
panel cartoons, cartoon strips, short poems, rhyming stories,
hidden pictures and word games. Most of the time, the site
encourages participation, either by drawing, solving a riddle,
rhyming or making props like paper hats or maracas. Also, the site
explains the difference between kinds of cartoons: animation, spot
drawing, editorial cartoons and caricatures.

   www.goosehead.com _ See what all the hype's about and visit the
popular teen content web site created by 15-year-old California
native Ashley Power (apparently, her real name). Ashley offers
relationship au to be a genius to see how an accidental call like
that could be downright awful under the wrong circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seem to have more cellular airtime than they have
something to say. Now I get calls from friends, driving in their
cars, who want to ask me if I've seen the latest model of the Ford
Explorer, or to muse about what they plan to have for dinner. Now
that free long-distance calling is part of most plans, I keep
hearing from folks all over the country who want to tell me about
the traffic jam that they've encountered in Cincinnati or about
their dog's medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a wonderful thing, but it's just about to bore me
to death.
</P>
<P>
   So today, at the risk of hurting your feelings, let's talk about
how to act right. Think of it as Husted's Rules for Cellular
Etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1. If you are so busy that you have to make and take calls
on the golf course, in the movies and other places where decent
folk are trying to get away from it all, then you are too busy to
have fun. Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2. Turn the danged thing off when you go to church, the
movies or a play. That weird nee-nah, nee-nah sound frightens
children and annoys adults.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3. Unless you are having a really interesting conversation
_ something that could be turned into a soap opera _ don't have it
within my earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 4. If you really don't have anything to say and simply
enjoy making calls, get a job as a motel switchboard operator.
</P>
<P>
   And please, if you disagree, send an e-mail. Don't call me using
your cellular phone.

 &HT;    Margaret Mitchell's childhood writings have reappeared _ and now
you can see them
 &HT;    By Julie Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Have you ever written poetry, a short story or even a
book _ or at least started one? What do you do with stuff you
write? Do you toss it, hide it, show it to anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Mitchell, who was born Nov. 8, 1900, in Atlanta, wrote
all the time as a young girl. As a young adult, she worked as a
reporter for this newspaper (earning $25 a week).
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1926, in a tiny apartment she called ``The Dump,'' she
started writing ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   It was published in 1936 and caused a worldwide sensation. The
book is a sweeping saga (a big, epic story) set in and around
Atlanta before, during and after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   While ``GWTW'' is loved by millions, it isn't loved by everyone.
African-Americans have long objected to the way Mitchell depicted
slaves and slave owners in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Several books have been written about Mitchell and how she came
to write the famous book. But after she died in 1949, family
members followed her wishes and destroyed most of her letters and
other writings.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell probably never dreamed that an old box of her childhood
writings would be unearthed in the 1990s, giving fans and scholars
greater insight into the natural talent she displayed as young as
age 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened. Seven years ago, two people were
cleaning out an old Atlanta house. In one crushed and filthy
cardboard box, they were amazed to discover Mitchell's childhood
writings. They found letters, diaries, plays and stories, all
written by Mitchell between 1907 and 1918, from age 7 through her
high school years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those writings have been collected into a new book
called ``Before Scarlett: Girlhood Writings of Margaret Mitchell,''
edited by Jane Eskridge (Hill Street Press, $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   You can also see many of these newly discovered childhood items
at the Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum in Midtown. The exhibit is
included when you take a tour of ``The Dump,'' which has been
restored to look much like it did when Mitchell lived there.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Mitchell was considered a tomboy and even had the
nickname ``Jimmy.'' She liked animals and loved riding ponies. She
also loved to play baseball, fly kites, go skating and get into
mudball fights.
</P>
<P>
   The 1939 movie version of ``Gone With the Wind'' _ one of the
first movies in color _ won eight Academy Awards, including best
picture. (It beat ``The Wizard of Oz.'')
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling book of all time is the Bible, with an
estimated 3.8 billion copies sold from 1815 to 1999. Next in line
are ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' by Harper
Lee. Each has sold more than 30 million copies.

 &HT;    Buying a car online
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it came time for Julie Smith to buy a new car,
she wasn't sure exactly what she wanted. But she was sure she
didn't want to haggle over the price.
</P>
<P>
   After researching vehicles in publications such as Consumer
Reports and looking at them up close on dealer lots, the inside
sales representative for McKesson HBOC turned to the Internet to
price and purchase her 2000 Lexus RX 300 sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole buying experience was great. I didn't have to
dicker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She went first to Edmunds.com, a site that has car-buying tips
as well as the dealer invoice for pricing a vehicle. There Smith
found a link to Autobytel.com, a car-buying service that puts
prospective buyers in touch with local dealers for a no-haggle
price on the vehicle they want, from color choice to option
packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have been the best deal, but I was getting a decent
price,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience is being shared by an increasing number of car
buyers who may feel intimidated by the car-buying process or who
want the convenience of car shopping from home.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of all used-car shoppers used the Internet
for assistance during the shopping process, according to an August
survey by J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the transaction, another Power study
showed the number of auto dealers working with online buying
services has doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Cyber Dialogue, an Internet consulting company, found
that 21 million people used the Net last year to get data on new
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 8.4 million reported that they bought vehicles, but
170,000 did so directly over the Internet, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, another dot-com company is adding a new
tool to the buyers' workbench. You'll find ways to find, price,
finance, insure and take delivery of a new or used car.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the first question a prospective buyer should ask:
Do I want a new or used vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is important. If you're buying a new car you must go
through a dealer. With used cars, there are varying paths to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   With new cars, state franchise laws require a dealer to be part
of the process, but there are no prohibitions on buying new cars
via the Internet or even from out-of-state dealers, noted Bill
Morie, president of the Georgia Automobile Dealers Association, a
trade group for new-car dealers. In most situations, Internet
buyers will sign the papers with a dealer in their area.
</P>
<P>
   Car buyers are embracing the Internet for buying all sorts of
things, noted Gayle Troberman, director of marketing for
Microsoft's CarPoint buying service. ``It's the first place to go
to get information at their fingertips and feel comfortable about
the money they are spending.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, price isn't the only factor, she said. ``They want
to get the right car for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet allows consumers to make comparisons between makes
and models, determine what tradeoffs they have to make and get a
fair price, which may not always be the absolutely lowest price,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealerships in the past have been more resistant to the Internet
than some other retailers. Despite the extensive consolidation
going on in the industry, most dealerships are owned by individual
entrepreneurs, many of whom have been in the auto business for
decades and are reluctant to accept new ways of doing business.
Still, there are some innovators.
</P>
<P>
   One who has embraced the Internet is Mark Bowen, general manager
for Hyundai, Subaru and Oldsmobile for the Ed Voyles automotive
dealership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best thing that ever happened to honest car
dealers,'' he said. ``The Internet has done for car selling what
the Model T did. It's that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can find the dealer's invoice amount easily, including
the base price and options packages. ``Everything's out there. Why
should we play games?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   From Internet traffic that was next to nothing last year, Bowen
says about 40 percent of his Subaru customers and nearly a third of
those looking at Hyundais have made contact online.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between the sites and the dealers is the key,
Bowen said: The Internet provides the contacts; the dealers provide
the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers in the J.D. Power survey reported that customers who
used an online service saved an average of $490 on a new car,
compared with traditional showroom shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, online customers usually are quoted a lower price
up front without having to make an offer, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
   While the Voyles dealership is not a no-haggle environment,
Bowen insists he's providing a fair price, usually a fixed amount
over the dealer invoice, to Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online services are particularly effective for shoppers
who feel intimidated by salespeople and want to find a dealer that
is willing to give them their best price right upfront,'' said
Chris Denove, J.D. Power's director of automotive
retail/distribution analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Most car-buying sites have links to other sources of
information, including Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), a popular
price guide for used cars, as well as reviews of new and older
vehicles and model comparisons. Many include links to financing and
insurance services. Manufacturers' sites also provide pictures,
specifications and options packages, along with the manufacturers
suggested retail price (MSRP, also known as the sticker price).
</P>
<P>
   But few vehicles are sold at the sticker price unless they are
in high demand or have a no-haggle tradition like Saturn. Instead,
buyers expect to begin their negotiations from the lower dealer
invoice price. That figure is a common feature on Edmunds.com and
many other buying service sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even that is not the dealer's cost for the vehicle because it
doesn't factor in ``holdback,'' an amount that the manufacturer
rebates to the dealer once the vehicle is sold. The refund is meant
to help offset the dealer's expenses for keeping the vehicle in
inventory. There also are other charges, including freight, dealer
back-office fees, sales tax and state title fees. There may also be
consumer or dealer rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers have gathered information on price, style and
options _ and maybe even arranged financing _ they may be directed
to a dealer's own Web site or e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of franchised new-car dealerships have
Internet sites, according to the National Automobile Dealers
Association. Of them, 93 percent allow customers to send e-mail,
order online or obtain financing. Of those without sites,
two-thy,'' said Denove.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet shopping process isn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports recently conducted research on five referral
sites. The magazine reported that only 35 percent of its panel of
1,056 online shoppers received a price quote within two days. When
they did get a quote, it wasn't always for the exact car specified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going online is a terrific way to do auto-related research,
but you can't kick the tires through your computer monitor, and you
can't slide behind the wheel with your mouse,'' said Lou Richman,
the magazine's finance editor.
</P>
<P>
   A test drive before ordering is still a good idea. ``The best
time is when the consumer has narrowed down the choices to two or
three cars,'' advises Alison Wagonfeld, Greenlight.com's vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOPPERS SAY
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports conducted a panel of 1,056 online car shoppers.
The findings are reported in the April issue of the magazine:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly a quarter of the shoppers, 22 percent, were told they
would have to visit the dealership for a firm price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only two of three dealers who responded said they had the car
in stock or could get it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overall, quoted prices were 5 percent to 10 percent below
manufacturers suggested retail prices, reasonably competitive for
some models but pricey for others.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 60 percent who got a price quote said they would
consider shopping in the future on the sites they tested.

 &HT;    Send audio e-mail files to friends
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to send a voice message as a .wav file via e-mail. I
have a PowerMac G4. Can you tell me how to record one?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. J. L. Ricketson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Many people are into sending their voices through the
Internet these days. Simple audio files seem to be an easy way to
pop off a quick message to a friend. I've seen a few of the
Internet postcard sites. They make it easy to send along a voice
message with your virtual card.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You can really get into this audio stuff. There are all
kinds of file types, different ways to record voice, music and
more. You can also convert files to the format you desire, and you
can create lists of audio that can be digitally altered to your
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: OK, OK. Let's keep it simple. So, you wanna say ``hey'' to
your friend? A WAV (pronounced ``wave'') file is an uncompressed
computer recording. It can be heard by anyone using a Mac or PC. I
downloaded Ultra Recorder 2.4.1 (members.aol.com/ejc3/Ultra.html).
It's a Mac shareware application ($20). I also tested SoundBuilder
2.0.3 (freeware from MacWorld downloads). Both of these apps let
you record your voice quickly and easily. Once you record your file
with a standard microphone, it's a no-brainer to convert it to
Windows WAV and send it to a PC friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, I created several little annoying voice WAV files
within seconds. I told jokes, said ``hi'' and made weird little
noises.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I have a beautiful new background on my desktop, but I can't see
it because of all the icons. How can I remove icons from the
desktop? I still want the programs. I'll just go to ``Programs'' to
get them. I can't seem to find the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ April Coleman
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like you need to do a little spring cleaning and
organizing. It can be confusing and scary if you do not know what's
what on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: I'm the resident expert on how to manage a messy desktop.
I haven't seen my desktop picture in years. In order for me to find
files, I close my eyes and play pin-the-tail on the computer
screen. One thing I have learned on a Mac is that your desktop can
take a hike (become corrupt) and you can lose all your data. I'm
still recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Some people will never learn. An easy way to deal with this
is to create a folder on the hard drive (could be the C drive for
PC, Macintosh HD for the Mac). Next, alias or shortcut the folder
to the desktop. Then save your files, downloads and other documents
to that folder. If the desktop become corrupt, you only lose the
alias, not the contents of the folder.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    The `doctor' is in, dispensing bitter pills
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Laura Schlessinger, the radio talker who equates
anti-gay bigotry with family values, is coming to television this
fall, and the sparks are already starting to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Should ``Dr. Laura,'' as she bills herself, be allowed to call
gays and lesbians ``biological errors'' on a nationally syndicated
TV show? The First Amendment tells us she has the right to say it,
but we don't have to listen. Or agree with her.
</P>
<P>
   But the power of TV adds another dimension to the free speech
debate. It's not like Schlessinger is espousing her views on a
street corner, where anyone who wants to can step up and disagree.
When ``Dr. Laura'' arrives Sept. 11, the only option offended
viewers will have is to hit the remote or write letters to the
station.
</P>
<P>
   As the debut nears, debate is springing up around the country.
Why are stations carrying a show that some people believe is
nothing more than hate-mongering? On the other hand, people who
believe Schlessinger is simply spouting old-fashioned
Judeo-Christian values don't understand what the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   First a bit of background. Schlessinger, who has a doctorate in
physiology, is the most popular radio talk show host in the
country. The TV version of ``Dr. Laura'' is being produced by
Paramount, which is owned by Viacom, which also owns CBS. Thus, all
CBS-owned and -operated stations were strongly encouraged to buy
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity to decline and did not,'' said Ross
Newsome, Austin's KEYE's general manager. ``She's a dynamic
personality. She can be very condescending and rude, but 20 million
people tune in to her radio show. Whether you agree with her or
not, it makes you stop and think, and thought-provoking
entertainment is what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   No pilot for the new series was made, so nobody except
Schlessinger and company knows what to expect. We do know she will
address myriad topics, not just homosexuality, and she will have
guests and a studio audience. If it's similar to her radio show,
topics will include child rearing, marriage and social issues. If
her style is the same, she'll be strident, loud and preachy. Even
people who agree with her are sometimes put off by her know-it-all
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a genius to figure out why ``Dr. Laura'' is
coming to television. She's popular on radio, and she could make a
lot of money for a lot of people on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially the sampling will be big because it does well here
on radio,'' Newsome said. ``She has a core audience, and we think
this could be a franchise program for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't take a genius to figure out why gays and lesbians
are upset by the prospect. Nationally, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation, or GLAAD, has launched a campaign to ``Stop Dr.
Laura.'' Locally, the Austin Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus is
considering its options. Representatives of the group have met with
KEYE executives and expressed their concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them what we found offensive _ that her remarks are
defamatory and often outright misrepresentative,'' said Allan
Baker, co-chairman of the caucus. ``This kind of speech, given such
a potentially large audience, contributes to an atmosphere of hate
and intolerance. And it can lead to hate crimes and discrimination,
especially against gay and lesbian youth.''
</P>
<P>
   KEYE's general manager was impressed with the caucus and says he
takes their concerns seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand their sense of caution and how damaging some of
her views have been to the gay and lesbian community,'' Newsome
says. ``But in this wonderful democracy we live in, she has a right
to be heard and judged.''
</P>
<P>
   So, are GLAAD and the Austin caucus advocating censorship? Isn't
this a free speech issue?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a free speech issue, because no one has the right to
a TV show,'' Baker says. ``She can express herself any time she
wants, but when she does it on TV, I don't get a chance for
rebuttal in the same forum.''
</P>
<P>
   t she thinks. But speaking on television does have more of an
impact than yammering in a civic auditorium. The show's producers
and distributor must be mindful of that and open up the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But this argument wouldn't even rear its head if someone came
along with a talk show that lambasted African Americans, Hispanics,
Asians or Jews. Would a pilot called ``The KKK Koffee Klatch'' or
``Nazi Nattering'' be considered? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a host who blasts gays and lesbians has a show in mid
afternoon, a time when children, especially impressionable teens,
are home watching. It's pathetic and potentially dangerous, but it
probably won't last. Hearing her for three hours a day is bound to
be enough, even for her ardent fans.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN20 _ A fire alarm sends luxury apartment

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A few columns ago I was
complaining about the new postmaster who came to town after our Mr.
Reed retired, and as good as accused me of trying to steal a
mailing envelope when he could see that all I was doing was
stuffing my old blue dress into it to mail to a friend for her yard
sale. Naturally, I wrote about it and as it turns out, a lot of
folks had something to add. (Schuett, Cox News Service). MOVED.

<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A few weeks ago, the mellow,
accentless voice of Dr. Andrew Weil came out of my car radio,
courtesy of National Public Radio, and told me to turn off the

with an auralike ring of white hair and beard around his face and a
book in the stores, ``Eight Weeks to Optimum Health.'' (Lane,
Daytona Beach News-Journal). MOVED.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another ``read my lips'' from a Bush?
 &HT;    For release June 21, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think George W would have learned from daddy's mistake.
But when the presidential candidate, seeking to participate in the
GOP's newest anti-administration, politically motivated maelstrom,
told a Florida audience last weekend that our nuclear secrets will
be secret again in his administration, he was mirroring his
father's ``read my lips, no new taxes'' boast that came to bury his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely: ``I'll bring this sorry chapter to a close. In my
administration, our national labs will be secure again, our vital
information will be sealed again, our nuclear secrets will be
secret again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some campaign promises just can't be kept and George W ought to
know better than to vouch that no similar problem will haunt his
presidency _ if he's elected. Say you'll do ever the Clinton
administration for not cracking down on something that had been
investigated for almost three years, someone reminded Sen. Trent
Lott that it was on Reagan's and Bush's watch that most of the
thefts took place. He responded, incredulously, that he was not
going to dwell on the past, but wanted to know what's being done
now about correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how serious is the Los Alamos crisis, and neither
did all those Republicans who spent last weekend bellowing on
network TV, including Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) who called for
Richardson's resignation. There is much more to be learned,
including whether the secrets were compromised at all.
</P>
<P>
   But we are in an era of intense political fury. In a capital
where no secret is ever safe, where leaks are more like waterfalls,
partisan politics will turn on the slightest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As if money-raising and slush funds were not enough to sicken
the general public, the political combat is getting more disgusting
by the moment. There is no working bi-partisan government anymore,
just partisan acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   There is little the Democratic administration has done, or has
not done, that has not resulted in some call by the GOP for an
investigation or a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does get elected, can we expect a similar reaction from
the Democratic partisans during his administration? I'm afraid so.
They likely will watch his every step -- and misstep -- and clamor
for investigations in an act of political revenge; a vicious chain
that may have its eye-for-an-eye roots in the partisan-driven 1987
Democratic rejection of Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And should Gore reach the presidency, then Lott and his folks
will continue to behave as they do today.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the real examination of breaches such as happened
at Los Alamos (if it happened) is driven not by professional
inquiry but more by political penchant, by public opinion based on
poisoned positions _ and by obtuse statements by presidential
candidates who should know better.
</P>
<P>
   We know where the buck stops _ Harry told us so _ but how many
are passing it around maliciously on the way up?

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: MY WASHINGTON PAJAMA PARTY
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It wasn't until I had clumped down seven flights of
stairs, my shoes hastily affixed to the wrong feet, and had burst
through the fire exit onto the street at 4 a.m. did I realize, by
golly, maybe the building really was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the chaos that greeted me.
</P>
<P>
   A police unit with emergency lights exploding like disco strobes
had traffic sealed off at the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and people were everywhere. You would have thought it was
New Year's Eve, instead of nearly dawn on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Was that screaming I heard, people trapped in the burning
building from which I had narrowly escaped?
</P>
<P>
   But, as my grogginess began to clear, I realized that it was a
happy noise _ people laughing and talking up and down the crowded
sidewalks and side streets, young men and women dressed in their
finest, fanciest party duds.
</P>
<P>
   And if I had to guess, I'd say they were likely laughing at me
and my fellow residents of the luxury apartment building where a
fire alarm had sent us fleeing into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   There we were, barely with clothes on our backs and huddled
along the edge of the sidewalk, while all around us there was a
party going on.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought _ at 4 a.m. _ that people could be having
such a good time?
</P>
<P>
   Music was everywhere, blaring from shiny, sleek automobiles
lined bumper to bumper both ways on the street, like a parade
coming from both directions.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the cop was doing there, trying to control the
traffic. I doubt the police even knew about the fire alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But it had certainly gotten my attention.
</P>
<P>
   WEE-WAAW, WEE-WAAW, the siren sounded over the room speaker. And
then this recorded voice:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fire reported in the building. Please leave the
building by the nearest exit. Do not use the elevators.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't have to tell me twice, though it kept repeating and
repeating and repeating ...
</P>
<P>
   WEE-WAAW, WEE-WAAW!
</P>
<P>
   I was out of there, barely taking time to pull on a shirt and
pair of pants, grab my wallet and jump into my shoes wrong feet
first, and then go galloping down the stairs and out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Only to find myself in the midst of a street party.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, the bunch of us was gathered together like a
gaggle of street people, a backwash of pinched, white faces,
alternatively flushed and pale, middle-aged fossils gasping and
wheezing, forced from our apartment fortress and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the onlyreason we were up this time of the early
morning was to go the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   I managed to hitch up my britches, tuck in my shirt tail and
swap my shoes to the proper feet. The others were tidying
themselves similarly, as best they could in what they were wearing.
</P>
<P>
   As a group we shuffled to the front of the building, where the
arched canopy at the entrance offered refuge. Indeed, assembled
refugees were what we resembled.
</P>
<P>
   And all around us ... it's party time!
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, maybe half an hour, we were informed that it
was OK to return to our rooms, that the fire alarm had been a false
alarm. I don't know about everybody else, but I would have been
just as happy hanging around on the street a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. I piled onto an elevator with the rest of them.
Outside we had stood stone silent. Now everyone was speaking at the
same time. But not one word about the fire alarm. What we were
talking about was the 4 a.m. celebration we had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   One white-haired couple, explaining that they lived on the
street side of the building, said it was like that every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes on and on,'' the man said. ``Finally, the police will
use bullhorns to tell everybody to get off the streets, go to their
cars and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that we went home as well, to luxury apartments where
you pay upwards of $2,000 a month, to sleep safely and securely in
the knowledge that a security force was on duty at every locked
entrance to our building.
</P>
<P>
   But you had to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Were we the privileged ones?
</P>
<P>
   Were we the ones most enjoying life?
</P>
<P>
   Or were we the ones locked out?

MAKING WAVES: MARK WAHLBERG TACKLES `THE PERFECT STORM' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Mark Wahlberg with George Clooney in a
scene from ``The Perfect Storm.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Marky Mark doesn't live here any more.
 &HT;    Mark Wahlberg is an actor, not a rapper or an underwear model.
But his past won't stay buried.
 &HT;    On the set of his upcoming film ``The Yards,'' he was thrilled
to have Faye Dunaway say to him, ``Mark, my son is going to do what
you do.''
 &HT;    Wahlberg was all ready with acting tips when Dunaway continued:
``So, Mark, what goes on in that modeling world, anyway? Are there
a lot of drugs at the photo shoots?''
 &HT;    The young actor, who has garnered critical acclaim for ``Boogie
Nights'' (1997), ``Three Kings'' (1999) and ``The Perfect Storm,''
which will open June 30, sighed.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Hey, Faye, I did one underwear ad. I'm not a
model,''' he recalls. ``She said, `Yes, OK, Mark. But he wants to
be a model just like you, and I hope he doesn't get caught up in
the debauchery!'''
 &HT;    Wahlberg grimaces, then laughs. Clad in jeans and a T-shirt as
he reclines on a couch at New York's Essex House and devours a
bagel, he swears that his Calvin Klein days are behind him.
 &HT;    ``As far as going out, pulling down my pants and running around
in my underwear, I don't think I could do that anymore,'' he says
cheerfully. ``Maybe a 20-year anniversary _ I'll come out with my
beer belly and pull down my pants.''
 &HT;    He can joke now, of course, because he's earned solid Hollywood
credibility lately, most recently as a young fisherman pitted
against a killer North Atlantic gale in Wolfgang Petersen's ``The
Perfect Storm,'' based on the best-selling real-life saga by
Sebastian Junger.
 &HT;    Co-starring is George Clooney, who plays the fishing-boat
captain. Clooney and Wahlberg are becoming quite the screen duo _
they co-starred in ``Three Kings,'' and Clooney is producing
Wahlberg's next film, the rock-band saga ``Metal God,'' due later
this year.
 &HT;    ``For `The Perfect Storm,' George personally went to Wolfgang
Petersen and suggested that he give me an audition. He campaigned
for me,'' Wahlberg says. ``I just want to be the one to say that
George is much more than just good-looking _ he is one hell of a
guy.''
 &HT;    Don't expect them to be the new Redford and Newman, however.
 &HT;    ``No,'' Wahlberg jokes, ``it's kind of like he's Eddie Murphy
and I'm Judge Reinhold.''
 &HT;    To prepare for his role, Wahlberg _ who grew up in the Boston
suburbs _ went back East to hang out on fishing boats. He even took
a room above the Crow's Nest Bar in Gloucester, Mass., where the
fisherman he's playing actually hung out.
 &HT;    ``I also got to know my character's family,'' he adds, ``which
just provided invaluable insight, although it was tough for them to
talk about what happened.''
 &HT;    Many of the calmer water shots were done in real boats outside
Gloucester, where Wahlberg grumbles that the only real hazard was
the swarm of fans who trail Clooney everywhere.
 &HT;    ``Even the sea gulls were screaming, `George, we love you!'''
Wahlberg says sarcastically.
 &HT;    The storm scenes, on the other hand, were filmed on the Warner
Brothers lot, in a special hurricane tank which measured 95 feet by
100 feet by 22 feet deep.
 &HT;    It wasn't as dangerous as a real hurricane, the actor says, but
it was hardly less uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``You get in the water, and they turn on the wind. The waves are
crashing,'' Wahlberg says. ``You really do feel like you're going
to die. It was just so tough getting through a day.''
 &HT;    Spending day after day soaked to the skin wasn't what he'd
expected after his performance as porn actor Dirk Diggler in
``Boogie Nights'' won him rave reviews and a reputation as a rising
star.
 &HT;    ``The good thing is that I have just been very busy,'' he says,
laughing. ``The bad thing is that people ask me about the size of
my private parts.''
 &HT;    He insists that his acting career is the real thing, however,
not merely the latest stop in a highly varied life.
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to act,'' he says. ``You know, I had been
bulls--ting and acting most of my life. It only made sense.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he adds, the turning point came in 1985, when at
15 he was sentenced to 45 days in jail for assault after an
argument over a bottle of beer.
 &HT;    ``That experience was definitely a wake-up call,'' he says. ``It
sounds strange, but I also got very into Bruce Lee in prison. I was
into working out, because I had to stay in shape to protect myself.
When I got out, I'd go to the gym instead of hanging out on the
corner with my friends.
 &HT;    ``It saved my life,'' he says. ``I feel like I'm blessed. I
found myself on a path where so many had gone before me _ a lot of
my friends watched their lives go down the chute. I just decided I
wanted something better for myself. I wanted to live the good life,
I wanted to do the right thing for my family.''
 &HT;    Sibling rivalry gave him his first break. His brother Donnie had
become a teen-music sensation with New Kids on the Block, and
Wahlberg followed suit, achieving a 1991 platinum album with his
rap group, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. That led to his Calvin
Klein contract _ and, between the underwear and the rapping, to
frequent problems in launching the acting career he really wanted.
 &HT;    ``At first, acting was so tough,'' he says. ``I got offers like,
`Hey, Mark, why don't you be a rapping, skateboarding dude? Or play
the punk a--hole for us?' I didn't want to be identified as that
type of guy, so I turned down a lot of offers.''
 &HT;    He finally got his acting break in ``Renaissance Man'' (1994),
which led to ``The Basketball Diaries'' (1995), ``Fear'' (1996) and
then ``Boogie Nights'' (1997). Then came stardom, and a whole new
set of issues.
 &HT;    ``It still kills me when I read stuff about myself,'' Wahlberg
admits. ``For instance, I heard someone say me talking about having
a troubled past was just something I did to boost my bio and give
me credibility.
 &HT;    ``Believe it, I was not trying to brag about it,'' he says.
``I'm not proud of my past. I don't think I need it to be
credible.''
 &HT;    The actor sighs.
 &HT;    ``I think I've been misunderstood all the way around,'' he says.
``I thought acting was the one thing that would make it difficult
for people to figure out who I was, because I could slip into
character.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he has had to deal with persistent rumors of an
affair with Jennifer Aniston, his co-star in ``Metal God.'' He and
Aniston have both firmly denied the rumors, but that doesn't matter
once the tabloids are in gear.
 &HT;    ``My mom believes everything she reads,'' he says, wincing.
``She calls me up and says, `Jennifer is dating that nice Brad
Pitt, and you leave that boy's girl alone, Mark!'''
 &HT;    Wahlberg throws his hands up in the air, then laughs.
 &HT;    ``Maybe my life was easier when I was just dropping trou!''

SON OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION: HEATH LEDGER ON `THE PATRIOT' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Heath Ledger in a scene from ``The
Patriot.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    You say you want a revolution? Heath Ledger is happy to oblige.
 &HT;    The young Australian actor, who first caught Hollywood's eye
with his swinging, singing Shakespearean turn in ``10 Things I Hate
About You,'' finds himself in Colonial America in ``The Patriot,''
opening nationwide on June 28.
 &HT;    One of this summer's event pictures, ``The Patriot'' casts
Ledger as the son of Mel Gibson, another brooding and handsome
Aussie _ though, oddly enough, both are cast as Americans this time
around. It's the story of Gabriel Martin (Ledger), a staunch
Colonialist who defies the orders of his father, retired war hero
Benjamin Martin (Gibson) and enlists in the Revolutionary War. One
thing leads to another, and soon father is drawn into battle
alongside son.
 &HT;    ``The thing that was really interesting to me was that Gabriel
had an unusual arc to his life,'' the affable Ledger says by
telephone from Columbia Pictures' New York offices. ``He makes the
transition from young boy to young man.
 &HT;    ``I could relate to that,'' Ledger says. ``I could understand
that time of life, when you step out from your father's opinions
and have your own ideas for the first time in your life. When you
discover that in yourself, it's rather exciting. The energy in you
is exaggerated, and you make exaggerated stands.
 &HT;    ``I think Martin sees himself in Gabriel,'' the actor says
thoughtfully. ``He was quite a savage, and I guess he could see
that bloodlust and enthusiasm coming out of me. He's afraid for me
to discover those qualities in myself _ but, of course, I'm not
going to listen to him, not going to hear any of that until I
discover it for myself.''
 &HT;    The 21-year-old Australian, who hails from Perth, admits that he
knew ``only the basics'' about the Revolutionary War when he signed
on for ``The Patriot.'' He did some studying to prepare, but says
that he was more interested in a sense of the era than in
historical details as such.
 &HT;    ``Obviously I couldn't begin to read enough books to discover a
real insight into what happened, to discover an insight into
Gabriel,'' he says. ``The Revolutionary War is pretty much just a
setting for the story, and the story is about a family. It's a love
story between a father and son that's set during the Revolutionary
War.''
 &HT;    Bonding with Gibson proved easy, Ledger says, mercifully going
easy on the hyperbole.
 &HT;    ``Mel and I had a mutual understanding that we just found in
each other's eyes when we first met,'' he says. ``We didn't go
fishing or anything. Most importantly, we developed a mateship as
friends, instantly, and that translates through to a relationship
as father and son.
 &HT;    ``We pretty much knew how it was going to play, and we took it
from there.''
 &HT;    Ledger's favorite scene in the movie is one in which Gabriel
confronts his father about his war experience. Ledger, Gibson,
director Roland Emmerich and his crew gathered on location at
Cypress Gardens, a manmade marsh, on a blustery winter's night to
capture the moment.
 &HT;    ``It was the last scene we shot for the movie,'' Ledger says.
``We shot it on Jan. 21, all night, until about 8 a.m. It was just
Mel and I sitting around a campfire, and it felt good. I felt
connected to Mel.
 &HT;    ``It was the end of the movie,'' he says. ``We'd been through so
much, and it was a turning point in the story, where Gabriel pulls
something out of his father, from the depths.
 &HT;    ``There was also a lunar eclipse that night, so there was a
blood-red moon in the sky that made the moment even more
beautiful.''
 &HT;    As ``The Patriot'' prepares to storm theaters, Ledger _ whose
credits include ``Black Rock'' (1997) and the Australian television
series ``Roar'' (1997) _ stands at the intersection of anonymity
and stardom. Though some are touting him as the next Mel Gibson,
Ledger simply wants to be Heath Ledger.
 &HT;    ``I haven't felt it yet,'' he says of his next-big-thing status.
``The only time I think about it is when people ask me about it. I
don't let it bother me.
 &HT;    ``It's there,'' he admits after a moment. ``Everything around me
is suddenly changing. But that little spark inside of me is still
the same. I really don't spend that much time thinking about fame,
and I don't care to.''
 &HT;    Instead, Ledger thinks about acting, a craft to which he's
devoted more than half his life, but one that still stirs his real
passion.
 &HT;    ``Acting is a medium of expression for me,'' he says. ``I get to
pass something from me to someone else, and I love to do that. It's
a medium of art, too.
 &HT;    ``I guess I was 12 when I started in amateur theater,'' he says.
``It was just a hobby. I never said I wanted to go to Hollywood, I
never thought I'd be making movies.
 &HT;    ``But doors kept opening and I kept following paths,'' Ledger
says. ``And it's been fun. Along the way I discovered myself. I had
to discover myself in order to portray people _ I had to fully
understand myself, inside and out.
 &HT;    ``So that's been a journey for me.''
 &HT;    Ledger's journey is only beginning, of course. He's halfway
through filming ``A Knight's Tale,'' which he calls ``a comedy
about the jousting life that's set in 15th-century London.'' Once a
``Tale'' is told, Ledger will move on to ``Four Feathers,'' a
remake of the classic 1939 British drama about a 19th-century war
deserter who attempts to reclaim the respect of his family and
friends.
 &HT;    As serious as he may be about his work, Ledger _ who considers
Los Angeles his current base, though right now he says he's
``living out of bags wherever I'm shooting'' _ stresses that he
doesn't live his roles. He's not his characters, and they aren't
him.
 &HT;    ``I tend to try to use the method of just acting,'' he says.
``That's what I feel my job is ... I'm pretty relaxed when it comes
to being on a set. I don't like to walk around and stress out too
much. It keeps things fresh for me, keeps things spontaneous.
 &HT;    ``I love acting, love it with a passion,'' he says. ``But it's
also just something that fills up a bit of time and space between A
and C in my life. Ultimately, on the grand scale of things, acting
is quite insignificant to life in general.
 &HT;    ``But I do love it, and that's why I'm still doing it.''

A REBEL STILL RUNNING: PATTI SMITH ISN'T GIVING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Patti Smith.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    She's been called a punk priestess, a rock-'n'-roll poet
laureate and one of many voices of a generation.
 &HT;    She rejects the most fawning of those titles, but Patti Smith is
happy to be called an artist _ and no word fits her better. Whether
through poetry, visual works or, most frequently, music _ including
her latest album, ``Gung Ho'' _ Smith has spoken with a
particularly strong conscience and sensibility.
 &HT;    During the 1970s she declared that ``Outside of society/is where
I want to be,'' but Smith actually revels in community and
champions the power of the collective spirit. The singer/songwriter
takes seriously the essage conveyed by her 1988 hit, ``People Have
the Power,'' and never more than this year, when America is in the
midst of a presidential campaign.
 &HT;    ``I was listening to the State of the Union address,'' Smith
recalls. ``Clinton was saying `Everything's fine, it's fine, were
fine,' and I was thinking, `No, we're not fine.'
 &HT;    ``Our children are shooting each other,'' she says passionately.
``We're becoming a totally materialistic society, our environment
is compromised. There's so many reasons why we're not fine.
 &HT;    ``Maybe economically things are good,'' she concedes, ``but that
doesn't make good people. That doesn't make a good country, that
doesn't make the moral fabric of the country good. There're too
many things happening that point to a spiritual lack and a lack of
unity and a lack of clarity in our country.''
 &HT;    The 53-year-old Smith, a Chicago native who was raised in New
Jersey and now resides in New York with Jackson and Jesse, her son
and daughter, has been spurred by her sense of the country's drift
to launch her most extensive American tour since the 1970s.
 &HT;    Back then, her Patti Smith Group _ blending classic-rock
conventions with the irreverent spirit of the punk and new wave
movements _ played some of the era's most visceral and challenging
music. She hopes to provoke people again this year, using the songs
from ``Gung Ho'' as a catalyst for thought and ideas.
 &HT;    ``I think that is very American,'' says Smith, a longtime
Democrat who supported Bill Bradley but also sings on the album
about the need for a ``New Party.'' ``It addresses global issues,
but I feel like it's got specifically the things that I'm concerned
with, especially in an election year, that our country has to
address _ things like gun control, some kind of education reform
and political-money reform ... and, most important, the
environment.
 &HT;    ``There're a lot of things I'm concerned about,'' she concludes,
``and I want to stick around America and use my voice as much as I
can and support the Democratic Party.''
 &HT;    Smith's return to the political arena follows a period of
introspection brought on by the death of her husband, former MC5
guitarist Fred ``Sonic'' Smith, of heart failure during 1993. Her
brother, Todd, died of a heart attack the following year, and
Smith's next two releases _ ``Gone Again'' (1996), only her second
album in 17 years, and ``Peace and Noise'' (1997) _ were dark
affairs, ruminating on her sense of personal loss.
 &HT;    ``Gung Ho,'' on the other hand, returns to the bold, punchy
energy of her earlier work.
 &HT;    ``I just had a few difficult, really difficult years, and I had
to rebuild my energy, rebuild my confidence and reacquaint myself
with performing and recording and collaborating with others,''
Smith explains. ``I had help _ Alan Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Michael
Stipe, the members of my band and friends. It was rewarding, but it
was difficult. And it did take awhile.''
 &HT;    ``Gung Ho'' features a variety of guests, including R.E.M.
singer Stipe, Tom Verlaine of the group Television, former Husker
Du member Grant Hart and harmonica player Skaila Kanga. Smith's son
Jackson also plays guitar on the track ``Persuasion,'' which was
co-written by his parents.
 &HT;    But at the core of ``Gung Ho'' is Smith's group, which includes
longtime associates Lenny Kaye on guitar and Jay Dee Daugherty on
drums, with bassist Tony Shanahan and guitarist Oliver Ray, who's
also Smith's current boyfriend.
 &HT;    ``I think that we fortify each other,'' Smith says of the group.
``I did `Peace and Noise' with the same people, and we did that
record ourselves, with no producer _ we just forged through that
one. This one is really a result of all our efforts through the
last record, and touring and collaborating.
 &HT;    ``I think we've found our place,'' she says. ``The musicians
bring in music, and I respond to some of it and they become the
songs. It was just, I guess, the collective spirit of the band. I
think we all stay in step.''
 &HT;    ``Gung Ho'' is a Chinese term that means ``working together,''
which Smith felt made it an appropriate title for the album. But
the title song itself _ a nearly 12-minute epic that closes the
album _ was inspired by her research into Ho Chi Minh, which she
began after seeing a documentary about the Vietnamese leader.
 &HT;    ``I spent two years studying his work, studying his life,
studying how he mapped out independence for the Vietnamese
people,'' Smith says. ``And in doing so, I found out he used our
Declaration of Independence as a guide and our Revolutionary War as
a guide, and I found that very interesting. It also moved me to
study the Declaration of Independence.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to write a song about his life,'' she adds, ``because
I have always opposed the Vietnam War, but I never understood it. I
suppose it was an opportunity for me to comprehend what the whole
thing was about, and so I did.
 &HT;    ``I was impressed with his knowledge of the history of our
country and the history of our freedom,'' the musician says. ``And
now, more than ever, I know that war was wrong.''
 &HT;    Since ``Gung Ho's'' release, Smith has also declared her own
independence. She bolted from Arista Records, her home since 1975,
to protest the ouster of Arista founder Clive Davis, whom she
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year.
 &HT;    ``He gave me the freedom to record as I see fit and artistic
control of what I do,'' Smith says. ``That means a lot to me.''
 &HT;    She may for the moment be one of rock 'n' roll's homeless, but
Smith says that she looks forward to a lot more music to come.
 &HT;    ``I really feel like I'm coming from a position of strength, of
health, of energy,'' says Smith, who's also working on a book about
her relationship with the late artist Robert Mapplethorpe. ``After
`Gone Again,' I really thought that would be my last record. But so
many people really encouraged me to go on. And people, when I would
perform, they seemed happy to see me.
 &HT;    ``So as long as I can do something of worth, as long as I can
contribute things that I think are of good quality, I'll continue
performing and I'll continue making records,'' she concludes. ``And
when I think I can't contribute anymore, I'll move on to something
else.''

BLAME CANADA!: CANADIANS ARE TAKING OVER AMERICAN TELEVISION

 (Includes a color slide of Hayden Christensen in a scene from
``Higher Ground.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 7, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The far North is heading south.
</P>
<P>
   In years past there were always one or two Canadian-born
celebrities who would break out of that country's frigid climes and
into the American show-biz spotlight. Remember the heydays of Lorne
Greene, Anne Murray and Robert Goulet?
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian invasion has shifted into hyperdrive in recent
years. Spearheaded by Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Bryan Adams and
other musical types, the list has expanded exponentially to include
a brave new crop of feisty Canucks, all eager to take over
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Television, in particular, has proved a potent breeding-ground
for northern lights. Here are 10 of the brightest. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Hayden Christensen.
</P>
<P>
   You may not know him yet, but just wait.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, born in Vancouver and raised in Toronto, was until
recently best known for his role as hunky Scott Barringer on the
Fox Family Channel series ``Higher Ground.'' Nowadays, however,
he's best known as the future Anakin Skywalker.
</P>
<P>
   After his recent selection to follow Jake Lloyd as Anakin in the
next two episodes of George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' saga, the
19-year-old's acting career has done the same thing that Mark
Hamill's did when he jumped ship on ``Eight Is Enough'' in favor of
the original ``Star Wars'' in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire time I've been involved in the casting process _
for eight months _ actually being in the new `Star Wars' movie just
seemed so farfetched,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an actor who, seven years ago, got his start on the
smarmy daytime soap ``Family Passions.''
</P>
<P>
   + Pamela Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's astute business sense, coupled with her memorable physique
and her questionable taste in men, has seen her skyrocket from
Playmate to ``Home Improvement's'' Tool Time girl to ``Baywatch''
babe and then into a hellacious sex-tape scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The story has a happy ending, however, as she's returned to the
small screen as star and executive producer of ``V.I.P.,'' one of
the world's most successful syndicated shows.
</P>
<P>
   + David James Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   After first coming to fame as Alison's sex-addicted rehab
boyfriend on ``Melrose Place,'' the Toronto-born Elliott nabbed the
starring role in ``JAG'' as Lt. Commander Harmon Rabb Jr. _
``Harm'' for short.
</P>
<P>
   After poor ratings got the show cancelled by NBC, ``JAG'' was
picked up by CBS, where it slowly but steadily built an audience,
becoming a genuine hit in its fourth year. Audiences warmed to its
combination of legal drama and military thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that about the show,'' Elliott says. ``It keeps it
interesting. But I think it hindered the show a little in the
beginning, because it was tough for people to put a finger on what
it was. That and getting over the prejudice of it being a military
show. People going, `Aaah, I don't like military shows,' when in
fact it's more than just that.''
</P>
<P>
   + Joshua Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   After Pamela Lee, Josh Jackson is probably the best-known
Canadian working in television at the moment. His portrayal of
Pacey, ``Dawson Creek's'' perpetual underdog, has cemented the
popularity that Jackson earned in the beloved ``Mighty Ducks'' film
series.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Jackson doesn't get too excited either by the
popularity of the show or by his own celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing it for three years,'' the Vancouver-born
Jackson says, ``and the initial blush of the show has worn off for
all of us. The crazy glow and the madness it had when it first came
out has died down, and now what makes the show most interesting, at
least for myself, is coming to work every day with actors I
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find it a challenge, to bring your best work to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   + Carly Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected much when Carly Pope's series, ``Popular,''
debuted on WB last fall.
</P>
<P>
   My, how things change. What at first looked like merely another
generic WB teen-angst festival blossomed into the most demented,
yet also most morally adept, comic series on teen television.
</P>
<P>
   As Sam, the unpopular, politically aware half of the stepsister
duo that powers the series, the Vancouver-born Pope has seen her
popularity soar.
</P>
<P>
   Pope compares her character to ``a builder or a contractor. She
has all the right tools, but she doesn't know how to use them
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite unlike Pope, who doesn't have that problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   + Ryan Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Reynolds' breakthrough series has survived so-so ratings
and the loss of half of its title. His genial sitcom, ``Two Guys
and a Girl'' _ nee ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place'' _ will
return to the ABC Friday-night lineup this fall, where fans of the
Vancouver native hope the show will find a new audience and
flourish in the friendlier time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had already had a measure of success in Canada when he
literally decided, on the spur of the moment, to drive south and
try his hand in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove down to Los Angeles,'' he says. ``Took several
attempts to get across the border, because I was just this ignorant
young Canadian thinking I could just cross and go to work!''
</P>
<P>
   + Scott Speedman.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Felicity'' scraped into a third season by the skin
of its teeth, look out for big things from Scott Speedman, the
Vancouver boy who plays Ben. He was handpicked to replace Brad Pitt
in the upcoming Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle ``Duets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't look for him to move back to Vancouver anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a love/hate thing with Vancouver,'' Speedman says. ``I
was born in London, England, and I was just over there and it's
just rank and gets me down. Vancouver is a little slow for me, but
British Columbia is one of the most amazing places.''
</P>
<P>
   + Tonya Lee Williams.
</P>
<P>
   She may be young, but it's her background that suggests she's
restless: Born in England, Tonya Lee Williams lived in Jamaica,
then returned to England before making Oshawa her home.
</P>
<P>
   Since she took on the role of Dr. Olivia Hastings on ``The Young
and the Restless,'' Williams has entered the pantheon of soap-opera
stars ... and, again, relocated _ this time to Los Angeles with her
dog, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   + Caroline Rhea.
</P>
<P>
   As Hilda Spellman on ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' and as a
virtual fixture on ``Hollywood Squares,'' Caroline Rhea has come a
long way from the New York comedy clubs where she slaved for seven
years. This irresistibly ebullient Montreal girl, who still tours
her bawdy comedy routine in her spare time, jokes about her role as
the good witch's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she says, ``I hope I am more mature than her. She's
like 512 years old, and is always looking for something to do
because she's been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   + Eric McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   The irony that Eric McCormack's character is gay, yet plays the
``straight'' man to the series' trio of neurotic, high-maintenance
characters is not lost on him. In fact, the Torontonian sees it as
a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Will is gay and Grace is straight, this show is free
to explore their relationship without building toward a sexual
payoff at the end,'' he says. ``Our series has the spirit of a
classic romantic comedy, except there's no possibility that these
two people will end up as a romantic couple.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life McCormack is married, and he and his wife maintain
homes in Los Angeles and Vancouver.

MAKING WAVES: MARK WAHLBERG TACKLES `THE PERFECT STORM' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Mark Wahlberg with George Clooney in a
scene from ``The Perfect Storm.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Marky Mark doesn't live here any more.
 &HT;    Mark Wahlberg is an actor, not a rapper or an underwear model.
But his past won't stay buried.
 &HT;    On the set of his upcoming film ``The Yards,'' he was thrilled
to have Faye Dunaway say to him, ``Mark, my son is going to do what
you do.''
 &HT;    Wahlberg was all ready with acting tips when Dunaway continued:
``So, Mark, what goes on in that modeling world, anyway? Are there
a lot of drugs at the photo shoots?''
 &HT;    The young actor, who has garnered critical acclaim for ``Boogie
Nights'' (1997), ``Three Kings'' (1999) and ``The Perfect Storm,''
which will open June 30, sighed.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Hey, Faye, I did one underwear ad. I'm not a
model,''' he recalls. ``She said, `Yes, OK, Mark. But he wants to
be a model just like you, and I hope he doesn't get caught up in
the debauchery!'''
 &HT;    Wahlberg grimaces, then laughs. Clad in jeans and a T-shirt as
he reclines on a couch at New York's Essex House and devours a
bagel, he swears that his Calvin Klein days are behind him.
 &HT;    ``As far as going out, pulling down my pants and running around
in my underwear, I don't think I could do that anymore,'' he says
cheerfully. ``Maybe a 20-year anniversary _ I'll come out with my
beer belly and pull down my pants.''
 &HT;    He can joke now, of course, because he's earned solid Hollywood
credibility lately, most recently as a young fisherman pitted
against a killer North Atlantic gale in Wolfgang Petersen's ``The
Perfect Storm,'' based on the best-selling real-life saga by
Sebastian Junger.
 &HT;    Co-starring is George Clooney, who plays the fishing-boat
captain. Clooney and Wahlberg are becoming quite the screen duo _
they co-starred in ``Three Kings,'' and Clooney is producing
Wahlberg's next film, the rock-band saga ``Metal God,'' due later
this year.
 &HT;    ``For `The Perfect Storm,' George personally went to Wolfgang
Petersen and suggested that he give me an audition. He campaigned
for me,'' Wahlberg says. ``I just want to be the one to say that
George is much more than just good-looking _ he is one hell of a
guy.''
 &HT;    Don't expect them to be the new Redford and Newman, however.
 &HT;    ``No,'' Wahlberg jokes, ``it's kind of like he's Eddie Murphy
and I'm Judge Reinhold.''
 &HT;    To prepare for his role, Wahlberg _ who grew up in the Boston
suburbs _ went back East to hang out on fishing boats. He even took
a room above the Crow's Nest Bar in Gloucester, Mass., where the
fisherman he's playing actually hung out.
 &HT;    ``I also got to know my character's family,'' he adds, ``which
just provided invaluable insight, although it was tough for them to
talk about what happened.''
 &HT;    Many of the calmer water shots were done in real boats outside
Gloucester, where Wahlberg grumbles that the only real hazard was
the swarm of fans who trail Clooney everywhere.
 &HT;    ``Even the sea gulls were screaming, `George, we love you!'''
Wahlberg says sarcastically.
 &HT;    The storm scenes, on the other hand, were filmed on the Warner
Brothers lot, in a special hurricane tank which measured 95 feet by
100 feet by 22 feet deep.
 &HT;    It wasn't as dangerous as a real hurricane, the actor says, but
it was hardly less uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``You get in the water, and they turn on the wind. The waves are
crashing,'' Wahlberg says. ``You really do feel like you're going
to die. It was just so tough getting through a day.''
 &HT;    Spending day after day soaked to the skin wasn't what he'd
expected after his performance as porn actor Dirk Diggler in
``Boogie Nights'' won him rave reviews and a reputation as a rising
star.
 &HT;    ``The good thing is that I have just been very busy,'' he says,
laughing. ``The bad thing is that people ask me about the size of
my private parts.''
 &HT;    He insists that his acting career is the real thing, however,
not merely the latest stop in a highly varied life.
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to act,'' he says. ``You know, I had been
bulls--ting and acting most of my life. It only made sense.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he adds, the turning point came in 1985, when at
15 he was sentenced to 45 days in jail for assault after an
argument over a bottle of beer.
 &HT;    ``That experience was definitely a wake-up call,'' he says. ``It
sounds strange, but I also got very into Bruce Lee in prison. I was
into working out, because I had to stay in shape to protect myself.
When I got out, I'd go to the gym instead of hanging out on the
corner with my friends.
 &HT;    ``It saved my life,'' he says. ``I feel like I'm blessed. I
found myself on a path where so many had gone before me _ a lot of
my friends watched their lives go down the chute. I just decided I
wanted something better for myself. I wanted to live the good life,
I wanted to do the right thing for my family.''
 &HT;    Sibling rivalry gave him his first break. His brother Donnie had
become a teen-music sensation with New Kids on the Block, and
Wahlberg followed suit, achieving a 1991 platinum album with his
rap group, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. That led to his Calvin
Klein contract _ and, between the underwear and the rapping, to
frequent problems in launching the acting career he really wanted.
 &HT;    ``At first, acting was so tough,'' he says. ``I got offers like,
`Hey, Mark, why don't you be a rapping, skateboarding dude? Or play
the punk a--hole for us?' I didn't want to be identified as that
type of guy, so I turned down a lot of offers.''
 &HT;    He finally got his acting break in ``Renaissance Man'' (1994),
which led to ``The Basketball Diaries'' (1995), ``Fear'' (1996) and
then ``Boogie Nights'' (1997). Then came stardom, and a whole new
set of issues.
 &HT;    ``It still kills me when I read stuff about myself,'' Wahlberg
admits. ``For instance, I heard someone say me talking about having
a troubled past was just something I did to boost my bio and give
me credibility.
 &HT;    ``Believe it, I was not trying to brag about it,'' he says.
``I'm not proud of my past. I don't think I need it to be
credible.''
 &HT;    The actor sighs.
 &HT;    ``I think I've been misunderstood all the way around,'' he says.
``I thought acting was the one thing that would make it difficult
for people to figure out who I was, because I could slip into
character.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he has had to deal with persistent rumors of an
affair with Jennifer Aniston, his co-star in ``Metal God.'' He and
Aniston have both firmly denied the rumors, but that doesn't matter
once the tabloids are in gear.
 &HT;    ``My mom believes everything she reads,'' he says, wincing.
``She calls me up and says, `Jennifer is dating that nice Brad
Pitt, and you leave that boy's girl alone, Mark!'''
 &HT;    Wahlberg throws his hands up in the air, then laughs.
 &HT;    ``Maybe my life was easier when I was just dropping trou!''

SON OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION: HEATH LEDGER ON `THE PATRIOT' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Heath Ledger in a scene from ``The
Patriot.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    You say you want a revolution? Heath Ledger is happy to oblige.
 &HT;    The young Australian actor, who first caught Hollywood's eye
with his swinging, singing Shakespearean turn in ``10 Things I Hate
About You,'' finds himself in Colonial America in ``The Patriot,''
opening nationwide on June 28.
 &HT;    One of this summer's event pictures, ``The Patriot'' casts
Ledger as the son of Mel Gibson, another brooding and handsome
Aussie _ though, oddly enough, both are cast as Americans this time
around. It's the story of Gabriel Martin (Ledger), a staunch
Colonialist who defies the orders of his father, retired war hero
Benjamin Martin (Gibson) and enlists in the Revolutionary War. One
thing leads to another, and soon father is drawn into battle
alongside son.
 &HT;    ``The thing that was really interesting to me was that Gabriel
had an unusual arc to his life,'' the affable Ledger says by
telephone from Columbia Pictures' New York offices. ``He makes the
transition from young boy to young man.
 &HT;    ``I could relate to that,'' Ledger says. ``I could understand
that time of life, when you step out from your father's opinions
and have your own ideas for the first time in your life. When you
discover that in yourself, it's rather exciting. The energy in you
is exaggerated, and you make exaggerated stands.
 &HT;    ``I think Martin sees himself in Gabriel,'' the actor says
thoughtfully. ``He was quite a savage, and I guess he could see
that bloodlust and enthusiasm coming out of me. He's afraid for me
to discover those qualities in myself _ but, of course, I'm not
going to listen to him, not going to hear any of that until I
discover it for myself.''
 &HT;    The 21-year-old Australian, who hails from Perth, admits that he
knew ``only the basics'' about the Revolutionary War when he signed
on for ``The Patriot.'' He did some studying to prepare, but says
that he was more interested in a sense of the era than in
historical details as such.
 &HT;    ``Obviously I couldn't begin to read enough books to discover a
real insight into what happened, to discover an insight into
Gabriel,'' he says. ``The Revolutionary War is pretty much just a
setting for the story, and the story is about a family. It's a love
story between a father and son that's set during the Revolutionary
War.''
 &HT;    Bonding with Gibson proved easy, Ledger says, mercifully going
easy on the hyperbole.
 &HT;    ``Mel and I had a mutual understanding that we just found in
each other's eyes when we first met,'' he says. ``We didn't go
fishing or anything. Most importantly, we developed a mateship as
friends, instantly, and that translates through to a relationship
as father and son.
 &HT;    ``We pretty much knew how it was going to play, and we took it
from there.''
 &HT;    Ledger's favorite scene in the movie is one in which Gabriel
confronts his father about his war experience. Ledger, Gibson,
director Roland Emmerich and his crew gathered on location at
Cypress Gardens, a manmade marsh, on a blustery winter's night to
capture the moment.
 &HT;    ``It was the last scene we shot for the movie,'' Ledger says.
``We shot it on Jan. 21, all night, until about 8 a.m. It was just
Mel and I sitting around a campfire, and it felt good. I felt
connected to Mel.
 &HT;    ``It was the end of the movie,'' he says. ``We'd been through so
much, and it was a turning point in the story, where Gabriel pulls
something out of his father, from the depths.
 &HT;    ``There was also a lunar eclipse that night, so there was a
blood-red moon in the sky that made the moment even more
beautiful.''
 &HT;    As ``The Patriot'' prepares to storm theaters, Ledger _ whose
credits include ``Black Rock'' (1997) and the Australian television
series ``Roar'' (1997) _ stands at the intersection of anonymity
and stardom. Though some are touting him as the next Mel Gibson,
Ledger simply wants to be Heath Ledger.
 &HT;    ``I haven't felt it yet,'' he says of his next-big-thing status.
``The only time I think about it is when people ask me about it. I
don't let it bother me.
 &HT;    ``It's there,'' he admits after a moment. ``Everything around me
is suddenly changing. But that little spark inside of me is still
the same. I really don't spend that much time thinking about fame,
and I don't care to.''
 &HT;    Instead, Ledger thinks about acting, a craft to which he's
devoted more than half his life, but one that still stirs his real
passion.
 &HT;    ``Acting is a medium of expression for me,'' he says. ``I get to
pass something from me to someone else, and I love to do that. It's
a medium of art, too.
 &HT;    ``I guess I was 12 when I started in amateur theater,'' he says.
``It was just a hobby. I never said I wanted to go to Hollywood, I
never thought I'd be making movies.
 &HT;    ``But doors kept opening and I kept following paths,'' Ledger
says. ``And it's been fun. Along the way I discovered myself. I had
to discover myself in order to portray people _ I had to fully
understand myself, inside and out.
 &HT;    ``So that's been a journey for me.''
 &HT;    Ledger's journey is only beginning, of course. He's halfway
through filming ``A Knight's Tale,'' which he calls ``a comedy
about the jousting life that's set in 15th-century London.'' Once a
``Tale'' is told, Ledger will move on to ``Four Feathers,'' a
remake of the classic 1939 British drama about a 19th-century war
deserter who attempts to reclaim the respect of his family and
friends.
 &HT;    As serious as he may be about his work, Ledger _ who considers
Los Angeles his current base, though right now he says he's
``living out of bags wherever I'm shooting'' _ stresses that he
doesn't live his roles. He's not his characters, and they aren't
him.
 &HT;    ``I tend to try to use the method of just acting,'' he says.
``That's what I feel my job is ... I'm pretty relaxed when it comes
to being on a set. I don't like to walk around and stress out too
much. It keeps things fresh for me, keeps things spontaneous.
 &HT;    ``I love acting, love it with a passion,'' he says. ``But it's
also just something that fills up a bit of time and space between A
and C in my life. Ultimately, on the grand scale of things, acting
is quite insignificant to life in general.
 &HT;    ``But I do love it, and that's why I'm still doing it.''

A REBEL STILL RUNNING: PATTI SMITH ISN'T GIVING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Patti Smith.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    She's been called a punk priestess, a rock-'n'-roll poet
laureate and one of many voices of a generation.
 &HT;    She rejects the most fawning of those titles, but Patti Smith is
happy to be called an artist _ and no word fits her better. Whether
through poetry, visual works or, most frequently, music _ including
her latest album, ``Gung Ho'' _ Smith has spoken with a
particularly strong conscience and sensibility.
 &HT;    During the 1970s she declared that ``Outside of society/is where
I want to be,'' but Smith actually revels in community and
champions the power of the collective spirit. The singer/songwriter
takes seriously the message conveyed by her 1988 hit, ``People Have
the Power,'' and never more than this year, when America is in the
midst of a presidential campaign.
 &HT;    ``I was listening to the State of the Union address,'' Smith
recalls. ``Clinton was saying `Everything's fine, it's fine, we're
fine,' and I was thinking, `No, we're not fine.'
 &HT;    ``Our children are shooting each other,'' she says passionately.
``We're becoming a totally materialistic society, our environment
is compromised. There's so many reasons why we're not fine.
 &HT;    ``Maybe economically things are good,'' she concedes, ``but that
doesn't make good people. That doesn't make a good country, that
doesn't make the moral fabric of the country good. There're too
many things happening that point to a spiritual lack and a lack of
unity and a lack of clarity in our country.''
 &HT;    The 53-year-old Smith, a Chicago native who was raised in New
Jersey and now resides in New York with Jackson and Jesse, her son
and daughter, has been spurred by her sense of the country's drift
to launch her most extensive American tour since the 1970s.
 &HT;    Back then, her Patti Smith Group _ blending classic-rock
conventions with the irreverent spirit of the punk and new wave
movements _ played some of the era's most visceral and challenging
music. She hopes to provoke people again this year, using the songs
from ``Gung Ho'' as a catalyst for thought and ideas.
 &HT;    ``I think that is very American,'' says Smith, a longtime
Democrat who supported Bill Bradley but also sings on the album
about the need for a ``New Party.'' ``It addresses global issues,
but I feel like it's got specifically the things that I'm concerned
with, especially in an election year, that our country has to
address _ things like gun control, some kind of education reform
and political-money reform ... and, most important, the
environment.
 &HT;    ``There're a lot of things I'm concerned about,'' she concludes,
``and I want to stick around America and use my voice as much as I
can and support the Democratic Party.''
 &HT;    Smith's return to the political arena follows a period of
introspection brought on by the death of her husband, former MC5
guitarist Fred ``Sonic'' Smith, of heart failure during 1993. Her
brother, Todd, died of a heart attack the following year, and
Smith's next two releases _ ``Gone Again'' (1996), only her second
album in 17 years, and ``Peace and Noise'' (1997) _ were dark
affairs, ruminating on her sense of personal loss.
 &HT;    ``Gung Ho,'' on the other hand, returns to the bold, punchy
energy of her earlier work.
 &HT;    ``I just had a few difficult, really difficult years, and I had
to rebuild my energy, rebuild my confidence and reacquaint myself
with performing and recording and collaborating with others,''
Smith explains. ``I had help _ Alan Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Michael
Stipe, the members of my band and friends. It was rewarding, but it
was difficult. And it did take awhile.''
 &HT;    ``Gung Ho'' features a variety of guests, including R.E.M.
singer Stipe, Tom Verlaine of the group Television, former Husker
Du member Grant Hart and harmonica player Skaila Kanga. Smith's son
Jackson also plays guitar on the track ``Persuasion,'' which was
co-written by his parents.
 &HT;    But at the core of ``Gung Ho'' is Smith's group, which includes
longtime associates Lenny Kaye on guitar and Jay Dee Daugherty on
drums, with bassist Tony Shanahan and guitarist Oliver Ray, who's
also Smith's current boyfriend.
 &HT;    ``I think that we fortify each other,'' Smith says of the group.
``I did `Peace and Noise' with the same people, and we did that
record ourselves, with no producer _ we just forged through that
one. This one is really a result of all our efforts through the
last record, and touring and collaborating.
 &HT;    ``I think we've found our place,'' she says. ``The musicians
bring in music, and I respond to some of it and they become the
songs. It was just, I guess, the collective spirit of the band. I
think we all stay in step.''
 &HT;    ``Gung Ho'' is a Chinese term that means ``working together,''
which Smith felt made it an appropriate title for the album. But
the title song itself _ a nearly 12-minute epic that closes the
album _ was inspired by her research into Ho Chi Minh, which she
began after seeing a documentary about the Vietnamese leader.
 &HT;    ``I spent two years studying his work, studying his life,
studying how he mapped out independence for the Vietnamese
people,'' Smith says. ``And in doing so, I found out he used our
Declaration of Independence as a guide and our Revolutionary War as
a guide, and I found that very interesting. It also moved me to
study the Declaration of Independence.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to write a song about his life,'' she adds, ``because
I have always opposed the Vietnam War, but I never understood it. I
suppose it was an opportunity for me to comprehend what the whole
thing was about, and so I did.
 &HT;    ``I was impressed with his knowledge of the history of our
country and the history of our freedom,'' the musician says. ``And
now, more than ever, I know that war was wrong.''
 &HT;    Since ``Gung Ho's'' release, Smith has also declared her own
independence. She bolted from Arista Records, her home since 1975,
to protest the ouster of Arista founder Clive Davis, whom she
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year.
 &HT;    ``He gave me the freedom to record as I see fit and artistic
control of what I do,'' Smith says. ``That means a lot to me.''
 &HT;    She may for the moment be one of rock 'n' roll's homeless, but
Smith says that she looks forward to a lot more music to come.
 &HT;    ``I really feel like I'm coming from a position of strength, of
health, of energy,'' says Smith, who's also working on a book about
her relationship with the late artist Robert Mapplethorpe. ``After
`Gone Again,' I really thought that would be my last record. But so
many people really encouraged me to go on. And people, when I would
perform, they seemed happy to see me.
 &HT;    ``So as long as I can do something of worth, as long as I can
contribute things that I think are of good quality, I'll continue
performing and I'll continue making records,'' she concludes. ``And
when I think I can't contribute anymore, I'll move on to something
else.''

 (Includes a color slide of Hayden Christensen in a scene from
``Higher Ground.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 7, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The far North is heading south.
</P>
<P>
   In years past there were always one or two Canadian-born
celebrities who would break out of that country's frigid climes and
into the American show-biz spotlight. Remember the heydays of Lorne
Greene, Anne Murray and Robert Goulet?
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian invasion has shifted into hyperdrive in recent
years. Spearheaded by Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Bryan Adams and
other musical types, the list has expanded exponentially to include
a brave new crop of feisty Canucks, all eager to take over
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Television, in particular, has proved a potent breeding-ground
for northern lights. Here are 10 of the brightest. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Hayden Christensen.
</P>
<P>
   You may not know him yet, but just wait.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, born in Vancouver and raised in Toronto, was until
recently best known for his role as hunky Scott Barringer on the
Fox Family Channel series ``Higher Ground.'' Nowadays, however,
he's best known as the future Anakin Skywalker.
</P>
<P>
   After his recent selection to follow Jake Lloyd as Anakin in the
next two episodes of George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' saga, the
19-year-old's acting career has done the same thing that Mark
Hamill's did when he jumped ship on ``Eight Is Enough'' in favor of
the original ``Star Wars'' in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire time I've been involved in the casting process _
for eight months _ actually being in the new `Star Wars' movie just
seemed so farfetched,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an actor who, seven years ago, got his start on the
smarmy daytime soap ``Family Passions.''
</P>
<P>
   + Pamela Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's astute business sense, coupled with her memorable physique
and her questionable taste in men, has seen her skyrocket from
Playmate to ``Home Improvement's'' Tool Time girl to ``Baywatch''
babe and then into a hellacious sex-tape scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The story has a happy ending, however, as she's returned to the
small screen as star and executive producer of ``V.I.P.,'' one of
the world's most successful syndicated shows.
</P>
<P>
   + David James Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   After first coming to fame as Alison's sex-addicted rehab
boyfriend on ``Melrose Place,'' the Toronto-born Elliott nabbed the
starring role in ``JAG'' as Lt. Commander Harmon Rabb Jr. _
``Harm'' for short.
</P>
<P>
   After poor ratings got the show cancelled by NBC, ``JAG'' was
picked up by CBS, where it slowly but steadily built an audience,
becoming a genuine hit in its fourth year. Audiences warmed to its
combination of legal drama and military thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that about the show,'' Elliott says. ``It keeps it
interesting. But I think it hindered the show a little in the
beginning, because it was tough for people to put a finger on what
it was. That and getting over the prejudice of it being a military
show. People going, `Aaah, I don't like military shows,' when in
fact it's more than just that.''
</P>
<P>
   + Joshua Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   After Pamela Lee, Josh Jackson is probably the best-known
Canadian working in television at the moment. His portrayal of
Pacey, ``Dawson Creek's'' perpetual underdog, has cemented the
popularity that Jackson earned in the beloved ``Mighty Ducks'' film
series.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Jackson doesn't get too excited either by the
popularity of the show or by his own celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing it for three years,'' the Vancouver-born
Jackson says, ``and the initial blush of the show has worn off for
all of us. The crazy glow and the madness it had when it first came
out has died down, and now what makes the show most interesting, at
least for myself, is coming to work every day with actors I
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find it a challenge, to bring your best work to the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   + Carly Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected much when Carly Pope's series, ``Popular,''
debuted on WB last fall.
</P>
<P>
   My, how things change. What at first looked like merely another
generic WB teen-angst festival blossomed into the most demented,
yet also most morally adept, comic series on teen television.
</P>
<P>
   As Sam, the unpopular, politically aware half of the stepsister
duo that powers the series, the Vancouver-born Pope has seen her
popularity soar.
</P>
<P>
   Pope compares her character to ``a builder or a contractor. She
has all the right tools, but she doesn't know how to use them
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite unlike Pope, who doesn't have that problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   + Ryan Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Reynolds' breakthrough series has survived so-so ratings
and the loss of half of its title. His genial sitcom, ``Two Guys
and a Girl'' _ nee ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place'' _ will
return to the ABC Friday-night lineup this fall, where fans of the
Vancouver native hope the show will find a new audience and
flourish in the friendlier time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had already had a measure of success in Canada when he
literally decided, on the spur of the moment, to drive south and
try his hand in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove down to Los Angeles,'' he says. ``Took several
attempts to get across the border, because I was just this ignorant
young Canadian thinking I could just cross and go to work!''
</P>
<P>
   + Scott Speedman.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Felicity'' scraped into a third season by the skin
of its teeth, look out for big things from Scott Speedman, the
Vancouver boy who plays Ben. He was handpicked to replace Brad Pitt
in the upcoming Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle ``Duets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't look for him to move back to Vancouver anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a love/hate thing with Vancouver,'' Speedman says. ``I
was born in London, England, and I was just over there and it's
just rank and gets me down. Vancouver is a little slow for me, but
British Columbia is one of the most amazing places.''
</P>
<P>
   + Tonya Lee Williams.
</P>
<P>
   She may be young, but it's her background that suggests she's
restless: Born in England, Tonya Lee Williams lived in Jamaica,
then returned to England before making Oshawa her home.
</P>
<P>
   Since she took on the role of Dr. Olivia Hastings on ``The Young
and the Restless,'' Williams has entered the pantheon of soap-opera
stars ... and, again, relocated _ this time to Los Angeles with her
dog, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   + Caroline Rhea.
</P>
<P>
   As Hilda Spellman on ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' and as a
virtual fixture on ``Hollywood Squares,'' Caroline Rhea has come a
long way from the New York comedy clubs where she slaved for seven
years. This irresistibly ebullient Montreal girl, who still tours
her bawdy comedy routine in her spare time, jokes about her role as
the good witch's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she says, ``I hope I am more mature than her. She's
like 512 years old, and is always looking for something to do
because she's been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   + Eric McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   The irony that Eric McCormack's character is gay, yet plays the
``straight'' man to the series' trio of neurotic, high-maintenance
characters is not lost on him. In fact, the Torontonian sees it as
a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Will is gay and Grace is straight, this show is free
to explore their relationship without building toward a sexual
payoff at the end,'' he says. ``Our series has the spirit of a
classic romantic comedy, except there's no possibility that these
two people will end up as a romantic couple.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life McCormack is married, and he and his wife maintain
homes in Los Angeles and Vancouver.

 By CLIFF GROMER 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sky diving is not an extreme sport except for folks too timid to
try it. Compared to the current wave of recreational mayhem that
pushes the envelope of sanity, and mental and physical endurance _
stuff you could experience a decade or so ago only in the circus _
sky diving is downright tame. Nondivers love to repeat the tired
excuse about how it doesn't make sense to jump out of a perfectly
good airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Sky divers make up a private club. They're the only ones who
know the incomparable sensation of truly flying _ swooshing through
the air without the benefit of any mechanical device save a
descent-slowing parachute. Thermals and arm-flapping
notwithstanding, a sky diver's route of flight is irreversibly in
one direction: down.
</P>
<P>
   But during free fall, before the chute is pulled, a diver's body
acts as an airfoil of sorts, through the subtle movements of hands,
feet and posture. Sure, plummeting humans might be a source of
amusement to passing birds, but it's flying nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Sky diving, however, requires substantial training and equipment
_ and a perfectly good airplane to jump out of. An alternative that
closely duplicates the sensation of flying is the sky-diving
simulator, a mobile vertical wind tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be confused with those ``Honey, I Cut The Elevator
Cables'' amusement rides, the sky-diving simulator supports your
body on a cushion of air. You can rise, descend, turn and _ for the
advanced _ perform somersaults, headstands, dives and other
assorted aerobatics.
</P>
<P>
   The simulator consists of a 1200-horsepower Detroit Diesel
engine hooked to a DC-3 propeller facing upward that generates wind
speeds up to 150 mph needed for the supportive air cushion. Air
speed is variable depending on the weight of the flyer. The whole
shebang is mounted on a huge trailer that's hauled by a commercial
truck.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one such device in the world at this time, the
3-year-old X-Treme Air owned and operated by Paradigm Entertainment
Group in Grand Rapids, Mich. X-Treme Air travels from coast to
coast and is booked by colleges that want to shake up their
students. Corporations also hire the flying machine to wake up
three-martini-lunched executives and to experience something that
blows even more air than their PR department (if such a thing could
be possible).
</P>
<P>
   X-Treme Air was recently at Teikyo Post College in Waterbury,
Conn., about a 90-minute drive from Manhattan, but surprisingly,
the line of students waiting to sign up for the ride was short. The
flyers, myself included, were divided into groups of six for a
10-minute orientation with one of the three pro flyers who
accompany the X-Treme Air machine on its cross-country trek.
</P>
<P>
   Students, including males, were told to remove jewelry and
piercings (boy, things have changed since I went to school). One
girl neglected to remove her tongue ring and the wind pressure
caused pain. Any loose stuff could drop into the spinning prop
where it would then shoot up and through you like shrapnel.
Participants donned helmets, goggles and special flying suits that
had handles for the pros to grab and control them.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the machine we sat around the perimeter of the wind
tunnel on a giant air-filled doughnut. Then the pros put on an
impressive demonstration of trick flying, shooting up 25 feet in
the wind stream, somersaulting and diving headfirst. Now there's an
idea for an extreme sport _ diving into a spinning DC-3 prop.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to fly, each of us rose into a kneeling
position and leaned toward the center. ``Don't push yourself off,''
we were warned, ``or you'll shoot across and torpedo the student on
the opposite side.''
</P>
<P>
   We were also told to keep our hands out and not wave to friends
or we would flip. ``Keep your feet straight out behind you and
don't flail them or you'll spin, and arch your back slightly, sort
of like a human banana.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of us leaned out and the two pros standing on opposite ends
of the doughnut grabbed us by the suit's handles. They are really
experts at what they do, having flown some 50,000 people with no
fatalities or injuries. They guided us up and down and, when the
prop rpm increased, jumped into the wind stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen if you didn't hold us?'' asked one student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd fly out over the top and land on the pavement about 50
feet away,'' came the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The experience itself was exhilarating and a real adrenaline
rush. The wind pressure turns your face to rubber. Your lips
vibrate in the breeze. But you actually do feel like you're flying
and don't even notice the handlers who are controlling you.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-minute ride seems a lot longer, but it's still over too
soon. And you want more. Much more. It's enough to make you look
around for a perfectly good airplane to jump out of.

Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.)
 By TOBEY GRUMET 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not an old lady. Honestly I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   But sadly, with Gen Y being raised on computers and the
Internet, I tend to feel left out of the loop when I consider
what's going on behind the average college kid's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to believe what's going on out there,'' a
friend recently said to me. He'd just returned from a college
reunion at Cornell, and while there he was startled by the rampant
use of something called Napster at college parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't one CD player in use at the party,'' he said.
``All the music was being run off computers, playlists and an
amplifier. In fact, during a meeting at my fraternity, they decided
to scrap getting a new stereo. They were just going to keep the
amp, and buy a new computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever hear of Napster? If not, let me clue you in. Napster is a
computer software _ now a startup dot.com company _ invented by a
19-year-old who just wanted to share some of his guitar samplings
with his online buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds innocent enough, but that teen-ager's bright idea has led
to a heap of legal questions. Napster also allows you to find,
share and download hundreds of thousands of MP3 music files to your
computer, MP3 player or CD Recordable-for free. This music is
digital and, unlike the old days of waiting for your favorite song
to come on the radio so you could tape it, downloading music files
is practically instantaneous. Once you've downloaded the software,
you do a quick search for the music you want, and start pirating.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Napster turns your computer into a server. So let's
say you want to find Bruce Springsteen's ``Born In The USA.'' You
press Search, type in the title and/or artist and hit Return.
Within nanoseconds you're given a list of all the people who have
Napster software, are on their computers at that moment, and have
``Born In The USA'' on their playlist.
</P>
<P>
   You can choose which person you'd like to take the song from,
depending on how fast their modem is or whether they have a cable
or T1 line. The software downloads the song to your own playlist _
and voila!, you're set to rock on.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit, it's hard to hate this program. The thought of
downloading almost any song I want in minutes is certainly
tempting. And it brings back all kinds of ``down with the system''
feelings I had at one time. But, the adult in me knows this isn't
great for the people who wrote the song, sell the song and perform
the song.
</P>
<P>
   I realize this makes it harder for struggling bands to retain
contracts, and I know it makes the creative contingent wonder what
they're working for. If I ever get around to writing that great
American novel (that is, when I get around to it), I'm not going to
want people enjoying my work for free. I'd feel cheated, and since
I'm already a poor writer, not getting royalties would be a drag.
Oh no _ am I becoming the establishment I once rejected?
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America is not amused. In
December, the organization sued Napster for contributory copyright
infringement. That means Napster may not literally hand over
pirated material to computer users _ but the makers of the program
aren't doing anything to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, performers and musicians aren't happy either. Heavy
metal group Metallica has filed a suit against Napster and,
according to Industry Standard magazine, rapper Dr. Dre has said he
wants all his copyrighted songs off the software.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is helping slow down the Napster rage is its
incessant gobbling of bandwidth on college campuses. Basically,
when you download Napster software, your computer becomes a server,
and servers consume a ton of bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, schools including Yale, the University of Southern
California and Indiana University have banned students from using
Napster _ though if you think that's going to stop people from
getting free music on the Internet, I've got a great bridge to sell
you here in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there will have to be some regulations put into
place. As the online generation matures, how people access music
will continue to change, and lawmakers will have to do something
about it.

   ROCKET INHALES ITS WAY INTO ORBIT
</P>
<P>
   NASA believes a new type of propulsion system will make it
cheaper to fly to the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a combined-cycle rocket engine, it inhales oxygen from
the atmosphere for about half of its flight. Conventional rockets
use oxygen stored on board. In both cases the gas supports fuel
combustion. Using an external oxygen supply will lower a vehicle's
launch weight. At $10,000 a pound to reach orbit, this
substantially reduces launch costs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest tests at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., demonstrated what engine performance would be
like during low-speed flight, when high thrust levels are needed to
push the rocket through Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FLOATING PLANETS
</P>
<P>
   Images captured by UKIRT, the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
in Hawaii, contradict the prevailing wisdom that planets must orbit
stars. The most sensitive survey ever undertaken of the region in
the Orion nebula where new stars are forming has revealed 13
``free-floating planets,'' says Philip Lucas, the University of
Hertfordshire astronomer who analyzed the images.
</P>
<P>
   About the size of Jupiter in our own solar system, each
free-floater has too little mass to ignite and become a star, or
even a so-called ``brown dwarf.'' Rather than orbit a star, they
drift through space alone.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, only two similar objects had been discovered, both in
the southern Chamaeleon nebula. The discovery of 13 in one cluster
suggests to astronomers that free-floating planets might be common.
</P>
<P>
   AQUATIC NOSE CAN SNIFF SCENT OF LIFE
</P>
<P>
   An electronic nose that can work at the intense pressures found
more than a mile beneath the sea is helping biologists locate
exotic forms of deep sea life.
</P>
<P>
   Created at the University of Delaware and Analytical Instrument
Systems in Flemington, N.J., the sensor can detect the sulfur-rich
compounds found in gases that spew from underwater vents. These
vents have drawn the attention of marine biologists because the
vents attract many exotic species of life.
</P>
<P>
   These species, because of their distance from the surface, can
obtain their energy only from locally available chemicals, instead
of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a system like this has been built to
operate at such great depths and pressures,'' chemist George Luther
told a meeting of the American Chemical Society. Some of these vent
dwellers may possess enzymes useful in processing food and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   21ST CENTURY WOOD BRIDGE
</P>
<P>
   Call it a step backward for progress. A steel span over the
Maronne River in France has been torn down to make way for a wood
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a bit backward, but the new 189-foot bridge is
actually wider and stronger than the older steel structure.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was not the engineers' first choice. Local residents
insisted upon it to match the scenery, which includes the remains
of a 13th-century castle. ``We hose Douglas fir because of its good
mechanical properties and its performance in terms of natural
durability,'' says engineer Jean-Louis Michotey. The wood was
laminated and arranged into three spans joined by hinges. In a
concession to modern times, the deck is reinforced concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Although France may have the newest wood bridge, the longest, at
328 feet, is in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER KILLERS FROM THE DEEP
</P>
<P>
   Sponges, marine worms and other creatures of the deep may
provide a new arsenal in the war on cancer, say Stanford University
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm follows studies that show that bryostatin, a
chemical compound produced by Bugula neritina, a tiny, plantlike
animal found off the California coast, has powerful cancer-fighting
abilities. It appears to prevent the growth of tumors in a variety
of human cancers, including melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
renal cancer, Paul A. Wender of Stanford told a recent meeting of
the American Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 clinical trials aimed at evaluating bryostatin are
currently under way in the United States. Preliminary findings show
cancer patients improve while suffering only minor side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it takes 14 tons of B. neritina to produce less
than 1 ounce of bryostatin. Not surprisingly, bryozoan farms have
begun to sprout up in California.
</P>
<P>
   Wender predicted that the ocean, and coral reefs that support a
broad array of marine life, will be a rich source of other
disease-fighting agents.

 (ART ADV: Graphic of a backwater valve is available by calling

 By NORMAN BECKER, P.E. 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.

<P>
   BACKWATER VALVE
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I prevent municipal wastewater from backing up into
my house's plumbing? On two occasions, it backed up and spilled out
of the washing machine's standpipe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joseph Ascher, Merrick, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: My first thought for correcting the problem is to install a
swing-check backwater valve in the main house drain. This would
protect the washing machine and any plumbing fixtures in the
basement from a reversal of flow caused by an overtaxed public
sewer. However, you would need to check with your local building
inspector about the plumbing regulations that apply where you live.
Some municipalities do not allow backwater valves on the main house
drain.
</P>
<P>
   My second thought, and my recommendation, is to install the
valve on the branch of the house drain that serves the washing
machine, rather than on the main house drain. Most municipalities
will allow this installation.
</P>
<P>
   RESILIENT TILE OVER CONCRETE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a 1,700-square-foot house with ceramic tile over
concrete. Can the tile be removed and replaced with resilient tile
or sheet vinyl?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeanine Straub, Dothan, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   A: Any type of vinyl flooring can be installed over a concrete
floor, as long as the area is smooth, clean and dry. The big
question is whether the floor is dry. Some amount of moisture will
normally be emitted from the concrete slab, but excessive moisture
will cause the new tiles or sheet vinyl to lose its bond to the
concrete. In turn, this causes tiles to become loose, or seams to
curl in sheet vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   A flooring installer needs to check the amount of water vapor
that is passing through the concrete before installing any
flooring. Although homeowners can get an idea of whether the floor
is dry by taping small squares of plastic on the floor and then
checking them for condensation, professionals can make a more
accurate estimate. They can actually measure the amount of vapor
(expressed as the weight of the water measured in pounds per 1,000
square feet of floor) emitted over a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of vinyl flooring make recommendations for the
amount of moisture vapor that their floor system can tolerate. For
example, to install vinyl with felt backing, the floor must emit no
more water vapor than 5 pounds per 1,000 square feet of floor in 24
hours.

GRAHAM'S CLOCK HAS RUN OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all goes well this week, Gary Graham will finally get what he
deserves: a lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   This coldblooded killer's worthless life is scheduled to end on
Thursday _ he's had eight execution dates, according to one news
report _ despite much protest, not to mention weeping and gnashing,
by the Gary Graham fan club. Led by bleeding-heart actor Danny
Glover and like-minded death penalty foes from Hollywood and
elsewhere, the save-Graham forces are trying to exploit recent
controversy about capital punishment in a desperate attempt to
rescue Graham from the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for society and the cause of justice, Graham may
have dodged the executioner for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's case provides a textbook example of the virtually
endless appellate process that keeps convicted killers on Death Row
for 10, 15 and 20 years. These misguided death penalty opponents
are constantly screaming that lowlifes like Graham are shortchanged
by the justice system _ but Graham's case has been reviewed dozens
of times since he was convicted of the 1981 murder of 53-year-old
Bobby Lambert in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has pursued every goofy appeal that his lawyers could
devise; all have been rejected by the courts. After nearly two
decades of stalling, Graham and his partisans are reduced to
arguing that it is unreasonable to execute a killer whose
conviction was based on the testimony of an eyewitness to the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The implications here are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   If the testimony of a sure and certain eyewitness _ the witness
in Graham's case was, and is, as sure and certain as you will find
_ is useless in a murder trial, how many past and future killers
must go unpunished?
</P>
<P>
   Graham gunned down an innocent bystander in a supermarket
parking lot. He left behind none of that precious DNA, the new
be-all and end-all of the criminal justice system. But a
schoolteacher named Bernadine Skillern saw Graham shoot Lambert.
She identified him for police. She never wavered while testifying
in Graham's murder trial, and she has never wavered since.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Skillern has been ostracized, harassed and
threatened _ but she has not yielded to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Mr. Graham shoot and kill Mr. Lambert on that parking
lot in 1981,'' Skillern said at a news conference last week. ``That
has not changed. It's not going to change. I saw him shoot and kill
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Skillern said she met with the media ``because the public was
being misinformed regarding the Graham execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted her:
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw his face three or four different times from angles, then
full-face ... I saw him full-face as he was crossing the drive. My
lights were on him in the car ... I'm very sure. There has never
been a doubt in my mind. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are those who question the accuracy of eyewitness
testimony, and there have been verified examples of
misidentification by such witnesses. But credible eyewitness
testimony has always been _ and will continue to be _ a cornerstone
of the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The jury believed Bernadine Skillern. The jury believed beyond a
reasonable doubt that Gary Graham killed Bobby Lambert. That's how
the system works.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has had practically 20 years to prove that Skillern and
the jury were wrong. He hasn't even come close. The clock has run
out.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn pointed out last week that
Lambert's murder was part of a weeklong crime spree that involved
at least 13 victims.
</P>
<P>
   The AP quoted Cornyn:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Graham is not the innocent victim in this case; he is the
convicted murderer. For 19 years, Graham's victims and their
families have had to live with the consequences of his crimes. It
is now time for them to have the closure and the justice our system
provides.''
</P>
<P>
   This case has dragged on too long. Justice has been delayed too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, finally, needs to keep his appointment with the
executioner. Danny Glover needs to shut up and make a movie.

`GENTLEMEN,' START YOUR ANTICS ON COMEDY CENTRAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that absolutely nothing in the Comedy Central series
``The League of Gentlemen'' is familiar _ not the stars, not the
jokes, and certainly not the peculiar town in which it is set _
actually helps to make the show fresh and fascinating, if not
exactly rip-roaring funny.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a 14-episode run on Monday, it features the British
comedy team of Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith,
an obviously talented trio of performers who pull off the
remarkable feat of portraying more than 60 men and women
characters, young and old, fat and thin, living in a bizarre small
town in northern England. They include, among other oddballs, a
psychotic couple running the local store (who murder people), a
blind photographer, a vet who kills more animals than he saves, and
a man who raises, and constantly talks about, toads.
</P>
<P>
   The humor _ often dark, sexually crude and strikingly unusual _
recalls such famous British comedies as ``Kind Hearts and
Coronets'' and ``Lady Killers,'' although, on second thought,
American viewers who find PBS a bore probably wouldn't know much
about those.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, then, that ``The League of Gentlemen'' features the
kind of bizarre scenarios and rampant absurdity rarely seen on
American television unless ``Monty Python'' is your cup of tea or
the other Comedy Central import, ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' about a
pair of boozing, carefree women, made you chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``The League of Gentlemen'' made it outside
northern Britain, let alone onto American television, has come as
something of a shock to the show's creators, who wonder,
rightfully, whether its humor is too geographically and culturally
specific.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit jolting for anywhere outside some public TV markets
and certainly for Comedy Central, which, beginning with Benny Hill
during the channel's early years, has over time schooled its
audience in the British sensibility of eliciting laughs. The Brits
live well in the context of Comedy Central, which continues to
solidify its identity as a cable channel unafraid to take risks,
even when it attracts bad (which often means good) press in the
form of shows like ``South Park'' and its seemingly endless scenes
involving bodily functions, and personalities along the lines of
Craig Kilborn, whose sarcastic, smirky nature was a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   How much its risk-taking has paid off probably depends on how
one looks at cable success at a time when luring a half a million
viewers to an episode is something of an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, ``South Park'' drew the channel's best ratings,
about 500,000 viewers, but even that was minuscule compared to
network programming shows like the canceled ``Safe Harbor,'' a
lifeless drama that had more than triple the number of viewers. In
general, Comedy Central programming draws less than half as many
viewers as leading cable channels like TNT and USA. Another problem
has been, of course, holding onto talent once they become stars.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Maher took his nightly ``Politically Incorrect'' series to
ABC, and Kilborn, who chaired ``The Daily Show,'' followed a
similar path to CBS. And the comedy channel's talent drain doesn't
include its behind-the-scenes losses, like its prized writers who
are steadily beating paths to sitcomland on the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Just when one of its programming chiefs, Doug Herzog, was touted
as a future savior, he bolted for greener pastures at Fox, although
the greenery turned out to include hidden land mines. (He has since
been replaced.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a big week for Comedy Central, which begins to sprinkle
original programming over five nights with series that are much
like ``The League of Gentlemen'' _ hit-or-miss propositions that
may or may not be around this time next season.
</P>
<P>
   Also being introduced is ``Strip Mall,'' which stars Julie Brown
as a former child star who lives in the San Fernando Valley and is
married to a nerdy owner of a dry-cleaning facility at the Rancho
del Toro. The joke is that it's a strip mall full of sex, greed and
sin.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is simultaneously cornball and silly. The dialogue
is lame, and even Brown's exaggerated mannerisms do little to
salvage what's in the script. That began Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Forget Your Toothbrush,'' beginning Tuesday, is a goofy
game show that originated in England but has been revamped for
American audiences. It's said to be a game show, but it's more of a
series of sketch comedy routines, in which people from the audience
are picked to be involved in the sketches and can win items.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the studio audience show up with their luggage in
anticipation of winning vacations said to be either nice or trashy.
(Scotland was the prize in the preview I saw.) Comedian Mark Curry,
last seen in the sitcom ``Hangin' With Mr. Cooper,'' is the host,
and it's clear that he's been out of work for some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, he persuades a woman to destroy her beloved
stuffed animal for $1,000. In another, much funnier sketch, a woman
is blindfolded and asked to guess what four men have under their
kilts.
</P>
<P>
   The series joins second-season shows ``The Man Show,'' which has
the distinction of being on more critics' worst lists than any
other show, and ``Turn Ben Stein On,'' as well as new episodes of
``South Park'' and the British version of ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway?'' (The American series is a ratings success on ABC.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike UPN, Comedy Central has sidestepped the scolding that
comes with offering humor that's considered juvenile and
frat-boyish, unless you count the outcry a few seasons back over
``South Park'' and its conspiracy to corrupt minors. Comedy Central
remains the channel of choice for college-aged men, and I'd be
surprised if ``The League of Gentlemen'' didn't rally guys around
the tube much the way ``Sex and the City'' lures women.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the programming remains mean-spirited, although Comedy
Central prefers the terms ``smart'' and ``innovative.'' Or, better
yet, ``edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   The channel has certainly come a ways since being formed in 1991
as a result of the merging of HBO's Comedy Central and MTV's Ha!
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   It initially relied heavily on television stand-up routines, but
by the early '90s most viewers had grown weary of watching mediocre
comics in front of brick walls. The channel lacked resources to
produce high-quality sitcoms, so it merely bought them from
somewhere else, airing reruns of ``Saturday Night Live,''
``McHale's Navy'' and ``The Benny Hill Show,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   Its back against the wall, this forced Comedy Central to be
inventive and daring, although I'd call it desperate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early successes was ``Mystery Science Theater 3000,''
an amusing program in which characters sat in front of a film
screen and ridiculed bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Comedy Central saw a glimpse of its audience and has
since zeroed in on a far more narrow view of comedy than its name
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a channel that prizes absurdity as comedy, Comedy
Central is lucky to have ``The Daily Show,'' which remains one of
the more witty _ and even in Comedy Central tradition, cynical _
contributions to TV's comedic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   At least there, your brain doesn't have to collapse in order to
enjoy it.

<P>
   SAN RAMON, Calif. _ What's your beef?
</P>
<P>
   You have one, don't you? Everyone else does. Like the writer of
a recent letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   He griped about meteorologists who often preface weather reports
with, ``Here's good news: It will be cooler tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me and many other Hispanics, good news is warm, even hot
weather,'' the writer complained. ``Yet so far as I know, there has
never been a Hispanic weather analyst in the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   I know what he means. I have similar thoughts whenever I watch
Spencer Christian, the weatherman on Channel 7 in San Francisco. Oh
sure, he talks intelligently about pressure highs and lows, and
advises whether I should wear a sweater if I visit San Francisco
that weekend, but what does he know, really? He's a black male. I'm
a white female. HELLO? What about MY people?
</P>
<P>
   The weather report would mean so much more to me if it were
delivered by a woman who was 50 percent Irish, 25 percent Colombian
and 25 percent French. She would also be around my age, early 40s,
since hormonal fluctuations could drastically impact what
temperature is deemed as ``too cool'' or ``too warm.'' One good
estrogen power surge could easily transform ``too warm'' into
anything over 58 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   I would prefer a female meteorologist with curly hair because
she would understand the effect that weather has on curly-haired
women.
</P>
<P>
   How many times has NBC weatherman Willard Scott flippantly
predicted ``mild precipitation''? Mild? To a bald guy, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle to a curly-haired woman is the beauty equivalent of the
Exxon Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask any middle-aged, European/South American, curly haired,
pre-menopausal female. If there were a meteorologist who understood
our needs and recognized the concerns of my people, we would be
better emotionally equipped to face a damp day in which we all
resemble Carrot Top.
</P>
<P>
   I want a SAD meteorologist. I suffer from Seasonal Affective
Disorder, and a meteorologist who also gets depressed when the days
are short and it's gray and overcast would sympathize with the
gloomy effect that bad weather has on people like me.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't cheerily predict howling winds and icy rain as ``a
cozy day to stay indoors and snuggle near a fireplace with a good
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that supposed to sound appealing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hide the knives,'' she would warn instead. ``Refill that
Prozac prescription and stock up on tissues. Go out and get
yourself a couple of men. Ben &AMP; Jerry come to mind, because
sisters, hear me when I tell you, we are in for one dreary spell.''
Amen.
</P>
<P>
   I need a middle-aged, European/South American, curly-haired,
pre-menopausal weather analyst who understands the chafing of heat
rash, the sorrow of sweat stains and the anguish of the frizzy
blues. Someone who sleeps with an electric blanket in the summer,
complains about the heat in the winter and on more than one
occasion has mistaken her sun block for hair conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Move over, weatherman. I don't mean to rain on your parade, but
a gale force is blowing into town and she's going to call the
weather the way it really is _ frizzy and depressing. So tell me:
</P>
<P>
   Where do I apply?

&HT;     TREAT INDONESIA WITH RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AL HIRSHEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia offers a kaleidoscope of cultures
and landscapes. It is an anthropologist's heaven. It is a dream for
any naturalist.
</P>
<P>
   This is true on any of 13,000-plus islands that make up the
archipelago that stretches almost 3,100 miles from the Asian
mainland into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But I've been intrigued by something else during the almost two
years I have lived in Jakarta and worked in Indonesia (in corporate
debt restructuring, investment and corporate governance).
</P>
<P>
   What fascinates me are glaring contradictions, either apparent
or real, of the Indonesian psyche (or at least the people on the
island of Java, which has 60 percent of the population and most of
the powerful politicians).
</P>
<P>
   For many foreigners living here, these contradictions try or
even break their patience. They can't get past Indonesia's negative
ways. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ The society is permeated by the long history and tolerance of
corruption at every level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business and government are conducted on a very hierarchical
base. The wish of the boss determines all. No action is taken
without his or her direction. He or she is waited on as if a great
potentate. This system stifles initiative and breeds fear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many Javanese tend to lack directness in dealing with others
and rarely show emotion. And yet, and I generalize, many are quick
to feel insulted, to act on rumors and, in some cases, to run amok
(an Indonesian word).
</P>
<P>
   Let me give an example:
</P>
<P>
   My driver and I came upon a street fight between students at
different schools, a common occurrence here. The kids appeared to
be no older than 13 or 15. In a matter of minutes, rocks as big as
grapefruits were being thrown. One hit our car.
</P>
<P>
   As we hastily left, people were running toward the fight with
sword-like metal bars. When I asked what the fight was about, I was
told: ``It just is what the school kids have always done.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are episodes like this one:
</P>
<P>
   When four local university professors were approached to write
questions for a proposed quiz show, they thanked the producer for
the opportunity, and for the chance to sell the answers.
</P>
<P>
   I do not profess to love the pollution of Jakarta, the
corruption, the mistreatment of the ethnic Chinese minority or the
violence that erupts among religious or ethnic factions. But there
are many positive sides to Indonesian society. These are things we
can only hope will reappear in America:
</P>
<P>
   _ Simple good manners and civility.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respect for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   _ An awareness of the importance of and respect for family and
community.
</P>
<P>
   _ Religious and ethnic tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The importance of character and personality, not competence or
status.
</P>
<P>
   _ The avoidance of saying no. (In order to be civil and polite,
Indonesians often soften their responses to ``not yet'' or ``maybe
later.'')
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurraham Wahid's first act after his election was to
go to the grave of his parents to show respect and give thanks for
what they had done for him. It is a Javanese duty to drop
everything and visit the hospital or attend the funeral of, not
only family and friends, but colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cursing or road rage on the streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
   Once you are accepted as part of their ``family,'' the sweet and
hospitable character of the Indonesian is evident. The poker face
gives way to a great sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Age is considered a plus in this society. Indonesians value the
opinion and wisdom of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In Yogyakarta, a 28-year-old man who worked for me and was a
former anti-Suharto student leader asked me to visit his
father-in-law (a former head of the university the young man
attended and an ardent Suharto supporter at that time).
</P>
<P>
   His father-in-law had suffered a stroke. The young man felt that
because of my age (61) and perceived status as a Western
businessman, my visit to the hospital would give the man
encouragement and his wife support. The thoughtfulness of the young
man and the experience moved me deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again I have attended functions that reaffirm the
importance and support of family and community. And it's
interesting that to my hosts, the care and feeding of my driver is
of equal importance to my own.
</P>
<P>
   I think my experience can be helpful to U.S. policymakers in
their approach to Indonesia. It is the most populous Muslim
country, a fledgling democracy with great promise.
</P>
<P>
   The government is attacking the problems of corruption,
including its court system. Rule of law is an important goal of
this new democracy. Indonesia's geographical location gives it
great strategic importance, and its wealth in oil, gas, minerals is
vital to the West.
</P>
<P>
   We should always keep in mind the psychological effect on its
people of the country's colonial past, treat its government and
people with patience and respect _ and keep a touch of humility.
</P>
<P>
   Arrogance, perceived or real, will undermine our goals to
support a democratic country friendly to America.

&HT;     THE LAST ANNIVERSARY IN A CAREER MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In June of 1975, when I took a job as a sports
writer at the San Francisco Examiner, I would have been amazed (and
appalled) had anyone told me I'd still be here when the 24th
anniversary of my hire date rolled around.
</P>
<P>
   Never a woman with a personal or professional grand plan, I
didn't think about how long I might stay at the Examiner. I was 26,
only nine months separated from New York City and a national
magazine job, and I was sick of the financial insecurity that
hounds most free-lance writers.
</P>
<P>
   All I knew was that I wanted steady work for awhile; the
Examiner offered it.
</P>
<P>
   Like all new employees, my first few months were officially
probationary. But, by early August, my boss confided that I was a
shoo-in for permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I worry about becoming a hack,'' I wrote in my journal.
``So easy it is to fall into phrases that normally make my stomach
contract. Daily newspaper writing: Blessing or burden?''
</P>
<P>
   Hooo boy. Besides being immature and arrogant, I did not yet
understand the virtues and rewards of daily journalism. I had not
yet fallen in love with newspapering.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I never did FALL in love with it. Rather, like a
mail-order bride, I discovered that an agreement born of necessity
could grow into a deep and lasting passion _ one that somehow
satisfies and arouses at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But it took years. And God knows how many stories. Stories I got
high doing and stories I hated myself (and some assistant city
editor) for having to do.
</P>
<P>
   Never though, even as the hire-date anniversaries piled up, did
I think of myself as committed to this newspaper. I believed I was
a free person who could leave any day I wanted. Able to gather
information and disseminate it in solid, easy-to-read English
sentences, I knew I was eminently employable.
</P>
<P>
   Probably even by somebody who'd pay me a whole lot more money.
</P>
<P>
   And so the years passed. The '70s, '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential administrations came and went. The economy fell and
rose. The earth above the San Andreas and Hayward faults
occasionally moved. And, somewhere along the way, I traded in
Scotch whisky and late nights for a couple of glasses of red wine
and ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the office, friends and lovers took turns starring on
center stage in my heart. All but a few drifted onto the periphery
or into the wings. Some got thrown out of the theater completely.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, five publishers and a couple of football teams worth of
editors took charge, then took a powder. A large handful of
colleagues died _ of cancer, AIDS, heart disease and homicide.
Scores more left in droves, often to work for somebody who found
them eminently employable and paid them a whole lot more money.
</P>
<P>
   New colleagues, usually young, ambitious and 10 times smarter
than I'll ever be, joined up in highly welcomed ones and twos.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced by corporate bottom-liners to a lean diet, the
Examiner ``family'' shrank in size, but somehow never in quality.
Those of us who'd been around awhile (us ``geezers''), joked
sardonically about the family's dysfunctional nature. But we knew
that we could find no better sisters and brothers in anybody's
newsroom anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people,'' I said about a million times. ``The people
I work with still make it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to June 21 and the 24th anniversary of my
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Everything I've learned from 30 years in journalism tells me
there will be no 25th, that _ this time next year _ the San
Francisco Examiner, as I have known it for half my life, will not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's to me and the mail-order husband I have grown to
love. Happy Anniversary to us. It's been one hell of a great run.

&HT;     WHERE TO STAY IN THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY SHATTUCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Hill Country has resorts that will satisfy a wide
variety of vacation objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Bandera, the 543-acre Flying L Guest Ranch
emphasizes a cowboy motif _ yes, horseback riding is a favorite
activity _ but also features an 18-hole championship golf course, a
pro shop, lighted tennis and basketball courts, a swimming pool and
fine dining.
</P>
<P>
   Summer programs for ages 3-12 range from goat roping and calf
scrambles to rock painting and pony rides.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's 41 suites and free-standing villas include bedroom
and sitting room, refrigerator, microwave and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   It's located 1 1/2 miles south of Bandera on Texas 173. Call

</P>
<P>
   Lake Austin Spa Resort is rated a top 10 destination spa by the
Zagat Survey of U.S. Hotels, Resorts and Spas.
</P>

   The resort offers a wide range of programs dedicated to a
healthy lifestyle. Its fourth annual series on healthy cooking,
presented during several weeks through August, features popular
chef Terry Conlan (author of Lean Star Cuisine) and guest chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Guest rooms are scattered about the property, and many afford
views of the lake. Overnight packages can include lodging, three

</P>
<P>
   Canyon of the Eagles Lodge and Nature Park, billed as Texas'
first large eco-resort, occupies 940 acres on the north shore of
Lake Buchanan, northwest of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this preserve with abundant wildlife is a 64-room lodge _
actually an 18-building compound _ where guests unwind in rocking
chairs on porches and watch as birds feed and deer pass nearby.
Naturalists conduct frequent programs, and an observatory
encourages stargazing.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the new home of the Vanishing Texas River Cruise.
Camping and RV facilities are available, as are canoe and kayak
rentals. The lodge offers full-service dining.

   The resort has 148 rooms and suites, all renovated last year.
Other features include a fine-dining restaurant, a pool, a fitness
center, tennis courts and nearby fishing lakes.

   About eight miles northwest of Boerne, the 377-acre Guadalupe
River Ranch offers hiking, horseback riding, tubing, golf
privileges at several area courses, and one of the Hill Country's
most popular full-service spas.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch has 48 guest rooms, and packages include three meals
daily in a restaurant that attracts many area residents.

   SAN ANTONIO _ Looking for an antidote to the early summer heat?
</P>
<P>
   Sink into an antique rocking chair on Aunt Mary's Porch. Float
along the 950-foot Ramblin' River. Saunter down a
three-quarter-mile nature trail, spying for native plants beneath
stately live oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the family fun at the Hyatt Regency Hill
Country Resort, a favorite San Antonio retreat since its debut
seven years ago and now fresh from a $3.5 million enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   More is on the way: A 15,000-square-foot spa, planned for
completion late this year, will include up to 20 private treatment
rooms; lounges with steam, sauna and whirlpool; a lap pool; and a
beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-acre resort, amid wildflower meadows and
limestone-banked creeks 16 miles northwest of downtown San Antonio,
just a short distance from Sea World, has received AAA's
four-diamond rating and Mobil Travel Guide's four-star designation
each year since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational facilities include a challenging 18-hole golf
course designed by Arthur Hills, three tennis courts, volleyball
courts, bicycles available for rent, paths for bikers and joggers,
a health club, Camp Hyatt for ages 3-12, and four acres reserved
for water enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Kids and parents alike enjoy tubing on the Ramblin' River, a
mini-version of experiences on the Guadalupe and other Hill Country
rivers. Two swimming pools are separated by a waterfall. An open
deck is designed for sunbathing.
</P>
<P>
   The resort's 500 guest rooms and suites _ each with new bedding,
carpet, drapes and wall coverings _ are in nine wings that form
scenic courtyards. All rooms have refrigerators, irons and ironing
boards, and coffee makers. Twenty-six rooms are designed for guests
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as ``the finest little ranch house in Texas,'' the main
lobby has comfortable seating beside two fireplaces and opens onto
Aunt Mary's Porch, where many guests relax with or without a glass
of Luckenbach Lemonade (gin, peach schnapps, cranberry juice, and
sweet and sour) or ``Texas tea'' (sweetened with an elixir more
potent than sugar).
</P>
<P>
   Fine dining is available Tuesday through Sunday evenings in
Antler's Lodge. Innovative starters during a recent visit included
a barbecued duck and mango quesadilla ($7.75), rattlesnake fritters
($7.50) and a ravioli of pheasant and foie gras ($8.50). Among
intriguing entrees: a trio of grilled beef medallion,
pumpkin-seed-crusted lamb chop and Texas venison ($28.50).
</P>
<P>
   On the second Friday of each month except December, Antler's
private dining room is the setting for a Winemaker's Dinner. Wine
tastings featuring different regions begin at 7 p.m.; then chefs
offer course-by-course food presentations paired with fine wines.
(Cost is $70, plus gratuity; call 210-520-4037 for reservations.)
The Springhouse Cafe is a winner, too, for breakfast, lunch, dinner
and weekend buffets. Light fare and beverages are served during the
day at Big Ed's Pool House. The General Store stocks deli
sandwiches and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging rates vary depending on season and availability but
generally range from $195 to $365 for deluxe rooms, with suites
starting at $315.
</P>
<P>
   A private wing houses Hyatt's Regency Club services. Golf
packages are available; rates start at $152.50 for one golfer and
$182 for two (each based on double occupancy) and include 18 holes,
cart and daily breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   As at most other resorts, convention business can be brisk; the
resort has more than 27,000 square feet of meeting space.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency Hill Country Resort is located at 9800 Hyatt
Resort Drive, just off the Westside Expressway and a short distance
from Loop 1604. Call the resort directly at 210-647-1234; call
Hyatt Hotels and Resorts at 800-223-1234; or access
www.sanantonio.hyatt.com on the Internet for a useful site with
sample menus, photos and other information.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Powerful solar storms can fry satellites,
disrupt power grids and snarl long-distance communications. This
vulnerability has spawned a new career that is increasingly vital
to power companies, the telecommunications industry and the
military: space weather forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   So new is this job that not everybody believes Craig Sechrest
when he says that is how he earns his pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine some of my family dinners, where my relatives
start talking about their jobs _ say, they're talking about fixing
car motors _ and they ask me, `What do you do?''' said Sechrest,
who works at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
(NOAA) Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them I look at sunspots and geomagnetic activity in the
near-Earth environment. They look at me and say, `Yeah, right!'''
</P>
<P>
   Space weather-casting is increasingly vital in an age when
humanity relies on technologies that are vulnerable to cosmic
hurricanes of radiation and high-speed particles. Satellites, cell
phones, pagers and continent-spanning power grids can be harmed by
the intense energy spawned by these storms.
</P>
<P>
   NOAA, NASA and power companies rely more and more on space
weather forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department guards its satellites, communication
networks and other functions against space storms by operating the
55th Space Weather Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most folks think of space as a vacuum _ you get taught that in
grade school, but in our briefings with our customers, we're
constantly reminding them that space is a hostile environment,''
said Lt. Col. Jeff Carson, the squadron commander whose clients are
the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   During a bad solar storm, military officials ``who use the high
frequency portion of the spectrum, anywhere from 3 to 30 megahertz,
oftentimes will literally be knocked off the air by the X-ray
energy hitting Earth's atmosphere. Those impacts can last anywhere
from several minutes to two hours,'' said Carson, who received his
master's degree in meteorology at the Naval Postgraduate School in
Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, a million miles from Earth, the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite detected two eruptions on
the sun that experts refer to as ``X-Class flares,'' one of which
was associated with a monstrous event called a coronal mass
ejection, when the sun spews out a massive amount of matter at
once. Usually the matter dissipates in space, but occasionally it
heads toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what the public affairs people like to call `a billion
tons of matter moving at a million miles an hour,''' said Joe
Gurman, U.S. project scientist for SOHO, a joint project of the
European Space Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Gurman works at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The June 6 storm wasn't that unusual, as major storms go:
Similar events happen an average of about once a month during
periods of maximum solar activity. Periods of ``solar maximum,''
like now, occur once every 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The June 6 storm could have been worse. Space weather
forecasters have not forgotten the ``Titanics'' of their young
profession, like the massive power failure in Quebec that was
triggered by a solar storm in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger electrical collapse might occur nowadays because
utilities increasingly rely on electricity shared over power grids
thousands of miles long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regularly monitor solar activity,'' said Staci Homrig of
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric in San Francisco. The utility compares
NOAA's reports of solar activities with the performance of PG&AMP;E
lines: ``We know the symptoms. We're watching for them and we
believe it's not impacting our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Space scientists constantly monitor solar activity through
deep-space satellites such as ACE, the Advanced Composition
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley are
helping NASA develop another sun-watching satellite, called HESSI
for High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. It is scheduled for
launch in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Both ACE and HESSI are primarily scientific missions that aim to
better understand the sun and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   But their observations augment alerts of solar storms from other
sources, including military satellites and the Air Force's global
network of ground-based solar observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Space forecasting is a sign of the times. ``As we become a more
technologically dependent culture, we have more and more
technological systems that are affected by space weather,'' Gurman
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added wryly: ``The people who develop space
satellites for pager communications will never admit that space
weather is to blame (for failures), because that's an `act of God'
and you don't get insurance for that.''

nonwhites holding the top political jobs in Washington state. The
others are Gary Locke, the nation's first and only Chinese-American
governor, and Norm Rice, Seattle's mayor, who is black. Sims is a
natural storyteller with a compelling one to offer, a bootstrap
tale about a journey from anger to open arms. Yet his friends and
advisers have long urged him to keep a large part of that story _
race _ bottled up. What people want to hear are his views on
property taxes, traffic growth and salmon. On this day, however,
Sims has been asked to say something in honor of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., and he is tempted, he says, to let them see the
whole man. But do they really want to hear what it is like for a
black politician to live in two worlds? By Timothy Egan.

   CHECKED OUT
</P>
<P>
   Q: I met a man who does research for large organizations at a
library that allows you to request 12 periodicals a day. To
circumvent this rule, he pays Russian immigrants a few dollars to
submit his requests in their names, violating the spirit of the
regulations and the minimum-wage laws. What is my ethical
obligation to the immigrants, who must need the money?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Hoke, Washington
</P>
<P>
   A: To cheat a library, that noble institution of democracy, and
to exploit poor immigrants are indeed unethical acts, but are you
certain this is happening? If those Russians are his research
assistants, their requests are as legitimate as anyone's. And do
you really know their pay scale?
</P>
<P>
   If your suspicions can be confirmed, you should tell the
immigrants about the minimum-wage laws and the librarian about the
request-slip laundering. The library can decide if the Russians are
inconveniencing other patrons; the immigrants can think about
pushing for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   I'd hold off on calling the cops. Some researchers have had it
worse. In George Gissing's 1891 novel, ``New Grub Street,'' Marian
Yule describes her job: ``The readers who sat here at the radiating
desks, what were they but hapless flies caught in a huge web, its
nucleus the great circle of the Catalogue. Darker, darker. From the
tower wall of volumes seemed to emanate visible motes, intensifying
the obscurity; in a moment the book-lined circumference of the room
would be but a featureless prison-limit.'' If you spot anything
like that, then call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Out to dinner, my wife and I became helplessly distracted by
blaring radio commercials. I had noticed the tuner in the back on
my way to the restroom, so I took the liberty of changing the
station to a commercial-free channel. My wife thinks I should have
asked someone who worked at the restaurant to change the station
rather than take matters into my own hands, but I think it was
simpler and faster just to do it myself. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   _ Matthew Johnson, Andice, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Your dispute seems more about etiquette than ethics, and it
is one in which I side with your wife. You're certainly free to ask
the restaurant manager to turn the radio down, or off, or to be
switched to another station, but you have no right to impose your
own taste on your fellow diners. Similarly, if the color of the
walls offends you, you may complain, but you may not pull out a
roller and a dropcloth and start redecorating. Someone else's
restaurant; someone else's call.
</P>
<P>
   While it may indeed be simpler and faster to take matters _ and
the radio dial _ into your own hands, that's not much of a defense.
If an action is inapt, performing it more swiftly does not augment
its benevolence. I'm just as reluctant to be robbed by a fast thief
as by a dawdler.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant's running commercial radio (or even those ``Car
Talk'' guys) may be annoying, but it is not unethical. Short of
cranking up the volume high enough to make your ears bleed, the
restaurant is free to pollute the audio environment any way it
likes. Because something is unpleasant needn't mean it is
unethical.
</P>
<P>
   That said, while your pre-emptive strike on the radio dial is
impolite, it is not particularly unethical. You harmed no one, and
should they desire it, the restaurateurs can easily switch back to
all-commercials, all-the-time radio. However, you may want to
reconsider the wisdom of offending the people who are about to
prepare your food.

U.S. AND CHINA WILL COOPERATE IN FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United States and China agreed Monday to step up
their cooperation against the production and smuggling of illegal
drugs, especially heroin and methamphetamine, which have emerged as
scourges in both countries and throughout much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, U.S. and Chinese law enforcement
agencies have sometimes cooperated to stop contraband drug
shipments. But on Monday the two governments signed their first
legal agreement to share information and evidence related to drug
smuggling, and officials from both sides predicted more
wide-ranging collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced here by Barry R. McCaffrey, the
retired army general who directs the White House office of national
drug control policy. McCaffrey is visiting China with counter-drug
officials from several U.S. agencies as part of an eight-day tour
that will also take them to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important moment,'' McCaffrey said after two days
of talks with Chinese officials. He said such collaboration was
vital to combatting global heroin trafficking and the fast-rising
abuse of methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Since China began to open its borders in the late 1970s, it has
become a major transit route for heroin produced in southeast Asia,
especially Myanmar, the former Burma. Some of that heroin is
shipped by ethnic-Chinese gangs to the United States, although the
bulk of the heroin sold in the United States now comes from Latin
America, primarily Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling has engendered rising heroin addiction inside
China, especially in the southern province of Yunnan and in the
western region of Xinjiang, which receives heroin smuggled from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCaffrey's office, factories in southeast China
are important producers of methamphetamine, which is sold
throughout East Asia, and of ephedrine, the ingredient used to
produce methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey listed several areas in which the United States hopes
to gain China's cooperation, including the sharing of strategic
intelligence about drug operations, money laundering, control of
precursor chemicals like ephedrine and of the weapons that make
their way to drug gangs, and on the analysis of seized drugs to
identify their sources.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which last year stationed a Drug Enforcement
Administration agent in Beijing, had also proposed opening a
Federal Bureau of Investigation office in China, but it has not
received an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Fengrui, director of drugs at China's Ministry of Public
Security, who appeared with McCaffrey Monday, said he believed
Sino-American cooperation ``is going to enter a new stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years ago in the Opium Wars, China was victimized,
and we can never forget that pain,'' Yang said, recalling an era
when Britain and other colonial European powers forced a defeated
China to accept opium.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yang said China was ready to work with the United States to
solve drug cases and control precursor chemicals and to exchange
samples from seized drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has repeatedly praised China's government for
making serious anti-drug efforts. McCaffrey said Monday that he did
not question the determination of Chinese officials to fight drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised China, which has been embarrassed by drug
scandals in international athletic competitions, for participating
in a new global agency to combat the use of performance-enhancing
drugs in sports.

 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ It was a grand experiment, if maybe not the
clever promotional idea it must have seemed: At a technology
conference here attended by a bevy of companies and hundreds of
investors, every attendee received a free Internet-equipped
Ericsson cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a chance for investors to experiment with
the new technology, to measure its potency hands on _ not to
mention spurring the investors to plow money into some of the
companies building applications and hardware for the latest
generation of handsets.
</P>
<P>
   But it became clear quite quickly to the people who received the
free phones that for all the hype about wireless application
protocol, or WAP, ``m-commerce'' and even the buzzword mouthful,
B-to-B m-commerce, the technology is still far from ready to
attract a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to call my secretary and ask her what happened
to the market today,'' said a French banker after fitfully pounding
the phone's buttons for 10 minutes to check the latest stock
figures. ``I can do it in half the time, and it will be
significantly less painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The phones were not a complete bomb, though. Many investors
seemed to enjoy the ``gee whiz'' nature of the devices, considering
them a precursor of what is to come. And there is a lot on tap,
even if it will not become a mass-market reality for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ready for prime time in a long way,''
acknowledged Gareth Hughes, managing director of Psion, the British
maker of hand-held devices, which is beginning to develop products
based on the wireless protocol. ``As much as I hate to say it, much
of what's out there is likely to disappoint the market with the
hype that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hughes described a science-fiction-like future that
he argued is only a year or two away from reality in Europe, where
the percentage of people who use mobile phones is much higher than
it is in the United States. His company is developing devices for
both white-collar and blue-collar work forces that will allow for a
variety of transactions and data exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   He waxed on about hand-held devices for doctors that will allow
them to pull up patients' records in real time with zoomable views
of X-rays and other diagrams. He demonstrated a hand-held device
that will allow corporate users to log on to a corporate network
and make a major stock trade on behalf of institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he said, BMW sales representatives in Germany use a
wireless Psion device that allows them to call up car
specifications and other data. The service may be slow now, but as
wireless broadband, or high-speed Internet connections over the
phone, rolls out _ still at least five years away in Europe,
according to most estimates _ car shoppers will be able to look at
a BMW catalog on a hand-held device and then design their own cars
while driving inside test models. And they will pay by beaming bank
details to the salesman, if Hughes has his way.
</P>
<P>
   That will just be the beginning. According to Motorola, one of
the largest manufacturers of mobile phones, making phone calls on a
hand-held device will be only one tiny function. The devices will
be used as credit cards, to pay for a meal at a restaurant or
groceries at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The devices will also have a business-to-business angle: Workers
will be able to buy things with the device using the digital
equivalent of a corporate credit card and be able to receive a
reimbursement approval almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Lynch, the chairman and chief executive of the
Autonomy Corp., an Internet software company, said that mobile
devices would go even one step further than the supermarket
example. He is working with clients who are developing devices and
software that will allow shoppers to scan a product's bar code in a
store and immediately display a list of other vendors selling the
same product and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will change the whole experience,'' he said. ``It will be
even more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   By tracking the location of customers' phones, stores and
restaurants will be able to alert customers who are in the
neighborhood to sales and specials they are running. Several
companies are even developing systems that would effectively alert
people if friends were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on that theme is another product in development that
would play matchmaker of sorts by issuing an alert when a possible
suitor with similar interests is nearby based on a questionnaire
both people would fill out beforehand. The company says that it is
aware of the potential perils and that the system will be
anonymous, with built-in mechanisms to avoid stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making payments for movie or airline tickets, mobile
devices will also act as a key to get into homes and offices, a
garage-door opener and identification device for all sorts of
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It may all sound fanciful, but it is coming, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 24 months will be the test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robin Saxby, chairman and chief executive of ARM Holdings,
one of the leading designers of microprocessors for hand-held
devices, still thinks m-commerce _ B-to-B or not _ is still a bit
of a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take at least 10 years to get it right,'' he said,
making reference to the free phone he received at the conference.
``Come on. These things just don't work.''

<P>
   Pick a movie, any movie _ not one with Julia Roberts, but
something out of the mainstream that you know you would have one
chance in 1,000 of finding in the average video store. Something
like ``The Cranes Are Flying,'' Mikhail Kalatozov's acclaimed 1957
film about tangled love in wartime Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Or choose anything old, foreign, obscure or rare _ D.W.
Griffith's ``Female of the Species'' with Mary Pickford and Lillian
Gish, ``The Communist Weapon of Allure'' or the western ``Rio
Rattler.''
</P>
<P>
   On foot or horseback, it would take hours to scour video stores
to buy such items. On the Web, the hunt could be over in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You will usually need a half-dozen places to look. Take
``Cranes'' as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers would go straight to Amazon.com, the 800-pound
gorilla of online video sales. Amazon carries 100,000 video titles
and, according to a report by Alexander &AMP; Associates, a Manhattan
consulting firm that follows the industry, accounted for almost 50
percent of online video sales in the last quarter of 1999. The site
also includes an auction of rare and hard-to-find videos.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is linked to the immense Internet Movie Data Base,
www.imdb.com, which does not sell videos directly but is an
annotated index of 230,000 films from around the world, a total
that rises by the hour. On that database is a complete description
of ``The Cranes Are Flying.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the interactive nature of many video sites on
the Web, the database lets movie fans write reviews. Robert De
Saint-Loup of Balbec, France, writes, ``In its subsuming of vast
social, national and world events to a love affair, it is
essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the ``Cranes'' entry is a box that links the user to
Amazon.com, but a balloon states that the movie is not available
from Amazon. So the search continues.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest site in terms of revenue, Familywonder.com _
with 11.3 percent of the Web video market _ is basically for
children and their parents. Not the likeliest source for
``Cranes,'' though it does offer foreign films, in addition to
animated, live-action and horror productions, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The third-largest site, Reel.com, a general, all-service source
that is owned by Hollywood Video, the nation's second-largest chain
after Blockbuster, doesn't have the movie. Nor does
Blockbuster.com.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-largest site, the online auction house eBay _ 5.5
percent of the market _ had 1,874 foreign films up for bids
recently, but ``Cranes'' wasn't among them. You could have bid on a
``rare'' edition of Pedro Almodovar's ``Matador,'' however, which
stood at $25 with nine days and 12 hours left on the block.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-largest site, Bigstar.com, whose home page says it has
80,000 titles, listed ``Cranes'' and gave some particulars _ but
it, too, did not have the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cranes'' was available from two well-known sites, however. The
site for Movies Unlimited, www.moviesunlimited.com, had the tape
for $47.49, down from $49.99. At Facets International,
www.facets.org, ``Cranes'' was listed at $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Of the sites checked, only these two had the film. Several
others noted for deep collections, including www.kimsvideo.com, an
arm of the famous New York video store, and Tlavideo.com, which
belongs to the Philadelphia-based chain and mail-order company, did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Movies Unlimited, also in Philadelphia, and Facets
International, in Chicago, publish catalogs of 40,000 to 45,000
titles, sprinkled with tapes even seasoned videophiles probably
haven't heard of. They have huge inventories of foreign and
art-house movies, along with large and eclectic collections in
every genre, from cult and horror to silent film, American
independents, all kinds of retro television and the performing and
fine arts. Facets has an extensive collection of foreign cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites look for the unusual, often title by title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make an effort to track down the stuff,'' says Irv Slifkin
of Movies Unlimited. ``We deal with hundreds of independents and
small companies. Often we deal with one person who owns the
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment he was pleased to be able to list ``Incubus,''
the 1965 horror film directed by Leslie Stevens and featuring
William Shatner speaking Esperanto.
</P>
<P>
   Even Facets didn't have that one. But Amazon did. ``Our price:
$34.95,'' the entry read.
</P>
<P>
   As the largest site, Amazon attracts videos from all quarters,
including hundreds of tapes from fledgling independent movie makers
offered in Amazon Advantage, a special section on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Like Facets, Movies Unlimited and most other sites, Amazon
quickly leads clients to related titles. Customers who bought
``Incubus'' at Amazon, the site says, also bought ``Blood Feast''
(1963), ``Macbeth'' (1978) and ``Black Sunday'' (1960) on DVD. Four
similar titles were suggested by Facets.org, including ``The
Devil's Nightmare'' (1971), Jean Brismee's ``slice of demented
Belgian-Italian sleaze.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD buyers may need an extra push to start browsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD households tend to be more tech-savvy, so it's more of a
planned purchase,'' says Greg Durkin, Alexander &AMP; Associates' video
research director. ``People go to Reel or Amazon and type in the
title. It's the same with books and music.''
</P>
<P>
   From that, retailers hope, something else catches the eye of
customers, leading to the impulse purchase. Studios spend a lot on
banner ads, ever flashing and changing. Buyers looking up one title
spot others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Why don't I just go ahead and buy it, if it's
discounted that much?''' Durkin says.
</P>
<P>
   And how much is that? Prices vary widely and often deceptively
online. At the end of 1999, Amazon had an average price of $24.97.
Familywonder.com's was $12.83, Reel &QC; .com's $15.23, eBay's $20.32
and Bigstar.com's $12.25.
</P>
<P>
   Sites regularly trumpet savings of ``30 to 40 percent.'' A young
market, video e-commerce accounted for only 2.2 percent of overall
cassette sales and 9.6 percent of DVD sales in the fourth quarter
of 1999, and players jockeying for market share often lower prices
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   But for new mainstream titles, shoppers are often better off
buying at the video store. If price is the main consideration, shop
around various sites but remember: The average price paid for a
video on the Web, according to Alexander &AMP; Associates, was $19.25
at the end of last year, compared with $14.25 in stores. Thank
shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say that cutting prices below cost will thin
out video e-commerce, and that many sites will fail or be
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video and DVD are low-margin commodity products,'' says Carrie
Johnson, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will only get bigger, Johnson says. So, too, in all
likelihood, will sites related to the big store chains and solidly
established mail-order operations such as Facets, Movies Unlimited
and TLA.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry about the movies _ there will always be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Shatner in Esperanto,'' Slifkin says.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another ``read my lips'' from a Bush?
 &HT;    For release June 21, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think George W would have learned from daddy's mistake.
But when the presidential candidate, seeking to participate in the
GOP's newest anti-administration, politically motivated maelstrom,
told a Florida audience last weekend that our nuclear secrets will
be secret again in his administration, he was mirroring his
father's ``read my lips, no new taxes'' boast that came to bury his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely: ``I'll bring this sorry chapter to a close. In my
administration, our national labs will be secure again, our vital
information will be sealed again, our nuclear secrets will be
secret again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some campaign promises just can't be kept and George W ought to
know better than to vouch that no similar problem will haunt his
presidency _ if he's elected. Say you'll do everything possible to
ensure that it doesn't happen but don't guarantee it; it's
foolhardy to do so, as the senior Bush found out.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the Super Bowl and George W isn't Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the misplaced computer hard-drives at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory has brought drool to the lips of the
political savages of Capitol Hill. They are calling for the head of
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, I presume in the context of ``the
buck stops here'' guideline set down by Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   But if that be the case, then how come Caspar Weinberger
remained secretary of defense for Ronald Reagan when 247 U.S.
Marines were blown to bits in a horrific breach of security in
Lebanon? And that's not the only one the GOP guard dogs ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when it became public that security had been breached
in the theft of nuclear secrets being passed to China, the GOP
mercenaries targeted the Clinton administration as being jelly when
it came to nuclear secrets. What was odd about it was that the
secrets were stolen during the Reagan and Bush presidencies as
well.
</P>
<P>
   As GOP senators and representatives harangued the Clinton
administration for not cracking down on something that had been
investigated for almost three years, someone reminded Sen. Trent
Lott that it was on Reagan's and Bush's watch that most of the
thefts took place. He responded, incredulously, that he was not
going to dwell on the past, but wanted to know what's being done
now about correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how serious is the Los Alamos crisis, and neither
did all those Republicans who spent last weekend bellowing on
network TV, including Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) who called for
Richardson's resignation. There is much more to be learned,
including whether the secrets were compromised at all.
</P>
<P>
   But we are in an era of intense political fury. In a capital
where no secret is ever safe, where leaks are more like waterfalls,
partisan politics will turn on the slightest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As if money-raising and slush funds were not enough to sicken
the general public, the political combat is getting more disgusting
by the moment. There is no working bi-partisan government anymore,
just partisan acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   There is little the Democratic administration has done, or has
not done, that has not resulted in some call by the GOP for an
investigation or a resignation.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does get elected, can we expect a similar reaction from
the Democratic partisans during his administration? I'm afraid so.
They likely will watch his every step -- and misstep -- and clamor
for investigations in an act of political revenge; a vicious chain
that may have its eye-for-an-eye roots in the partisan-driven 1987
Democratic rejection of Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And should Gore reach the presidency, then Lott and his folks
will continue to behave as they do today.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the real examination of breaches such as happened
at Los Alamos (if it happened) is driven not by professional
inquiry but more by political penchant, by public opinion based on
poisoned positions _ and by obtuse statements by presidential
candidates who should know better.
</P>
<P>
   We know where the buck stops _ Harry told us so _ but how many
are passing it around maliciously on the way up?

 &HT;    Cell phone insanity is spreading, so here are some rules
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man was obviously insane, maybe dangerously so,
waving his arms, speaking loudly as he walked alone along the
street on a dusky evening near the newspaper where I work.
</P>
<P>
   As near as I could tell he was either excited about a baseball
game or explaining to no one in particular that he intended to buy
bread on the way home.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw the tiny wire leading from the cell phone and the
microphone and earpiece. He was having a cellular phone
conversation as he walked. To avoid scaring folks such as myself,
maybe he should get a sign: ``Not crazy, just talking on the cell
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   There are very few times that I need to have long conversations
while walking down the street, now that they have the medication
right. But seemingly normal people who have homes and families are
walking the streets, talking about the darnedest things. It's
because of those danged low cell phone rates and free airtime
offers.
</P>
<P>
   I yearn for the days when the only people having monologues were
wearing three jackets and mismatched shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the only danger from cell phone addicts. If they
don't kill you on the road, they'll drive you crazy in the
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Just this morning on the elevator at work, a fellow standing 8
inches away from me was explaining to his wife why his golf round
lasted 18 hours on Saturday. It was obvious, from listening to his
end of the conversation, that she wasn't buying. He would have been
better off spending enough time getting a better story together.
From what I could hear, he was finding out in a personal way that
cell phones can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   There are other dangers, too.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine at work got a strange call the other day. Her
phone rang and _ instead of hearing someone say hello _ she was
listening to a heated discussion at a business meeting. Turns out
that her boyfriend had his phone in his hip pocket and _ by
squirming just right _ hit the button that re-dialed her work
number.
</P>
<P>
   No harm was done, it was just funny, but you don't have to be a
genius to see how an accidental call like that could be downright
awful under the wrong circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seem to have more cellular airtime than they have
something to say. Now I get calls from friends, driving in their
cars, who want to ask me if I've seen the latest model of the Ford
Explorer, or to muse about what they plan to have for dinner. Now
that free long-distance calling is part of most plans, I keep
hearing from folks all over the country who want to tell me about
the traffic jam that they've encountered in Cincinnati or about
their dog's medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a wonderful thing, but it's just about to bore me
to death.
</P>
<P>
   So today, at the risk of hurting your feelings, let's talk about
how to act right. Think of it as Husted's Rules for Cellular
Etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1. If you are so busy that you have to make and take calls
on the golf course, in the movies and other places where decent
folk are trying to get away from it all, then you are too busy to
have fun. Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2. Turn the danged thing off when you go to church, the
movies or a play. That weird nee-nah, nee-nah sound frightens
children and annoys adults.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3. Unless you are having a really interesting conversation
_ something that could be turned into a soap opera _ don't have it
within my earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 4. If you really don't have anything to say and simply
enjoy making calls, get a job as a motel switchboard operator.
</P>
<P>
   And please, if you disagree, send an e-mail. Don't call me using
your cellular phone.

hearing from folks all over the country who want to tell me about
the traffic jam that they've encountered in Cincinnati or about
their dog's medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a wonderful thing, but it's just about to bore me
to death.
</P>
<P>
   So today, at the risk of hurting your feelings, let's talk about
how to act right. Think of it as Husted's Rules for Cellular
Etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 1. If you are so busy that you have to make and take calls
on the golf course, in the movies and other places where decent
folk are trying to get away from it all, then you are too busy to
have fun. Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 2. Turn the danged thing off when you go to church, the
movies or a play. That weird nee-nah, nee-nah sound frightens
children and annoys adults.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 3. Unless you are having a really interesting conversation
_ something that could be turned into a soap opera _ don't have it
within my earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 4. If you really don't have anything to say and simply
enjoy making calls, get a job as a motel switchboard operator.
</P>
<P>
   And please, if you disagree, send an e-mail. Don't call me using
your cellular phone.

FOUR YEARS AFTER GUERIN KILLING, CRIME GROWS IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Four years ago, Veronica Guerin, a reporter whose work
shone a relentless light on this country's burgeoning underworld,
was shot dead as she sat in her car at a traffic light, and Ireland
was changed, changed utterly.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, organized crime was all but ignored and gangland
leaders operated with relative impunity. But while laws aimed at
the underworld have been toughened and those who murdered Guerin
have been brought to justice, the problems she exposed have only
gotten worse. Ireland is awash in drugs, and organized crime,
despite unprecedented pressure by police, has never been more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Guerin, who worked for the Sunday Independent,
has been forgotten. With the fourth anniversary of her murder
coming on June 26, a memorial to her was recently unveiled on the
Trinity College campus. Last month in Boston, the Vienna-based
International Press Institute honored Guerin. And Friday, a film
based on the last few years of her life, ``When the Sky Falls,''
opened in Dublin and London.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four years since her murder, the number of heroin
addicts in Dublin has nearly doubled to about 13,000, health
officials say. Drug pushers have slashed the price of heroin and
junkies can get a fix for about $5, the cheapest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Junkies walk the streets aimlessly or lounge bleary-eyed in city
parks and public places. One day last week, a couple of addicts lay
passed out, in an unconscious embrace, on a bench outside the
Financial Services center at the mouth of the River Liffey, a
temple to Ireland's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin, 38 at the time of her death, exposed the venality of
Dublin's gangsters, the obscene profits they were making by turning
one generation after another into heroin-addicted zombies, and the
seeming inability of the Irish authorities to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   For that she was first shot in the leg as a warning, then, when
she would not back off, assassinated. In response to the public
outrage at her murder, which cost Ireland its most courageous
reporter and a 6-year-old boy his mother, the government passed
sweeping laws allowing authorities to seize the assets of anyone
who cannot explain where he got his money.
</P>
<P>
   The Garda Siochana, Ireland's national police force, carried out
the biggest criminal investigation in the history of the Irish
Republic, which led to the arrest and conviction of several men who
carried out her murder.
</P>
<P>
   The underworld leader who allegedly ordered her murder, John
Gilligan, will soon go on trial, and there seems little doubt that
he will spend the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the war over Northern Ireland winds down, the battle
over the lucrative narcotics trade has heated up. Police resources
that used to be spent on antiterrorism are now devoted to combating
drugs. But it is a Sisyphean task. Many Irish gangsters have moved
to the Netherlands, where the use of some narcotics is
decriminalized, and police are not as aggressive in going after
drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cusack, who covers law enforcement for The Irish Times, said
the laws created after Guerin's murder have helped the police seize
more than $20 million in criminal assets, but have not curtailed
the influence of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The gangsters who killed Guerin hoped they would silence other
reporters as well. To some extent, they have, said Emily O'Reilly,
who wrote a book about the murder and its aftermath. Guerin was
famous for confronting criminals face to face. No one has done that
since, said O'Reilly, who says such restraint is a sign of prudent,
not frightened, journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Her book, ``The Life and Death of a Crime Reporter,'' was
critical of Guerin for taking what O'Reilly considered unnecessary
risks and personalizing journalistic attacks on reputed criminals.
But O'Reilly reserved special condemnation for Guerin's editors at
the Sunday Independent, whom O'Reilly accuses of not doing enough
to dissuade Guerin from risking her life even as they failed to buy
her a life insurance policy. The newspaper eventually gave Guerin's
husband a large lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Guerin was killed, her replacement, Liz Allen,
scaled a fence to confront Gilligan's wife at home, and he later
called Allen to deny involvement in the murder. O'Reilly said Allen
has since been advised by her editors not to engage in the kind of
confrontations that made Guerin famous.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Kealy, the Sunday Independent's deputy editor and news
editor, denied that he or other editors had ordered Allen to steer
clear of criminals. But he acknowledged that Guerin's murder
changed the way editors assess the risks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were careful with Veronica,'' Kealy insisted. ``And there
are things we can do to protect Liz.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Guerin felt the need to confront criminals in person
to get their side of the story is that Ireland's strict libel laws
make it legally risky to cast aspersions in print, even on
gangsters. There has been no political groundswell to change the
laws, Cusack argues, because they benefit politicians who do not
have to worry about scrutiny of their personal lives or of the
widespread corruption plaguing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new movie and the renewed focus on Guerin's life have
encouraged antidrug activists in some of Dublin's poorest
neighborhoods. At a special screening of the film, Sadie Grace, who
coordinates the Dublin Citywide Antidrugs Campaign, asked for a
moment's silence to remember Guerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are being killed on a weekly basis here and
nobody cares,'' said Grace. ``If the government cared the way
Veronica Guerin cared, we wouldn't be having the deaths we're
having.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie O'Kane, a reporter for The Guardian, a leading British
newspaper, does not think that the authorities' inability to curb
the kind of crime that Guerin put in the spotlight is a slight to
her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read the autobiography of Martha Gellhorn, who was
Ernest Hemingway's companion, and it made me think of Veronica,''
O'Kane said. ``When she was in her 80s, Gellhorn pondered her own
legacy, concluding that while maybe not one word she wrote had made
any difference, that was nothing to regret. Her duty, she said, was
to try to make a difference. And Veronica tried. God knows,
Veronica tried.''

CYBERPRIVACY CATCHES THE EYE OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of piecemeal proposals to safeguard
personal information on the Internet, Congress is beginning to
seriously address the concept of ``online privacy.'' It is
considering an array of legislation that could dramatically
increase the rights of consumers who release personal details into
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 privacy bills are pending in the House and Senate, and
the idea of privacy, registering in the polls as a top concern
among Americans, is also making its way into the presidential
debate. Democrats and Republicans are touting the same goal:
Reassuring the public that private information, from CD purchases
to medical records, will not be misused.
</P>
<P>
   Although few expect any laws to pass this year _ and skeptics
view many of the current efforts as part of an election-year ploy _
the proposals have begun gaining momentum in recent weeks, through
congressional hearings, federal studies, and informal political
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican champions of e-commerce, including
legislators who oppose a sales tax on the Internet, are
contemplating whether new laws are needed to control the
trafficking of consumer information online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that some of the practices on
the Internet are not what most Americans would want done with their
private information,'' said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John
S. McCain, an Arizona Republican who held privacy hearings last
week and is shaping online privacy legislation of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The current political debate divides along deceptively simple
lines: Should consumers have to ``opt out,'' informing companies
that they would rather not have their personal information divulged
elsewhere? Should online companies have to ask permission first,
requiring customers to ``opt in'' to a consent agreement that frees
their information for use in the public domain? Or should the
current system, in which information moves through cyberspace
virtually unrestricted, remain intact?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the political issue is broader and more complicated,
affecting information exchanges on and off the Internet. Also, it
is fertile political ground, touching on common anxieties among
average Americans about what happens when they share their names
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-marketing firms have always kept dossiers on consumer
habits in order to target people for specific products. The
Internet makes that process easier and more immediate. Consumers
who browse the Web now have their habits tracked, thanks to small
files known as ``cookies'' that are transferred from certain Web
sites to the consumer's computer hard drive while the user is
online. The cookies create a roadmap of the user's online browsing
habits, allowing companies to compile information on what the
consumer is interested in looking at and buying. Although cookies
can be removed from a user's hard drive, people who intentionally
disable their computer's ability to accept cookies are often denied
access to some Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered by using cookies allows advertisers to
know whom to pursue, an efficient marketing device that industry
leaders say is part of what keeps the Internet free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a great deal is at stake for online companies, some
of which have based their success on the ability to gather consumer
information freely in cyberspace. Many leading online firms say
they are worried about consumer confidence enough to help them
ensure their privacy , and see political motivations behind the
current flurry of privacy discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Even some companies that would be largely unhampered by federal
regulation are not convinced it would work. Daniel Jay, chief
technology officer of Engage, an Andover firm that has developed
privacy software allowing online marketers to track consumers
anonymously, said it would be ``preferable to figure out how to do
it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer that a combination of technology and
self-regulation is the only practical solution,'' Jay said. ``How
do we hire enough policemen to police the Net?''
</P>
<P>
   That position leaves many legislators in Washington pulled by
opposing forces: consumers, who say they favor greater protections,
and Internet companies, which insist they cannot flourish in a
regulated environment and promise to eventually protect consumer
privacy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, most legislators say they support privacy
protections. The two leadiing presidential candidates have come out
in favor of the general idea of privacy in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, is a
self-described ``privacy rights person,'' according to a spokesman.
Vice President Al Gore has been more explicit about his views.
According to an account of his meeting with the New York Times
editorial board meeting last week, Gore said consumers should be
able to expect that personal information ``will remain private
unless they affirmatively give up that right,'' a strict
interpretation of the current privacy bills under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Gore held a press conference to announce
that he would ``protect personal privacy'' by making the sale of
Social Security numbers illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to unveil a detailed privacy platform by November.
</P>
<P>
   But the political debate is often muddied because all sides say
they want privacy rights for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   How to achieve that is the dilemma for many legislators,
especially because the answer may involve technological advances on
the Internet, a medium most politicians have only begun to
understand themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of confusion,'' said Robert Ellis Smith,
publisher of Privacy Journal, a Providence, R.I. newsletter that
examines privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest fear politicians have. Politicians say, `Oh
my gosh, I don't understand the Internet, I don't want to be
charged with killing it,' '' said Representative Edward J. Markey,
Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, including Markey, have advocated federal
privacy regulation for years. Many also believe privacy rules
should vary, depending on what information is at stake. Release of
financial and medical records, for example, has drawn intense
attention.
</P>
<P>
   One financial services bill in particular has come under
scrutiny: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill of 1999, which approved giant
banking mergers, but also gave consumers the option of opting out
of information-sharing agreements. Under the bill, a bank that
merges with an insurance firm would be allowed to pool the checking
account information of its customers with the new subsidiary,
unless individual customers actively request the bank not disclose
such details.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates see that system as weak, placing too much
burden on customers to read confusing legal notifications and
locate opt-out features on a Web site. To toughen the standard,
several bills, two of them sponsored by Markey, have been
introduced: bills requiring an opt-in model for banking and medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several states, including Massachusetts, are
considering enacting privacy laws to safeguard consumers while
Congress continues its debate. But advocates of stricter privacy
protections at the state level say that a federal standard would be
preferable to a hodge-podge of state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boundaries, in our world, are sort of irrelevant lately, with
the global economy,'' said Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift, who supports an opt-in model for the most sensitive records.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who prides herself on being a champion of privacy rights,
this year served on a Federal Trade Commission panel that led to
one of the most scathing congressional reports on the lack of
online privacy. Saying that only 20 percent of online companies
conform to four commonly accepted standards _ notifying consumers
of how information will be used, giving consumers a choice in the
matter, making security practices clear, and allowing consumers
access to their own records for correction or deletion _ the FTC
recommended that Congress act on privacy legislation. That report
has added momentum to the political privacy debate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate seems to be everywhere in Washington these days. Two
hearings were held in Congress last week. Dozens of privacy bills
are expected to be unveiled before the end of the year. Among them
is a proposal by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachussetts,
to require a minimal effort by companies: disclosing privacy
policies on Web sites. Kerry's proposal also calls for a 12-month
privacy commission to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, companies like Engage are continuing to develop
software to keep consumer identities separate from their marketing
habits, a practice that allows targeted advertising without
compromising privacy. Nearly a dozen Web sites have sprung up
solely to provide privacy to consumers, allowing users to surf the
Web through a third-party site that shields their identities.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry leaders hope the delay in Washington will buy
enough time for online companies to solve the privacy issue
themselves. But the growing political drumbeat is unlikely to
subside before November, and privacy advocates are hoping that will
draw support for legislation by next year. They also believe the
concept of privacy will become increasingly easy for Americans to
understand, even if the technology involved is not.

BUSH AND GORE'S LIFE-OR-DEATH ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although both Al Gore and George W. Bush are strong supporters
of the death penalty, the related controversies could make the
consequences of capital punishment one of the more interesting
issues in this presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   With the sharp increase in public awareness of DNA testing,
which could truly determine whether inmates on death row were
guilty or innocent of the crime for which they were convicted, the
political dynamics linked to the death penalty could create
meaningful differences on this issue between the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for Gore, who falls behind Bush in the polls
when voters are asked who is the toughest on crime, the issue of
whether innocent people are put to death under capital punishment
can be turned in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt neither Gore nor any other presidential candidate these
days can afford to be portrayed as being against the death penalty,
which is akin to being soft on crime in the eyes of most voters.
</P>
<P>
   The last presidential candidate to oppose the death penalty was
former Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, and that was one of
the issues that worked against him in his unsuccessful bid for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest polls showing that 73 percent of Americans favor
the death penalty, it would almost certainly be the end of Gore's
campaign if he switched his position.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he endorsed the death penalty only for the most heinous
murders, he still might be putting his ``tough on crime'' stance at
risk. Of those polled 38 percent say the death penalty should be
applied only to the most brutal murders or to mass murders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are related areas where the candidates can venture
without being perceived as soft on the death penalty, and thus soft
on crime. Both candidates, for example, support wider access to DNA
testing for the accused or the convicted to reduce, if not
eliminate, the chances of wrongful executions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently gave a boost to the compassionate side of his
theme of being a self-described ``compassionate conservative.'' He
made a last-minute decision to stay a highly publicized execution
to give time to perform advanced DNA testing to determine whether
the condemned man raped as well as murder his victim. The rape
conviction mandated the death penalty in this case.
</P>
<P>
   This move did not soften Bush's support of the death penalty. He
has said before and since that decision that he firmly believes
that only the guilty have been executed after a fair trial, despite
recent disclosures that some of the convicted received shoddy
defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is an area where Gore could make a difference. A recently
published 10-year study by Columbia University showed that
two-thirds of all death sentences across the nation are overturned
on appeal, mostly because of poor defense or overzealous
prosecution. This study further heightens concern even among
staunch death penalty supporters that the innocent can be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George Ryan brought that concern home earlier this
year when he placed a moratorium on executions after new evidence
cleared several inmates on death row in his state. Ryan, a
Republican, made the move regardless of any potential political
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   With overturned death sentences, clearing of inmates on death
row, and the advanced science of DNA testing, there is an
ever-increasing feeling among the populace that, despite their
support of the death penalty, that an innocent person may have
been, or will be, wrongfully executed.
</P>
<P>
   Some death penalty proponents argue that capital punishment is a
deterrent, that it removes the condemned inmate from society, and
that it should be retained for these reasons even if there is
evidence that one of the executed might have been innocent.
</P>
<P>
   But as both Gore and Bush know, the death penalty is not a
deterrent, as Bush's own state of Texas clearly demonstrates. Texas
has easily outnumbered other states in executions of convicted
murderers, yet that state has also the highest murder rate. In
short, the death penalty did not stop or even slow down the states
murder rate. Instead the murder rate has increased during these
executions.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was essentially the same in other states, supporting
the argument of death penalty opponents such as Amnesty
International it brutalizes our society and it contributes to,
rather than diminishes, the number of murders in this country. As
some self-confessed murderers have said, the death penalty was not
on their mind when they were committing a murder.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these arguments would convince neither Gore nor Bush
to change their firm opposition to the death penalty. But if Gore
proposes a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and, at the
same time, calls for more expansive use of DNA testing on both the
accused and on death row inmates, may turn out to be more favorable
to the electorate than merely maintaining his one-note support of
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent news report, Gore indicated that he might consider a
moratorium on federal executions if problems with death penalty
cases at the state level were also evident in federal cases. He
added, however, that he did not believe there would be such a
finding. Still, this is the direction Gore ought to take to show a
more human side of his campaign image.
</P>
<P>
   But he should not consider a moratorium on only federal
executions. If he calls for such a moratorium during a period when
DNA tests are being conducted, there is at least a possibility that
a test will reveal an innocence.
</P>
<P>
   No voter could fault Bush for his last-minute stay of an
execution. And no voter would fault Gore for demonstrating how a
moratorium could save a wrongfully convicted person's life.

 COUPLE COMPLAINS OF A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1997 wedding of Steven and Emily Shalansky is now a fond
photo-album memory, but as of last week the Massachusetts couple
was still waiting for much of the china their wedding guests
purchased for them three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they prepare for the arrival of their first baby in
November, the Shalanskys are battling with Bloomingdale's over the
retailer's failure to deliver the fancy French china.
</P>
<P>
   What particularly irked the Shalanskys was the lack of urgency
they sensed from Bloomingdale's officials. ``They've just been
passing us off with overt indifference,'' said Emily.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration reached the breaking point last week when the
Shalanskys called me. They voiced a common complaint of many
consumers, that retailers take their money and then fail to deliver
what was promised. Rather than leveling with the consumer about the
problem and rectifying it, the Shalanskys say Bloomingdale's strung
them along and in the end failed to compensate them properly for
lousy customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's last week agreed to take back the china the
Shalanskys had received and issue a refund equal to the current
retail price of the china, a total of approximately $3,500. The
Shalanskys had wanted an additional $3,100 to purchase a new set of
china, but Bloomingdale's refused to compensate them further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed and we still want additional
remuneration,'' said Steven Shalansky.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's officials, while acknowledging poor customer
service, nevertheless say they were caught in the middle between an
angry customer and a manufacturer, Christofle of Paris, that
couldn't deliver the product. ``It's beyond our control,'' said
senior vice president Anne Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Marc Gallot, president of Christofle's US operations, said
he heard about the Shalanskys' situation just last week and felt
terrible about it. He said he planned to personally intervene to
rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Gallot said delays of several months with china deliveries are
not uncommon because of the uncertainty of the manufacturing
process, but he said a three-year delay was totally unacceptable.
``The service has been very poor, terrible, awful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong is still not entirely clear. The Shalanskys
registered with Bloomingdale's in December 1996, well in advance of
their August 1997 wedding. Among the items they listed was an
expensive china pattern made by Christofle, a respected company
that started out as the silversmith to the emperor Napoleon III.
Christofle is known worldwide, with stores called pavillons in
cities ranging from Buenos Aires to Athens, Paris to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Guests to the Shalansky wedding paid for nine table settings,
plus eight rimmed soup bowls and seven accent plates. These items
cost nearly $2,200 in all.
</P>
<P>
   The Shalanskys didn't think much about the china as they dashed
off to Bermuda for their honeymoon, but after the thank-you notes
had been written and the wedding gown stored away, they began
calling the Bloomingdale's store in Chestnut Hill, Mass. to seek
progress reports. They said they were typically told about vague
problems with the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   A few pieces would arrive in the mail periodically, but as of
last September, two years after their wedding, only three place
settings and three soup bowls had been delivered. Frustrated,
Brookline, Mass. couple wrote a letter to the chief executive of
Bloomingdale's in New York. Laurie Thornton, the general manager of
the Chestnut Hill store, responded with a letter in which she said
she was ``appalled at the lack of customer service you
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said some items from the original registry had been
purged from the Bloomingdale's system and were being reordered. She
said Christofle had promised delivery by December and as a token of
apology she offered a Christofle teapot worth $240.
</P>
<P>
   The Shalanskys were so encouraged by the tone of Thornton's
letter that they decided to pool the $240 from the teapot with more
of their own money to buy a full 12 place settings.
</P>
<P>
   But December passed and the full order had still not arrived. In
April, the Shalanskys wrote another letter to the chief executive
of Bloomingdale's demanding their china and additional
renumeration.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton again responded, this time blaming a warehouse
relocation and operational difficulties at Christofle for the
delay. She promised to seek alternative sources for the missing
china. ``This process will take a few weeks, but my hope is that we
can successfully fulfill your order,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after calls from the Globe, Bloomingdale's officials
said they could not obtain assurances from Christofle of a
guaranteed delivery date. So they told the Shalanskys to return the
china that had been delivered and get a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Bloomingdale's store at Chestnut Hill is
carrying the same Christofle pattern the Shalanskys purchased. And
when I called the Christofle store in New York, I was told I could
take delivery of 12 place settings of the same pattern in four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Gallot said the four-month delivery pledge is what his factory
in France is promising, but he said he could not guarantee it. He
also noted the pattern the Shalanskys purchased is partly made by a
supplier to Christofle, which makes delivery even more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shalansky said he is convinced only the Globe's
intervention forced the issue to come to a head last week. Asked
what he and his wife plan to do now, he said: ``We're going to shop
somewhere else and never shop at Bloomingdale's again.''

<P>
   Gasoline discounts
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With gasoline prices going through the roof, drivers with gas
guzzlers might want to check out Carclub.com as a way to save some
money this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Carclub costs $5.99 a month, or about $72 a year, which is
steep. But it offers a 10 percent discount for the rest of this
year on gasoline purchased at any of the 110,000 gas stations
nationwide that accept MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Club membership has other benefits as well, including
reimbursement of auto insurance deductibles of up to $500 in the
case of an accident, a mechanic hotline for second opinions on
repair estimates, and even directions when you get lost.
</P>
<P>
   The gas discount, however, is the real value. Here's how it
works. You sign up at carclub.com or 1-800-227-2582 for what, in
effect, is a prepaid gas card. You prepay up to $200 a month. You
can then go to any gas station that accepts MasterCard and buy gas
there. Carclub will pay the gas station owner the price on the pump
but deduct only 90 percent of that price from your card's account.
</P>
<P>
   If you spend $80 a month on gasoline, for example, the card will
save you $16, nearly three times the monthly cost of the
membership. With prices at many stations hitting $1.60 a gallon and
expected to go higher this summer, the savings is at least 16 cents
a gallon. A Carclub spokeswoman said the discount will continue
next year, but probably at the reduced level of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Carclub's chief advantage over other gas discount programs is
that it allows you to shop for the lowest-priced gas and then get
10 percent off that price. By contrast, several oil companies offer
gasoline rebate programs with their credit cards but require you to
buy gas at their stations. Priceline.com is also planning to unveil
a gas card soon, allowing users to place bids on what they want to
pay for gas. But that will take more effort and also restrict where
you can fill up your tank.

CLAY ANIMATORS FEATHER THEIR NEST WITH `CHICKEN RUN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think spending 18 months shooting an animated prison
breakout film starring chickens would make codirectors Peter Lord
and Nick Park empathetic to the plight of poultry, think again.
Both had just eaten fowl for lunch and were feeling none the worse
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no one we knew, so it was all right,'' says Lord, 46.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lord and Park's goal with their new film, ``Chicken
Run'' (opening Friday), was to make heroes out of hens, not destroy
the breast, wing, and drumstick market. They achieved that goal by
making ``The Great Escape'' with fowl, a ``Hogan's Heroes'' for
hens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' is about an imprisoned group of birds who have
two choices in life: Lay eggs regularly or become the next
evening's meal for their captors, the Tweedys. Their plucky young
leader, Ginger (played by Julia Sawalha, veteran of the British
comedy series ``Absolutely Fabulous'') tries to liberate her fellow
hens innumerable times before the film's beginning credits crawl to
an end. But it's Mel Gibson's character, Rocky the rooster, who may
finally give the birds the skills they need to break free.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with comedy, drama, and a dash of action thanks to visual
references to ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Aliens,'' ``Chicken
Run'' is the first big-screen outing for Aardman, a clay animation
studio in Bristol, England, founded by Lord and David Sproxton.
Aardman has achieved cultlike status (not to mention snagging three
Academy Awards for best animation short films) with the help of
their popular hand-molded creations Wallace, an inventor, and his
faithful pooch, Gromit.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a world where animation hits, whether ``The Rugrats
Movie'' or ``Tarzan,'' tend to come from literature or television
series that audiences are already familiar with. Will viewers
respond to a film filled with strange fowl?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wallace and Gromit did a lot of groundwork for us,'' says
Park, 41, with a laid-back delivery that makes him sound like a
British hippie. ``I think we'll have quite a devoted following on
this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And the film does offer the fans something familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the California raisins?'' asks John Canemaker,
director of the animation program at New York University's Tisch
School of the Arts, of the 1980s commercials that featured plump
singing raisins. ``It's the same sort of clay animation technique
that `Chicken Run' is doing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Laying the egg &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To develop the film, Park and Lord followed their instincts
rather than the money-generating Disney musical formula. So you
won't hear the poultry break into Negro spirituals over their
enslaved plight. Instead you get chickens with wings that work like
arms and beaks that contain a dazzling set of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Many viewers may wonder about the birds' extensive dental work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean they don't have teeth?,'' says Lord who was in Los
Angeles with Park doing media interviews. ``We were hoping no one
would notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Park, ``We went to a chicken farm actually and discovered
that they don't have teeth. It was a bit of a shock. But we were
too far down the line of production at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   They're joking, of course. Lord and Park added teeth and armlike
musculature to their feathered characters for specific reasons. One
gave their stars the ability to enunciate their lines. The other
allowed the chickens to dig ditches, build airplanes, and _ knit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These chickens of ours have to hold the screen compellingly
for 83 minutes,'' says Lord. ``They have to be able to act really
well. And, you know, it's very difficult if you have beaks stuck in
front of your face and just wings.''
</P>
<P>
   But the animal kingdom is filled with a variety of creatures.
Why choose chickens in the first place? Park and Lord mull over the
matter for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that chickens had had bad press for too long,'' Lord
finally explains. ``Something should be done to address the
balance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The fertilization &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the film developed after Park drew a picture of
a hen digging under a wire fence with a spoon. Park had had an
affinity for the birds since he was a child; his sister had owned a
pet chicken. ``Chicken Run'' gave Park a chance to try to end fowl
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never really been used in movies except to play
extras,'' says Park. ``Usually they go flying out of a barn when a
car goes racing through. People think they're just dumb animals and
are only good for that kind of role. Whereas when you get close to
a chicken and live with it, then you get to see they do have
character and a lot of comic potential.''
</P>
<P>
   That potential becomes apparent when you see Ginger and Rocky
staring soulfully at each other in one scene and kissing in
another.
</P>
<P>
   The kiss was a particular challenge. Park and Lord first
experimented with having the beaks meet together like suction
tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which was totally bizarre,'' says Lord. ``It was totally
ridiculous. It was hard to take the moment seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   They solved the problem by allowing this moment of intimacy to
remain private. After several false starts, Rocky and Ginger lock
lips turned away from the camera.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hysterically blank stare that passes between Rocky
and Ginger as they fall for each other: ``That's one thing we love
to play with, really, the dead kind of look,'' says Park. ``I think
people read things into the characters. That gives them depth, you
know.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
An animated history &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lord and Park have worked in animation most of their lives. Lord
and his Aardman cocreator Sproxton experimented with animation on
their kitchen tables as teenagers before founding Aardman in 1972.
Park was already making his own animation movies in his parents'
attic when, at 12, he was introduced via television to Aardman's
work in the form of their shape-shifting Morph character.
</P>
<P>
   Lord and Sproxton dabbled with traditional animation ``for about
a week,'' jokes Lord, in the beginning of their career. But the
pleasure of shaping plastic into living creatures quickly won out.
</P>
<P>
   It's an arduous task. An eye, leg, hand, or arm of just one
character can be adjusted 24 times to create a second of film seen
on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow, it's weird, it takes you all day,'' says Lord,
``But then when your film comes back from the laboratory and you
get to see it, you find that you've created this moment of life _
or so it seems. That's what it's about, animation, meaning giving
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to clay animation ``no one else does it
better, I don't think,'' says Lord, than Aardman. Remember the
animated images in Peter Gabriel's ``Sledgehammer'' video? That's
Aardman's work. The studio's preeminence in the field was further
cemented in the 1990s when Park won Oscars for directing the
Wallace and Gromit shorts ``A Grand Day Out,'' ``The Wrong
Trousers,'' and ``A Close Shave.''
</P>
<P>
   If that award record isn't enough to lure people into theaters,
having superstar Gibson voice one of the film's lead characters
might do the trick. Park and Lord started working with Gibson while
he was filming ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' Gibson spent mornings filming
``The Patriot'' and afternoons voicing Rocky to complete his
``Chicken Run'' chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often wondered why he agreed to do it,'' says Lord,
laughing. ``Playing as a chicken, I'm sure, wasn't his best offer
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Park, ``He probably hadn't done enough poultry roles
recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the truth is Gibson's a fan, so you could say Wallace and
Gromit made him do it.

FOR THIS COUPLE, FULL PENSION IS THE WAY TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I work in education and would like to retire in
June 2002, when I will be 59 1/2. Our projected pensions have a 2
percent annual cost-of-living increase. In addition to my pension,
I will receive a monthly stipend of $500 from age 59 1/2 to 62, due
to my longevity with the school district. At 62, I will qualify for
$500 a month in Social Security. Counting an anticipated withdrawal
of $2,000 a month from our mutual fund accounts, we would have a
maximum gross monthly income of $8,900. Should we leave all our
money in the pensions and take the guaranteed lifetime payout, or
withdraw some and invest it? Both pensions would continue to make
full lifetime payments to the surviving spouse when the first of us
dies. We are not concerned about leaving an inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   G.W., Boring, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I hope you're not a math teacher. In calculating that $8,900
maximum monthly income, you counted both the Social Security
benefit that begins at age 62, plus the longevity stipend, which
ends at 62. So your income upon retirement would range from a low
of $8,100 to a high of $8,400.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to take the full pension or the smaller
pension plus cash shouldn't take much analysis. You would have to
find an investment with a return in excess of 19 percent to supply
a cash flow to match what the pension offers, and in addition you
would sacrifice half of the cost-of-living adjustment if you went
for the lower pension. Clearly, this pension plan is designed with
heavy incentives to take the lifetime pension rather than the cash.
I think you would be foolish to take anything but the full
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   To express the situation another way, if you took the $122,500
in cash and invested it in a portfolio that produced average 10
percent gains _ and then withdrew $1,950 a month _ the pool would
run dry in less than 7.5 years. The full-pension option is so
attractive it's a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, my main suggestion is that you take a different
approach to budgeting your retirement, beginning with the low end
of the range for the pensions, and then considering the possibility
that you might not want to take as much as $2,000 a month from your
mutual fund accounts at the outset. I have never been a big fan of
budgeting an income stream with a stock-dominated portfolio being a
major source of the income; what you are basically planning on is
spending anticipated capital gains, which may or may not be in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, it doesn't appear you are being particularly
aggressive in terms of your expectations. A sequence of withdrawals
of $2,000 a month from a $350,000 portfolio would require a return
of only 6.87 percent to avoid depletion of your capital.
</P>
<P>
   But while several of your funds feature the word income, they
are all, in fact, dominated by stock holdings. Only United
Continental Income fund, with 30 percent bonds, and United
Retirement Shares, with 13 percent bonds, have fixed-income
positions. The highest current yield of any of your funds is the
2.05 percent of United Continental Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you take one of two approaches to getting income from
the fund portfolio. One is to move about half of the money to pure
bond funds, from which you would withdraw the actual yield, a move
that might net you about $1,000 a month. As for the other half, I
suggest you draw a line in the sand at $175,000; if the fund
balance exceeds $175,000, you could take your $1,000 additional
withdrawal, provided it did not bring the balance below that
$175,000. If the stock markets deliver you a bad season, you could
then rebudget for a thin month and squeak through.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the assumption of a 6.87 percent return is indeed
reasonable, you might have a few tough months at the outset, but
before a great deal of time elapses your balance should be so
comfortably in excess of that $175,000 you won't have to worry. The
advantage here is that while you would indeed be spending capital
gains from your stock funds, at least you would be spending only
capital gains that have actually occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The second approach would involve more flexibility in your
budgeting, since it would entail leaving all of the money in the
stock-dominated funds, but being prepared to take no withdrawals at
all in the event the portfolio slipped below that $350,000 level.
In the long run, this approach would be more attractive, but it
would also expose you to larger potential shocks in the early
years.
</P>
<P>
   I am leery of plans that anticipate fairly steady stock market
gains. But I also think you should retain a significant part of
your savings in stocks or stock funds. The 2 percent annual COLA
that applies to both of your pensions will help you deal with the
inflation that's likely during the years of your retirement, but
it's probably not going to do the entire job. About 10 years into
your retirement, you will doubtless find you'll want to make
heavier withdrawals from the fund accounts. If a significant part
of the money had been in stocks during that decade, the odds are
very strong the balance would be sufficient to support those higher
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I seem to have substantial savings, but no direction. I'm not
sure where to put my savings to maximize growth. I am saving for
the long term, but within a year I plan to get married and buy a
home. Homes here average about $300,000. In the future, I'd also
like to own a small condo in Florida, which would probably cost
about $100,000. I plan to work at my current job for another 27
years and retire with an 80 percent pension. Also, new funds are
being offered in my deferred compensation plan, and I would like to
add more funds to diversify. I feel I have no direction, and with a
stock market that is very unpredictable, I could lose all. I
believe I'm diversified, but I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   R.J., Scituate, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have no direction, you've certainly gone a long way
for a fellow of 32. In addition to earning the pension you are
looking forward to, if you continue contributions to the deferred
compensation plan at current levels and achieve 10 percent average
annual returns, you would amass $1,723,860 in that account. If your
Roth IRAs were fully funded for the same period, that would add
another $347,142.
</P>
<P>
   In short, with those accumulations in addition to your pension,
it seems to me your long-term planning is pretty well taken care
of. Certainly with a 27-year time frame in those accounts, you
don't need to worry about the stock market's health. In a period
that long, you will go through many markets good and bad. The trick
is simply to stick to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IRA and deferred compensation plans should deal with
your retirement so well, I suggest you deal with the uncertainties
of the current stock market by making a whopping down payment on
your home. You can determine for yourself how large a mortgage
payment you want to face, and how much in the way of emergency
savings you require. You might fund as much as half _ and perhaps
even more _ of your home purchase from your various taxable savings
accounts, still leaving you with about nine months' income in
emergency savings. If you do that, I'd suggest thatonce you decide
on the amount of your taxable mutual fund positions you want to
sell, do it immediately. Since you plan to buy within a year,
whatever amount will go for the down payment would have become
short-term savings, and thus would be more appropriately invested
in a money market fund than in the various stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   (But if you decide to retain some of the taxable stock positions
as long-term investments, I'd put Putnam Health and Sciences fund
at the head of the list of keepers.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the new investments available within your deferred
compensation plan, you can stick with both of the Fidelity funds
you are now using and diversify by building small positions _ in
the 10 to 15 percent range _ in the small-cap and international
offerings.

<P>
   Her muscles sore and tight from fibromyalgia, Cheryln
Christoffels used to feel like she'd been run over by a truck when
she woke up in the morning. No more. Now that she's visited a
massage therapist, she says that she feels like she's ``improved 90
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that kneading muscles relieves stress and aids
circulation. ``It's invaluable in helping an individual have less
pain, and it improves their range of motion,'' says physiatrist
Jerry Blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, massage allows a person to sleep better too.
Insurance companies are realizing that massage can be an integral
part of a rehabilitation program.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health defines therapeutic massage as
the manipulation of soft tissue to prevent and alleviate pain,
muscle spasms and stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the muscle is tight and short, there's less blood supply
and less circulation,'' says Blow. ``What massage does is break
that cycle. You get in and soften up the muscles and break up the
hardened area.''
</P>
<P>
   Massage not only increases circulation but also boosts the
body's pain-relieving endorphins, according to the American Massage
Therapy Association. Still some say it's not medical therapy, and
research must prove its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The AMTA cites numerous studies showing that massage lowers
heart rate and blood pressure while increasing circulation.
``Therapeutic massage enhances medical treatment and helps people
feel less anxious and stressed, yet more alert,'' states the AMTA.
</P>
<P>
   The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and
Bodywork certifies therapists, and 29 states and the District of
Columbia regulate the field. As insurance companies recognize the
expertise of the therapists, they're providing more coverage for
prescribed treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Not all proponents of massage feel convinced that increasing
insurance coverage, however, is a good thing. Some say it will make
for a lot of paperwork and may ``medicalize'' the practice in a way
that makes some therapists uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Whether insurance offers coverage for massage or not, doctors
warn that not all patients benefit from muscle kneading and soft
tissue manipulation. This includes those with inflammation of the
veins or phlebitis, infectious diseases, certain cancers, some skin
conditions or specific cardiac problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whether through insurance or their own pockets, consumers now
spend $2 billion to $4 billion annually for massages. Since many
can't afford the average $45 per hour fee, insurance policies often
determine who gets the therapy and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are even considering legislation that would require
insurance companies to cover treatments by licensed massage
therapists. According to ATMA, several health and managed-care
plans already cover it including Oxford Health Plans Inc., PREMERA
(formerly Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska, and Medical Services
Corp.,) Prudential Insurance Company of America, Great-West Life
and Annuity, Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound and
Alternative Health Insurance Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish my insurance covered it,'' says Christoffels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once massage therapy is prescribed,'' says Blow, ``you or your
doctor may need to seek authorization from the insurer if coverage
is not clearly spelled out in your policy or plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written survey of physicians, nurses, dentists and other
health professionals at the University of Florida, 52 percent said
they had tried an alternative treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this survey, we've learned that the health science
faculty are pretty much like anyone else when it comes to their own
health,'' said Dr. Allen Neims, a professor of pharmacology and
former dean of the University of Florida's College of Medicine.
``This is significant, because they are the role models and
teachers of the next generation of health-care professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of U.S. medical schools offer elective courses on
alternative therapies, Neims said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of individuality in how
integrative treatments are presented to students by the faculty,''
Neims said. ``Some include quite a bit of information and others
are quite resistant to it, seeing it as a step backwards
scientifically. While there is room for both views within the
college, I hope this study gives people a little more sense of
permission to teach these things. Teaching about them does not have
to be an endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health opened an Office of
Alternative Medicine in 1992 to study therapies like massage. NIH
reported the following results:
</P>
<P>
   _ Office workers massaged regularly were more alert.
</P>
<P>
   _ Massage therapy decreased the effects of anxiety and pain in
burn patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abdominal surgery patients recovered more quickly after
massage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Premature infants who were massaged fared better than those
who weren't.
</P>
<P>
   _ Autistic children showed less erratic behavior after massage
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really want to feel better, and doctors are finding
that massage is a great way to get people back to a functioning
level,'' says Blow. ``We can all use massage at one time or
another, but in acute medical conditions, it's extremely
beneficial.''

 &HT;    (ART ADV: A photo of Goldie Hawn is available in JPEG format by
calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By JULIANN GAREY 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc. 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features &QL;
<P>
   Goldie Hawn was practically giddy with excitement as she and her
date, her 13-year-old son, Wyatt _ made their way into last
spring's all-star tribute to legendary singer Joni Mitchell.
``She's just one of the greatest poets of our time,'' said Hawn,
glowing with admiration. ``She's given us so much joy and so much
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the music was vibrating up through the floor, and Bryan
Adams and Wynonna were bringing down the house with their cover of
Mitchell's ``Raised on Robbery.'' Sitting in the audience, Hawn
tried hard to stay in her seat, but her shoulders shook, her hips
wriggled, her hands clapped, and her blond mane swung back and
forth over her bare shoulders. If she weren't afraid it would
mortify her son, she would have been on her feet, dancing. But as
the mother of a teen-ager, she knew better. So Hawn kept her butt
in her seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the smile on her face was pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   Goldie Hawn is about nothing if not the thoughtful and
considered exploration, cultivation, renewal and expression of joy.
It is not a subject she takes lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a light personality and a deep-thinking brain,'' she
said. ``Those are two very different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in suburban Takoma Park, Md., by her mother, Laura, a
dance teacher, and her father, Edward, a musician, Hawn always
loved to perform and planned a career on the stage as a singer and
dancer. But then a talent agent spotted the 22-year-old Hawn
dancing in a chorus line, signed her up, and landed her a small
role on a CBS television series. One day, George Schiatter, the
creator of Rowan and Martin's ``Laugh-In,'' happened to walk by the
set. And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Laugh-In,'' Hawn's trademark giggle was born when she
flubbed her lines on camera and broke into a fit of laughter. She
discovered, along with the rest of the country, that she was a
comedic natural. ``Directing Goldie was more a question of getting
out of the way,'' says Schlatter, ``because whatever was going to
happen was better than what I would have directed her to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn hardly fits the stereotype of the neurotic comedian. It's a
safe bet that 99.9 percent of her colleagues aren't as happy as she
is. Offstage, good comedians are supposed to be at least a little
angst ridden, right? Filled with just a touch of self-loathing?
</P>
<P>
   Not Goldie. ``She is an amazing positive energy force,'' her
friend and Pacific Palisades, Calif., neighbor Martin Short has
said, ``that just emits sunshine and joy wherever she goes.'' Her
``Everyone Says I Love You'' co-star Alan Alda feels there's
something almost therapeutic about hanging around Hawn. ``We need
people like her to lift our spirits,'' he's said. ``There's always
a lot of laughing and fun with Goldie.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, too much unadulterated perkiness probably wouldn't be
tolerated for long among some of Hawn's friends _ Woody Allen,
Steve Martin, Bette Midler. Yet somehow Hawn's radiant happiness is
far from relentless or irritating.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unique about Goldie,'' said Diane Keaton, who worked
with Hawn on ``The First Wives Club,'' ``is that she has a huge
capacity to enjoy life. Every morning she would get a cappuccino,
and every day it was 'the best cappuccino!' It's fun to be around,
because I'm not that way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In next month's ``Town and Country,'' a romantic comedy about
two couples facing mid-life marital crises, Hawn stars opposite
Garry Shandling, the actor/comedian who has to be _ at least
temperamentally speaking _ her polar opposite. ``They are such an
unusual combination that the chemistry was just explosively
funny,'' says ``Town and Country'''s producer, Simon Fields.
``Garry's very understated and self-deprecating, and Goldie's very
big and very funny. You don't often get to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Hawn's happiness so unique in Hollywood is that it
wasn't born yesterday. She is not the celebrity
ex-junkie/sexaholic/overeater who just last week found the
kaballah/community service/low-carb diet that changed her life.
This is the way she has always been _ though it continues to
surprise even her. ``It's kind of amazing, really,'' she has said.
``My kids look at me and say, 'Mom, you're so happy!' And I do feel
happy. I feel joyful inside. I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what makes Hawn's joy so integral to her is that it's
based on a lifetime of self-examination and re-examination _ of
learning from her mistakes, of relying on her strong sense of
family. Perhaps it's even biological. ``I came in this way, but
now, as I get older, I'm trying to figure out where it really comes
from,'' she said. ``What is this tickle of joy that I have? Are you
born with it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's such a big subject for her that Hawn is planning to make a
film about it _ Joy: The Documentary. Here's how she pitches her
project: ``I want to know where joy lives. I'd interview
scientists, religious leaders and heads of state. I want to find
out exactly what it is that makes people happy. I want to look into
the biology, the chemistry of the human brain and find new ways to
access a level of happiness within us. A baby smiles something like
72 times a day. Where does that smile go? That's what I really want
to know.''
</P>
<P>
   So, ask what makes and keeps Goldie Hawn happy, and you don't
have to worry that she's going to give you a ``buying a new pair of
mules'' answer. The foundations of her contentment are far more
substantial. Her philosophy: ``There are ways to sustain joy inside
of you.'' And here they are.
</P>
<P>
   1. LIVE IN REALITY
</P>
<P>
   Probably the toughest thing about being famous is fame. It tends
to screw up everything _ especially relationships with friends,
family, lovers. Somehow, Hawn has managed to avoid that trap. ``She
has handled her fame better than any actress I know,'' said Nancy
Meyers, who produced ``Private Benjamin'' with Hawn. ``I've seen a
lot of people go wacky. She doesn't hide from it, and it doesn't
distort her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn credits her father with teaching her to stay grounded. ``He
told me that the minute you lose reality, you lose everything,''
she said. ``I'm a very practical person, and as I got older, I
stayed realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Being realistic keeps her sane _ in business, in love, in life.
``I've learned,'' she's said, ``that if you are giving all you can
and it still doesn't make a difference, you must give up control
over others. The only person you can control in the whole universe
is yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn is probably questioned more about the longevity of her
happily unmarried relationship with actor Kurt Russell (17 years
this past Valentine's Day) than about the longevity of her career.
Yet she is always quite frank about the fact that she prefers to
wake up each day and make the choice to be in that relationship and
understand that it only has a certain life span, whatever that may
be.
</P>
<P>
   That said, she also thinks we tend to give up on relationships
too quickly. ``Really be clear that the grass is not always
greener,'' she said. ``We have a tendency to think, Oh, if I could
just be over there, wouldn't it be fun. But the truth is you're
just ... grasping for some answers, and the answers are in your
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   2. GET YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT
</P>
<P>
   When Hawn made ``The First Wives Club'' in 1996, she was facing
the big 5-0. The film gave her a chance to poke fun at her own
ingenue image before Hollywood did it for her. And when she made
``The Out-of-Towners'' three years later, she was facing the same
empty-nest syndrome issues as her character.
</P>
<P>
   Three of her four children (Oliver Hudson, 24, Kate Hudson, 20,
and Russell's son, Boston, 19) had, by that time, all moved away
from home.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her career, Hawn's work has reflected the issues
she's facing in her personal life. But her personal life has always
been her priority.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during her career, Hawn chose not to work at all for more
than two years at a stretch _ when Wyatt was born in 1986 and when
her mother became terminally ill in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a big part of my life,'' she said, ``and it was
a joy to be able to take care of her till the end. I've made
choices not to work, choices not to go out of town, choices in
terms of my priorities ... but there's nothing I would call a
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   3. PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU LOVE
</P>
<P>
   Among Hawn's top priorities these days is spending more time
alone with Russell just ``playing.'' ``When we find we're not
playing together,'' she's said, ``we drop everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn is mindful about taking care of the important people in her
life. ``Like not losing the wish to make love. I think that's very
important .... And sometimes you just don't feel like it. But when
you do, afterward you feel great I think it's important that we
honor each other with tenderness and attention. We have a tendency
not to see each other after a while. But you have pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn is convinced that the world-weary look see in some people's
eyes comes from the fact that they've stopped paying attention to
the world. They're forgetting to notice things because they're
jaded _ they've been there, done that. Hawn's solution: ``We can
train ourselves to look with wonder at that tree. I know it's a
cliche, but it works.''
</P>
<P>
   4. SEEK OUT QUIET
</P>
<P>
   Hawn, who was raised Jewish (``All I ever wanted was to marry a
Jewish dentist''), is now a practicing Buddhist who's been
meditating for years. ``I try to meditate 20 minutes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   For women, whom she believes often get stuck with the lion's
share of caretaking responsibilities, this completely private time
is crucial. ``I think mothers have to work on nurturing themselves
first,'' she said. ``When a woman feels happy inside, she can give
her children a more optimistic feeling about life.''
</P>
<P>
   5. KEEP CHALLENGING YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   So what's next? Hawn is working on the script for ``Ashes to
Ashes,'' a movie about a woman who goes to India to carry out her
late husband's dying wish. Then of course there's her search for
joy _ the documentary. But that's all very short-term. Where does
she see her life going? What path will she follow?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the focus is ... who I want to be at 60, at 70, at 80,''
she said. ``I want to move in a fashion that helps me through the
transition of letting go of motherhood and moving into my
womanhood. Using my feminine power, my feminine energy to continue
to express myself. To teach and learn and accomplish things.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is that you can't be happy if you're bored. ``Ask
those questions,'' she said. ``Challenge yourself, face your fears,
all the things we think we can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hawn isn't happy all the time. Let's just say that
she's a student of happiness _ with a wall full of diplomas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   America is a nation of immigrants. My daughters are a delightful
mix of French, Scot, Irish and Norwegian, with a splash of genes
from the countries that once formed Austria-Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   When their first relatives arrived on these shores _ just in
time to fight on the wrong side in the American Revolution _ this
land had long been inhabited. In school, my daughters were taught
that the earliest ``native'' Americans, the Clovis people, came to
this country sometime about 11,500 years ago. They were said to
have traveled from Siberia across the land bridge that then
connected the Asian land mass with what is now Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   However, your youngsters may soon be telling you a different
story about how this nation was settled. In this revised version of
America's earliest history, the first settlers were a far more
diverse lot who moved about more than we suspected. This new, more
complex picture of the peopling of America comes from two
converging lines of research that couldn't seem to be farther apart
_ measuring skulls and analyzing grammar.
</P>
<P>
   C. Loring Brace, an anthropologist at the University of
Michigan, has made a career out of analyzing skulls from around the
world. In a recent seminar at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., he
said his work had confirmed a complex origin for today's American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Brace and his colleagues performed two dozen measurements on
each of thousands of ancient and newer skulls. Then, they mapped
the similarities among groups. Their analysis shows that the
descendants of the first humans to enter the New World _ including
natives of Mexico, Peru and the southern United States _ have no
obvious ties to any Asian groups. ``The 'native' inhabitants of the
Western Hemisphere are not all minor variants of the same people,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   This idea runs so contrary to prevailing wisdom that Brace, a
strong advocate of the diversity proposition, plans to press
forward with his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of the original settlers is not quite as great as
that of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries when waves of
European, Asian and (unwilling) African immigrants arrived on
American shores. However, the first Americans did have more
far-flung origins than were ever suspected.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brace's studies have revealed that the Blackfoot,
Iroquois, and other tribes from Minnesota, Michigan, Ontario and
Massachusetts descended from the Jomon, a prehistoric people of
Japan. The Inuit in the far north and tribal groups who once lived
down the Eastern seaboard into Florida appear to be a later branch
from the trunk of the Jomon family tree, he says. The
Athabaskan-speaking people from the Yukon and northwestern Canada,
who spread as far south as Arizona and northern Mexico, appear to
trace their origins to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their craniofacial configuration allies them more closely to
the living Chinese than to any other population in either
hemisphere,'' says Brace.
</P>
<P>
   To identify the ultimate origins of these peoples, Brace hopes
to use new samples from sites in Mongolia that have been silently
biding their time in museums in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``These samples represent the remaining large block of the world
not currently covered in any detail by the University of Michigan
Museum of Anthropology craniofacial database,'' says a university
spokesman. Their addition could provide a fuller picture of our
country's earliest inhabitants. ``We hope that new samples from
Novosibirsk, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which we've recently been
given permission to measure, will illuminate their origins,'' says
Brace.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Brace's work is being taken so seriously is
that it has been more or less verified.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Nichols, a professor of Slavic languages and literature
at the University of California at Berkeley, has reached a
conclusion similar to Brace's by way of an entirely different
approach. While Brace has analyzed the most substantial bits of our
past, Nichols has focused on the most ephemeral _ language.
</P>
<P>
   She says that new linguistic evidence from indigenous languages
throughout the New World strongly suggests that humans have been in
the Americas since as early as 40,000 BCE. She says that it is only
along the West Coast that languages appear to have come from
immigrants who arrived after the ice age, 14,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols also has some radical ideas about the direction in which
the country was settled. Breaking with the traditional view of
migrations, she says that the interior of North America was
colonized not directly from Siberia but almost entirely from the
south. Even the Athabaskan language family, now centered in
northern Canada and Alaska, is more likely to have moved up from
the south than to have entered directly from Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster her argument for an early settlement date, Nichols
points to findings from the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. It
has been dated at 12,500 years old, which meansthe area was
occupied during the last ice age. And, the Monte Verde people would
have needed at least 6,500 years to travel from Alaska to Chile.
Yet that only takes us back to about 19,000 years ago. Here is
where her study of language diversity provides the rest of the
explanation for the 40,000 BCE settlement date. Her research
suggests a very high degree of language diversity, and that, says
Nichols, is something that happens only with time. She maintains
that the approximately 150 distinct Native American language
families we know of today must have required at least 35,000 years
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   However, beneath this diversity there are deep linguistic
similarities that link across the Pacific Ocean. ``From the Sierra
and the Andes mountains all the way to the Atlantic, American
languages share distinctive features,'' says Nichols. ``They share
grammatical features that are rare elsewhere, which gives the
hemisphere a distinctive signature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these features is a pronoun system with ``n'' in the
words for ``I'' and ``we'' and ``m'' in the words for ``you.'' It
is found on both the American Pacific coast and the south Asian
coast.
</P>
<P>
   As to the question of where it all began, that is something we
may never know. Nichols says that the language similarities
``indicate a common history of a people so ancient that we cannot
hope to trace their linguistic descent.'' So it would appear no
matter how deeply we delve into our past, America always was a land
of immigrants. Some just arrived a bit earlier than others.

<P>
   As you drive in from Kansas City, Independence doesn't look like
much. The two-lane highway rolls away from the interstate in gentle
waves, but the landscape is littered with fast-food restaurants and
discount stores. It isn't until you reach downtown Independence
with its neat blocks of glass-fronted, two-story buildings that you
notice the change.
</P>
<P>
   The center of town with its attractive square looks much as it
did around the turn of the century when Harry S. Truman worked at
the local drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   The square is dominated by the Jackson County Courthouse, built
in 1836. There you can visit the office where Truman made the
transition from bankrupt haberdasher to public servant when he was
elected county judge in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   President Truman himself said, ``I tried never to forget who I
was and where I'd come from and where I was going back to,'' and
explained that because one day he would be out of office and back
in Independence, he had to make sure he did his best and made his
neighbors proud.
</P>
<P>
   Though Independence is most closely associated with Truman, it
has a surprisingly rich history for a place with such a small-town
feel. Founded in 1827, it soon became known as the Queen City of
the Trails because of the throngs of people who arrived to join
westward wagon trains.
</P>
<P>
   The National Frontier Trails Center, about a mile from downtown,
stands on the site of the trailhead for three of the overland
routes most vital to the settlement of the West: Santa Fe, the
Oregon and the California.
</P>
<P>
   A short film gives a good overview of the history of the
overland trails and a comprehensive collection of period artifacts
makes it all the more immediate. The exhibits quote extensively
from trail diaries, offering visitors a chance to relive the
arduous journey west.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who went to Independence intended to keep moving.
The founder of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith, arrived in 1831
while proselytizing in the Midwest. He declared the town the new
promised land and selected a spot that is today known as the Temple
Lot as the site of a new church.
</P>
<P>
   His followers began migrating to the area in such numbers that
by 1833 the local residents were beginning to resent their
presence. When their homes were burned, they were forced to
relocate just north of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1838, Missouri's governor, Lilburn Boggs, issued his
``Extermination Order,'' mandating that Mormons be driven from the
state or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a small memorial on the Temple Lot commemorates the
moment when Smith declared this patch of Independence promised
land. The church headquarters on the edge of town are certainly
worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons were not the only source of controversy in Independence.
The battle over slavery hit here with particular force. Under the
Missouri Compromise of 1820, Missouri was a slave state, but when
Congress in 1854 decided to let Kansans vote on whether their state
would be free or slave, many Missourians felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-slavery forces rushed into Kansas from border towns like
Independence to menace abolitionists and to elect a pro-slavery
legislature. The 1859 jail, Marshal's Home and Museum just off
Independence Square examine this grim chapter of Independence
history.
</P>
<P>
   The brick compound has been restored to its Civil War-era
appearance when it housed abolitionist raiders (jayhawkers) from
Kansas and occasionally, an overzealous pro-slavery Missourian.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the jail mostly held petty criminals. Frank
James, the brother of Jesse and second-in-command of the by-then
defunct James Gang, spent time at the jail in the winter of 1882-83
after turning himself in to authorities. His brother had been
killed, and the popular press had gone from portraying the gang as
folk heroes to calling them hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Frank James turned in his gun belt, saying, ``I'm handing you
something no other man has touched in twenty years.'' His cell has
been restored, and it looks quite cozy, with a rug on the floor, a
quilt on the bed, and a sampler on the wall that reads, ``God is
our Refuge and Strength.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this history must have been quite familiar to Harry S.
Truman. He made so many references to his hometown that the press
took to calling him ``The Man from Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman was born in Lamar, in southern Missouri, and moved with
his family to Independence in 1890 when he was six. Around then he
met Bess Wallace, whom he married in 1919 after what was
essentially a twenty-nine-year courtship.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nicest exhibits at the Truman Library, dedicated in
1957, is a display of some of the hundreds of letters Harry wrote
to his beloved Bess over the years. The library, which greets
visitors with a Thomas Hart Benton mural titled ``Independence and
the Opening of the West,'' is a fine starting point for learning
about Truman the President, but his home at 219 North Delaware
Street _ the house where his wife grew up _ offers intimate
glimpses of his life in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a hollow week,'' Truman wrote to Bess Wallace in
1913, ``if I don't arrive at 219 North Delaware at least one day in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After their marriage, they moved into the two-and-a-half-story
structure, which Bess's grandfather had built in 1867. By the time
she died in 1982, she had lived in the house for seventy-eight
years. Even when Truman was in the White House, she rarely stayed
away from 219 North Delaware for more than a few months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   When Truman was courting her, the Wallace home was considered
one of the finest mansions in Independence, though by today's
standards it looks rather plain. The bedrooms are not open to view
since she stipulated in her will that though the house was to be
given to the public, her daughter, Margaret, must be permitted to
spend the night whenever she chose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can stand on the porch where Truman pored over his
newspaper and where, during his Presidency, he sought moments of
solitude, and feel you are beginning to know the man who so dearly
loved the simple pleasures of life.
</P>
<P>
   A piano stands in the parlor, along with a television that
Truman refused to watch, preferring instead to read. The walls of
his study are lined with books, and his worn blue reading chair
looks as inviting today as it must have when he would snatch some
free time there.
</P>
<P>
   President or private citizen, Truman wanted his life in
Independence to remain unchanged. Much to his chagrin, the Secret
Service erected an iron fence around the lot in 1948 to protect the
lawn from the increasingly large crowds that gathered to catch a
glimpse of him at the ``Summer White House.'' Bess Truman, tired of
having her flowers tramped upon, had no such objections. Still, the
Trumans were disappointed when they moved home after his final term
as President and their neighbors couldn't bring themselves to treat
them as regular folks.
</P>
<P>
   As one park ranger put it, ``People wouldn't just drop by
anymore, and if they did come over, they were very formal and never
stayed more than half an hour. They figured the former President
had better things to do with his time. Harry didn't see it that
way, but there was nothing he could do to convince his guests of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the years between his return to Independence and his
death in 1972, Truman's daily routine included grabbing his hat,
coat and cane _ his wife insisted after his death that they remain
hanging where he'd left them _ and walking the mile to his library.
(He and Bess are buried on the library grounds.)
</P>
<P>
   He was notorious among his Secret Servicemen for walking
everywhere, and he especially enjoyed striding through town.
</P>
<P>
   A statue of him erected outside the Jackson County Courthouse
after his death shows him moving purposefully forward, as if
marching into history.
</P>
<P>
   Truman so loved Independence that in 1971 he approved having the
Department of the Interior make the twelve blocks around his home a
National Historic District.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll past the storefronts and through the quiet leafy
neighborhoods, it's not hard to understand why the place meant so
much to him.

<P>
   Call the Independence Tourism Office at 800-810-4700, or visit
www.ci.independence.mo.us, for general information on local
attractions and events. During the first week in May, Independence
throws a birthday party for Truman, offering discounts on admission
to all its historic sites and serving free birthday cake in the
town square.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things to do and see in Independence, but except
for a few bed-and-breakfasts, there aren't many places to stay.
However, Kansas City is a 15-minute drive away, whose many urban
attractions serve as a counterpoint to Independence's rural charms.
</P>
<P>
   While in Independence, be sure to stop in at Clinton's
Old-Fashioned Soda Fountain, where the young Harry Truman got his
first job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember the first three dollars I received for working
a week,'' he recalled. ``I had to wipe off the bottles, mop the
floor every morning, make ice cream for sodas and wait on the
customers. That three silver dollars looked like three million and
meant a lot more. I've never had as much or as big a payday
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the soda fountain is run by the Jackson County Historical
Society, and you can check out a display of Truman memorabilia
while sipping a vanilla Coke at the long marble bar.

CROSS-BORDER POLLUTION HITS MEXICAN TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ ``Man by Day, Woman by Night.'' ``Size Does
Matter.'' ``I Don't Want My Son to Marry the Housekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Topics from the best of Jerry Springer? How about ``Cosas de la
Vida (Things of Life)''?
</P>
<P>
   Trash TV has come south of the border, and it's causing a stir
in this conservative, class-conscious society.
</P>
<P>
   Three new talk shows, all produced by Mexico's two major
television networks and broadcast nationally, have debuted over the
last few months to a mix of criticism and through-the-roof ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd what they show on those programs,'' said Esteban
Castillo, 30, a mechanic who admits to having clicked on a few
episodes. ``The people are always yelling and fighting. But it's
fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk shows are an extraordinary leap in a country bound by
religious and cultural traditions; where people prefer to keep
their dirty laundry home rather than hang it out before millions of
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why the shows' producers often have to troll
the streets to find participants, luring them with the promise of
appearing on national television, a chance to see a real TV studio,
a free makeover, and a gratuity of up to 300 pesos, about 10 times
the average daily wage.
</P>
<P>
   Once on stage, the panelists engage in an hour of constant
bickering, insults, reprimands, and even brief fistfights that are
quickly ended by broad-shouldered bodyguards in tight T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   But even in their brief, scandalous existence, these shows have
broached subjects questioning seldom-discussed issues here:
extramarital affairs, domestic violence, interclass relationships,
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is a closed and conservative society like so much of
Latin America, but this show helps give people a chance to express
themselves,'' said Roberto Romagnoli, the 25-year-old producer of
``Cosas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with the same daily issues that people face in their
lives, and that's what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not the first shows of this genre to be broadcast in
Mexico, but ``Cosas,'' ``Hastaen las Mejores Familias (Even in the
Best Families)?'' and ``Martha Susana'' are the first to be made in
Mexico, featuring nationally known hosts and guests who might as
well be neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some warn that these new US-influenced shows are just
another bad influence from the north that could have a corrosive
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a culture lacking in ethics that damages
people's integrity,'' said Xavier Esteinou, a communications
professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University, in the
newspaper Reforma. ``The issues are presented in a coarse way,
lacking creativity, with an end to generate high ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The shows' producers agree _ at least about the ratings part.
</P>
<P>
   All three new programs have been gold mines for their networks.
``Cosas'' has broken ratings records for TV Azteca, second only to
``Hasta,'' which airs on Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs are on at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, during the
traditional lunch hour when children and parents are usually at
home.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent Thursday, both shows drew higher ratings than a
championship soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   Romagnoli has only two concerns about his show's future: that he
continue to find interesting panelists and that the authorities
don't get too upset over what he airs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had other shows at this network stopped because of
pressure from the government or because they were too aggressive,''
he added with a chuckle. ``I hope they don't do that to us. Maybe
they'll see that we're also doing something good.''

TIME TO FREE LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `All Syrian forces must leave Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House or the State Department ought to pronounce those
six words unambiguously, says a bipartisan committee of statesmen,
scholars, and entrepreneurs, and thereby take the first step toward
freeing the only sovereign nation on earth still ruled as the
satellite of another.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is the Lebanon Study Group, and its report,
``Ending Syria's Occupation of Lebanon: The US Role,'' has just
been published by the Middle East Forum. Monographs on foreign
affairs are notoriously windy, vague, and full of jargon; this one
is penetrating and eloquent. It can be read with profit by anyone
who cares about Lebanon or US foreign policy, or who relishes
clarity of thought.
</P>
<P>
   And its timing is perfect: The death of Hafez Assad and Israel's
departure from southern Lebanon have thrown open a window of
opportunity for pressing Syria to end its Lebanese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian troops entered Lebanon in 1975; between 30,000 and 40,000
of them remain there to this day, along with an untold number of
secret police and intelligence agents. Three times Damascus has
agreed to withdraw its forces _ in the Riyadh-Cairo accord of 1976,
the Fez Declaration of 1982, and the Ta'if agreement of 1989 _ and
three times Damascus has reneged.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly called for
all occupying troops to leave Lebanon. Resolution 520 demands
``strict respect for Lebanon's . . . political independence under
the sole and exclusive authority of the Lebanese government through
the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon.'' But Syria has thumbed its
nose at 520 and at every other other call for a restoration of
Lebanese autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new report points out, Syria has never recognized
Lebanese sovereignty. The two states have never exchanged
ambassadors. Damascus has ``flatly stated that Lebanon does not
deserve independence and should be no more than a province of
Syria.'' In 1990, Syrian troops forcibly crushed the last fragment
of Lebanon's lawful government, killing hundreds of Lebanese
citizens loyal to Prime Minister Michel Aoun. Since then, Lebanon
has been ruled from Damascus via a series of puppet presidents and
prime ministers in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to Lebanon _ once famed as the ``Switzerland
of the Middle East'' _ is an international crime. Its economy has
been ravaged. More than 1 million Syrian workers have flooded into
the country, depriving countless Lebanese of work and siphoning out
at least $3 billion every year. Businesses are forced to share
their earnings with unwanted Syrian ``partners.'' The country's
middle class has been wrecked. Corruption _ bribery, kickbacks, and
extortion, most of it lining Syrian pockets _ has become rampant.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the economy. Lebanon's armed forces have been
turned into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Syrian military as
genuine Lebanese patriots have been purged from the ranks. The
judiciary, which used to be independent, is now indistinguishable
from Syria's. ``Top judges regularly . . . receive instructions
from Syrian intelligence officials,'' the Lebanon Study Group
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, human rights are violated wantonly. Foes of
the Syrian occupation have been imprisoned and tortured _ or have
disappeared altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Especially heartbreaking for those who remember how robust
Lebanon's media used to be is the suppression of the press.
Censorship is now routine. Newspapers have been closed and editors
imprisoned for criticizing the government. The 52 television
stations that used to operate in Lebanon have been reduced to five;
of the 100 or so radio stations, 11 remain.
</P>
<P>
   But the cruelest blow of all has come not from Damascus but from
Washington. In the vain hope of inducing Syria to make peace with
Israel, the United States has turned a blind eye to the Syrian
occupation. When Assad's troops demolished Beirut's last defenders
in 1990, they did so with the acquiescence of President Bush, who
was willing to pay any price for Syria's support of Desert Storm.
That is, to reverse Saddam's conquest of Kuwait, the White House
accepted Assad's conquest of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   All this despite the fact that Damascus has been involved in
more American deaths than any regime since Vietnam's and is a
perennial on the State Department's list of states that export
terror.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has often condemned the Syrian occupation, but
executive branch appeasement goes on. ``Syria has played a
constructive role as far as Lebanon is concerned,'' Secretary of
State Albright said, incredibly, on June 7. ``We hope they will
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an atrocious message to be sending Damascus and a bitter
betrayal of the Lebanese. There will never be peace in the Middle
East as long as Lebanon is a satrapy of Syria. With Assad dead, the
moment is ripe for a correction of US policy. It could begin with a
simple six-word statement: ``All Syrian forces must leave
Lebanon.''

<P>
   A carjacking. A brutal murder. A son's life taken. And a father,
wracked by loss and seizing on a single wish: death for the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of Jason Burgeson brought Ernest Burgeson and the
entire town of Lakeville, Mass. to life amid numbing pain,
petitioning the US Department of Justice and Attorney General Janet
Reno to provide a remedy the state cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island, where on June 8, Jason Burgeson and his friend Amy
Shute were hijacked, shot at point-blank range, and robbed of $18,
has no death penalty statute. The only chance for a death penalty
outcome lies in a federal statute that elevates carjacking to a
capital crime when it results in murder.
</P>
<P>
   That chance, Ernest Burgeson said last week, has become his
life's quest. Before a bank of cameras outside the courtroom where
the alleged triggerman and four accomplices faced murder charges,
he asked only to live long enough to see the alleged perpetrators _
all of them _ put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage alone does not fuel his quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that if they are put to death, they won't get out
of jail and do this again,'' Burgeson said the day he buried his
son. ``I want to save someone else's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as overturned convictions, exonerating DNA evidence, and
statewide moratoriums have led to a national soul-searching on the
death penalty, Burgeson is a face and voice of the victim in the
American justice system _ particularly victims who lose loved ones
to homicide.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the victims rights movement has transformed
what was once a sense of powerlessness _ watching some violent
offenders serving fractions of their sentences, career abusers
finding their way out the revolving door of a courthouse, and
juveniles avoiding adult sentences for grisly crimes _ into a mode
of action, seeking stricter penalties and renewing calls for the
death penalty. In Massachusetts, the cry for ``just punishment''
nearly pushed the state to reinstate the death penalty after the
murder of Jeffrey Curley in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, other faces and voices of victimhood have
emerged, finding a foothold in the landscape of victims rights
advocacy and challenging some of its core assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices, which experts say have been overshadowed by calls
for the most severe punishment, are not only publicly renouncing
the death penalty, but building bridges with the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   There have long been families of murder victims who privately
turned away from the death penalty and dedicated themselves to
alternative efforts at crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But the fluctuating notion of what it means to be a victim
reached a turning point last fall. In an unprecedented victim's
plea to the court, the parents of Matthew Shepard successfully
persuaded prosecutors in their son's case not to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 21, a student at the University of Wyoming, was lashed
to a wooden fence on a freezing prairie and pistol-whipped to
death.
</P>
<P>
   In another celebrated case, Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed
in the Oklahoma City bombing, has crusaded against the death
penalty, and has sat down with the father of Timothy McVeigh,
convicted in the case.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the most influential groups in the reconciliation
movement, Murder Victims Families For Reconciliation, has brought
relatives of homicide victims and relatives of violent offenders
into a common conversation. Its vice chairwoman, the Rev. Renee
Wormack-Keels of the United Baptist Church in Boston, lost her
father to execution after he was convicted of murder, and her
oldest son is serving a life sentence for murder.
</P>
<P>
   In building bridges with offenders, some say Welch and others
have taken on a role that should never be asked of a victim of
violent crime _ using the power of remorse and the possibility of
reconciliation to rehabilitate offenders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they have stirred controversy among victims
and their advocates, pointing to the death penalty as a model of
vengeance that contributes to a climate of violence gripping
American culture and its legal system. The United States is the
only Western nation that allows capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for a long time, there was a monolithic view that all
victims wanted the same thing, that all families of homicide
victims have reason to want to see the death penalty,'' said Bonnie
Bucqueroux, founder of Crime Victims for a Just Society, a
Michigan-based, anti-death penalty victims group that advocates for
innovative solutions to crime, including reconciliation. ``But I
think more and more people are starting to understand, at some
point, we have to get past the part of calling for more killing and
start reclaiming people. For a lot of people, using remorse to
change a criminal's behavior is the only real living legacy you can
have to the death of a loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucqueroux, an early advocate of community policing,
acknowledged that some have found solace in seeing a murderer
executed. But she and others say many who have sought out ``magic''
solace _ watching poison stream through the veins or electricity
course through the body of a killer _ have not found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing awareness among victims groups that
vengeance is a dead-end solution,'' said Bruce Shapiro, author of
an upcoming book about crime victims and the politics of crime.
``On the one hand, it doesn't address the anger or the grief. It
leaves that wound open and at the same time it does nothing to
prevent other atrocities on a broad scale.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Shepard case, Shapiro said, victims
and survivors who ask the legal system not to pursue the death
penalty are routinely disregarded. And among the broader society,
there is a stigma _ sometimes silent, sometimes vocal _ that
accuses victims who don't seek the maximum punishment of not loving
those they lost enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we're seeing nationally is the rise of victims
who . . . will not settle for a narrow view of what politicians or
the media say being a victim means,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Everett turned the notion of what it means to be a victim
on its head: Four years after he watched his son's killer, Michael
Carlucci, sentenced in court, he spoke before a parole board
supporting his early release.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Everett, a Hartford, Conn. pastor, officiated
at Carlucci's wedding. Now, he and Carlucci, a supervisor at a
trucking company, are good friends who eat together regularly and
speak around the country about their decade-long journey.
</P>
<P>
   The killer who robbed Everett of ever officiating at his own
son's wedding has not strayed back to crime. But Everett said that
when he began to reach out to Carlucci, other victims who had lost
loved ones to homicide shunned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was though I had betrayed the group,'' Everett said of the
survivors support group he was attending at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He could understand the anger and grief that gripped other
survivors for years, Everett said. But he said the anger was
debilitating him, victimizing him twice over, and he felt strongly
he had to release it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had moved in a direction that they did not want to go in,''
he said of other victims he encountered. ``It was isolating.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul G. Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah, who
testifies on the rights of crime victims, said that while more have
begun to seek remedies like Everett's, they remain in the minority.
The approach of reconciliation and confronting offenders, he said,
remains most common where the offenders have committed lesser
crimes, and among juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing is that there should never be
a one-size-fits-all model for how to be a victim,'' Cassell said.
``More than anything, victims want their voices heard. Whether they
seek just punishment in the death penalty or forgiveness is less
important than that their voices be heard and respected.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the steakhouse and the locker room, the Civil War remains
one of the great male redoubts in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   For an incoherent tangle of reasons, American men continue to
read and write about it, reenact and imagine it, in ways that
sanctify and separate it from all other conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare woman who is drawn to the patriotic gore of the
Civil War. But then Drew Gilpin Faust was not your average girl
growing up in Clarke County, Va., home to the state's clarion
segregationist, Harry Byrd. As children, Drew played Grant to her
older brother's Lee. As an adult, she plumbed the shadow between
the moral rectitude of the adults there and the bite of their
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict seduced her early. While at Bryn Mawr, she raised hell
from Selma to Washington, D.C., in the civil rights and antiwar
movements. Still with her is Michael Herr's line from his book
``Dispatches'': ``I think Vietnam was what we had instead of happy
childhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the incoming dean of the Radcliffe Institute For Advanced
Study is in the vanguard of a small band of women who are Civil War
scholars of standing. Rarer still, Faust is fascinated by war's
violent death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can be more interesting than trying to figure out what
made people kill each other?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For her next book, Faust, 52, departs from an impressive oeuvre
of Southern social history and heads into the very maw of war as
she examines the effects of massive death on the North and South.
The Civil War scholar from the University of Pennsylvania considers
the carnage that left more than 600,000 dead to have been the most
significant aspect of the great moral and geopolitical fight. And
while that point may appear obvious, she says it has been never
been addressed frontally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle to digest that death,'' Faust says.
``Americans in the North and South were faced with the possibility
of death's meaninglessness. They got the notion for the first time
that God was more distant, more inscrutable. This death laid the
foundations of modern sensibilities like irony and doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women on both sides struggled as never before with the
haunting questions of theodicy _ the tension between a just, loving
God and the presence of evil. As the war wore on, they increasingly
asked how such a power could countenance such a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were battles where you could walk for a mile on bodies
without touching the ground,'' Faust says. ``This raises the
question of how the Civil War generation responded to that level of
slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony is noticeably absent in huge chunks of popular Civil War
culture today. Men eagerly reenact the killing in anodyne
pageantry. During a break in the filming of ``Gettysburg,'' a bunch
of Confederate extras actually stood up and cheered as the actor
Martin Sheen, dressed as Robert E. Lee, rode by.
</P>
<P>
   The death project grew from Faust's 1996 award-winning book
examining how white Southern women fared during the Civil War in
the absence of the men who both idolized and subjugated them in the
antebellum South. She chose for a title what Frank Zappa had named
his band: ``Mothers of Invention'' (subtitled ``Women of the
Slaveholding South in the American Civil War'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I got interested listening to the voices of the women in
`Mothers of Invention' and wondered why hasn't anyone written about
death,'' Faust says. ``I saw it as a gender issue. Women think
about death as the first outcome of war. They are so often the
designated mourners.''
</P>
<P>
   The women in her book also rekindled the unsettling feelings
Faust felt in her youth as she pondered what it meant to be a white
Southerner. ``I was torn between empathy, sympathy, and horror,''
she says of these women, whose letters to their husbands were
marbled with poignancy and jarring racism.
</P>
<P>
   Faust's intellectual curiosity spread like an oil slick from
Southern social history to the carnage itself. As a professional
historian, her path toward the meaning of death in the Civil War
appears inevitable. It raises the question of why there aren't more
women like her, populating the male world of Civil War history.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists argue that over the years male Civil War
historians have simply denied women entrance to the ranks.
Elizabeth Leonard, a Civil War historian who teaches at Colby
College, recalls the dyspeptic reaction by a male historian to an
address she gave about women nurses during the Civil War at a
history conference in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood up and dressed me down,'' Leonard recalls. ``He was
saying, `This is not your place.' To be fair, this was the only
case like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others maintain that women have never been interested in the
battlefield because they have never had to fight. So what happened
at Antietam is foreign to them. Still others wonder if women are
emotionally less comfortable confronting violent death than men.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Until recently, there were hardly any women
Civil War historians. ``There were very, very few in 1980,'' Faust
says. But since then, she has seen a dramatic increase. Adds
William McFeely, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Grant,
``I was astonished teaching at the University of Georgia at the
number of women interested in the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is relative. While the volume of entrants into the
field has grown by scores, Faust puts the number of top women at
about a dozen. In this elite cadre, she mentions Catherine Clinton,
Nina Silber, Carol Reardon, LeeAnn Whites, and Leonard. Of this
group, only Reardon is a military historian.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women studying the Civil War still steer clear of
the bloodshed, notes James McPherson, the Civil War historian at
Princeton whose history ``The Battle Cry of Freedom'' won the
Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armies and tactics for the most part don't attract women
scholars at all,'' McPherson says. ``Most of them write around the
edges. They are interested in social history or slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Reardon, who teaches at Penn State, is the obvious exception.
She has just finished a year at West Point teaching, among other
things, the art of war. She recalls being chastised by feminist
colleagues merely for choosing to pursue military history.
</P>
<P>
   ``One told me that I'd sold out to the patriarchy,'' Reardon
recalls. ``I laughed. Then she wanted me to focus on women in
military history. I told her I'm not going to write about Joan of
Arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not why there are so few women military
historians, but why there are so few military historians in
general,'' she continues. ``This is not a gender thing. It's the
whole field. A lot of it has to do with Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Older military historians who rose to prominence in the 1950s
and '60s have retired, says Reardon, while younger ones who came of
age in the '60s pursued other branches of history because of their
antiwar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard finds another reason for the absence of women in the
military field: an overtly contrarian strain to skirt the
traditional. ``So much of what feminist history is about is
rejecting the standard notion of history and trying very explicitly
not to look at what everyone else has always looked at,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Civil War history as we know it is changing.
If the wall between military and social history is falling, however
slowly, in favor of a more coherent look at both aspects of the
conflict, women like Faust deserve credit. ``Her work has never
been gendered in the narrow sense,'' says McFeely. ``She is a
historian's historian with a no-nonsense, acute mind.''
</P>
<P>
   This shift will challenge both male militarists and orthodox
feminists to think wider. ``Keeping them separate diminishes the
power of both,'' says Faust of the two disciplines. ``We'll have
more women looking at all of these questions, breaking down the
boundaries between `I do military history' and `I do social
history.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Weber is a case in point. Weber, 37, a former reporter
for the Sacramento (Calif.) Bee, is McPherson's lone female
doctoral candidate in Civil War history. She exemplifies the new
generation of female Civil War historian bent on understanding all
facets of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Within the military sphere, Weber focuses on Fredericksburg, the
Virginia battle in late 1862 where Lee's forces slaughtered
poorly-led Union troops. Her dissertation examines the civilian
will of both sides to continue the war in the face of such horrific
losses. To address this subject competently, she notes, ``You have
to know the battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber is hesitant even to talk openly about why women eschew
military history, in part out of fear that some of her thoughts
will ignite feminists. Still, she wonders out loud, ``Is life more
precious to women? Are women less comfortable with these losses
than men? They're the mothers, after all. I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Faust, who will assume her duties at the Radcliffe Institute on
Jan. 1, dismisses emotional differences of gender and cites instead
the male clubbiness among Civil War historians that women have long
found hostile. More important, she adds, women scholars have
avoided military history because, ironically, it has been held in
lower regard within the academic community and considered a tougher
route to a successful career.
</P>
<P>
   Weber is unfazed. ``I know hardly any women interested in
military history,'' she says. ``But I am interested in good
stories, and this is the best story in American history.''

FUHRMAN TAKES THE GLOVES OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDPOINT, Idaho _ Nestled in a pine-filled valley between the
rugged Bitterroot Mountains and a snow-capped column of smaller
peaks, Mark Fuhrman can nearly see Ruby Ridge from his isolated
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   If this is Elba for the former cop whose racist invective helped
free O. J. Simpson, many believe it's a fitting exile among the
scattered network of white supremacists and neo-Nazis drawn to the
wilds of northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   For Fuhrman, the past is always present in a pilloried American
life that is a fascinating example of uncommon resilience, rather
than redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman bristles at the suggestion that he feels a kinship with
the Aryan Nations, located in nearby Hayden Lake, or to Ruby Ridge,
where separatist Randy Weaver's wife and son were killed in a
standoff with federal marshals in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But he also concedes that he is nearly powerless to alter his
image as a national symbol of bigotry and rogue police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the carcass that the ravens come down and pick on,''
Fuhrman said recently, in his first extensive interview in years.
``Most people bury their dead, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   If not, most try to keep the corpses out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when Michael Skakel, a Kennedy cousin, appears at a
probable-cause hearing in the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley, the man
who is widely credited with reinvigorating that long-dormant case
is not expected within 2,000 miles of the Stamford, Conn.,
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   After protests by ABC News staff, Fuhrman was dropped by ``Good
Morning America'' as a paid consultant during the case. So, as the
national media revisit the slaying, the author of ``Murder in
Greenwich,'' a best-selling book that named Skakel the likely
killer, will be watching instead from his 20-acre mountain ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman says he enjoys the seclusion, but in a three-hour
interview he also spoke about the drawbacks of a life consigned to
the fringes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to just be the Mark Fuhrman before June 13, 1994,''
he said, referring to the day when Simpson was arrested for murder.
``But that's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Impossible because, although Fuhrman is praised by the Moxley
family as a person and detective, millions of people share the view
of Alan Dershowitz, one of the Dream Team attorneys who represented
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who harbors the most primitive racist views,''
Dershowitz says. ``He has returned to the guise of a smiling,
gentle, misunderstood man. But he's a virulent racist, sexist, and
anti-Semite who is the most dangerous kind because people like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's impressions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dorthy Moxley, the mother of Martha Moxley, counts herself among
those who like Fuhrman. ``I was impressed with him,'' she says.
``He was very articulate and very smart. I think the world and all
of Mark Fuhrman. He just couldn't be nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moxley says that Fuhrman's book, while helpful, was not the
pivotal element that led to murder charges against Skakel. The case
has been a group effort, she says, and much of the credit should go
to Fairfield County State's Attorney Jonathan C. Benedict, who she
says scrupulously reexamined the evidence and requested an
investigative grand jury in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, however, said in the interview that staff from
Benedict's office told him they planned to use ``Murder in
Greenwich'' as an outline for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, such a statement is one more suspected example
of the embellishments, and worse, that have been linked to the
Fuhrman persona.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious statements, the racist rantings that he
committed to tape and replayed years later during the Simpson
trial, continue to shadow Fuhrman. But now, removed to the
mountains, Fuhrman has found a life that is lonelier but more
lucrative than the adrenaline-pumping career he pursued on the
streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old is at work on ``Murder in Spokane,'' a book
about a serial killer. The book follows the success of ``Murder in
Brentwood'' and ``Murder in Greenwich.'' Fuhrman also is the host
of a weekly radio call-in show in Spokane, Wash., about 80 miles
from his Idaho ranch. The show allows him to air his unambiguous
opinions on American crime, morals, race, and _ inevitably _ O. J.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman _ tall, relaxed, lean, and muscular _ says he is content
with the domestic routines he has fashioned with his third wife and
two children. ``Living in Idaho is very peaceful. Hunting, fishing,
raising horses,'' he said, looking out a hotel window in Spokane
before heading to the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman projects an image of the Marlboro Man at peace, but a
lingering anger appears to smolder just below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   To Fuhrman's thinking, the culture that made him a pariah _ a
society once honorable, self-sacrificing, and admirable _ has been
polluted by political correctness and ethnic pandering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On racial profiling, quotas
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is a myth, he says. Affirmative action can lead
to dangerously low professional standards. And perhaps sports
stars, who in increasing numbers commit crimes, have a gene that
predisposes them to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you right now, there's no such thing as racial
profiling. . . . I'm really sorry, guys, but the very people who
are committing the crimes are creating the racial profile,''
Fuhrman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell a policeman that he can't even react to a certain
crime because someone is a certain color, all you'll have is a
policeman who rolls up his window and puts on his Walkman.''
</P>
<P>
   On affirmative action, Fuhrman says that more recruiting should
be done in minority neighborhoods. But he scoffs at the notion of
quotas, and links efforts to increase racial and gender diversity
at the Los Angeles Police Department to relaxed physical
requirements at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get qualified people of all races to be great cops
and detectives, but maybe they don't want to,'' Fuhrman said.
</P>
<P>
   Such outspokenness has attracted a loyal and growing audience on
his radio call-in show. Called ``All About Crime,'' the Thursday
program is the station's highest-rated show in the 2 to 4 p.m.
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like in the NFL, we have some really terrible,
terrible behavior _ like murder,'' Fuhrman said on a recent show.
Later, he asked his listeners whether the American sports culture
might be breeding criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The brass at KXLY-AM in Spokane like the Fuhrman phenomenon so
much that they are considering adding a second show during the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to talking about crime on radio, Mark is one of
the most qualified anywhere,'' said Mike Fitzsimmons, the regular
talk-show host who plays second fiddle to Fuhrman on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman's notoriety, far from being a disadvantage, has become a
reason for tuning in, says Jim Bickel, the station's program
director. Bickel even jokes about the Simpson defense allegation
that Fuhrman manufactured physical evidence. ``Do you know how
Mark's neighbors know it's spring? Because he's out in the garden
planting gloves,'' Bickel said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Joking aside, Fuhrman's life changed irrevocably after he lied
under oath about whether he had used racial epithets or bragged
about beating minorities. And although Fuhrman notes that he
retired from the force in 1995 on the 20th anniversary of his hire
_ a common practice that allows him to collect an estimated $25,000
annual pension _ it is widely believed that he was pressured to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman then moved to Sandpoint, a small-town mecca for artists
where city leaders tout a focus more akin to Greenwich Village than
the interests of a small group of vocal hatemongers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have militia walking down the street. We wouldn't
tolerate them,'' Fuhrman said.
</P>
<P>
   But a racial separatist ran for mayor last year, prompting a
tough counter-campaign by human rights groups and financial
resources from Coldwater Creek, a mail-order clothing business that
is the largest private employer in north Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `There's no vindication'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The supremacist, who lost, had flooded mailboxes in the past
with what a Coldwater Creek spokesman, David Gunter, called a
``convoluted'' and ``hate-based'' message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is not very focused, and it is anything but
representative of the Sandpoint area and north Idaho as a whole,''
Gunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Like misperceptions of Sandpoint, Fuhrman says, he also
considers himself unfairly demonized. Fuhrman lays much of the
blame on a news media he calls more interested in political
correctness than whether the tapes that unveiled him as a perjurer
reveal his true character.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman insists his work on the Moxley murder was not an attempt
at rehabilitation. ``I can never do anything that would vindicate
anything I did in the Simpson case. There's no vindication to take
away the words I used,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people are going to call me a racist solely because of
the Simpson case, it's absurd. If that's all they think and they've
done no reading either way, they got the opinion that Johnnie
Cochran wanted them to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, Simpson's lead defense lawyer, once branded Fuhrman a
``lying, perjuring, genocidal racist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I am,'' Fuhrman said. ``I'd say to Mr. Cochran:
`What have you done for your race? I spent 20 years protecting
them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fuhrman acknowledges he made a colossal mistake when he
told a Simpson lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, that he had not used racial
slurs. ``I was dancing as fast as I could,'' Fuhrman said. ``I had
32 million people watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman insists that his taped racist remarks were role-playing,
prompted by an aspiring screenwriter who also asked him to imitate
a ``good'' cop, ``dumb'' cop, and other variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was absolutely absent of relevance,'' Fuhrman said of the
tape, although he concedes that it was ``irresponsible'' for him to
have made the comments. ``My life changed, and it changed for all
the wrong reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz disagrees with Fuhrman's assessment. Far from being
mere role-playing, Dershowitz says, the tape corroborated the
racist sentiments that others had heard from Fuhrman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fuhrman denied knowing her, a real estate agent
testified in the Simpson trial that Fuhrman told her all blacks
should be incinerated, and that he would pull over interracial
couples and fabricate evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a horrible man,'' Dershowitz says, ``and no one should
give him any credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fuhrman concludes, he has managed to insulate his 7- and
9-year-old children, a girl and a boy, from these kinds of
comments.
</P>
<P>
   But the time will come when they will ask what he did to be so
hated. Then, Fuhrman says, he will reply: ``Dad made some mistakes.
Don't make them.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, and adds, ``But Dad was a good detective.''

HOW OUR CHOICES FACE THE TEST OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political scientists, psychologists, and
sociologists spend endless hours unlocking the mystery of how, and
why, voters change their minds. Meanwhile, historians are changing
their minds about the choices voters have made already.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, in 50 years Harry Truman has gone from a rube
to a prophet, and Dwight Eisenhower has been transformed twice,
from military hero to snoozy caretaker to _ the latest
interpretation _ canny politician. And though the balladeers who
sing tributes to John F. Kennedy like to play off the Irish song
``Johnny, we hardly knew ye,'' the more accurate remark, about
Kennedy and others, goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Johnny, we hardly recognize ye.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism consists of history written on the run, but the men
and women who sit, think, and write serious history often come to
vastly different conclusions. And so, too, does the public, which
is never reluctant to alter the pencil sketches that comprise its
impressions of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons, of course, is new material that rises, like
ground water, to the surface over time _ or fresh archival
documents that are released years after the first drafts of history
are written.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those documents become available because complicated
legal strictures have expired (typical example: ``Nothing may be
released until 50 years after the death of all the principals'') or
after archivists have finished processing them (typical example:
the tapes of President Johnson's first months in office, which were
transcribed meticulously and annotated insightfully by Michael
Beschloss before they were released, beginning only in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But more than the geology of history _ the raw materials _
changes over time. The climate of history changes, too.
</P>
<P>
   World War I, for example, has always been regarded as a dreadful
conflict produced by misunderstandings and misreadings by leaders
who stumbled into war. But in recent years, historians have been
willing to consider that the beginning of the Great War might have
been produced, or at least abetted, by the cold calculations of
clear-thinking men, some in London, others in Berlin. The Vietnam
War, first considered a pure product of Cold War tensions, then a
tragedy of hubris and human error, is undergoing a brisk
revisionism of its own, with some modern thinkers willing to
reconsider the causes and results of the war _ and willing to
conclude that the conflict might have been far more noble than the
conventional consensus acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   These wars are part of the backdrop of American presidential
elections, and as views about the conflicts are altered, so, too,
are views about the leaders who prosecuted the wars _ or who
succeeded wartime presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson, the preacher's son and university president who
campaigned for reelection in 1916 on the basis of having kept the
United States out of war, led the nation into war only a few months
later. Just as Wilson changed his mind, history's view of Wilson
has changed, too. Where once Wilson was a romantic idealist, now he
is regarded as a stubborn ideologue. (Such conclusions often say as
much about the contemporary period as about the past. Today, when
ideology is out of fashion and the two parties are about to
nominate moderates for president, ideologues are regarded as
stubborn rather than as courageous.)
</P>
<P>
   In this year's campaign, the Democratic candidate, Vice
President Al Gore, is sometimes denigrated as a stern intellectual
with effete interests such as the environment, nuclear deterrence,
and government organization. If he is elected and the times call
for insight on those issues, he may be rewarded by history. The
Republican candidate, Governor George W. Bush of Texas, sometimes
is dismissed for his easygoing personality. If he's elected and his
bedside manner ministers the nation through a crisis impossible to
foresee today, he will win points in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   But the transformation, for example, of President Nixon from
cold-blooded Cold Warrior to stumbling trickster to coldly
calculating miscreant and, more recently, to diplomatic magus
reflects more than the passage of time. It reflects a change in
perspective. So, too, does the change in Johnson's image from
small-minded Vietnam commander to big-hearted social visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Few historians would argue that Johnson succeeded in Vietnam,
and the sober roll call of the dead on the walls of the Vietnam
memorial in Washington, D.C., is testimony to the price the nation
paid for the conflict. Even so, Johnson's reputation is
experiencing something of a revival, even in a period that is
skeptical of the sort of big-government social programs that were
at the center of the Great Society.
</P>
<P>
   In his monumental 1961 Trevelyan lectures on the nature of
history, E. H. Carr, who was both a journalist (assistant editor of
The Times of London during the World War II years) and a historian
(fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and author of numerous
volumes on Soviet Russia), explained how the view of history
shifts:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnant failures are not unknown in history. History
recognizes what I may call `delayed achievement': the apparent
failures of today may turn out to have made a vital contribution to
the achievement of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr argues, moreover, that the historical verdict may be shaped
by ``things that have not yet happened.'' The eventual triumph of
the civil rights movement, for example, put both Kennedy and
Johnson on the right side of history _ and besmirches the
presidential reputation of Eisenhower, whose enthusiasm for the
1954 Supreme Court school-desegregation case was, at best, muted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton often is lost in reveries about his own place
in history, and he is given to speculate that he may eventually
find a place in the upper-middle ranks of presidents, not in the
same category as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln (the
reigning champions) but neither in the same category as Andrew
Johnson (the only other president to be impeached, and universally
regarded among the worst American presidents).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton takes solace in the resurgence in the reputation of
Truman, who is revered today but who never approached cult status
in his White House days, when the byword sometimes was ``to err is
Truman.'' Today, however, he is regarded as an inspirational
figure, often for the very same reasons he was denigrated while in
office: his earthy language (now hailed as plain-spoken honesty),
his plodding approach to problems (now celebrated as the American
work ethic made incarnate), his stubbornness (now saluted as an
emblem of his integrity), and his reliance on intuition (now
regarded as proof that he was comfortable with himself).
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to divine how history may regard some of the
familiar recent presidents. Will Ronald Reagan, for example, be
rewarded for altering Americans' views of government or punished
for the deficits he ran up? Will George Bush be celebrated for
winning the Gulf War or for failing to invade Baghdad and topple
Saddam Hussein?
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest mystery may be Clinton. The president's
job-approval rating from historians will be affected by the
economy, by his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, by his impeachment
in the US House of Representatives and acquittal by the Senate,
even by whether Gore is elected to succeed him. But it will also
depend on events that will transpire after he leaves office. The
verdict on his efforts in the Middle East (where he sought peace)
and the Balkans (where he was willing to go to war), for example,
almost surely will be affected by whether those regions experience
peace or war in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford historian Geoffrey Barraclough once traced how the
interpretation of 19th-century Europe evolved in the 20th century.
``The historian who takes his stand not in 1815 but in the present
will see the same period in different proportions,'' he wrote.
``His starting-point will be the global system of international
politics in which we live today and his main concern will be to
explain how it arose.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus the ultimate irony of history: The past can be
redefined by the future. It turns out that the portrait of a
president is not a stilllife.

ROOT BEER REGAINING ITS FIZZ AFTER YEARS OF FLAT SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON DICKSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ Rich, frothy, sweet, spicy and creamy.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply rooted in American history. A favorite beverage of
nostalgia buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer appears to be making a big comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs, retailers and soda jerks in Dallas-Fort Worth are
reporting renewed interest in the carbonated concoction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lady in here who saw our sign from an airplane window
and drove straight here from D/FW Airport,'' said Keith Chauhan,
manager of an A&AMP;W All American Food restaurant that opened this
year in Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   An A&AMP;W restaurant has opened in Dallas, and one is being built
at Harwood Road and Grapevine Highway in North Richland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer aficionados prefer it from the tap and in a frosty
mug, Chauhan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people bring their kids in here,'' he said. ``They
want their root beer in a frosty mug. You don't mix ice with it
because that spoils the taste.''
</P>
<P>
   At Plano-based Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, which makes three of the
nation's top-selling root beers _ A&AMP;W, Hires and IBC _ year-to-date
sales of root beer have increased 6 percent, spokeswoman Emily
Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   That is remarkable considering that overall sales of carbonated
beverages have increased less than 1 percent during the same time,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just available in more places now,'' Livingston said.
``The increased availability is reminding people how much they like
it. These brands have a lot of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern beverage can be traced to the 1870s. Early root beer
makers experimented with various ingredients, including herbs,
wintergreen, juniper and sassafras extract.
</P>
<P>
   Root beer has been popular for much of the 20th century.
Teetotalers touted it as a temperance alternative to alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Because most root beer has little or no caffeine, some consider
it a healthier alternative to other soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But through the years, mega-colas such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi
seized much of the soft drink market. Despite figures that show
growth in root beer sales, it has less than 3 percent of the soft
drink market share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who love the foamy drink are fiercely loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tastes a lot better than the others,'' said Saginaw
resident Martin Cantu, an airplane mechanic at Kitty Hawk in
Grapevine who tipped back a frosty mug during a recent lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I like it a lot. It's just a lot different taste.
It doesn't have the carbonation that Coke does. It's a different
taste that is almost addicting. Once you've had it, you've got to
have it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Stanford of Colleyville treated his nieces and nephews _
Elizabeth Hammon, 7, Rebecca Hammon, 5, and Jacob Pruett, 10 _ to
cold mugs of root beer on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's making a comeback. It never left us,''
Stanford said. ``We drink it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Main Street Barber Shop in Grapevine, which sells sodas made
with sugar (no corn syrup allowed) in 1950s-style bottles,
customers drink almost as much Frostie Root Beer as they do Dr
Pepper, co-owner Al Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Grapevine's newest restaurants, Big Buck Brewery and
Steakhouse, plans to sell homemade root beer on tap and in bottles,
an official said. The restaurant is expected to open about Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's three Michigan restaurants, root beer is second
to Coca-Cola in sales, Big Buck President William Rolinski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hit this weekend at our store in Gaylord, Mich. One
gentleman bought 32 cases of it,'' he said. ``Ours is very sweet,
and it's got a light froth. We use beet sugar in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people often are reluctant to order root beer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have an aversion to root beer, but the parents
say, `Son, you've got to taste this.' Then their eyes light up,''
he said. ``We're trying to find those old flavors that people
remember when they were kids.''

WHY BUSH HAS THE PRE-CONVENTION ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Democrats, this is a time of puzzlement and wonder. The
economy is going great guns. Most people think the country is on
the right track. Compared with 1992's torrent, there's barely a
ripple of discontent abroad in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in poll after poll, George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee-to-be, bests Al Gore, his Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the confusion are the economic determinists who have
peered deep into their multiple-regression analyses and declared
the election decided. ``Statistical Al'' will not only win the
White House, they say, he'll win it going away.
</P>
<P>
   But if those mathematical models are a confident coronet playing
a sprightly Democratic victory march, history sounds a less certain
trumpet. Only four vice presidents _ John Adams, Thomas Jefferson,
Martin Van Buren, and George H. W. Bush _ have risen immediately
from second-in-command to the top post absent the death (or
resignation) of the president, and only Van Buren and Bush fit the
example of a VP running to succeed a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The political disconnect Gore faces was on stunning display in a
week when his campaign underwent yet another overhaul as US
Commerce Secretary William Daley replaced the ailing (and allegedly
abrasive) Tony Coelho as campaign chairman. On the very day Gore
began a campaign swing to highlight the Clinton administration's
economic record, a Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that by 46
to 41 percent, respondents said Bush would be a better steward of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Which means Gore has a lot of persuading to do; while he sees
himself as the heir to Clinton's economic credit, voters seem to
view the VP more like the proverbial fly, who, perched atop the
oxen's horn, declares: ``That was easy, let's go plow another
field.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem for Gore, says CNN political analyst William
Schneider, is that the current economic boom lacks an obvious
cause. There has been no war as there was under FDR, no tax cut as
there was under JFK, no combination of military buildup and tax
reduction as there was under Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the economy is a political disconnect, it is hardly the
only one. Look at five key determinants of a presidential vote and
it becomes clear just how much Bush has succeeded in seizing the
pre-convention advantage. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Leadership &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason Bush continues to outpoll Gore?
</P>
<P>
   People see him as the stronger leader, says Republican pollster
Neil Newhouse. ``That is the single most important attribute that
drives voter support,'' Newhouse contends.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, a
nonpartisan political newsletter, concurs. ``I have always believed
that leadership is a lot more important than what your position is
on tax cuts or guns. I think it is the number one measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post/ABC poll crystallizes Bush's advantage. By a margin of
65 to 30 percent, those polled called Bush a strong leader, while
only 48 percent said the same of Gore, with almost as many _ 45
percent _ saying he was not.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gore may be suffering the slings and arrows that come
with the post. ``The vice president is by definition a shadow, and
shadows never lead, whereas George W. has been the chief executive
of a large state,'' says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will have an opportunity to burnish his image as a leader
when he emerges from Clinton's shadow and accepts his party's
nomination at the August national convention. But for now, award
this crucial category to Bush. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ability &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One crucial test any potential president must pass in voters'
minds is whether he or she is big enough for the job, a sizing up
that appraises both experience and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Voters rarely judge House members or mayors as big enough for
the job, for example, while big-state senators and governors pass
the experiential test almost without further questions.
</P>
<P>
   As Vice President and a certified policy wonk, Gore clearly
holds an advantage here. Still, it's not a prohibitive one, for
after several months of adroit campaigning, Bush has made some
progress to counter his reputation as a bit of a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is seen as more experienced, and thus the safer choice,
though as we have now learned, Bush got grades at Yale that were
(in some cases) higher than Gore's at Harvard, so Bush is not
stupid,'' says Larry Sabato, director of the University of
Virginia's Center for Governmental Studies. ``But he does have his
father's gene of sounding incoherent and being grammatically
incorrect with appalling regularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Give ability to Gore _ but more narrowly than one might have
expected only a few short months ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Likeability &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans are fully capable of electing presidents they aren't
particularly fond of. Exhibit A: Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton demonstrate, if
voters are naturally inclined to like a candidate, they are willing
to overlook, or forgive, a multitude of sins. Which is a problem
for Gore, who, more than Bush, has a personal style that too
frequently comes across as patronizing and pedantic or
apple-polishing and off-putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Dr. Fell syndrome,'' says Hess, offering a version of
17th-century English satirist Thomas Brown's stinging quatrain
about the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. ``I do not like thee, Dr.
Fell. Why it is, I cannot tell. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, may benefit from a time-tested electoral
impulse, suggests Schneider: In picking the next president, voters
often seek what was missing in the last one. Thus they opted for
the youthful dynamism of JFK after the sleepy Eisenhower years, the
order of Nixon after the chaos of Johnson, the morality of Carter
after the mendacity of Nixon, the strength of Reagan after the
shilly-shallying of Carter.
</P>
<P>
   So what are they looking for this year?
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's best hypothesis: ``After Clinton, people are tired
of someone who is so totally political and are looking for someone
who is not completely driven by politics.''
</P>
<P>
   So, despite his oft-noted smirk, award likeability to Bush,
hands down. As far as Gore is concerned, that category is gone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trustworthiness &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A president needn't be trusted to win, though it certainly
helps: Clinton and Nixon are probably the only two chief executives
in this century elected despite widespread public doubts about
their character and probity.
</P>
<P>
   As a vice president in prosperous times, campaigning on a
platform of more of the same against a lightly accomplished
governor of a weak-executive state, Gore should own this one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he doesn't. Bush scores every bit as well on this quality.
That speaks in part of the residue from the Clinton scandals, in
part of Gore's own missteps and evasions, from the Buddhist temple
fund-raiser to ``no controlling legal authority'' to his
I-drank-iced-tea-and-had-to-pee defense as to why he missed
fund-raising specifics others in the same meeting heard, in part to
his dizzying array of personal reinventions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the campaign trail, Gore has developed a Chicken
Little problem by labeling everything Bush proposes as ``risky'' or
``reckless,'' charges that have now become self-parodic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, though plagued by some concerns that he remains a
right-wing Texan, is buttressed by the nation's relatively good
feelings about his family. Call trustworthiness a tie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Issue positions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is another category that should be a Gore strength,
particularly since President Clinton reduced Democratic exposure on
matters such as welfare and the budget. Concerns such as improving
education, shoring up Social Security, reducing gun violence, and
improving health care are all matters where the Democrats
traditionally enjoy an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   However, several recent surveys reveal that voters don't yet see
a distinct Democratic advantage. Gore has a real advantage on
health care and the environment, while Bush is seen as clearly
superior on crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But on most other matters _ the economy, education, Social
Security and Medicare, and foreign affairs, for example _ the two
are so close it's a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a Gore advantage, but right now I would call it a
draw,'' says Democratic consultant Mary Anne Marsh. In part, that's
because voters aren't focused, in part, because Gore himself isn't
focused, Marsh says. ``He hasn't been telling people who he is and
why he should be president. Until very recently, he has been
attacking Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Attack is a mode that has worked well for Gore in the past;
during the primary season, he proved better at scaring voters off
rival Bill Bradley's proposals than offering compelling ideas of
his own. Yet the news that unexpectedly strong tax revenues will
soon lead the federal government to reviseits surplus figures
upward once again may undermine a central Gore charge: that Bush's
$1.3 trillion tax cut is too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take Vice President Gore's risky club away,'' says
Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban League and former
director of the Congressional Budget Office. ``If there are
surpluses of $1.5 to $2 trillion anticipated over the next decade
in the non-Social Security portion of the budget, there is clearly
room for tax cuts and other initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, then, on the five most important considerations in
choosing a president, Bush claims two, leadership and likeability.
Gore clearly leads in one: perception of ability. That leaves two
areas _ trust and issues _ that are currently close enough to be
tossups. The candidate who ultimately prevails in three of five is
the one most likely to relocate to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue come
January.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean? Fie on the mathematical models: 2000 seems
destined to join 1916, 1960, 1968, and 1976 as a truly close
election year, one where the campaign decides the outcome rather
than merely reinforces underlying feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to start paying attention.

INDEPENDENT REPUBLICAN GROUP TO HIT GORE WITH TV ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the important task of building a moderate image
for George W. Bush begins, a group with no formal link to the
candidate or the Republican Party will be taking a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its official sounding name, the Republican Leadership
Council is an independent group of Republicans concerned about the
rightward drift of the party. Still, with its sizable war chest, it
played a major role in the GOP primary as it blitzed the airwaves
with ads scolding Steve Forbes and warning him against engaging in
negative, attack politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the general election, it is poised once again to serve
Bush's interests by targeting his opponent with television ads.
With the Democratic National Committee having already launched
television ads for Al Gore, groups like the RLC will be picking up
the slack for Bush, at least in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council was born as a result of one
family's dissatisfaction with candidates it considered too
conservative. When Lewis Eisenberg's three daughters were
teenagers, they were turned on to Republican politics, volunteering
at the GOP's 1988 convention in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Patrick J. Buchanan delivered his harsh
rhetoric at the Republicans' Houston convention, leaving the
Eisenberg daughters feeling that the party was hostile to women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made them feel as if there was no home for socially
inclusive Republicans,'' said Eisenberg, a wealthy investor and
chairman of the New York-New Jersey Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The group, backed by moderate Republicans with thick bankrolls
such as Henry Kravis, the New York financier, and John Moran, a
private investor who led Bob Dole's presidential fund-raising
effort, promotes fiscally conservative candidates with more liberal
approaches to social matters.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican presidential primary, the group blistered
Forbes before he even made a peep. So vociferous was the RLC with
its television ads and press releases denouncing Forbes that many
accused the group of being no more than a front for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Kieran Mahoney, a New York Republican strategist advising
the RLC, said the intention was to steer the candidates and the
party to the center of the GOP road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main goal was to see that the Republican Party did not end
up committing suicide in March so that they might live to fight
another day,'' Mahoney said. ``I think they were successful in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Forbes would have been more successful without the RLC's
presence is open for debate. But now that Bush faces a Democrat,
the RLC is prepared to enter the fray once again. The group's
leaders say they have not yet decided what tack to take, or how
much money they will spend to execute their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A recent RLC survey conducted by Mahoney provides a blueprint
for the committee's intentions. The survey was conducted in 17
presidential swing states, the likely targets of television
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   An RLC ad campaign could be expected to stress Bush's education
ideas, for example. According to the survey, swing-state voters
approved of Bush's record of ``testing students in grades 3 through
8 in reading and math in order to track academic achievement'' by
83.6 percent to 11.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More advertising may emphasize the Clinton-Gore administration's
blunders while raising money for the 1996 election. The survey
found that by 63.2 percent to 19 percent, swing-state voters
believe the administration ``acted unethically by making campaign
fund-raising calls from the White House and selling overnight stays
in the Lincoln bedroom to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the RLC may promote the notion that ``it's time for a
change,'' a common tactic when attempting to oust an officeholder.
The survey found that by 59.3 percent to 35.5 percent, voters in
the 17 swing states agreed that ``the Clinton-Gore administration
has been in office too long and it is time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans approve of the RLC and its aims. Greg
Mueller, Forbes's communications director, said that Ronald
Reagan's strong stance against abortion would have cost him the
group's support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never good to have battles with your base,'' said
Mueller. ``I don't think their efforts have been very good for the
unity of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   And with 13 of the RLC's 23 advisory committee members
supporting Bush during the primaries and eight members of the
executive committee serving as ``pioneers'' for their fund-raising
prowess on Bush's behalf, the group was suspected of acting as a
wing of the Bush campaign. Under the law, third-party groups are
barred from coordinating their actions with a specific campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg and executive director Mark Miller denied any
collusion with the Bush campaign, and Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer
said the Bush campaign had no coordination with the RLC.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Young, a Republican strategist who advised Forbes,
scoffed at the claim that there is no coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is,'' said Young. ``You're never going to get
anybody to admit to that. It's a fairly common practice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gore headquarters, officials are trying to prove that
Bush is coordinating, pointing to the repeated ``coincidence'' of
groups launching ad campaigns on a particular subject just as Bush
begins to talk about that very topic.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said the RLC and other groups
have such close connections to Bush that they are doing his ``dirty
work'' for him, allowing Bush to stay above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is out there saying he's going to run a
positive campaign, when in fact, his cronies, lieutenants, and
cohorts are out there engaging in misleading, negative TV ads,''
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleischer said the Gore campaign is complaining just to
justify breaking its anti-soft money pledge. Gore had said the
Democratic National Committee would not run any campaign ads unless
the Republican National Committee did so first. With the Republican
National Committee holding its fire and groups like the RLC
stepping forward, Gore appears to have realized he made a tactical
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard Vice President Gore criticize NARAL or the
Sierra Club for running soft-money advertisements against Governor
Bush, have we?'' Fleischer said. ``This is more politics as usual
for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential campaigns are frequently a battleground for
third-party groups trying to promote their own agendas and back
their preferred candidate while staying within the technical letter
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, teachers' and labor unions and abortion
rights groups are expected to help Gore, providing foot soldiers
for phone banks and money for advertisements. Business groups and
the RLC don't have nearly as many members, but will try to
influence voters with ad campaigns in order to help Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the general election strategy, Eisenberg and his
family are satisfied, having watched Republicans feature three
candidates to their liking _ Bush, John McCain, and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughters are feeling that we are doing better,'' he said.

REGULATORS SOUND ALARM ON PAYDAY LOAN VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Web site text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who can't make it from paycheck to paycheck, there's a
new form of what some regulators and consumer advocates call
``predatory lending'' or ``legal loan sharking'' _ Internet payday
loan sites.
</P>
<P>
   A new twist on existing concerns about millions of people taking
out high-interest payday advances in states that don't cap interest
rates, these Internet sites raise the ante even more, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the technology can make available these short-term payday
loans to any applicant, even if he lives in a state such as
Massachusetts, which caps interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A payday loan, also known as a deferred deposit, is typically an
advance of a few hundred dollars on a person's paycheck for up to
two weeks, with fees of $15 to $20 for each $100 advanced. While
the fees don't seem like much on a dollar basis, they amount to
more than 400 percent when calculated as an annual percentage rate.
Some people get into a never-ending cycle of going from one payday
loan to another, without being able to pay back the principal.
</P>
<P>
   To warn Massachusetts residents about this new trend, the state
Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation and the Division
of Banks just released a report entitled ``Internet Payday Loans _
Risky Business.'' Their survey of payday loan Web sites found some
of them engaging in such questionable practices as failing to
disclose fees and the true cost of a loan figured as an APR, or
asking for private information such as an ATM PIN number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about payday lending. First and
foremost, because the interest rates you're looking at are so high,
consumers are going to be ripped off by these places,'' said Steven
Antonakes, senior deputy commissioner for the Division of Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Internet sites that do list APRs _ a disclosure required
of banks under federal and state truth-in-lending statutes _ the
rates typically range from 300 to 500 percent on an annual basis,
although one listed an equivalent annual rate as high as 6,205
percent, according to the state report. Some payday lenders are
considered banks, while others are nonbanks that may ``rent'' bank
charters.
</P>
<P>
   The payday lender typically gets its money back by depositing
the borrower's post-dated personal check or making an authorized
electronic debit from the borrower's account. It makes its profits
from the fees attached to the loans.
</P>
<P>
   The payday loan industry emerged over the last few years, an
outgrowth of federal legislation allowing interstate banking, a
decline in national finance companies willing to make small loans,
and deregulation of interest rates. As a result, payday loan
outlets have proliferated in states that do not regulate interest
rates. Consumer advocates, community activists, banking officials,
and bank regulators have increasingly raised concerns about some of
the payday lending industry's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., spoke out against one industry practice in
particular as ``unbecoming'' _ that of renting out a charter from a
bank in a state without interest rate caps in order to circumvent
another state's caps and set up a payday loan outlet there. She
ordered her staff to review what can be done on a regulatory level
about charter renting and called on lawmakers and bank trade
associations to do their part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice of renting a charter merely to collect a fee to
allow a high-cost payday lender to circumvent state law is
inappropriate. It may be legal _ but I don't like it,'' said Tanoue
in a speech before the Greenlining Institute, a California
organization promoting economic development in low-income and
minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts has an interest rate cap of 23 percent and
has been largely protected from payday loan outlets, the appearance
of Internet payday loan sites may change all the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the banking laws are geographically based. With the
Internet, you're dealing with a medium where geography doesn't
count as much as it used to,'' said state regulator Antonakes.
</P>
<P>
   And while Massachusetts regulators have not received any
complaints about payday loans, whether obtained on the Internet or
through a payday loan outlet, they did shut down one payday loan
outlet in downtown Boston in April. Regulators said the outlet,
inside a Mail Boxes Etc. on Milk Street, illegally took
applications and processed documents for a Delaware bank for
short-term loans with APRs of more than 476 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But payday lenders say they provide a much-needed service to
people who are in need of short-term cash and have no other access
to credit, to pay for an emergency such as car repairs or a broken
refrigerator. Traditional banks rarely make loans in small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   In response to concerns about some of the industry's practices,
however, a national trade group of payday lenders adopted reforms
in January to curb abuses. Members of the Community Financial
Services Association of America, as the group is known, must comply
with these ``Best Practices'':
</P>
<P>
   --Full disclosure of service fee as both a dollar amount and an
APR.
</P>
<P>
   --No threat or pursuit of criminal action against customers who
have not made payment on their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   --Give customers the right to rescind their transaction at no
cost on or before the close of the following business day.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide consumer information about the responsible use of
payday loans and advise against long-term misuse.
</P>
<P>
   --Limit rollovers of payday loans to four, if states where they
operate allow such rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payday advances are supposed to help consumers out of
financial trouble, not get them into it,'' said Billy Webster,
president of the Washington-based trade group, in a statement
accompanying the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer advocates, regulators, and traditional banking
officials remain concerned that unsuspecting people will get into a
cycle of living from payday loan to payday loan, and they are
trying to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A payday loan is bordering, if you will, on loan sharking,''
said Kevin F. Kiley, executive vice president and chief operating
officer for the Massachusetts Banker Association. Over the last
several months, the 210-member industry group has distributed more
than 60,000 pamphlets entitled ``Beware of Easy Credit'' to educate
consumers about predatory lending in general, although not
specifically about payday lending.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley advised that people in need of short-term cash seek out
alternatives to a payday loan, such as a credit-card advance, a
home-equity loan, or a small loan from a credit union, presuming
they have access to such alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   And the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America and the
National Consumer Law Center, with offices in Washington and
Boston, have proposed model state legislation to govern payday
loans and license lenders.

A GILT-FREE GLIMPSE OF THE VICTORIAN AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new four-part PBS miniseries ``The 1900 House'' is kind of a
Victorian version of ``Survivor,'' except on this show there's no
million-dollar prize and all the volunteers long to get tossed out
of the thoroughly demodernized London townhouse in which they are
stuck for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and Joyce Bowler and their four children were chosen by
Wall to Wall Television, the British producers, from more than 400
families who applied to live as middle-class people would have in
1900. Joyce, a school inspector and history buff, was eager to go
back in time. Paul, a Royal Marine, agreed to participate because
he felt he owed it to Joyce, who has coped with the challenges of
being a military wife. The family has moved 13 times in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Paul's well-intentioned payback turned out to be
a disaster, especially for Joyce, who learned firsthand that an
ordinary woman's life in 1900 was a mind-numbing round of drudgery
and boredom. The series provides a dose of reality for romantics
who think Victorian England was a Merchant-Ivory production, all
cream teas and country houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowler family _ Kathryn, 17, Joe, 9, and 11-year-old twins
Hilary and Ruth, were chosen for their sense of humor and their
flexibility. They knew they'd be required to wear period clothing,
corsets included, and to confine themselves to food and products
that would have been available in 1900. But they were unprepared
for the rigors of using slop pots, laundering by hand, and cooking
on a coal-fired stove.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did they anticipate the boredom of the low-tech life.
Deprived of television, telephone, recorded music, and other modern
diversions, the Bowlers were hard pressed to amuse themselves, but
they tried, with homemade plays and games and projects.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was upbeat in the first episode, which aired last
Monday. The Bowlers were looking forward to their experiment.
Viewers saw the house being prepared, stripped of electricity and
central heating and refitted with gas lamps, fireplaces, and period
plumbing. Decorated in authentic Victorian style, the house looked
comfortable and welcoming. It wasn't. By the second episode the
Bowlers were coming unglued. Joe was refusing to eat. Joyce was at
the breaking point after only three days of cold baths, scorched
rhubarb compote, endless dusting, no shampoo, no junk food. The
camera followed her to the backyard, where she wept and raged and
vowed, ``I'm not going back in!'' The woman wouldn't have lasted a
day on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help thinking that the Bowlers could have used a
little help from Martha Stewart. She'd have told them to quit
whining and get cracking, or else. Of course Martha would have
insisted on employing a full staff of servants. The Bowlers, like
people of their means in 1900, had only a maid-of-all-work,
Elizabeth, who, as the series unfolded, turned out to be the most
interesting member of the ``cast.'' The drudgery and class
resentment of 1900-style servitude changed Elizabeth, who by the
last episode appeared to be well on the way to becoming a feminist
activist.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowlers endured, complaining, for the agreed-upon three
months. Joyce waxed weepy when it was time to leave. ``I don't want
to go home,'' she insisted, not very persuasively.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier to believe Kathryn, who, asked if she'd do it
again, said, ``Definitely not. It would be nice watching somebody
else do it though, watch them suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   After quitting the hated house, the Bowlers' made a beeline for
a Burger King.

THE VIEW FROM THE CONSOLES AT MISSION CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION 
Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond 
By Gene Kranz. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 320 pp. Illustrated. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a pep talk for the ages. Gene Kranz, flight director for
the stricken Apollo 13 spacecraft, gathered NASA controllers around
him and told them:
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, listen up. When you leave this room, you must leave
believing that this crew is coming home. I don't give a damn about
the odds, and I don't give a damn that we've never done anything
like this before. Flight control will never lose an American in
space. You've got to believe, your people have got to believe, that
this crew is coming home. Now let's get going.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the ultimate space-age crisis of the years before the
Challenger disaster, the moment when Houston really had a problem.
But the crew of Apollo 13 persevered and prevailed, and Kranz and
his controllers brought the men home. It is the story of America: a
can-do attitude, an ideology of daring, a challenge met with
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kranz, who joined the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in 1960, and was assistant flight director for
Project Mercury and flight director for the first lunar landing,
has written a memoir of an era and an idea that are fast receding
into the mists but that, in many ways, represented the best of us _
and the best use of our idealism and our instinctive fascination
with machines.
</P>
<P>
   In these pages are none of the racy revelations that Tom Wolfe
brought to his story of the men who had the right stuff. Nor are
there particularly searching or revealing portraits of the
astronauts we met in the pages of Life magazine and on
black-and-white television sets. No matter. Kranz has provided a
workmanlike chronicle of America's reach into space _ and a flight
controller's view of the drama inherent in sitting behind a console
trying to figure out whether a launch should occur, whether a
mission would continue, whether lives could be saved. Besides the
D-Day crossing from Britain to Omaha Beach, this might have been
the most important American journey of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Also the most exciting. Recently the return into space of John
H. Glenn Jr., the stoic commander of Friendship 7, transported a
riveted nation back to 1962, when Cold War tensions prevailed and
when a fragile Atlas booster _ ``a pressurized metal balloon,'' as
Kranz calls it _ was America's ladder out of earth's atmosphere.
Kranz reminds us of the improbability of it all, and of the
innocence that accompanied that improbability. ``It was difficult
at such times to maintain my focus,'' he writes. ``I felt a strong
urge to yell out, `We've got an American in orbit!' '' We all felt
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Through these pages stroll _ streak would be a better word _
such figures as Alan B. Shepard, Gus Grissom, M. Scott Carpenter,
Wally Schirra, L. Gordon Cooper, Donald Slayton. They were the
flyboys of space. They travelled into space alone, but _ and this
may have been their most enduring, endearing attribute _ they never
forgot that they were not really alone. We were all behind them,
watching, hoping, praying. But Kranz and his colleagues were behind
them, doing back-of-the-envelope calculations to figure out, for
example, whether to leave Glenn's retrorockets on his capsule to
keep a pesky heat shield in space, or how to bring Carpenter back
to earth after he fell behind in his flight plan. ``Once again,''
Kranz writes of the Carpenter episode, ``we were lucky _ but luck
has no place in space flight.''
</P>
<P>
   No place, maybe, but it sure did play a role. There was luck
coursing through the entire enterprise, and some of the luck was
having controllers like Kranz at the other end of a communications
link that was so precarious that it looks positively primitive to
our eyes here in the first breath of the 21st century. For all the
emphasis on astronaut training in the cult of space, so much of it
was, literally, flying by the seat of the astronauts' and
controllers' pants. The plan for the first American spacewalk,
performed by Gemini 4 astronaut Ed White, was stitched together by
Kranz in what can only be called a rush job.
</P>
<P>
   This was, to be sure, experimental science, and no one involved
in it ever thought otherwise. There was care, there was attention
to detail, but mostly space flight, especially in the early days,
involved risk. Most of the time the risks paid off. Sometimes they
did not, and the results were tragic. Kranz doesn't say that
explicitly, but his words to his fellow controllers in the wake of
the accident that killed three Apollo astronauts on the launchpad
in January 1967 are vivid enough:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job! We
were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by
launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We
were pushing the schedule. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   There was risk every day, every mission, from Shepard's brief
brush with space in his Mercury capsule to Apollo 13's terrifying
brush with death in its aborted mission to the moon. The hard
thing, about the missions and about the challenge of managing risk,
was the distances involved _ the distance between Cape Canaveral
and the moon, for example, and the distance between earthbound
mission controllers and the poor souls risking their lives in
spacecraft built by the lowest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   So when an explosion imperiled the astronauts aboard Apollo 13,
Kranz and his controllers battled the limits of their knowledge,
experience, and expectations. ``The frustration of the crew and
controllers was starting to creep into their voices,'' he writes.
``Everything we knew about our spacecraft, all that we had learned
about the design, precluded the kind of massive failures we were
seeing.'' Even so, it was indisputable that an oxygen tank had
exploded aboard the spacecraft 200,000 miles from the earth (and
45,000 miles from the surface of the moon) and that more than the
success of the mission was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers came up with a plan: Use the lunar module, which
was designed to land on the moon, as a lifeboat. Use the force of
lunar gravity to sling the crippled spacecraft around the back side
of the moon and back toward earth. Use duct tape where necessary
(yes, the astronauts were equipped with supplies of duct tape). Use
as little electrical power, water, and oxygen as possible. ``Crew
comfort was our last priority; they would have to tough it out,''
Kranz writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kranz brought the men home, ending a mission in many
ways more dramatic than the first lunar landing itself. The success
in ending NASA's failure was a story of heroism and brains, but
mostly of the human spirit. ``We _ crew, contractors, controllers _
had done the impossible,'' Kranz writes. ``The human factor had
carried the day.'' His chronicle is the story of Mercury, Gemini,
and Apollo, and of the human factor that made them possible and
made them work.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
 !!!  1/2 ``Boys and Girls'' A smart, witty college romance about a
cautious guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and a commitment-phobe (Claire
Forlani) edging from friendship into something more. Part of its
charm lies in its keen awareness of everything that can go wrong in
a relationship, part in its seductive settings (the Berkeley
campus, San Francisco, the Marin foothills), part in its ability to
convince us that these two could actually handle the academic load
at a good college. (PG-13) 
 
 !!!  ``Fantasia 2000'' Disney's new edition isn't going to retire
the studio's classic 1940 blend of animation and classical music.
It does reprise Mickey Mouse's ``Sorcerer's Apprentice'' sequence,
but the seven new segments mostly seem unremarkable. Two are
brilliant: Whales glide through a cool blue and green universe of
sea and sky to Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' are hypnotizing, and
Hans Christian Anderson's ``Steadfast Tin Soldier'' is set to
Shostakovich at his liveliest. (G) 
 
 !!!  ``Love's Labour's Lost'' Kenneth Branagh takes a lesser
Shakespearean comedy and turns it into a '30s musical, with help
form Gershwin, Porter, Berlin, and Kern, and a diverse slate of
elegantly costumed actors more than willing to face the music and
dance. Although far from effortless, it's one of the more stylish
and winning pieces of time travel to which the Bard has been
subjected. (PG) 
 
(FL)  !!!  1/2 ``Shaft'' John Singleton's rejiggering of the
blaxploitation classic is cooler and grittier than the original,
and more explosive. Half the job is done simply by the casting of
Samuel L. Jackson _ the undisputed king of cool, and believably
dangerous _ as the new Shaft, a cop with a short fuse running a
vicious racist killer to ground. Richard Roundtree, the original
Shaft, climbs aboard as Shaft's uncle. (R) 
 
(FL)  !!  1/2 ``Titan A.E.'' This full-length animated sci-fi
ranges from ordinary to derivative (``Star Wars'') in its story of
a young hero charged with saving humankind from annihilating
aliens. But the computer-generated visuals from Don Bluth's studio
are terrific. The environments are fresh and imaginative; the
voicings by Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, and Bill Pullman are
pluses, too. (PG)

FILMMAKER HARRISON PUTS A HUMAN FACE ON THE TECHNO PARTY SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At its essence, it's all about the music.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you hear plenty about the kids who've blown their
wool-capped tops on Ecstasy, and get trippy from Vicks VapoRub
slathered inside surgical masks. But what gets lost in most
discussions of raves _ those massive dance gatherings _ is the
music, the thriving, driving lifeblood of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has ever attended a rave, it ain't just a party.
It's a religious revival where the church is a warehouse, the
spirit blesses the crowd at 135 beats per minute, the DJ is a god,
and the altar is made up of two turntables, a mixer, and a milk
crate full of vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene in which Greg Harrison immersed himself in San
Francisco in the mid '90s, which probably explains why his film
``Groove'' arrives in theaters Friday as the first movie to
convincingly capture the pulse of the rave, as well as the people
who find themselves while looking for the perfect beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the scene are looking for a film to portray
their culture,'' said Harrison, who wrote and directed the film,
during a recent stopover in Boston with the film's producer
Danielle Renfrew, and one of its stars, Lola Glaudini.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a film that takes them seriously,'' he said, ``and
there's a lot of subtlety and humanity in the scene which just gets
whitewashed by the mainstream media.''
</P>
<P>
   The film also stars Hamish Linklater, Denny Kirkwood, Mackenzie
Firgens, Jeff Witzke, Angelo Spizziri, Steve Van Wormer, Rachel
True, and some of the best DJs ever to lay hands on a turntable. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The moments of one night &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfolding over a single night, ``Groove'' is less a linear story
than a series of moments. There's the ``break-in'' to secure an
abandoned warehouse as a rave site; the single e-mail message that
spreads the word among devotees; the difficulty in finding reliable
directions to the rave; and the various relationships among the
participants, especially David (Linklater), who is attending his
first rave, and Glaudini's character, the worldly-wise Leyla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was by no means a raver. I've been to raves, and been to
parties and DJ events,'' said Glaudini, who also has formal dance
training. ``I was probably investigating that scene in the early
1990s. I'm a total electronic-music head, and not a closet one. I
have a prolific collection of various DJs, and I follow their
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those DJs, who receive title-card introductions, are the
true stars of ``Groove.'' Securing the skills of such beatmasters
as WishFM, Polywog, Forest Green, and Britain's legendary John
Digweed was a big part of Harrison's effort to make his film as
authentic as possible, but it wasn't his only bow to keepin' it
real. One of the most striking things about ``Groove'' is that its
dancers can actually dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone was plucked from the clubs,'' said
Renfrew, who first met Harrision through a mutual friend in the
rave scene. ``They're all ravers,'' Harrison said. ``The
underground scene came out in force to make the film.''
</P>
<P>
   With his background as a film editor, Harrison, 30, was eager to
make a film, and began toying with the idea of a movie about the
rave scene. Not only would such a film be possible financially, but
``dramatically and creatively, I felt the rave scene worked as a
film, only if I could capture the essential joy of the dance floor,
the music, and the scene,'' he said. ``I wanted to put a human face
on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, Harrison argued, has been something the mainstream media
have neglected to do. They ignore that raves are often peaceful
events, without the violence that can mar other gatherings of
youth. They overlook that ravers are black, white, Latino, Asian,
straight, gay, lesbian. They neglect to mention that raves are less
about people's differences and more about what they share _ an
unbridled love of the music that moves them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people think of when they think of raves is a very
simplified view,'' Harrison said. ``There's never an exploration of
what the music means to people, or what the experience of the music
is on the dance floor, what their emotional experience is, or even
why people are drawn to take drugs in that environment.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The spin on drugs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some aspects of the culture have seeped into the
mainstream through the music of such artists as Fatboy Slim, Moby,
Chemical Brothers, Air, and Groove Armada, what most folks know
about raves they learned from TV newsmagazines. Those stories
mostly concern drugs, whether it's law enforcement seizures of
Ecstasy or kids who OD'd on GHB, a synthetic hormone. Are drugs a
part of the scene? Absolutely, and in ``Groove,'' there is drug use
_ unapologetic, perhaps, but hardly glorified. This, however, did
not endear Harrison and Renfrew to potential investors when they
were shopping their film.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the conversation was usually along the lines of,
`We're very interested in this youth-culture movie, we've been
looking for a rave script, but before you send it, we have to know
if anyone dies in it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, nobody dies in ``Groove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted someone to die because then it would make it OK
that there's drug use,'' Renfrew said. ``They wanted more
consequences.'' Several other companies, she said, ``wanted to add
a gun'' or gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted simplified fake drama, superimposed onto a culture
they didn't understand,'' Harrison said. ``Translating the scene to
a film is very difficult because essentially the experience of a
rave is nonverbal, nonintellectual, visceral, emotional, and
internal to a certain degree. It's very hard to resist the
temptation to tack a false drama onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the music _ what ``Groove'' and the rave
scene are all about. It's not Vicks VapoRub, glow sticks,
pacifiers, or baggy clothes; the drama and the drug are in the
music, bathing everyone in a cocktail of light and sound, and
spinning them into a divine rapture as if it's the end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a magnetic quality to it, almost like a
primal thing,'' Glaudini said. ``It's the bass line, the
repetition, the sequencing, the build. It's very seductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Without vocals or lyrics, the music ``avoids intellectual
interpretation,'' Harrison said. It's universal, allowing ``lots of
people from all walks of life, whether it's a banker or a kid from
the inner city, to access the same piece of music. It's rhythm, and
rhythm is outside linear thought, rational thinking, and structured
society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what creates the community around the music,'' Harrison
said. ``It's a scene based on openness, acceptance, creativity,
experimentation, and those are things people can relate to. It's
about being alive.''

write. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Plowing the Dark'' by Richard Powers (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,

EILEEN FARRELL STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eileen Farrell sang for the last time in 1995, closing an
unusual and glorious all-American career that had lasted since
1941, when she had her own weekly show on CBS Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano was only 20 when network radio made her a national
figure _ at 24 her name appeared in the lyric of a Cole Porter
song, ``Big Town.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Farrell celebrated her 80th birthday, and despite some
health problems, she retains her spirit; she still talks about her
life in a spirit of celebration. Eight years ago, she told the
Globe she had ``no plans'' to write an autobiography. ``I've had a
lot of publicity in my life,'' she said, ``and what the public
doesn't know, I don't want them to know. I was married for 40 years
and had two kids, and what else is there to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, that summary omitted her half-century on
radio, television, the operatic stage, and the concert platform,
not to mention the long series of recordings documenting her art
and achievement as one of America's best pop singers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, a longtime admirer, Brian Kellow, executive
editor of Opera News, convinced Farrell to work with him on
producing her autobiography, ``Can't Help Singing,'' which
Northeastern University Press published last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now Farrell returns to an old stomping ground, Symphony Hall.
She was a great favorite of Arthur Fiedler's and made one of her
first recordings with the Boston Pops (``Solveig's Song'' from
Grieg's ``Peer Gynt''); later she was the star of one of the
all-time best ``Evening at Pops'' shows singing opera arias in one
part and pop songs in the other _ Harold Arlen's ``When the Sun
Comes Out'' really cut loose. In her book she admits that she loved
Arthur Fiedler dearly but ``I purposely avoided looking at him . .
. because if I had looked, I would have been lost around the first
bend.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell also recorded Wagner scenes with Charles Munch and the
Boston Symphony and sang a superb Act II of ``Tristan und Isolde''
with William Steinberg and the BSO. This week she will be there for
a special fund-raising dinner/-concert for the Longy School of
Music, which will present one of its first three lifetime
achievement awards to her, along with Pops associate conductor
laureate Harry Ellis Dickson and Rosebud C. Holland, for more than
three decades a beloved music teacher in the Boston public schools.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Upbeat despire illnes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farrell spoke over the phone from her home in New Jersey last
week sounding remarkably upbeat, considering what she's been
through lately. ``Just a year ago I had a quadruple bypass
operation, and then I got an infection in my leg, where they took
the veins out to put into my heart. So now I have to get around
with a walker and a wheelchair. Steps and I don't agree anymore, so
I try to stay home and take it easy. But I am going to come to
Boston and do a book signing as well as attend the Longy School
event! I was amazed at how many people showed up to see me when I
did a book signing at the Met.''
</P>
<P>
   `Well, I know I said I wouldn't ever write an autobiography. I
figured I'd been around so long that people would either know my
story or not be interested. And I didn't want to write the usual
kind of opera autobiography _ you know, the kind that's about how
great I was. I'll never forget trying to read the autobiography of
that tenor with the white hair, you know the one I mean, James
McCracken, and about the fourth or the fifth page he was telling
you how he realized he was the greatest living tenor. `Good for
you, buddy,' I thought. But who wants to read stuff like that?''
</P>
<P>
   As Farrell talks, her voice clears up and rings across state
lines; she probably doesn't really need the telephone. And she
hasn't gotten over her old habit of speaking her mind. In her book,
she remarks that when she met Thomas Schippers when he was 19 _ he
became America's golden boy of music in the 1950s and 1960s _ she
realized ``he'd never been five feet from (bunk) in his life.''
Confessing that she ``would have made a lousy diva,'' she admits a
sneaking admiration for people who could get away with it, like the
soprano Eleanor Steber, ``who carried it off like a one-egg cake
before breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary life
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farrell's book is unusual because she worked hard to keep her
life as ordinary as possible under the circumstances of her unusual
talent _ the one drawback of her book is that there's virtually
nothing in it about how hard she must have worked to learn all that
music, master all those styles, in so many languages. Born into an
Irish-Catholic family in Willimantic, Conn., she went to New York
straight out of high school, and it didn't take long before she had
won her place on the radio. She spent some of the prime years of
her career raising her family on Staten Island; her husband, Robert
Reagan, was a New York policeman, who posed in casual family photos
carrying his heater. She took the ferry to work _ in Carnegie Hall,
at the Met, and Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell could sing just about everything, and did. She toured
the hinterlands with the Bach Aria Group _ and sang Marie in
historic performances of Berg's ``Wozzeck'' with the New York
Philharmonic. She appeared with every important American orchestra
and became a favorite soloist of the two greatest American
conductors of her era, Thomas Schippers and Leonard Bernstein; she
sang at the opening night of Philharmonic Hall. She was not a
favorite of Rudolf Bing, the general manager of the Met, and her
book makes it abundantly clear he was not a favorite of hers. But
she did sing five of her operatic roles in 46 performances with the
company, and she did win one prestigious opening night.
</P>
<P>
   On the radio she had sung light classics and her first
recordings were mostly of operettas and Broadway shows. (``When
they couldn't get the original cast,'' she jokes, ``they called
me.'') The microphone loved her voice, although she found the
process of recording uncomfortable. ``The hardest thing,'' she
says, ``is that you had to be so quiet because every bit of noise
came through the microphone. It was very difficult making records,
but once they were done, I thought they were fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, she dubbed the soundtrack for a popular Hollywood
film, ``Interrupted Melody,'' the biography of the Australian
soprano Marjorie Lawrence who was struck down by polio at the
height of her career. Farrell wasn't given credit on screen, but
people demanded to know who it was; the soundtrack album was
finally reissued as ``The Art of Eileen Farrell.'' The album
contains the most gorgeous performance of ``Over the Rainbow'' ever
recorded. Farrell was happy to hear that her interviewer thinks so.
``Harold Arlen, who wrote that song, was a very close friend, and
later on I made a whole album of his songs with a trio. You have to
sing things the way you sing them, with your own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new career
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farrell began a whole new career in 1959 when Louis Armstrong
came down with pneumonia before a television performance from the
Spoleto Festival. Farrell, who was at the festival to sing the
Verdi Requiem, stepped in and sang ``The Sunny Side of the Street''
with Armstrong's band and became a pop star (``It had to be a song
I knew the words to,'' she recalls). Her first pop album, ``I've
Got a Right to Sing the Blues,'' made the charts, and she continued
to make beautiful albums from the Great American Songbook for the
next 35 years, moving easily into a new register, a new style, a
new vocal placement, while maintaining the same standards of
musicianship, phrasing, and diction she brought to her classical
singing. She spent her career singing what she wanted to sing, not
what others wanted her to, and the result was there never was
anyone like her.
</P>
<P>
   A robust sense of humor carried her through some great trials _
an unhappy teaching career at Indiana University; the agony of of
having a son fighting in Vietnam; the death of her husband. One of
her Indiana students told Farrell she was scared to death of her
because ``she used to be a star'' _ Farrell later wore a T-shirt
with those words emblazoned on it.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano enjoyed her first trips to the ``new'' Met in
Lincoln Center this season _ for 35 years she never saw the point
of going there. ``I must say that orchestra has improved so much I
can't believe it. And the intermission during the broadcast of
`Tristan und Isolde' was really wonderful. I had never met Birgit
Nilsson before. They asked her when she had first heard Miss
Farrell and she said she had heard me on the movie soundtrack. I
had to say that I was sorry that I had never heard her sing, and it
was so embarrassing, I thought I would die!'' (Nilsson, who is
about as tactful as Farrell, quipped, ``You really missed
something!'')
</P>
<P>
   Farrell still keeps in touch with some her musical friends, such
as Beverly Sills, and she still enjoys going out to hear cabarets.
``I love Wesla Whitfield, she is such a lovely girl, and her
diction is so good. We correspond.'' In her book Farrell laments
that there was no official tape of the joint concert she gave with
her friend, the legendary queen of cabaret, Mabel Mercer. ``But
after the book came out, two people sent tapes to me. That was such
a wonderful concert. I would sing and she would sing and then we
would sing together, and we had the words in a huge loose-leaf
notebook because she couldn't always remember what was coming next
_ and neither could I! Her words were in red and mine were in
blue.''
</P>
<P>
   And the soprano says she's looking forward to being driven up to
Boston. ``Other people are going to take care of all the details
and wheel me down the aisle. The only thing I have to remember is
to put my teeth in before I smile!''

<P>
   DUBLIN _ Leave it to Stephen Rea to take something long thought
of as being confined to a narrow slice of Dublin history and make
it relevant to Belfast, all of Ireland, and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of traditionalists, Rea, the actor best
known for his Oscar-nominated role as the reluctant IRA executioner
in Neil Jordan's ``The Crying Game,'' has revised Sean O'Casey's
great play ``The Plough and the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, written in 1926, is still set in Dublin during the
1916 Easter Rising, when a group of idealistic Irish men and women
staged a quixotic rebellion that was a failure until the British
began executing its leaders and public opinion swung firmly behind
the rebels. A cast of loquacious working-class Dubliners still
debate the honor of rebellion and the futility of war. But Rea has
added some modern references to his native Northern Ireland and the
most recent incarnation of the Troubles, the term the Irish use to
describe their ancient fight with the British and among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is, no pun intended, revolutionary. In Ireland, you tinker
with O'Casey at your peril. The country has changed rapidly over
the last decade, its booming economy transforming it from one of
Europe's poorest countries to one of the richest. The peace process
in Northern Ireland, meanwhile, has over the same period changed
the future of that tortured corner of the island from a mostly
violent debate to a mostly political one.
</P>
<P>
   But while most Irish people are more than willing to accept the
new way business and politics are conducted on their island,
reinterpreting O'Casey is seen by some as going, as the playwright
might have put it, beyond the beyonds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking stock &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the play ended a monthlong run here at the Gaeity
Theater, Rea _ who not only directs but stars as Fluther, the
play's ambivalent central character _ sat down and assessed its
impact, his critics, and whether his version of the O'Casey classic
will travel beyond Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was prepared for the criticism, he replied,
``Yeah,'' speaking with the same laconic tone and displaying the
same mournful expression that has made him a popular film actor and
a staple in Jordan's movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's irresponsible of theater to go at people with
the same production, over and over, as if nothing else has happened
in the world since it was written,'' he says, sitting on a couch in
the bowels of the Gaeity, near St. Stephen's Green, where the
rebels of 1916 made a stand.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Belfast, Rea, 50, always has been something of a
rebel himself. But while many of his contemporaries picked up a
gun, Rea picked up something far more dangerous, far more
subversive: his culture.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been anything more threatening to Britain's
imperial hold on any part of Ireland than Irish culture. For most
of the last eight centuries, the British tried their best to stamp
it out. They made it illegal to teach the Irish language, which was
essential to passing down what was almost entirely an oral
tradition. The English language had more success undermining the
indigenous culture than English soldiers, a situation captured
poignantly in ``Translations,'' written in 1980 by Brian Friel, the
Tyrone-born playwright who with Rea, Seamus Heaney, and Seamus
Deane founded the Field Day Theatre Company in Derry that same
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite centuries of repression, the Irish never stopped
asserting their identity through their language, music, poetry,
prose, and drama. Rea enthusiastically joined that cultural
revolution, arming himself with an abiding interest in Irish drama,
in particular. &QL; 
 &QL; 
At home onstage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While primarily known for his film work, Rea is at heart a stage
actor. At 18, he began his professional career in 1968 with the
Abbey, Ireland's national theater, but soon headed over to London,
where his first big role was in O'Casey's ``The Shadow of a
Gunman.''
</P>
<P>
   He has played several roles in the ``Plough,'' appearing
opposite the late Siobhan McKenna, who was also a Belfast native.
But Rea had never played Fluther, the role that the late Donal
McCann made his own, until he got a call last year from Noel
Pearson, the prolific Irish film and theater producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noel asked me if I wanted to play Fluther. There was no talk
of directing. I said, sure, great. One thing led to another and
before I knew it I was the director, too, mostly by default,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rea added props and references in an attempt to link the Easter
Rising with the post-1969 Troubles. In 1969, Northern Ireland spun
out of control when the Protestant-run government cracked down on
the Catholic civil rights movement, which was demanding equal
rights in housing and employment. Loyalist extremists burned down
Catholic neighborhoods, Catholics retaliated by forcing Protestants
out, and as virtual civil war broke out, the British army arrived
in August 1969. The unrest breathed life back into a dormant Irish
Republican Army, which went on the offensive, shooting British
soldiers and the overwhelmingly Protestant police force.
</P>
<P>
   Rea puts onstage some of the scenes he watched as a young man in
Belfast. A looter scoots across the stage carrying an electric
guitar, which hardly would have been available in any of the
storefronts whose windows were broken by the shelling of the
General Post Office by a British gunboat in the Liffey some 84
years ago. A television, not yet invented in 1916, shows images of
burning buildings. Fluther rides onto the stage on a bicycle,
singing a bit of ``My Way,'' long before Paul Anka wrote it and
Frank Sinatra, not to mention Sid Vicious, made it famous.
</P>
<P>
   The British soldiers who appear toward the end of the play,
after Bessie Burgess has been shot at the window, mistaken for a
rebel sniper, are dressed in uniforms worn in the 1970s. Over the
loudspeaker comes an English accent shouting, ``Shoot the sniper!
Shoot him dead!''
</P>
<P>
   The tape, Rea explains, is authentic, a recording of a British
soldier exhorting his comrades to shoot demonstrators in Derry on
Bloody Sunday, on Jan. 30, 1972. The killing of 14 unarmed
Catholics that day, and especially the British government's
foolhardy attempt to portray the dead as somehow being culpable in
their own deaths, poured fuel on what had been a relatively small
fire. Moderates became extremists, on all sides. About half of the
3,600 people who died in the Troubles since 1969 were killed in the
five years that followed Bloody Sunday, as the IRA was flooded with
recruits and the British cracked down hard.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the play, the white noise of helicopters, part of
the aural landscape in Belfast for nearly 30 years, fills the
stage. For anyone who has heard that noise in Belfast, it is
haunting.
</P>
<P>
   Some theater critics, not to mention some audiences, found the
insertion of modern references off-putting, and some accused Rea of
letting his politics unduly influence his art. Rea disagrees.
``Most of my choices were theatrical, not political,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While Rea changed none of the dialogue as O'Casey wrote it, he
did change the emphasis given to some scenes, especially by
emphasizing the conflict within the relationship of Jack and Nora
Clitheroe, rather than Fluther's observations on the madness all
around him. Jack sees his duty first to Mother Ireland and runs off
with the rebels. Nora demands that her husband put her first,
considering family more important than country, and falls apart
when Jack is killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to humanize them both, especially Nora,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to humanize the British soldiers, who in some
productions are portrayed as one-dimensional bullies. He insisted
on casting Englishmen in the roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the soldiers I saw in Belfast were nervous,'' he
says. ``They were just kids, a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   While traditionalists sniffed, Mary Holland, The Irish Times
columnist who is one of the most perceptive commentators on
Northern Ireland, found the play ``almost unbearably moving.''
Holland said it was a stroke of brilliance to link O'Casey's
meditation on the futility of war that brought Ireland partial
independence with what seems to be the end of the war in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful moment in Rea's production comes not with
Burgess's death, or Nora Clitheroe's slow descent into despair, but
when two British tommies level their guns at Fluther.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lay them down and I could beat the two of ye without
sweating,'' Fluther tells the tommies, contempt dripping from each
word.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken by Rea, the words have a resonance lacking from previous
productions of ``Plough.'' And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that happen in real life,'' says Rea. ``I've seen
people held back from going after British soldiers. And I know what
that moment is like, when someone could do something stupid, and
someone could get killed.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catching Rea's act?
</P>
<P>
   That Rea's revision of O'Casey is considered so unusual, and
controversial, underscores the reluctance of many Irish artists to
tackle the subject of the Troubles, and especially to take risks
the way Rea has. While audiences for the monthlong run at the
1,110-seat Gaeity ran at about 70 percent capacity, you would think
a production directed by and starring someone of Rea's stature
would have been a nightly sellout.
</P>
<P>
   But the aversion of some theatergoers, and some of the criticism
directed at Rea, has nothing to do with art or with his
reinterpretation of O'Casey. There is a sizable element in southern
Irish society that dislikes anything and everything about Northern
Ireland. They were embarrassed by the Troubles. They don't like
Northerners, Catholic or Protestant. And they especially don't like
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   After I interviewed Rea, I walked across town to meet an old
friend at Mulligan's, a traditional pub on Poolbeg Street near the
Liffey. As I waited at the bar, a well-dressed man standing next to
me noticed my theater program, and as we talked, he learned of my
interview with Rea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better be careful of that one,'' the man said, suddenly
turning hostile. ``You know who he's married to.''
</P>
<P>
   Rea is married to Dolours Price, who in the 1970s was convicted
of being part of an IRA team that planted car bombs in London, then
went on a hunger strike and forced the British authorities to allow
her to serve her prison time in Ireland. After her release, she and
Rea were married in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   For many Irish people like the well-dressed man at Mulligan's,
there is no redemption for people like Price, or Rea.
</P>
<P>
   There are no concrete plans to take this version of O'Casey on
the road, though Rea confesses to being intrigued by the prospect
of taking it to Belfast, to Boston, even to New York, where he was
nominated for a Tony award in 1992 for his role as a hostage held
by Islamic terrorists in Frank McGuinness's ``Someone to Watch Over
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like this to be seen in other places,'' Rea says,
betraying for the first time something that others would see as
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me,'' he says, smiling. ``I'm game for anything.''

A RICH BIOGRAPHY OF HEARST UNMASKS A SHADOWY LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CHIEF 
The Life of William Randolph Hearst 
By David Nasaw. Houghton Mifflin. 
687 pp. Illustrated. $35. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orson Welles saw through a lens darkly. His ``Citizen Kane'' was
a gloomy portrait of William Randolph Hearst, a man of Falstaffian
flamboyance who seldom felt gloomy himself. Hearst ruled American
journalism for half a century, ran a multimedia empire, kept a wife
on one coast and a mistress on the other, made millions, lost
millions, and collected art the way one of his underpaid newsboys
might collect baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   The most apt lines in Welles's movie echo in the booming
narration about ``the greatest newspaper tycoon of this or any
other generation'' who was ``more newsworthy than the names in his
own headlines!'' But teary-eyed over a sled, busted up about
Rosebud? Not Will, as his doting parents called him. He was a sunny
Californian, born in 1863, the only child of George Hearst, who
mined a Gold Rush fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Every chapter of David Nasaw's biography is as rich in human
insight as its subject was rich in material possessions. This book
is for those who want their biographical protein straight, seasoned
with gracefully straightforward writing and no psychobabble. The
saga is as suspenseful as the serial Hearst ordered for the movies
``The Perils of Pauline.''
</P>
<P>
   Why now, 49 years after the death of ``The Chief''? W. A.
Swanberg's ``Citizen Hearst'' is 40 years old and lacked access to
the Hearst family papers. Nasaw, a City University of New York
historian, plunged into the archives and uncovered a warts-and-all
wealth of anecdotes. The Chief was an original thinker, a savvy
businessman, and an indulgent father. He was also a wastrel, a
bully, and an accomplished mama's boy, manipulating Phoebe Apperson
Hearst, who had inherited her husband's millions.
</P>
<P>
   Welles was right in one regard. He did not make of Hearst's life
a serious documentary, but chose lurid melodrama, the same stuff
Hearst and other publishers served up daily. They employed stunts
and sensationalism to disguise a thin diet of real news, as some
still do. Absent his baroque habits, Hearst was a bottom-line baron
like Frank Munsey, or Munsey's modern avatar, Rupert Murdoch. But
the Hearst personality was festooned with as many gargoyles as the
loot he shipped from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Nasaw documents these traits with almost painful candor. Hearst
was a compulsive collector, as his mother reported from Paris to
George in San Francisco. ``He wants all sorts of things,'' Phoebe
wrote, and had developed ``a mania for antiquities.'' Will was 10
years old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, as business manager of the Lampoon, he ``engaged in
a full-scale advertising and marketing campaign to make the journal
self-sufficient.'' Studying, however, was not on his dance card,
and he became the most notable dropout in Harvard history until
another multimedia magnate, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, Hearst became ``editor and proprietor'' of the San
Francisco Examiner, a gift from his father. His self-sufficiency at
the Lampoon was not replicated when he bought newspapers,
magazines, and movie studios, not to mention paintings,
bric-a-brac, sculpture, and mansions to put them in. He begged and
borrowed from his mother, then from banks, because, Nasaw writes,
``He didn't believe in the Protestant ethic or Poor Richard's
aphorisms. A penny saved might be a penny earned, but a penny
borrowed was worth even more.''
</P>
<P>
   He hired celebrity journalists, including eventually Benito
Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. At the Examiner in the 1880s, then at
the New York Journal in the 1890s, he ran populist, antibusiness
crusades in preparation for his entry into politics. He served two
terms in Congress, ran for governor of New York, and ran for
president. In 1929, Winston Churchill described him as ``a grave,
simple child, with no doubt a nasty temper, playing with the most
costly toys. A vast income always overspent; ceaseless building and
collecting; two magnificent establishments, two charming wives,
complete indifference to public opinion, . . . a 15 million daily
circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Kane'' is the 35th of 36th chapters in ``The Chief,''
as if the author wished to portray his subject in Technicolor
before discussing the film's famously noirish portrait. Charles
Foster Kane was ``a mystery'' concocted by Welles, but was William
Randolph Hearst a mystery? Lincoln Steffens wrote so in 1906, two
years after Hearst ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's politics seemed a mystery when blended with
circulation-boosting populism before he evolved into a plutocrat.
He urged regulation on business when he was a young entrepreneur in
the 19th century, but as he grew richer, he changed. He declared
for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 only because he believed FDR was
``a conservative.'' Hearst soured on the New Deal quickly,
predicting Alf Landon's victory in 1936 before the Kansas governor
carried only two states. ``The result of the Chief's
anti-Communist, anti-Roosevelt crusade had been a loss of
circulation and advertising,'' Nasaw writes. ``Readers forced to
choose sides between the president and the publisher had voted
twice: at the ballot box for Roosevelt, at their newsstands against
Hearst.''
</P>
<P>
   As bankruptcy loomed, threatening his possessions, Hearst showed
another side: He so loved his stuff that, at 74, he was again,
Nasaw writes, ``a spoiled child.'' When his mistress, Marion
Davies, hocked her jewels to help him, Hearst was both gallant and
shrewd. He insisted on treating her aid as a loan, for which he put
up his Boston papers as collateral. (Readers of the Boston Record,
American, and Sunday Advertiser would have been surprised by the
amount: $1 million.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, H. L. Mencken wrote that Hearst ``debauched
journalism,'' but also ``shook up old bones, and gave the blush of
life to pale cheeks. . . . There was scarcely a newspaper in
America, in 1900, that did not show his influence.'' Nasaw's
epilogue gives a brief account of the current state of the Hearst
Corporation and Hearst-Argyle Television that makes it clear that
that influence is not a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Chief himself led a tribe of sycophants, hangers-on,
loafers, and freeloaders. Some newspaper dynasties started later
and lasted longer. None of his five sons finished college and
``while Hearst had demanded that they work for a living and
threatened to cut them off if they did not, he had never followed
through on any of his threats.'' But his sons, by making family
letters fully available to Nasaw, have served both Hearst and
history well. American history resonates on each page. After 600 or
so, when I knew there weren't many more, I felt a little
Rosebud-ish myself.

   HEARTLAND-ILLINOIS _ Summer in Illinois means heat. Sun baked
farmers worry about drought. Sweaty Chicagoans crank their air
conditioners during the first steam bath, then wait for the city's
electrical distribution system to overload and crash. Cubs fans
grouse about beer sales being cut off in the sixth inning at

evenly offset by its suburban and downstate voters whose inborn
conservativism dates to the days of the prairie schooner and helped
spawn the Republican party. And then there is the Peoria factor.
The phrase ``does it play in Peoria,'' is shorthand for whether an
idea will get support from the nation's vast political middle. That
middle ground _ found in Peoria as well as places like Dayton,
Ohio, Midland, Mich. and Allentown, Pa., _ is where many expect the

   RADIO-TOPMARKET _ ATLANTA _ Traffic jams, a shortage of radio
stations, and advertisers with fat wallets have something in
common. They are making Atlanta's fragmented radio market
especially attractive to broadcasters trying to control more of the
dial. ``Atlanta is the radio beachfront property. It's not unusual
to pay a premium for it,'' says John Hogan, an Atlanta-based senior
vice president for Clear Channel Communications. One of his
competitors -- Cox Radio, which already operates five of Atlanta's
15 top stations -- recently signed a deal to acquire fourth-ranked
Kiss 104.7. The station's $280 million price tag apparently is the
highest ever paid in Atlanta, competing broadcasters say. (Kempner,

 (ART ADV: Two color photos of Sebastian Junger are available by

 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe Magazine  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Sebastian Junger (pronounced ``younger'') was
hanging from a tree on a hot summer day, looking at the bloody tear
he had just ripped down the back of his leg with his chain saw,
when the idea for his book blossomed. Cutting trees, he mused, was
difficult work, like firefighting, logging or commercial fishing.
Why not a book about those jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, three storm systems collided off the coast of
New England, creating a meteorological debacle so disastrous, and
so improbable, that a weatherman dubbed it a ``perfect storm,'' or
a storm that could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the maelstrom of 100-mph winds and 90-foot waves, a
72-foot swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, Mass., called the
Andrea Gail went down with her crew of six. Junger, then living in
Gloucester, clipped a newspaper article about the missing vessel,
which was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Sebastian Junger, 38, a Belmont, Mass., native, became
chronicler of that 1991 fishing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, what started out as a chapter on fishing had
turned into a whole book, ``The Perfect Storm.'' Suddenly, Junger
was the Sexiest Author in America, and the book was a publishing
marvel being aggressively optioned by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As publishing leaders see it, it was Junger's own willingness to
stump for the book, coupled with his publisher's savvy marketing
strategy, that led to the book's singular success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it didn't hurt that he was very good-looking,'' says
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly. ``These days,
when a publisher looks at an author, obviously, they consider the
manuscript, but they're also looking at the kind of publicity the
author can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher W.W. Norton says it wasn't because of Junger's
appearance or manner. It was because of his obsession with his
subject. Norton is a prestigious publishing house known for
literary quality and a traditional interest in nautical topics.
When Junger approached Norton, he was an unknown. He had never
written a book. He had written only a handful of pieces for such
magazines as Men's Journal and American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And his book proposal had been turned down by a dozen publishers
who did not see how a book could be written about a storm. But
Starling Lawrence, Norton's editor-in-chief, sat down with Junger
in his Manhattan office and liked him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an obsessional quality to his interest in the
material that I liked,'' says Lawrence, who gave Junger a $35,000
advance. ``Obsession is always an interesting, maybe essential,
quality in a writer. I personally am not interested in books that
don't have to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Junger's obsession was his nature. He tends to fixate.
But part of it was that he had once had a near-drowning experience
himself while surfing on Cape Cod, and the sensation of water
pressing against his lungs had been seared into his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book is a combination of reportage and deduction: He
tells a compelling and factual human story of the fishermen's lives
leading up to the departure of the boat, as well as that of others
who survived the fateful storm. But he also plunges deep into
imagination to narrate what might have happened in the Andrea
Gail's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' is chock-full of information about such
things as how human beings drown, and waves form, and boats are
built, and hurricanes crest. One of the most riveting sections of
the book describes in unflinching detail the fishermen's probable
final moments as their boat sank, after Capt. Billy Tyne's final
radio transmission: ``She's comin' on boys, and she's comin' on
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger's best guess as to what happened:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew of the Andrea Gail either have laryngospasms or
completely inundated lungs. They are suspended, open-eyed and
unconscious, in the flooded enclosures of the boat. The darkness is
absolute and the boat may already be on her way to the bottom. At
this point only a massive amount of oxygen could save these men.
They have suffered, at most, a minute or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason this book is so good is we know so much more about
the weather _ all this scientific information. The weather is a
principal character in this book,'' says Peter Davison, former
editor at Houghton Mifflin and currently poetry editor for The
Atlantic Monthly. Junger ``is also willing to go the final mile and
tell how people die. Most people end with a cry _ and the mate was
washed off to starboard and never seen again _ and that kind of
crap. Junger really deals with this. It is a brave book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm,'' published in May, 1997, has sold just
over 2.5 million copies. (It has since been made into a movie, of
the same title, that is due out in July, and features heartthrobs
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Washington Post ran glowing reviews,
as did many others. National Public Radio alone did five interviews
with him, and People magazine did three stories, the last of which
dubbed him one of the Sexiest Men Alive (author division). He was
on ``Good Morning America'' twice, CNN three times, and made
appearances on Charlie Rose, ``CBS Sunday Morning,'' Tom Snyder,
CSPAN and Fox News. And then Oprah waved him into a chair along
with several other of People's Sexiest Men Alive. One writer dubbed
the show ``Hunk Writers With Less Substance Than Their Books.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger balked. He did not want to do it. He did not have a suit.
His chain saw needed oiling. People would think he was using the
book, he says, ``to catapult myself into some weird, glamorous fame
world.'' But Norton editor Starling Lawrence presented Oprah to
Junger in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence said, `Look. The amount of book sales we're going to
get from this, the amount of money we're going to get from this, is
huge. And you may not feel like you need the money' _ and I did
feel that way _ `but we're a business, and the more money, the
better for us.' He said, `You know, it will allow us to publish a
lot of guys like you, what we thought you were. And that struck
home. I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Junger had done 134 interviews, most with
the national media, four of them online. He had participated in 46
book events and traveled to 40 locations on tour. And reporters
loved him. ``He's affable and enthusiastic, articulate, charming,
frank, modest but not overmodest, romantic but not hopelessly so.
God, isn't there anything wrong with this guy?'' gushed Britain's
Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brave. He's built. He's literate,'' exclaimed New York
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, love letters and marriage proposals poured into
Norton's office by the fistful. And now the former tree-cutter and
would-be journalist who could barely get his stories published, was
transformed into The Perfect Author.
</P>
<P>
   It seems significant that Junger did not have a girlfriend in
high school. Now, Junger's life could easily be divided into Before
the Book and After the Book. And not having a girlfriend seemed to
symbolize many of the things he felt he could not have before the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, in fact, started out with a healthy portion of the
conventional ``good things.'' Although he has been lionized in the
media as a kind of wrangler writer, Schwarzenegger with a laptop,
Junger was raised in the prosperous suburb of Belmont, the son of
an artist and a physicist. He attended tony area schools before
graduating from Wesleyan University in 1984 with a degree in
cultural anthropology and, at last, a girlfriend. His book is
dedicated to his father, ``who first introduced me to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the very tameness and predictability of his
suburban youth that drove him to build a lean-to in the woods _ ``I
didn't want to kill things, but I wanted to know that I could if I
wanted to'' _ and to scale 100-foot trees with his chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Junger wandered for several years, trying to launch a writing
career without success. Newspapers turned him down. He wrote some
stories for an alternative paper in Washington, D.C., and for The
Boston Phoenix. He waited tables at the old Casablanca restaurant
in Cambridge, Mass., to pay the bills, then wandered down to New
Orleans and tried his hand at fiction. But after six years, ``the
writing thing was going nowhere. And I wanted it so bad. It was
like trying to get a girlfriend in high school. I was like, `What
is wrong? Why won't this connect?'''
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day in 1989, he sat down at a bar next to a guy
who offered him a job cutting down trees. And things began to
connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it immediately,'' says Junger. ``I felt, here I have
something which is exhausting, which makes you incredibly dirty,
and you're doing something very scary and that can kill you. And at
the end of the day, you've won. The tree is a stump. A huge dead
oak over this person's house is a stump. Through a mix of machinery
and brute strength and athletic ability and engineering, you have
brought this thing down. It is a tremendous feeling. I fell in love
with it immediately and actually had a hard time giving it up as I
got more into writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't, altogether. There is the chain saw, after all,
right there on the bare wooden floor of his two-bedroom apartment
in Manhattan's East Village. (Junger moved to New York from Cape
Cod midway through writing the book, because, he says, he needed a
change.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a picture of him pressing the saw into a 90-foot tree.
It is tacked to the wall, right next to the picture of Ethel
Shatford, bartender at the Crow's Nest, the Gloucester bar that
anchors ``The Perfect Storm,'' and the mother of one of the men who
died on the Andrea Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Junger became close to Ethel Shatford during the countless hours
he spent talking to fishermen in the Nest. In writing the book, he
wrestled with whether to include details of the men's drowning,
thinking largely of its impact on Ethel. In the end, he did
describe their deaths, and Junger later wrote her a letter
explaining why. ``I didn't want her blindsided,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book came out, he started a fund to help the
children of commercial fishermen, called ``The Perfect Storm''
Foundation, and he remains closely involved.
</P>
<P>
   Junger sold the paperback rights to his book for $1.2 million
and made another $500,000 on film rights, although he will not say
how much more he has made on the book.
</P>
<P>
   His third-floor apartment, at a $2,500 monthly rent, counts as
one of the handful of things his new wealth has allowed him. He
bought a sailboat for $4,000. And an 1820s farmhouse in Truro,
Mass. He is also planning on opening a bar in Manhattan in June,
with some friends, that will have a ``journalistic'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Junger's first book has also garnered a host of
writing assignments he could not have dreamed of before. He's
written several pieces for Vanity Fair, one about the forensics
being practiced at the mass graves in Kosovo, another about the
mysterious death of a Greek shipping magnate's son, called
``Addicted to Danger.'' He wrote ``The Lure of Danger: Confessions
of an Adrenaline Junkie'' for Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, he will drive from Brussels to Sierra Leone to
deliver a school van and will write about it for The New Yorker. He
is currently working on a piece for Vanity Fair about Albert
DeSalvo, the man who claimed to be the Boston Strangler and who,
once upon a time, did some carpentry for Junger's parents. He has
an idea for a new book but says only that ``it will surprise people
that I did it, but they will understand by the time they are
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fame and fortune that have come his way, however,
many who know him say that he has been little changed by his new
status.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, they say, remains a rogue adventurer who far prefers his
worn jeans and tattered black T-shirt to the pressed shirts he
grudgingly dons for public appearances.

HOME AND AWAY 
Memoir of a Fan. 
By Scott Simon. Hyperion. 364 pp. $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am a fan,'' declares Scott Simon, a native Midwesterner and
weekend host for National Public Radio. And fans of professional
sports ``don't get much respect,'' he goes on to observe. You
remind yourself these are just games you're watching, nothing all
that serious _ not like the global conflicts Simon has covered for
NPR, for instance. But then, he writes, the action begins, the
passion kicks in, and suddenly you're a fan again, whereupon
nothing else matters.
</P>
<P>
   Fandom and its side effects, good and bad, occupy the heart of
Simon's new memoir, an entertaining read that sometimes suffers
from too much play-by-play commentary and too little color
analysis. At its best, the book paints a beguiling portrait of the
author as a young bleacher bum, a baby-boomer Chicagoan who wanted
to be White Sox hurler Billy Pierce when he was Little League age
and who grew up worshipping the Cubs, Bears, and, later, the Bulls
(though not the NHL's Blackhawks). Relocated to Cleveland briefly,
Simon even dressed up as Indians slugger Rocky Colavito one
Halloween. No Superman costume for this kid.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's sketches of legendary sports personalities like Bill
Veeck, the colorful White Sox owner; Frank Lane, the despicable
Indians general manager dubbed Trader Lane by his detractors; and
Leo Durocher, the irascible Cubs manager (Simon writes that while
he has interviewed war criminals and other scoundrels, Durocher was
the only person he ever wanted to say ``(expletive) off'' to) are
terrific, reminding us that some of the most compelling figures in
sports are not necessarily the ones toeing the pitching rubber or
foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Many more pages are devoted to Chicago sports stars like Dick
Butkus and Gale Sayers of Da Bears, Cubs stalwarts Ernie Banks and
Fergie Jenkins, and Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen of the Bulls.
Jordan, whom Simon likens to such Windy City icons as Frank Lloyd
Wright, Saul Bellow, and Louis Armstrong, dominates the last third
of the book. Where Simon tends to misfire is when he reaches too
high and hard for the sports historian's lofty perspective. If
you're not a Bulls fan, or at least a semi-serious sports nut,
you're likely to find his lengthy recitation of clutch games and
winning shots to be, well, a bit windy. If you're a Celtics fan,
moreover, you may rightfully quibble with Simon's description of
Larry Bird as a ``fading, old star'' when he faced Jordan in the
1986 NBA playoffs. MJ may have been a rising superstar back then,
but Bird was at the height of his incomparable powers, not fading
or old.
</P>
<P>
   Far more compelling than the box-score rehashings are the ways
in which Simon interweaves a fan's sensibility with larger global
and generational issues. Simon's father and stepfather were both
capital-F fans, too, and their influence is captured by the author
without undue sentimentality. Simon's dad, an itinerant comedian,
counted among his close pals baseball announcer Jack Brickhouse;
former Cubs manager Charlie Grimm married another family friend.
Together they provided Simon and his father with the sort of access
young fans only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Moved from Chicago to San Francisco to Cleveland, where his
father battled alcoholism and his parents' marriage ultimately
broke up, Simon saw his team loyalties tested but never his basic
love for the games themselves. Simon's parents divorced in 1958, 10
years before his father's death in 1968: a cataclysmic year during
which personal tragedy overlapped with societal upheaval. A chapter
on the Cubs 1969 season balances events like the death of Ho Chi
Minh with the team's fortunes in a thrilling pennant race with the
Mets. Simon's mother remarried in 1972. Ralph Newman was a
bookseller and Lincoln scholar who once played minor league
baseball. Simon grew particularly close to his stepfather, who was
later embroiled in a tax-evasion scheme involving Richard Nixon's
vice presidential papers. But politics and sports (just ask Nixon)
often make strange bedfellows. ``Even in the days when I was
striving to be a political radical,'' notes Simon, ``I was still a
traditionalist about baseball.'' SDS si, DH no.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with his beloved Cubs in the playoffs, Simon traveled
to Grenada to cover that country's elections. Naturally the
snakebitten Cubbies lost _ to the San Diego Padres, of all teams. A
solicitous boss at NPR offered Simon ``compassionate leave'' to get
over his heartache. On assignment in trouble spots like El Salvador
and Bosnia, Simon was the kind of foreign correspondent who looked
at snow falling in war-torn Sarajevo and called it ``Bear
weather,'' a fantasist (emphasis on fan) who re-enacted Bulls
playoff games in his mind to lull himself to sleep while in the
field during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's death and Jordan's retirement from basketball provide
the denouement to Simon's story. In the end, he even gets to meet
one of his childhood heroes, Billy Pierce. Now in his 70s, Pierce
quips that he's prepared to spend the next 20 years being...Scott
Simon. Boys and girls, as the beer commercial says: It doesn't get
any better than that.

&HT;     LAZIO'S FLUCTUATION ON EDUCATION BECOMES CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last year, Rep. Rick Lazio voted to enact
dramatic education reforms to give states and local school
districts wide discretion in spending federal aid. And last month,
Lazio stood by those reforms, saying they would ``provide our local
schools the flexibility they need to use their resources to produce
real results.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the four-term Republican congressman broke with
his party and quietly reversed his vote, siding this time with the
Clinton administration to retain federal control over education
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which surprised Lazio allies and opponents alike,
marks the latest political change of heart for the congressman in
his U.S. Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Education ranks among the top three areas of concern _ above
crime, the upstate economy and taxes _ for New Yorkers who will
choose between Clinton and Lazio for the seat being vacated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton never has had to be held directly accountable
for her positions on education because she never has held elected
office. But in speeches as first lady and the Democratic candidate
for Senate, she at least appears consistent in her plans for public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Lazio's congressional voting record shows a shift
on education matters since the start of his Senate campaign. He
also has modified his position on vouchers and voted in 1995 for
legislation that, among other things, would have eliminated the
U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more important issue than education for our future
and the choice in this election is very clear as to who will stand
for the children, the teachers, the families of New York,'' Clinton
said Wednesday in a speech attacking Lazio's then-opposition to the
Democratic plan that earmarked federal aid to hire new teachers and
build new schools.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio embraced the White House plan a few hours later. He was
one of only seven Republicans to vote against his party's education
reforms, which squeaked by in the House, 217-214.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican's campaign staff said Lazio was concerned about
the lack of funding for education in the GOP plan, which would
allow states and local school boards wide discretion in spending
federal dollars. But the vote came the same day Clinton launched
her sharpest criticism of Lazio so far, accusing the lawmaker of
portraying himself as a mainstream politician while siding with
conservative House leaders on key congressional votes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's vote marked a sea change in Lazio's position on how
federal funding should be allocated for education.
</P>
<P>
   In two votes last fall, Lazio supported bills embraced by the
House GOP leadership to give states and local school districts
spending discretion. As recently as last month's state Republican
Party convention in Buffalo, Lazio reinforced the
power-to-the-states plan as one of his main education campaign
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will push for federal policies that provide our local
schools the flexibility they need to use their resources to produce
real results,'' he said then. ``Let the other side push its
`Washington-knows-best' programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton proposes earmarking $2.9 billion specifically
for new teachers and classrooms. She also has adopted a Democratic
proposal to reduce federal interest on construction bonds to pay
for new school buildings, a plan she says would save New Yorkers
$2.7 billion in local tax hikes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Lazio education votes appear to be inconsistent with his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although he calls himself a strong proponent of public
education, Lazio voted in 1995 on legislation to balance the
federal budget _ a bill that included eliminating the U.S.
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Lazio also has wavered on his support of
vouchers _ publicly funded scholarships to send students to private
and parochial schools. While he consistently voted in favor of
vouchers in Congress, Lazio said earlier this month that he now
supports vouchers only for ``schools that are failing, and there's
no opportunity for children to learn, or if they're not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opposes vouchers outright.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lazio and Clinton share ground on other school
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Both aim to recruit mid-career professionals into teaching
ranks. Clinton, borrowing an idea from Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., and Republican Gov. George Pataki, proposes granting up to
60,000 scholarships annually for college students who commit to
teaching in high-need schools for at least four years. In addition,
she has proposed financial bonuses for 15,000 professionals in
other careers to become teachers. It is unclear how she plans to
pay for those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio successfully lobbied for an amendment to be added to the
1999 Teacher Empowerment Act allowing career professionals to
bypass standard certification processes to become elementary and
secondary school teachers. But he missed voting on the bill because
he was chatting with a colleague on the House floor, said a Lazio
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of teachers' merit pay, Clinton opposes enacting a
system of salary raises based on students' classroom performance.
Lazio has expressed reservations about merit pay but has not ruled
it out.
</P>
<P>
   Both support public charter schools, although Clinton has
criticized New York's two-pronged system of approving them _ by
both the State University of New York and the Board of Regents _ as
confusing inconsistent with other states. Both also support
affirmative action in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton already has seized on Lazio's apparent
inconsistencies and is likely to continue haranguing the
congressman on his most recent turnabout on education. ``You're
going to have a great time trying to figure out where he stands on
issues,'' Clinton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Lazio: ``My campaign will stress my strong record of
standing up for New York, a mainstream record I am proud of.''

CALL OF THE WILD: WHAT TO DO WHEN BABY ANIMALS DROP BY
UNEXPECTEDLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often, in late spring, wild baby animals, often injured or
abandoned, will show up unexpectedly in the yard. What do you do?
The Humane Society of the United States has some guidelines to help
the well-intentioned decide which is intervention or interference.
</P>
<P>
   Administering first aid or giving food to an injured animal can
harm or even kill the animal. Your first action should be to
contact a local animal shelter, animal control agency or
veterinarian who specializes in wildlife or exotic pets. Their
assistance will be the animal's best hope of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Determining whether a juvenile animal needs help isn't always
easy. Signs of illness or injury are vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding
and an apparent broken wing or limb. An animal that is cool to the
touch is in shock or hypothermic and needs immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife that appears orphaned may not be. Some animals like
deer and rabbits may leave their offspring alone for long periods
of time.
</P>
<P>
   The following guidelines suggest steps to take when you see a
juvenile animal that seems to be in need:
</P>
<P>
   _ A nestling, a young bird with just the beginnings of feathers,
which has fallen out of the nest should be put back in the original
nest or a makeshift one hung from a nearby tree branch. A plastic
berry basket lined with paper towels works well. If no parent
returns by nightfall, call a rehabilitator or animal shelter for
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Fledglings, young birds with full feathers, and occasional downy
tufts on their heads, spend a great deal of time hopping around on
the ground. They are capable of short-distance flights, and the
parent birds are often heard or seen nearby. They should be left
alone unless obviously sick or injured.
</P>
<P>
   _ Squirrel babies, found on the ground, need help if their eyes
haven't opened yet or they are incompletely furred. Place a fallen
squirrel in a partially covered box at the bottom of a tree and
stay completely out of sight. If the mother doesn't retrieve her
young within a few hours or by nightfall, call the rehabilitator or
animal shelter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby rabbits usually require no assistance if the nest area is
intact and the parent is in the area. They are fed by the mother at
dawn and dusk, so you are unlikely to actually see her. If you find
furless young with closed eyes, put them back in the nest and cover
the nest with loose grass and mark the top with an X made of
sticks. If the marker is undisturbed the next day, that usually
indicates the mother hasn't returned to feed them, a professional
should be called for further advice before removing the young.
</P>
<P>
   If rabbits are active and furred with open eyes and erect ears,
they are probably old enough to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fawns are often left alone by their mothers for long periods
of time during the day. So unless a fawn is bleeding or looks
physically injured, it is best to vacate the area so the mother
will feel safe returning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opossum young will occasionally fall off the mother. If the
juvenile is longer than 7 inches (not counting the tail), it is
best to leave it alone. Many young opossums have been saved from
certain death by bystanders who have retrieved them from their
mother's pouch or from the surrounding area after she has been hit
by a car.
</P>
<P>
   If you determine that a wild animal really does need help, the
first thing to do is call an animal shelter, which can direct you
to a wildlife rehabilitator. You will be advised how to keep the
animal safe, warm and protected until you can get the appropriate
help.

&HT;     EMPLOYEE SUITS TARGET POPULAR RETIREMENT PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For millions of Americans, 401(k) retirement
plans are their first introduction to investing.
</P>
<P>
   And these programs are becoming increasingly important saving
tools for workers, supplementing the traditional Social Security
safety net and sometimes replacing corporate pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have parked $1.7 trillion in 401(k) accounts to take
advantage of tax deferred savings and, in many cases, matching
contributions from employers. Just 10 years ago, employees
contributed $385 billion to these accounts, according to the Profit
Sharing/401(k) Council of America in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plans have grown by leaps and bounds,'' said Dan
Riesenberg, an employee benefits lawyer in the Luce Forward
Hamilton Scripps law firm in San Diego. ``Employees have gotten
much more interested in the stock market and retirement plan
investments. And employers want employees to take more
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawback is that people just learning about investments
through 401(k)s could get burned when they make decisions on issues
that require them to be experts in retirement law. That is why
under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act,
companies must operate their 401(k) plan with an exclusive eye
toward benefiting participants, from prudently managing the assets
to providing information in a timely, comprehensible fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Three recent lawsuits filed by the Washington D.C.-based
Sprenger &AMP; Lang law firm highlight the potential conflicts between
workers and employers who are entrusted to manage their retirement
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a former vice president of New York Life Insurance
Co. charged that the company improperly managed its employees'
retirement savings accounts. The class-action suit alleges the
company poured those assets into its institutional mutual fund
business, mediocre funds that resulted in the loss of millions of
dollars to employee retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 18 former and current employees of SBC Communications
Inc. of San Antonio charged that the corporation lost $1.15 billion
of its employees' retirement funds when it sold off 11 million
shares held in 401(k) accounts of AirTouch Communications Inc., the
high-flying mobile phone unit that the telephone company spun off
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, employees at Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union Bank
sued the corporation, claiming that it restricted their investment
choices to the funds that it controls rather than
better-performing, lower-fee funds offered by competing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies named in all three lawsuits deny the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an irony here. Companies argue that 401(k)s are
empowering workers, helping them save for themselves,'' said Karen
Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center, a consumer
advocacy group in Washington, D.C. ``But now that they (employees)
are told they're in charge, they want to make sure they have a
say.''
</P>
<P>
   These cases could have a major impact on the way companies must
convey changes to retirement plans and inform employees of all
their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be made very clear in the law that employers have a
lot greater duty to communicate,'' said lawyer Fred Reish, an
employee benefits expert at Reish &AMP; Luftman, a law firm in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A central issue in the SBC case is whether the company gave
clear, timely and informative notice to plan participants.
</P>
<P>
   After SBC acquired Pacific Bell in 1997, the company
automatically converted Pacific Bell shares into SBC stock, a
common practice of acquiring companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquiring company usually tries to integrate employees and
assets into their workforce,'' said David Wray, president of Profit
Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a trade group of companies that
offer such plans. ``The idea here is to bring new people into
existing plans. It's typical.''
</P>
<P>
   What has come under fire is how SBC dealt with the AirTouch
portion of the retirement portfolio and communicated those changes
to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that SBC misled its plan participants by
failing to disclose the option that would have allowed them to keep
all or some of their lucrative AirTouch stock.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the SBC notice sent to employees would ``take an
expert and mind-reader,'' said Eli Gottesdiener, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs. ``The relationship should not have been adversarial. It
should have been like a parent to a child, going out of the way to
explain.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the lack of information helped ensure
that plan participants would convert their AirTouch stock to SBC
shares, boosting the company's stock prices _ a move motivated by
corporate gain rather than employee interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big part of my retirement. We can't live on
pensions, that's for sure,'' said Darlene Haney, 55, of Simi
Valley, a retired communications technician and plaintiff in a
separate but related lawsuit against SBC. ``This is definitely
going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC, in a statement, denied those allegations. Officials said
that the AirTouch sell-off brought Pacific Bell retirement plans in
line with their company policy: No SBC savings plans should include
direct stock ownership in any company not related to SBC.
</P>
<P>
   John Riley, 61, a retired Pacific Bell employee from San Mateo,
said that SBC had assured employees that changes to their 401(k)
accounts would be minimal after the merger. He would have fought to
keep his 304 AirTouch shares had he been better informed about his
choices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did want to keep it. It was a much better growth prospect
than either Pacific Telesis or SBC stock,'' Riley said. ``I felt I
had lost out after Vodafone bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC began selling the AirTouch shares on May 1, 1998, when
mobile phone company AirTouch's shares were $52.25.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, 1999, as AirTouch was being acquired by Vodafone
AirTouch PLC _ after a bidding war with Bell Atlantic drove up
stock prices _ its shares reached $107.67. The lawsuit alleges that
SBC ``knew or should have known'' about the pending takeover and
should have waited to sell the shares at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   SBC declined to comment on its policy of when to buy and sell
stock or otherwise make changes to the design of employees' 401(k)
accounts.

renaissance. A new generation of physicists is stretching its
collective mind and coming up with radical ideas about how the

extra dimensions. Others are building bridges between islands of
thought that once seemed hopelessly remote, rekindling hopes of a

 &HT;    Supreme Court picks hang heavy over election
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in Washington and politics category
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not much discussed in campaign appearances,
but the question of who will win the power to appoint the next
Supreme Court justices _ maybe up to four in the next four years _
hangs heavy over this year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two major presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore
has raised the court issue most often. And when he does, it is
usually to evoke the specter of a Republican president undoing Roe
v. Wade, the 1972 Supreme Court ruling that guaranteed a woman's
right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a Supreme Court majority that is in keeping with
the philosophy of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, that is what is
at stake in this election,'' Gore said during the Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, while less talkative on the subject of judicial appointments,
is nonetheless mindful that the next president's appointments could
have enormous influence on a nine-member court that is closely
divided on contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, ironically, he has linked himself to Ronald Reagan rather
than to his father, George H.W. Bush, in putting forth a ``strict
constructionist'' view of judicial appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same position that Governor Reagan, soon to be
President Reagan, took in the '80 debate,'' Bush said during the
Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of Supreme Court appointments bubbled to the
surface of the presidential contest Monday with the court's 6-3
ruling that student-led prayers before high school football games
violates the constitutionally required separation of government and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case from Texas that included a brief
from Bush urging the high court to uphold such student-led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But abortion is the central issue in the political debate over
the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the presidential primaries began this year, the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) ran
television ads in New Hampshire last December warning that Bush
would appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   And since the primaries, President Clinton has joined the fray,
noting earlier this year that there is ``absolutely no question in
my mind that whether Roe vs. Wade is preserved or scrapped depends
on what happens in the presidential election, and to pretend
otherwise is naive.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other divisive issues before the justices, however.
And one new justice could change the court's thinking on such
issues as racial preferences, separation of church and state,
voting rights, sex discrimination, criminal law and the power
relationship between Congress and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is the hinge _ nearly every important vote is
5-4,'' said Herman Shwartz, a constitutional law professor at
American University's Washington College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   The three oldest justices are Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
75, Justice John Paul Stevens, 79, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
70. Two of them _ Rehnquist and Stevens _ have already exceeded the
average length of services of justices, 23 years. And O'Connor will
mark her 23rd year on the court in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Of those appointed since 1986, the oldest is Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, 66, who has undergone surgery for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to predict when a court opening will occur,
however. Three of the last four justices to retire did so when they
were well into their eighties: William Brennan at 84, Thurgood
Marshall at 83 and Harry Blackmun at 85.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Gore and Bush camps clearly anticipate that the
next president could appoint enough justices to affect domestic
politics well into the 21st century, beginning with abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he would look for justices ``who understand that
our Constitution is a living and breathing document, that it was
intended by our Founders to be interpreted in the light of the
constantly evolving experience of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he has indicated he would ``not use a litmus test''
regarding abortion rights in selecting justices, he has vowed that
``you could rest assured that a Supreme Court majority appointed in
a Gore administration would support a woman's right to chose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would name judges ``who will strictly interpret
the Constitution and not use the benches from which to legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has cited Justice Antonin Scalia, perhaps the court's
most conservative member and most outspoken opponent of abortion,
as the justice he respects most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed very encouraging that Scalia is the type of judge
that Bush would look to (for the court),'' said David O'Steen, the
executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, the
most active anti-abortion organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American
Way Foundation (PFAWF), countered: ``If the far right succeeds in
remaking the court in the image of Scalia ..., the result would be
a disaster for millions of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as it is impossible to predict when a Supreme Court
vacancy will occur, so it is to predict how a new justice will
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are still seething over the appointment of David
H. Souter to the court. Souter, who was appointed by President
Bush, is counted among the court's liberals in most instances and
has voted solidly in favor of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, when asked about his father's appointment of
Souter, ducked the question. ``Nice try,'' Bush responded. ``I'm
not going into all of that.''

&HT;     CAN ANYONE TOPPLE TIGER WOODS? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It's hard to be philosophical when you're
young. Too many trees, not enough forest, and all that.
</P>
<P>
   But the old hands who have watched Tiger Woods make his first
fortune en route to the PGA Tour, make another while on it, and now
back up his advance notice with deeds as monumental as Sunday's
15-stroke victory at the U.S. Open . . . they're the ones who know
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done is raise the bar to a standard only he can
reach,'' said Tom Watson, one of the few golfers of the last
half-century who knows the triple burdens of trying to be lead dog,
being lead dog, and losing the job. ``People are starting to
realize that. The players are saying, `Is there any other player
but Tiger Woods?' and the answer is, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   This coming from a man who was the answer to the question, ``Is
there any other player but Jack Nicklaus?'' in the late '70s. This,
coming from a man who could not be the answer to the question, ``Is
there any other player but Tom Watson?'' until the early '80s.
Watson got it coming and going, as Nicklaus did before him.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods didn't have that as he ascended what has been mostly
a remote throne, nor does he seem to have it now. His victory in
the Open puts him alone, with no challenger even in sight, no
matter how many straw golfers are propped up before him.
</P>
<P>
   He now owns two of the 12 most lopsided victories in
professional golf history. He missed by a single stroke tying the
record for widest margin ever, in the hardest tournament there is.
A potential rival? Save your candidate the embarrassment and hold
your tongue with rivet tongs.
</P>
<P>
   There is but one, and there is no visible second, or even a
third. Welcome again to one-man golf.
</P>
<P>
   The last fellow in this position was Nicklaus, and the older
hands still cling to him as the shield for the greatness of an
earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I can think of someone who was far ahead of the rest of
the field like this. Jack,'' said Tom Kite. ``The late '60s, early
'70s . . . he was by far No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when you consider Gary Player or Lee Trevino?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was by far No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see Woods as the Nicklaus in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young guys, I feel for them,'' Nick Price said.
``They're taking a pounding from this guy. I always thought some
day there would be someone who can hit the ball 300 yards
consistently and could putt like (Ben) Crenshaw. Well, (Woods) hits
the ball as far as anyone I've ever seen, and he putts better than
Crenshaw. He's a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that isn't clear enough for you, consider this, also from
Price:
</P>
<P>
   ``When he plays his best, it's almost impossible to beat him.
Maybe he can be beaten on a certain course here or there but not
everywhere. There are a lot of great young players out there right
now who won't get any credit because Tiger gets it all. I think
there are a lot of young guys who are going to start scheduling
around Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds disheartening to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need competition,'' Kite said. ``Otherwise, it gets to be
boring. I think Tiger wants that. He wants to be pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in a few years. Maybe by that college guy Price says is
out there. It doesn't seem likely, but the elders agree that the
line of succession cannot die out with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is healthy,'' Watson said. ``Someone's going to reach
that standard a few times and touch it. Some time in the future,
someone will do it. Remember when you guys used to ask me if there
would ever be someone to dominate the sport like that ever again,
and I always said, `Of course there will,' and here he is. And I
think that's a good thing. He brings youth, length, diversity,
commitment, and I think it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Price, too, advances the rising-tide-raises-all-boats theory
that most golfers believe to their economically conservative souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys in college now who will come out, and they're
all gauging their game to his game,'' Price said. ``Just the way
people came out and aimed their game at Nicklaus'.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a long time to wait, and a lot more one-sided slogs like
last weekend's. It also assumes that Woods intends to stand quietly
while the next heir-presumptive, whomever he might be, perfects his
chops.
</P>
<P>
   Watson spoke admiringly of the way Woods changed his backswing
to improve his ball-striking. Mark O'Meara gushed about his mental
control. The scoreboard screamed out the arm-bar he has across the
collective throat of the rest of the membership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only questions left between Woods and Nicklaus in
the debate to see who is the best golfer ever are ones that have
nothing to do with anyone but Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Will he have the creativity to discover fresh new ways to
compete with himself when the rest of the field is as prone and
inert the way it was last week? Can he find the self-control not to
drop F-bombs into the ears of small television viewers, as Nicklaus
had the self-control to lose all that weight and stop smoking while
he played? Will he resist the impulse to become so swamped by his
own fortune that he gets into golf course design, media
conglomerates and other forms of planetary domination?
</P>
<P>
   Will he see Michael Jordan, one of the men to whom he is now
compared, in his present incarnation and think, ``Hey, I think I'll
wear a suit every day and run the Warriors''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's not get stupid here. By comparison, winning the
United States Open by 15 shots is something any old cheese could
do.

&HT;     NBC COMES OUT ROARING, THANKS TO A TIGER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHELLE SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ NBC faced down one of sports
broadcasting's toughest mandates Sunday afternoon while telecasting
the final round of the U.S. Open, milking the drama out of a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But the network had two factors working in its favor. First, it
has plenty of experience, having done this routine with Super
Bowls, NBA Finals involving the Chicago Bulls and Olympic telecasts
where the events were, well, actually concluded. Second, the star
of this exercise in inevitability was Tiger Woods, who gave the day
a Super Bowl-like feel with the two-touchdown margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for success here was really quite easy. Put Tiger on
the air and keep him coming.
</P>
<P>
   Run out of things to say about him? Show him playing. He isn't
playing at that particular moment? Show tape of what he did at the
previous hole, the one before that and if necessary, the one before
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably on the air about 50 percent of the time,''
estimated NBC executive producer Tom Roy.
</P>
<P>
   If watching Tiger Woods do a number on a field of the world's
top players isn't going to prove entertaining then watching him do
a number on history would have to suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had barely gotten to the 11th tee when NBC host Dan Hicks
announced that ``it's not too premature to start the coronation''
and the graphics department started pumping out statistics of
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The only suspense left by the time he made his victory lap down
the fairway at 18 was whether he would finish with a four-round
total of 271 and break the U.S. Open record held by Jack Nicklaus
and Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the day, with this golf course playing so
difficult, there was a chance that Tiger could have come back to
the field. But obviously that didn't happen,'' Roy said. ``At that
point it became a march to history and we started dealing with the
record and the appreciation of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the round wound down, Hicks _ strong in his debut as the Open
host _ called it ``a remarkable week by a remarkable player.''
Analyst Johnny Miller called it ``the greatest performance in golf
history.'' And while sports television and hyperbole go hand and
hand, it was tough to work up a rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   From a visual perspective it was a near-perfect day. In other
words, NBC couldn't have done much to screw it up. In fact, the
only bad grade for the day came at the end of the telecast when NBC
resorted to that pseudo-acoustic national anthem to accompany its
historical montage.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's best investment of the week turned out to be the boat-cam.
After it was fogged out of commission the first day and a half, it
turned out to be an impressive and effective angle. No more so than
on Sunday when Woods made his way up 18 with the cliffs in front of
him and the crowd behind him. It made the moment seem as big in
scope as it actually was, a feat that's often difficult for
television.
</P>
<P>
   All of this will pay off with huge ratings. Woods has proven to
be a viewer magnet no matter how competitive the rest of the field
and there was little else on to offer competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, England _ British customs officers searching a
consignment of imported tomatoes aboard a Dutch truck in this
Channel port early Monday found the bodies of 58 Asian men and
women inside the dark, airless space.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the people in the truck _ presumed to be
poor migrants being smuggled into Britain _ had died. But
suffocation was suspected after it was discovered that the
refrigeration equipment had been switched off, the doors had been
locked from the outside and there was scant ventilation. With
temperatures reaching 91 degrees, Sunday was the hottest day in
Britain so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Two male survivors were taken to a Kent County hospital, and the
driver, identified only as a citizen of the Netherlands, was
arrested. The victims _ all adults and all but four of them men _
were described as ``orientals'' until a more accurate national
identity could be established. The majority of Asians who try to
enter Britain surreptitiously are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pugash, spokesman for the Kent police, said the two
survivors were expected to recover, though he added, ``It's hard to
say `non-life-threatening' when you consider the trauma they went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Their security, he said, was a top priority, and they were being
closely guarded. ``This kind of thing doesn't happen spontaneously
on this scale,'' he said. `` It takes a lot of planning and finance
and coordination, and if you were one of those responsible for it,
you wouldn't want to have any survivors around afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking in Portugal where he was
attending a European Union summit meeting, said the discovery of
the bodies demonstrated the importance of stamping out the ``evil
trade in people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Intelligence
Section believes that at least 20 criminal groups are actively
involved in bringing illegal immigrants into Britain and forcing
them into prostitution and jobs at slave wages. Groups of
bewildered, frightened and sickly foreigners emerging from the
backs of overloaded vehicles have become a common sight at Dover
and other Channel ports.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the home secretary, Jack Straw, told the House of
Commons: ``This particular incident is now subject to a major
police investigation. The government is determined to continue to
crack down on the evil trade in such trafficking, whose
perpetrators have no regard for human life.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pugash said he had spoken to the police and customs officers who
first came upon the grisly sight. ``Nothing had prepared them for
what they found in that lorry,'' he said. ``They were absolutely
appalled, absolutely traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Knott, a Customs spokesman, said the truck, one of the
4,000 that pass through Dover's Eastern Docks terminal daily, had
been singled out just after midnight for inspection because it fit
a profile developed by officials to identify vehicles suspected of
transporting contraband. The Dutch-registered truck had just made
the four-and-a-half hour crossing from Zeebrugge on a freight-only
P &AMP; O Stena Line ship that left the Belgian port at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Knott declined to say what had aroused suspicions, but a
spokeswoman for the P &AMP; O shipping line said the driver paid cash
for the trip and the company to which the vehicle was registered,
Van Der Spek, was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Using a fork lift, the customs inspectors unloaded stacked
crates of tomatoes from the 58-foot truck that had in effect formed
a wall blocking what was behind. ``It is common for us to find
veneers, if you will, or false bulkheads like this put up to hide
things,'' Knott said.
</P>
<P>
   A single customs officer climbed into the exposed space, where
he made the horrifying discovery, Knott said. Emergency services
were summoned, and police took over the case. Two pathologists from
the Home Office arrived from London Monday morning to conduct
autopsies and determine how the victims had died.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, tomatoes still lay on the concrete loading
dock where customs officers, working in the dim amber light of the
unloading shed, had hurled them when they discovered the gruesome
human cargo. Forensic specialists dressed in white full-body suits
picked over the wilted vegetables and broken wood slats Monday
while the doctors worked inside a refrigeration hangar next door
that had been converted into an emergency morgue.
</P>
<P>
   A rolling flotilla of large ferries kept landing at the piers,
which lie at the base of Dover's famous white cliffs. Trucks rolled
down the gangplanks and then lumbered out the exits toward
northbound highways. In mid-afternoon, one of them was stopped,
and, as reporters watched, six young men were escorted out a back
door and marched into an interrogation office.

   The surge in the number of people seeking asylum is a big
political issue in Britain, an insular nation that has always felt
the added security of having no overland borders with other
countries, aside from the frontier between Northern Ireland and
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   A record 75,000 people claimed asylum for the year that ended in
February, compared with just over 49,000 the year before. The war
in Kosovo, which prompted many Kosovar Albanians to seek refuge in
the West, accounted for only some of the rise. There were large
influxes of people from Eastern Europe, Central Asia and, as
Monday's episode seemed to illustrate, China.
</P>
<P>
   Although the requests of most asylum-seekers to Britain are
denied, two-thirds of those who are refused vanish in an effort to
stay here. The government says it intends to get tougher and is
introducing plans to imprison and deport larger numbers of new
arrivals. Immigration has been at the center of political debate in
recent weeks, with Conservative party leader William Hague making
inroads on Blair's popularity by using deliberately emotive
language to warn of the dangers of a ``flood of bogus asylum
seekers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blair's government and the Conservative opposition joined Monday
in denouncing the lucrative and exploitative business of smuggling
human beings into Britain. Both Labor and Tory politicians stressed
the need for closer examination of cargoes on the continental
European side of the Channel. ``I accept entirely that there is a
need greatly for other countries to improve the checking of
vehicles coming in here,'' said Straw.
</P>
<P>
   The British government introduced tougher new measures this
spring, including fining drivers $3,000 for each illegal foreign
stowaway found in their trucks. Some $1.8 million has been levied
thus far, and a spokesman for Blair said Monday that ``As a result
of that, there's been a 49 percent reduction in the number of
clandestine entrants discovered in vehicles in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   When Straw visited Dover in April to publicize the new
regulations, he arrived at a moment when eight illegal immigrants
were being flushed from the back of a Czech truck.
</P>
<P>
   The government may boast of the effectiveness of the fines, but
drivers and trucking companies claim that the government is
penalizing them for the failures of border control authorities.
Drivers say people clamber onto the trucks without their knowledge
while they are parked on side roads or in gas station or restaurant
parking lots while waiting to cross the Channel. One company
official told The Evening Standard, ``It's like a householder being
fined for reporting a burglary.''

LET 'EM EAT `STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let them eat cake.'' Those words have come ringing down the
centuries as the height of hauteur. Marie Antoinette was never able
to live them down, even after the queen followed her husband, Louis
XVI, to the guillotine after the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, whenever a hardhearted trickle-downer suggests that
a rising tide lifts all the boats, he or she is denounced for
having ``an arrogant let-them-eat-cake attitude,'' unconcerned with
the needs of the common people.
</P>
<P>
   She never said it. The source of this canard is the sixth book
of ``The Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau'': ``At length I
recollected the thoughtless saying of a great princess, who, on
being informed that the country people had no bread, replied, `Let
them eat cake.''' (The words, in French, read `` &UR; Qu'ils mangent de
la brioche &LR; .'')
</P>
<P>
   However, these words were written in or about 1770, the same
year the daughter of the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire arrived
in France to marry its crown prince. Rousseau was attributing that
saying to some other ``great princess.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth about Marie was just the opposite: She recognized the
need for austerity at court and reduced the royal household staff,
but in so doing offended snooty nobles, who proceeded to down-mouth
her for posterity. I get incensed at this historical linguistic
injustice every time I look up the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is that the only never-said-it. Who can forget ``The Guard
dies, but never surrenders'' (`` &UR; Le Garde meurt, mais ne se rend
pas &LR; '')? The Count Cambronne, the head of Napoleon's most loyal
troops at the Battle of Waterloo, to whom it was attributed, went
to his grave wishing we would forget it, because he insisted that
he never said it.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century after the battle, the writer Edouard Fournier
credited a reporter named Rougemont with the creation of the
ringing phrase. It may be counterapocryphal, but some say the
count's battlefield response to a demand for surrender was the
expletive `` &UR; merde! &LR; '' _ a favorite Hemingway word for excrement
sometimes referred to in France as `` &UR; le mot de Cambronne &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   These belated corrections are made here today because of a
response received after a correction of a more recent
misconception: Richard Nixon's never-said ``I have a secret plan to
end the war.'' I challenged anyone to come up with a contemporary
citation directly quoting the 1968 candidate saying it; nobody ever
has.
</P>
<P>
   Because word got around the White House that great
misattributions were being straightened out in this space, the
following handwritten note came in from Sandy Berger, national
security adviser: ``Bill _ Since you have asserted frequently that
Bill Clinton is the `architect of the strategic partnership' with
Beijing, and because you are a stickler for the facts, I would like
you to show me one instance in which the President describes the
relationship as a  &UR; strategic partnership &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, could it be that Clinton is being unjustly saddled with a
never-said-it? You can get hundreds of citation hits on the
databases when you type in `` &UR; strategic partnership &LR; '' and
``Clinton.'' An article in Japan's daily Yomiuri Shimbun in 1998:
``Last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United
States, and this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton returned the
visit. On both occasions, the two countries began using the term
` &UR; strategic partnership &LR; ' between the two powers to describe their
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Lim wrote recently in The International Herald Tribune,
``Two years ago, Clinton announced a ` &UR; strategic partnership &LR; ' with
China.'' And a vituperative right-wing New York Times columnist
(albeit a stickler for the facts) has been writing frequently of
``Clinton, architect of the discredited ` &UR; strategic partnership &LR; '
with Beijing.'' Could we all be wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Berger goes on: ``On many occasions we have said that we would
hope to develop a  &UR; strategic partnership &LR; , i.e., described it as an
aspirational goal. But there is a big difference between describing
an objective for the future and what exists today. I can provide
you what the President actually  &UR; said  &LR; in Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, upon my eager request, he did. On July 3, 1998, the
president (New York Times style, unlike White House style, is to
lowercase the name of the office) said in Hong Kong, ``My view is
that the potential we have for a  &UR; strategic partnership  &LR; is quite
strong.'' This followed by five days Jiang Zemin's usage:
``progress in the direction of building a constructive  &UR; strategic
partnership &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, and in a dozen other citations provided by the
White House, the Clinton context is, as Berger asserts,
``aspirational'' _ a hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the future were the only context for the Clinton use of the
phrase, then all of us who have been deriding the president as
``architect of the discredited policy of a  &UR; strategic
partnership &LR; '' _ as if it signified his notion of a present state
of affairs _ would surely owe him and his advisers abject
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is the problem of the Clinton statement to
business leaders in Shanghai, China, on July 1, 1998, dutifully
provided by the White House. Discussing normal trade treatment for
China, an issue then known as MFN (for ``most favored nation''),
Clinton warned what would happen if Congress did not respond to his
plea to vote to renew the normal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to renew that would sever our economic ties,'' he
said, ``denying us the benefits of China's growth, endangering the
 &UR; strategic partnership &LR; , turning our back on the world's largest
nation at a time when cooperation for peace and stability is more
important and more productive than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   When Berger saw that citation, he must have uttered an American
translation of  &UR; le mot de Cambronne &LR; , but to his credit he did not
remove it from the file. A close analysis of the structure of that
sentence, especially its concluding ``at a time'' clause, indicates
clearly that the president was speaking of the  &UR; strategic
partnership &LR;  as something now in existence _ a current relationship
that would be endangered if Congress failed to act as he wished.
</P>
<P>
   Had he only put  &UR; prospective &LR; ,  &UR; potential &LR;  or  &UR; hoped-for &LR;  in
front of the key phrase, the Berger hypothesis would have been
unchallengeable.
</P>
<P>
   You could say in Clinton's defense that he was ad-libbing and
intended to follow the agreed-upon future formulation but just
slipped into the present tense on a single occasion. And it is
undeniable that the other Clinton and Jiang citations follow the
prospective-relationship formula.
</P>
<P>
   What's fair? We should recall the raw deals that loose
historians have given the brioche-free Marie Antoinette, the
die-hard count and the secret-plan-less Nixon. Unless other usages
surface, accuracy-stickling Sinophobes should limit themselves to
castigating ``the ` &UR; strategic partnership &LR; ' that Clinton frequently
hoped for and  &UR; in one instance &LR;  suggested his policy produced.''

   Fighting Fog
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do antifogging treatments for mirrors and eyeglasses
work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Antifogging agents force the tiny droplets of water that make
up fog to merge into a transparent sheet, said Ken Duffie, chief
engineer for H.L. Bouton Inc. of Wareham, Mass., which makes safety
glasses and related products, including an antifogging agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spray a liquid on the lens, and when it dries it forms a
clear film,'' he said. ``Normally, water beads up, but when you add
the surfactant, the beads run together. The water is still there,
but you can see through it.''
</P>
<P>
   A surfactant is a chemical that lowers the surface tension of
the liquid in which it is dissolved, in this case water. The exact
chemistry of the product is proprietary, Duffie said, but it
basically resembles soaps or detergents.
</P>
<P>
   A low-cost emergency substitute for commercial antifogging
agents is potato juice. In research on land-mine removal at the
University of Western Australia, potato juice was tested for use in
poor countries to keep blast-protection visors from fogging up. It
performed as well as some brand-name products.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers cut a slice from a raw potato, rubbed it
generously and evenly onto the inside surface of the visor, then
wiped away solids and excess juice with a soft cloth.
</P>

&HT;     PROSECUTORS LOSE CASE AFTER POLICE VIOLATE SUSPECTS RIGHT TO
REMAIN SILENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A gardener discovered the dead man face up in
the dry creek bed at the edge of the University of California at
Davis campus, amidst crushed beer cans and cigarette butts. He was
missing one sandal.
</P>
<P>
   Forty feet above him on Low Water Bridge, police found his other
sandal, along with a receipt for beer and a cashed unemployment
check. Those clues led them to arrest three men who allegedly
confessed to robbing Jose Garcia Reyes and pitching him to his
death on Aug. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution of the case fell apart after disclosures
that detectives conducted illegal or coercive interrogation
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate resulting in no justice for Mr. Reyes,'' said
Deputy District Attorney Valerie McGuire, the Solano County
prosecutor. ``It's unfortunate . . . anytime police officers engage
in conduct that's prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reyes case demonstrates that improper interrogation tactics
can undermine the criminal justice process. It suggests that such
police methods are especially dangerous when used on suspects who
are illiterate and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   The case confirms that video- and audio-taping entire
interrogation sessions can be crucial to establishing what goes on
inside the interrogation room. Only two states, Alaska and
Minnesota, require recording interrogations, and the practice
elsewhere in the United States and in California varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   And it illustrates what experts say is a police tendency to rely
on purported confessions at the expense of other evidence that may
corroborate _ or contradict - suspects' statements.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives in the Reyes case had no evidence against the three
defendants other than their statements, McGuire acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming they had the case sewn up, the officers failed to
adequately pursue evidence implicating a fourth man, a convict who
police say was the last known person seen with Reyes, defense
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the case collapsed when a judge suppressed
statements from the first suspect because a detective failed to
fully advise him of his Miranda rights to remain silent and to have
legal help before questioning. The judge threw out statements from
a second suspect because another detective kept questioning him
after he invoked his right to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Miranda procedure is meant to protect the constitutional
right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge disregarded statements from the third suspect
because, while the detective advised him of his Miranda rights, he
then used promises and threats to illegally extract a statement
ruled involuntary and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was, in fact, coercion,'' said Solano County Superior
Court Judge Eric R. Uldall.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the prosecution team said in interviews that no one
had meant to violate the suspects' rights. ``Nobody tried to
coerce, intentionally, any statements out of these guys,'' said Lt.
Joyce A. Souza of the UC-Davis Police Department. ``There was no
conspiracy to try and violate anyone's constitutional rights.
Everybody thought they were doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the San Francisco Examiner found a pattern in which police
across the state violated the Miranda rights of suspects _
sometimes deliberately _ in efforts to obtain incriminating
information.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Justice has told police they may
lawfully question suspects even after they have invoked their
rights to remain silent or to have legal counsel, although state
and federal courts have criticized the practice as illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court is now considering whether to overturn
the Miranda rule in a case called U.S. vs. Dickerson. Some
prosecutors say Miranda lets criminals escape punishment, but the
U.S. Department of Justice says that the rule helps win convictions
and that reversing it would bring more claims that police violated
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how police handled the Reyes case emerged from
court records, police reports and interrogation transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, 57, was an unemployed tomato picker known as an amiable
drunk around his neighborhood in Dixon, a city of 15,110 just south
of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The receipt on the bridge led Solano County Sheriff's Detective
Jose Cuevas to the Home Town Market in Dixon, where a clerk
confirmed that Reyes, joined by a younger man, had cashed his $264
unemployment check the day before. The detective learned the pair
had gone to buy more beer at a nearby 7-Eleven, where a
surveillance camera filmed Reyes and the other man, whom he
recognized as Ruben Campos.
</P>
<P>
   Campos was an illiterate migrant laborer who spoke little
English. He worked in the UC-Davis grape fields, his attorney said,
and was in the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Campos lived in a child's play house in the yard behind some
friends' rented home, court records show. He was about 24 years
old, but didn't know his birth date.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Cuevas found Campos sitting in front of his friends'
house, and Campos voluntarily went to Dixon police headquarters,
where detectives interrogated him.
</P>
<P>
   Cuevas' subsequent report made the case look tidy: Campos
initially denied being with Reyes the day of his death but then
admitted to murder.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Campos confessed that he, Guadalupe
Franklin and Juan Palomino had spent much of the day drinking with
Reyes. Around midnight, the four men drove to Low Water Bridge and
drank more. When Reyes refused to lend Franklin $20, Franklin hit
him. Campos added that he and the other men had then thrown Reyes
from the bridge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Campos' statement, police focused on Franklin and
Palomino.
</P>
<P>
   Like Campos, they were uneducated immigrants and manual
laborers. ``Most of their day appears to be spent wandering from
one bar or store to another to obtain alcohol,'' said John Coffer,
Franklin's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   And like Campos, reported Cuevas, both men denied and then
admitted beating Reyes at the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   But in court, the prosecution began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Campos' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Donald Sawyer,
contended that UC-Davis police detective Javier Barragan, who
initially interrogated Campos, had failed to give him complete
Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Campos was confused but apparently tried to invoke his rights to
remain silent and to have a lawyer, the interrogation transcript
shows. Yet the detective continued to question him. At the end of
the interrogation, Campos was arrested for murder.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he allegedly confessed his role in the murder to
Cuevas.
</P>
<P>
   But in court, Deputy District Attorney McGuire revealed that
UC-Davis police had told her they had deliberately interfered with
Campos' right to counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detective Barragan indicated he intentionally failed to give
Mr. Campos his complete advisement,'' McGuire told the judge,
according to a court transcript. ``He told me he did this to
intentionally elicit a statement from Mr. Campos.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire agreed that by law Campos' statements could not be used
to prove his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people don't have any other evidence against Mr. Campos,''
McGuire told the court. ``Therefore, the people move to dismiss.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Guadalupe Franklin, 42, who lived with Campos in the
play house and who spoke English poorly, was also thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Uldall found the interrogation was not coercive but he
ruled that kSolano County Sheriff's Detective Jose Cuevas had
violated Franklin's Miranda rights by questioning him after he'd
invoked his right to remain silent. At McGuire's request, the court
dismissed the case on May 10, 1999 for insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Juan Palomino, 21, who spoke no English, was thrown
out after it was shown that Cuevas in effect force-fed a confession
to Palomino and coerced him into regurgitating it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ofshe, a UC-Berkeley sociologist and court-recognized
expert on interrogations, testified for the defense that Cuevas'
interrogation of Palomino was among the most coercive he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Ofshe said the case underscored the importance of recording
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this hadn't been tape recorded, there's a good likelihood
Palomino would have been convicted,'' Ofshe said.
</P>
<P>
   The case also shows that police may put too much weight on
uncorroborated confessions, Ofshe said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the confessions crumbled in court, police failed to
adequately pursue evidence pointing to another potential suspect,
sources said. So far the suspect has not been arrested.

<P>
   To listen to the manufacturers of an ever-growing list of
germ-fighting products _ including antibacterial soaps and sprays,
toothbrushes and toothpastes, pajamas and slippers, sheets and
mattresses, potty chairs, high chairs, toys, sponges, cutting
boards and even chopsticks and paper towels _ my family and I
should have been riddled with disease all these many years.
</P>
<P>
   My husband is allergic to antibacterial soaps, so we abandoned
them 34 years ago. I do not have a dishwasher, so our dishes,
glasses and utensils are not ``sterilized'' at high temperatures. I
had no clothes dryer for 20 years and still don't use one for
drying and ``sterilizing'' our clothes. We use sponges to wipe the
kitchen counters and cloth towels to dry our hands. We ride the
subways, often holding the poles that the ads tell us are crawling
with billions of germs. And we do not use instant ``hand
sanitizer.''
</P>
<P>
   As infants, our sons crawled around the streets and parks of New
York, putting whatever they happened to find into their mouths,
which is how babies test their interest in all manner of objects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to my knowledge, none of us has ever acquired an
``environmental'' infection or even spread microorganisms from one
person to another. In fact, we have been remarkably healthy for
more than three decades, despite what the manufacturers tell us:
that everything from our hands to our counters to our supposedly
clean laundry is crawling with potentially pathogenic bacteria that
their products can wipe out.
</P>
<P>
   But can they? And if they can, at what price does this
superhygienic environment come? People frightened by a microbial
world that harbors superbugs they believe are out to get them may
be adopting an approach that actually fosters rather than
suppresses serious infections.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month at a conference sponsored by the American
Medical Association, Dr. Stuart Levy, director of the Center for
Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in
Boston, voiced serious concerns about the more than 700
antibacterial products now crowding the marketplace. They do not,
he said, kill all bacteria, only those that are most susceptible.
They upset the natural balance of microorganisms and they leave
behind the bacteria that are strong enough to survive and multiply.
Furthermore, these surviving bacteria may evolve resistance to both
antimicrobials and antibiotics that could be transferred to
dangerous pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, because of the growing concern about the emergence of
antibiotic-resistant germs, the American Medical Association urged
the government to step up regulation of antibacterial soaps,
lotions and other household products.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the process two years ago in Scientific American,
Levy wrote: ``Bacteria are a natural, and needed, part of life.
Most live blamelessly. In fact, they often protect us from disease
because they compete with, and thus limit the proliferation of,
pathogenic bacteria. The benign competitors can be important allies
in the fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.''
</P>
<P>
   In making a case against products spiked with antibacterials, he
explained: ``Like antibiotics, antibacterials can alter the mix of
bacteria; they simultaneously kill susceptible bacteria and promote
the growth of resistant strains. These resistant microbes may
include bacteria that were present from the start. But they can
also include ones that were unable to gain a foothold previously
and are now able to thrive thanks to the destruction of competing
microbes.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance to proliferate, some of these emergent
organisms ``may become new agents of disease,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently used antibacterial agent in consumer
products is triclosan. Laura McMurry and colleagues in Levy's
laboratory have shown that while triclosan wipes out the most
sensitive bacteria, it also gives rise to bacteria that resist its
action by pumping the chemical out of their cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residues are the potential problem,'' Levy said. ``We're
talking about chemicals that can stick around in the home and
continue to select for resistance when the levels of these
chemicals drop. Then even high levels of the chemicals won't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem of creating a superhygienic
environment is misdevelopment of the immune system in children that
persists throughout life. The developing immune system may need to
be primed to function properly.
</P>
<P>
   During their first year of life, babies need to be exposed to
germs to foster the production of T-helper 1 cells, which make
antibodies to dangerous microorganisms. If the baby's environment
is too clean, the production of T-helper 1 cells is not adequately
stimulated and the immune system instead overproduces T-helper 2
cells, which create antibodies to allergens and could result in
lifelong allergies or asthma, a recent study in Italy showed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need for an ordinary healthy person to be a fanatic
about cleanliness, Levy said. Among the hygienic habits that make
sense are these:
</P>
<P>
   _Always wash your hands with soap and water after using the
toilet, before preparing or eating food, after working in the
garden or changing a dirty diaper.
</P>
<P>
   _Thoroughly rinse under running water all fruits and vegetables
before eating or preparing them, including foods like melons and
grapefruit. Skins can harbor disease-causing microorganisms that
contaminate the edible part of the food, especially if it sits
around unrefrigerated for a while.
</P>
<P>
   _Always thaw foods in the refrigerator. Do not leave cooked
foods unrefrigerated for more than two hours, or for more than one
hour when the temperature reaches 90.
</P>
<P>
   _Use separate cutting boards for uncooked meat, poultry or fish,
and for vegetables, fruits and bread. Always wash surfaces,
including the sink, and utensils that have been in contact with raw
meat, poultry, fish or eggs with hot soapy water as soon as you are
through using them.
</P>
<P>
   _Plastic cutting boards, sponges and dishcloths can be sanitized
in the dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   _To sanitize a surface or object, use bleach, denatured alcohol
or hydrogen peroxide. These do their work and disappear, leaving no
residue to foster microbial resistance. Laundry detergent with
bleach is fine.
</P>
<P>
   _Infant clothing, bedding, etc. might be washed separately from
adult laundry, but no special detergent is needed. If you use cloth
diapers, they should always be washed separately in hot water with
bleach.
</P>
<P>
   _Close the lid on the toilet before you flush it to keep tiny
droplets containing microorganisms from spewing into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The rules change if someone in the household is seriously ill or
has a compromised immune system. ``Products containing
antibacterial agents are best reserved for use when someone is very
sick,'' Levy said. ``When caring for a sick person, hand washing
should should take more than one minute.''

LABOR SEEKS NEW YORK MINIMUM WAGE OF $6.75 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A push by labor unions to lift New York state's minimum wage to
$6.75 an hour, from $5.15, has turned into one of the last major
battles in this year's legislative session in Albany, N.Y., as
small businesses lobby fiercely to block an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbyists are pressing the Republican-controlled state
Senate to vote against the increase before the end of the session,
scheduled Thursday. The Assembly, which is dominated by Democrats,
overwhelmingly approved the $6.75 wage two weeks ago by a vote of
120 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials argue that the minimum wage needs to be lifted
well above the $5.15-an-hour authorized by the federal government
because living expenses are so high in New York. But corporate
leaders assert that raising the minimum wage would hurt small
businesses, especially upstate, where pay levels are generally
lower than in New York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of issue that excites fierce support and
opposition from such diametrically opposed groups that there would
never be a legislative resolution until the very last minute,''
said Edwin Donnelly, the chief lobbyist for the New York State
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The wage issue is heavy with political consequences this year,
since all 211 seats in the Legislature are up for grabs in
November. Many Republicans fear that if they oppose a higher
minimum wage, the Democrats and labor unions will flog them over
the issue in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican lawmakers consider an increase to $6.75 in
January to be preposterously steep and say the Assembly Democrats
proposed so large a jump not with the expectation that it will
become law, but in the hope that it will become a winning campaign
issue. Many Senate Republicans are also unhappy with a provision in
the Assembly bill that would raise the minimum wage each year at
the same rate that the statewide average wage rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate raise to $6.75 and the escalator are poison
pills to make sure this doesn't pass,'' said Assemblyman John Faso,
the Republican minority leader. ``I think this is a political
gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, New York has not raised its minimum wage above the
federal level, but some Assembly Democrats said it was time to do
so because the $10,000 a year paid to full-time workers making the
minimum wage was too low to support a family. They also noted that
Connecticut and Massachusetts had raised their minimum wage above
federal levels. Connecticut's is $6.15 an hour and will rise to
$6.70 on Jan. 1, 2002. The Massachusetts minimum of $5.25 will go
to $6 in January, and $6.75 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s you could support a family on the minimum wage,
but you can't do that in any guise, way or form now,'' said
Catherine Nolan of Queens, chairwoman of the Assembly's labor
committee and the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for $12 an hour, we're asking for $6.75,
which is achievable. The more money you put into people's pockets,
the more money they spend. So this would help the economy by
generating more goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said that the business groups were shocked that the higher
minimum wage sailed through the Assembly, and have responded with a
huge lobbying campaign in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Alesse, state director of the National Federation of
Independent Business, an association of small businesses, said he
was confident that a higher minimum wage would not be approved this
year, but Donnelly of the AFL-CIO expressed confidence that labor
would prevail on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Alesse called a raise to $6.75 ``a hideously bad idea.'' ``The
small-business community is completely unanimous against this,'' he
said. ``It will hurt the business climate and in particular the
small-business community.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that most minimum wage workers in New York were
teen-agers, he said raising the minimum wage would do little to
lift families out of poverty. Instead, raising the minimum wage
would cause many small businesses to lay off low-wage workers, he
said, because it could squeeze their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   One of business' biggest fears is that if the minimum wage does
go to $6.75, it would put pressure on employers to give raises to
workers earning $6.75 to $9 an hour. Many union leaders also say
that is how a higher minimum wage could help lift many low-wage
families out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader,
was caught between business lobbyists who want him to stop any
minimum wage increase and Republican pragmatists who are urging him
to negotiate with Assembly leaders for a smaller increase.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was consulting with labor, business, the Assembly and Gov.
George Pataki, said Bruno's a spokesman, John McArdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do something in such a way that's not going to
put smaller business at a disadvantage, while also recognizing
labor markets out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said he was open to increasing the minimum wage,
although he said he feared it could hurt the tourism industry in
the Catskills and Adirondacks, where many workers at hotels,
restaurants and ski resorts are paid the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   As for the increase to $6.75 approved by the Assembly, Charles
Deister, a spokesman for the governor, said, ``It's certainly
something he'll take a look at.'' He added that the governor
thought the minimum wage was an issue that should be handled at the
federal level, not the state level.
</P>
<P>
   The Working Families Party, a new political party set up with
the support of several labor unions, is one of the main forces
behind the push for a higher minimum wage. Some Senate Republicans,
worried that their seats might be vulnerable, are hoping to gain
the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which would give
them an extra ballot line. But the party has said it will look to
whether a candidate has backed the higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Some lobbyists said that if the Senate took no action on the
minimum wage bill, it might seek to placate organized labor by
approving another labor-backed bill, one that would require a day
off each week for farm workers and would extend overtime coverage
to them. Under current law, farm workers can be required to work
365 days in a row and do not qualify for time-and-a-half pay when
they work more than 40 hours a week.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: PORTUGAL'S POUSADAS _ HISTORY WITH A
DISCOUNT  
 &HT;

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    For nearly six months out of the year, Portugal's
government-sponsored hotels, known as ``pousadas,'' offer a 40
percent discount for travelers ages 60 and older.
 &HT;    This was just the sort of deal that Ted and Fran Lewis of
Severna Park, Md., were hoping to find. Not long ago, the couple
planned to celebrate the completion of Fran's chemo and radiation
treatments for cancer by traveling to Portugal to take advantage of
the discount program at the pousadas. The discount applies to stays
Sundays through Thursdays from Nov. 2 to March 31. The Lewises'
accommodations ranged in cost from $60 to $130 (U.S.) per night,
which included a breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    After arriving at the Lisbon International Airport, the Lewises
got in their rental car, headed southeast across the long Vasco de
Gama bridge which spans the Tagus River and, after an hour on the
road, arrived in Alcacer de Sa. There, a resident directed them to
the Pousada de Alfonso II, which sits on the highest part of town
overlooking the River Sado.
 &HT;    The castle dates back thousands of years and has withstood the
occupations of the Phoenicians, Arabs and Romans. From their room,
they could see a number of stork nests on high poles, complete with
occupants.
 &HT;    On their first full day in Portugal, the Lewises took a
three-hour drive to Sagres and spent the night in the Pousada do
Infante. From there they took time to drive to Cabo St. Vincente
and explore the lighthouse where Prince Henry the Navigator is said
to have established his Navigation School.
 &HT;    ``The chefs all tried to outdo themselves by offering a
selection of local foods and desserts,'' says Ted, describing the
evening meals he and his wife enjoyed at the pousadas. Although
roast kid with herbs, giblet rice and rich fish soups would have
pleased any palate, Ted most enjoyed the small clams with fried
pork chunks. Each meal ended with coffee and a glass of port,
enjoyed by a crackling fireplace in the sitting room.
 &HT;    In the town of Evora, the couple checked into the Pousada dos
Loios, a former convent and now a UNESCO-designated Heritage Site,
in the historic center of town. Right outside the entrance is a
Roman temple that dates back to the second century and contains 14
of its original 18 columns.
 &HT;    The next day it was off to Beja and the Pousada de Sao
Francisco, a former Franciscan convent from the 18th century. The
Lewises say, ``the impressive building combines the mystic monument
of the past with today's standard of comfort.''
 &HT;    That evening, they were one of only three couples to eat in the
large dining hall. ``All through dinner, a talented pianist played
Gershwin and Cole Porter,'' Ted Lewis reports. ``After the meal, a
complimentary after-dinner drink from the region was presented by
the maitre d'.''
 &HT;    According to the Lewises, the meal prices in the pousadas were
on a par with those in good, local restaurants. For example, a
dinner for two, including bread, cheese, olives, a main course, a
bottle of wine and coffee, cost about $50 (U.S.) with tip.
Sometimes, after a heavy lunch, they simply shopped at the local
supermarkets for light dinner snacks.
 &HT;    Next up was the town of Obidos, which is completely encircled by
walls, all intact. There, the Pousada do Castelo was the first to
be adapted and restored from a historical monument.
 &HT;    From the castle ramparts, one can look down on the village of
typical white houses with blue trim, flower pots filled with
geraniums marching across the windowsills and narrow streets paved
with cobblestones.
 &HT;    During a brief stop in Batalha, the Lewises wandered through an
impressive monastery that stands as a fine example of Gothic
stonework. Nearby in the village of Fatima is the internationally
famous shrine of the same name, where, according to the Catholic
Church, three peasant children witnessed the appearance of the
Virgin Mary in 1917. A neo-Baroque basilica with a 215-foot-high
central tower dominates a 37-acre esplanade where the faithful
pray. On the esplanade there is a glass-enclosed building where
Mass is celebrated several times a day.
 &HT;    After heading north to Oporto to visit the port-wine caves along
the Douro River, the Lewises spent the night in the seaside town of
Villa do Conde in a 500-year-old inn similar to the pousadas. Then
they drove south the picturesque fishing village of Nazare. What
they had hoped to see _ colorful boats pulled up on the beach and
fisherwomen in their costumes of many petticoats handling the cargo
of fresh fish _ was far from the reality.
 &HT;    ``Well, we were several decades too late,'' Ted Lewis says. ``We
saw only one elderly lady drying her sardines and a wreck of an old
boat on the beach as a memento of the past.''
 &HT;    Lewis equates the comfort of the pousadas to that of four- and
five-star hotels. A bellhop was always on call, ready to lug their
luggage up to their room. ``Of the six pousadas we tried, only the
Pousada do Castelo in Obidos was missing an elevator,'' he says.
 &HT;    Before heading home, the Lewises stopped in Sintra to see the
Royal Palace. They also had a look at both Cascais and Estoril up
the coast from Lisbon before checking into the Pousada de Dona
Maria I in Queluz, where they spent their last night. Both agreed
that the trip ``was a special treat for both of us, as it was meant
to be.''

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Paradise is a relative term, and that's especially true when it
comes to choosing an island in the Caribbean. Some couples might
find a sleepy island such as Grenada to be Eden, one where
nightlife consists of quiet beachfront bars and the wake-up call
comes with the breaking surf.
 &HT;    But an active family of four might imagine paradise to be a
different place altogether, an island like Puerto Rico, where large
beachside hotels come with multiple pools and water slides,
kid-friendly restaurants and even a casino.
 &HT;    If price is an issue, choose an affordable island. For the most
bang for the buck, look to Aruba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica,
Puerto Rico and St. Thomas. They are all blessed with a large
number of resort hotels and condominiums. All of those rooms
translate to cheaper prices overall.
 &HT;    Secondly, all these islands are served by non-stop flights from
the United States. Flights are plentiful and relatively affordable,
since there's not a second or third flight in a puddle-jumper. And
the budget-minded will find that the most affordable air/hotel
package deals are available on these islands.
 &HT;    For those who can spare only three or four days, the flight
should be as painless as possible. So the Dominican Republic,
Jamaica, Puerto Rico and St. Thomas are also good picks _ islands
that are relatively close by and served by non-stop flights from
the United States.
 &HT;    Many people choose an island by default because they really want
to stay at a particular resort. It might be an upscale resort like
Guanahani on St. Bart's or a simpler place like Lambert Beach
Resort on Tortola.
 &HT;    For many travelers, that's just fine because in the end it's the
resort, not the island, that's the real destination for them. They
intend to spend the lion's share of their time there.
 &HT;    Even on bigger islands known for big resorts, such as Jamaica,
resorts like Strawberry Hill offer privacy and seclusion. For those
traveling with kids, choosing a kid-friendly resort is usually the
way to go, with the island taking second place.
 &HT;    But for travelers who like to explore, to get a little history,
find a little Caribbean culture or need a dash of city life,
choosing an island because of a certain resort may not be ideal if
the resort is isolated or seems like a compound.
 &HT;    Some islands are better than others, depending upon the season.
September and October mean prime hurricane season in the Caribbean,
so many resorts have low rates that reflect not just rain and
humidity but the real possibility of a storm visiting their island.
Try to head below the hurricane belt, to islands such as Aruba,
Bonaire, Curacao, Grenada, Tobago or Trinidad. These destinations
are almost always well out of harm's way and provide a safe haven
during these months.
 &HT;    Travelers looking for islands where formal dress means Teva
sandals and shorts should consider St. Croix, the perennial sleeper
of the three USVI. A little more bustling is the boater's haven of
Bequia; a little quieter still is Culebra, off the coast of Puerto
Rico.
 &HT;    Or go farther off the beaten path. The little island of
Carriacou is the desert-like yin to the jungle-like yang of
Grenada. The island of St. Eustatius is a quiet sibling of St.
Maarten, a 20-minute flight away.
 &HT;    The rule of thumb with all of these islands is that they take
longer to get to but they also take one farther away.
 &HT;    Serious bird-watchers and hikers might want to go to Dominica to
see one of the great natural paradises in the Caribbean. On an
island like St. Lucia, there's terrific hiking among the Pitons.
 &HT;    On Curacao, Christoffel Park, the 4,500 acres that encompass the
ruins of several 18th-century plantations as well as 1,239-foot Mt.
Christoffel are worth exploring. Grenada also has terrific hiking,
with waterfalls, and a rain forest.
 &HT;    If snorkeling or diving really matter, choose a place that's
known for providing a tantalizing glimpse into how the lower half
lives. In Grand Cayman, there's stingrays aplenty at Stingray City,
which lies just off the northwest tip of Grand Cayman Island.
 &HT;    On St. John, where locals say the best half of the island lies
underwater, there's a well-marked underwater trail. Bonaire has
elkhorn coral up to 10 feet across, coral terraces and trumpet fish
swimming through the aquatic equivalent of the Louvre.
 &HT;    The Turks &AMP; Caicos are surrounded by reefs some 65 miles wide
and 250 miles long. And Anguilla boasts six marine parks. For
dedicated windsurfers, Aruba and Bonaire are tops.

 &HT;    Paradise is a relative term, and that's especially true when it
comes to choosing an island in the Caribbean. Some couples might
find a sleepy island such as Grenada to be Eden, one where
nightlife consists of quiet beachfront bars and the wake-up call
comes with the breaking surf.
 &HT;    But an active family of four might imagine paradise to be a
different place altogether, an island like Puerto Rico, where large
beachside hotels come with multiple pools and water slides,
kid-friendly restaurants and even a casino.
 &HT;    If price is an issue, choose an affordable island. For the most
bang for the buck, look to Aruba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an elementary school summit meeting. Crammed
around the low table in the first-grade classroom sat the parents
(fidgeting nervously), the principal, the first-grade teacher, the
speech therapist and the 11-year-old translator, who had been
hauled out of her sixth-grade class for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not unexpected. Eduardo Barros, who like nearly 80
percent of the incoming students in Public School 139 arrived
speaking no English, needed to spend another year in first grade to
improve his language and comprehension skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy,'' said Edda Barros, who translated the news about her
brother to her parents, ``they are saying that Eduardo has too much
trouble reading and understanding. They do not want to put him in
second grade and then move him back down. It is better if he does
another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Edda's was not an unfamiliar role. She accompanies her parents,
who were born in Ecuador, to the bank, to the doctor and on
shopping trips, as well as to all school functions. It is her job
to make sure her brother understands and completes his homework and
to riffle through electric and gas bills, business letters, rent
notices and school and community announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of young children in immigrant families, Edda is
much more than a translator for first-generation parents who speak
little English. She interprets American culture, customs and mores
for her parents, at times gently correcting and advising them. She
plays a vital and at times nerve-racking role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times, especially with doctors, when I have no idea
what they are talking about,'' Edda said in English, seated in her
Queens apartment with her parents. ``But I have to translate
something. My parents rely on me. I have to keep asking and asking
what it means, what they are talking about. And sometimes I have my
own life, my own work to do, but I have to stop to help my brother
or leave to go with mother or father. It is tiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and administrators in schools like P.S. 139, where 36
different languages are spoken and 77 of the 100 children in
kindergarten come from homes in which the parents speak a foreign
language, say young children must often mediate with parents to get
them to conform to American society. And each new hurdle loads more
onto the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often too much for their fragile nervous systems,'' said
Khanna Borukhov, a teacher in the English as a Second Language
program at P.S. 139.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Goldenback, the supervisor of the ESL program for
District 28, which includes P.S. 139, says that when children are
taken out of school to accompany parents to appointments or on
routine chores, the missed classes can affect homework and test
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should remember that some of these parents do not even
have the English facility to buy a subway token or ask directions,
so they must take the child along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict often erupts around benign and simple tasks. Many
immigrant parents will not sign school permission slips or allow
their children to go on overnight trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these families live in fear of deportation,'' said
Goldenback. ``They fear that something could happen to the child if
they sign anything, even a report card.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms must also adjust to new traditions, such as allowing
Muslims to skip lunch during Ramadan, and new cultural
sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a child from Iran in my class,'' said Frayda Sharaby, an
ESL teacher. ``One day Mitre did something I perceived as
brilliant. I said it was not just one thumb up, but two thumbs up.
She fell to the floor laughing.'' The thumbs up sign, it turns out,
is a foul insult in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of immigrants is so diverse that it is also
impossible to keep up with the plethora of languages, even in
schools such as P.S. 139, where teachers or administrators speak
Spanish, Korean and Russian.
</P>
<P>
   The parents-night meetings are broken down into clusters, so
children can translate what is being discussed. Newsletters go out
in Russian, Spanish, Korean and Chinese, in an effort to reach at
least some of the community in their own tongue. And teachers,
dizzy with the infusion of cultures, customs and languages, look
for ways to make the American experience relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are the Pilgrims like Russians?'' Jackie Neuwirt, the
first-grade teacher in classroom 1-229, asked her pupils one
morning last week.
</P>
<P>
   Neuwirt, whose parents did not speak English when they arrived
in Queens in 1959 from Israel, explained to her pupils that the
Russians came to the United States to escape religious persecution
and find freedom. She pointed to a bulletin board in her classroom
labeled ``We are the children of the world'' that had 15 figures,
labeled with names of countries like Peru, Azerbaijan, Nepal and
Taiwan, that represented the cultural backgrounds of her 20
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other people came for this reason?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The music teacher at P.S. 139, Fern Nash, has the school choral
group do songs in Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Yiddish, French,
Korean, German and Mandarin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We incorporate the school's diversity into the program,'' she
said. ``I have Chinese kids who know songs in Yiddish and have
danced in Indian costumes. It is all here.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, some who assumed the role of interlocutors say it
was not only burdensome but uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Neuwirt's sister, Zeporah Becker-Gonzalez, a fifth-grade teacher
at John I. Smith Elementary in Miami, remembers what it felt like
to be the family translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was often embarrassed that my parents could not speak
English or assimilate,'' she said. ``I wanted to be just like the
other kids. I wanted to be an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the family tensions, she said she believed she was a
stronger person for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could not help me with my homework,'' she said of her
parents. ``I had to do it myself. I could not depend on them to
help me as much as other parents that spoke English. It made me
more self-reliant than other children.''

   Bad News for Pests
</P>
<P>
   A water droplet hitting the waxy top of a leaf is like a
basketball hitting a backboard _ it rebounds off the surface. This
can be a problem if, for example, the water is a pesticide solution
being applied to crops. Studies have shown that in much pesticide
spraying, less than half of the spray is retained by the plants.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists in France, researching how droplets rebound from
such a hydrophobic surface, have discovered a way to help make them
stick. The key, they report in the journal Nature, is to add small
amounts of a polymer to the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied droplet impact using a video system that
recorded 1,000 frames per second. A plain water droplet hits,
spreads out to a maximum diameter and then contracts so much and so
quickly that it leaves the surface. A droplet containing
polyethyleneoxide or another polymer, on the other hand, contracts
very little and stays where it hits. The researchers found that the
elongational viscosity of the polymer _ that is, how it resists
stretching _ dampens the contraction of the droplet.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say their findings could be useful not only in
agricultural spraying but in industrial and consumer applications
where cutting waste or preventing the spread of contaminants is
desired. They note that so little polymer is needed that other
characteristics of the solution are essentially unchanged, meaning
that other processes that it has to go through _ pumping, for
example _ would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Ice Age Survivor
</P>
<P>
   The Irish elk was a spectacular animal, the largest deer that
ever lived, with antlers that spanned up to 12 feet. Like some
other large mammals, it was thought to have become extinct at the
end of the last ice age, about 10,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of its demise, however, have been found to be a bit
premature. Radiocarbon dating by British researchers of a specimen
unearthed two centuries ago on the Isle of Man shows that it is
only about 9,225 years old. Thus the Irish elk joins some other
large mammals, including the woolly mammoth, as an unexpected
survivor into the Holocene, the modern post-ice age epoch.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in Nature, found that the body size
of the specimen was well below the mean for the species, indicating
that the same factors thought to have killed off the animal during
the Ice Age _ notably a lack of food _ probably contributed to
decreasing body size.
</P>
<P>
   The Isle of Man became separated from mainland Britain about
10,000 years ago. So the finding shows that some large mammals were
able to survive the ice in isolated spots, only to die off later,
unable to cope with changes in vegetation, perhaps, or the victims
of human or other predators.
</P>
<P>
   A Modern Survivor
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists who had been concerned that California sea
otters might be going the way of the Irish elk got some good news
this month with the release of spring survey numbers that show that
the otter population increased by almost 11 percent from the year
before, to more than 2,300.
</P>
<P>
   The population has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent
decades, declining in the mid-1970s, picking up again after
restrictions on some fishing nets were instituted and then
declining again. While otter experts said the current increase, the
first since 1995, was an encouraging sign, they added that the
increases would have to continue for several years before they
would declare that the declines have stopped. Particularly
encouraging in the current survey was the fact that the number of
otter pups increased by almost 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys are done twice a year, in May and November. Spotters
cover about 375 miles of the central California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Disease, pollution, loss of food sources and entanglement in
fishing gear are all considered causes of the decline of the
animals, which were listed as a threatened species in 1977.

 (For release Tuesday, June 20)  
(EDS: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New
York Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is

by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of
ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that Americans
continue to face. These stories, two or three each week, will be
approximately 6,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days. Please see

   BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash. _ The ferry from Seattle is 10 minutes
from landing as first light slips through the silvered mist of
Puget Sound, and Ron Sims is still not sure what face he will
present to the world this day.
</P>
<P>
   The look is fine. He is not dressed like a Northwest guy. No
camouflage of plaid, hiking boots or fleece vest. He wears his
politician's suit and suspenders, his silk tie and leather shoes
with a shine _ standard uniform for the leader of a county with a
population greater than that of a half-dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers recognize him: there are stares and smiles directed
his way. But he is also attracting the kind of curious glances that
might fall on a square-jawed, rock-shouldered black man sitting
next to a sheriff's deputy as he arrives at a place where blacks
are more abstractions than neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The boat glides past million-dollar homes, and the big engines
growl in reverse. The whistle blows. Almost show time. Two school
assemblies in Kitsap County, barely 10 miles across the water but a
world removed from King County, the one Sims governs, will hear
him. The question is: which Ron Sims will take the stage?
</P>
<P>
   He is known as an ebullient man, someone who hugs teachers and
police officers with equal zest. And at a time when so much of
politics is about conveying the authentic personal narrative, Sims
is a natural storyteller with a compelling one to offer, a
bootstrap tale about a journey from anger to open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his friends and advisers have long urged him to keep a large
part of that story _ race _ bottled up, even if it is the one thing
that deeply affects how people view him. It would do him no good to
talk about it, they say. Especially if he personalizes it. The way
to succeed is to be seen but not seen. Flesh without color. What
people want to hear from the second-highest-ranking elected
official in the state are his views on property taxes, traffic,
growth.
</P>
<P>
   On this January day, however, Sims has been asked to talk about
race, and he is tempted, he says, to throw caution aside, to let
them see it through his eyes. But do they really want to hear what
it is like for a black politician to live in two worlds?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' he says, laughing. ``I lead a dual life. I
struggle with it every day. There is Ron Sims the person and Ron
Sims the public official. And my greatest fear is that in order to
govern, I will end up divesting myself from who I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington does not look like a state where a nonwhite
politician would have to anglomorph to succeed. The old boundaries
of race and power appear to be fading. When he was sworn in as King
County executive three years ago, Sims became one of three
nonwhites holding the top political jobs in the state. The others
were Gary Locke, the nation's first and only Chinese-American
governor, and Norm Rice, Seattle's mayor, who is black.
Asian-Americans have been elected to high office in Washington
state for 20 years, and black mayors have won not just in the
heavily Democratic Puget Sound area but in the overwhelmingly white
and Republican eastern part as well _ all this in a state that is
89 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters say that by putting a Chinese immigrant's son and
two descendants of slaves atop the governing pyramid of the state,
Washington state has transcended race; in the new century, in the
New West, the expressed hope is that politics has shed its color
barriers, and even its color consciousness. Not long after electing
Locke in 1996, the voters threw out all laws allowing Washington to
hire based on racial preference. No more affirmative action.
Competence was all that mattered. End of subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, people think we are beyond prejudice here,''
said Locke, 50. ``Certainly growing up in Seattle I never felt any
overt racism. And I think that's because of our newness. We are a
young state, open to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the old racial order _ of whites always on top _ has
eroded, a more complex one has replaced it. Now the system rewards
nonwhites who know how to make the largely white electorate see in
them what the voters see in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Locke, a popular Democrat seeking re-election this year,
has played up his family story _ an American immigrant tale about
coming from poverty in China to a country where the Chinese had
long been barred. Thus Sims has concluded that the best way to get
people to listen to him in a state that is barely 3 percent black
is to shatter assumptions about black politicians and become an
expert in what the white majority cares about most.
</P>
<P>
   RESISTING STEREOTYPES
</P>
<P>
   When Sims was first elected to a county legislative post more
than 10 years ago, he was taken aside by Sam Smith, a Seattle
councilman and dean of the city's black politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you sit on no health and human services committee,''
Smith warned him, Sims recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He followed his mentor's advice. ``And if you look at what Gary
Locke and Norm Rice have done, they took the same path,'' Sims
said. ``We all became budget chairmen _ the opposite of the
stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims, 51, has since become a national expert on the life cycle
of Pacific salmon, a Northwest icon now in decline. ``One of my
African-American political friends back East said to me, `You mean
you get up every morning and talk about fish? Fish!'''
</P>
<P>
   Locke knows stereotypes too. It was not so long ago, in the
mid-1980s, that a few former colleagues in the state Legislature
were not sure if he was Japanese or Chinese and, in any case,
assumed his family was no friend of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `Your people disrupted my life. I had to go off and
fight because of your people,''' Locke recalled. His people _
actually, his father _ also fought, also in an American uniform,
against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Chinese-American governor has not heard or seen
what the African-American county executive has _ the kind of thing
usually transmitted in a code that has become ever more
sophisticated.

 BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash.: more sophisticated.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People will call me an `inner-city politician' whenever they
want to remind someone of my race,'' Sims said. No matter that he
grew up in the less populated, nearly all-white eastern part of the
state and now spends most of his time talking about suburban
concerns. By contrast, Locke lived in public housing as a boy in a
racially mixed part of Seattle; he is by far the more ``inner
city'' political leader. But that label has never been pinned on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Charting a course through the racial terrain of the
post-civil-rights era is tricky, Sims said. He saw what happened to
his best friend, Rice, when as a black mayor he tried to step out
of the urban political box by running for governor. And he has seen
how Locke, who defeated Rice in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary, has used a favorable public perception of Asian-Americans
to advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Sims cannot change his skin color, and if he expects to
follow Locke to the governor's mansion in four years, as he may try
to, he has to find a way on his own, he said. Asked by a reporter
to talk about that exploration, he did so over several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't deny your race,'' he said at one point. ``But it's
there. It's always there. It's like a huge anchor around your neck,
even though nobody ever asks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Black politicians have learned certain approaches, he said:
``One thing we do is called the get-over technique. You know how
the world sees you. But in order for them to get over it, you speak
their language.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best minds in American politics have told him as
much, saying that if he wants to be governor, he has to stay out of
the race zone. Be a black who does not run as a black, in the words
of Frank Greer, a political consultant who helped L. Douglas Wilder
of Virginia become the only black ever elected governor in the
United States. Keep it neutral, upbeat, informed, the way he talks
about salmon.
</P>
<P>
   This day will be different, though. Ron Sims has been asked by
his hosts to talk about something other than salmon or sewers. The
person and the politician will be one. That, at least, is what he
tells himself.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY LESSON VS. LIFE LESSON
</P>
<P>
   A sea of white faces awaits Sims at Woodward Middle School on
Bainbridge Island. It is early, and the seventh and eighth graders
gathered in the gym are sluggish. A murmur rolls through the
assembly as the King County executive walks in.
</P>
<P>
   On Bainbridge Island, an outpost of new wealth and settled
rhythms, blacks are a novelty, but throughout this side of Puget
Sound, racial troubles still surface. At a high school basketball
game in the southern part of the county a few days earlier, some
boys chanted ``Go rob a liquor store!'' at visiting black players
from Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   They later apologized, and school administrators said it had
been an isolated incident _ not reflective of predominant student
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not surprise Sims. Growing up in Spokane, where a
slim 1 percent of the population of 175,000 was black, he felt the
daily rub of racial humiliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kid who used to run by our house every afternoon
and shout, `Nigger, nigger, nigger,' and then run off,'' Sims said.
``Same routine every day. One day my twin brother and I caught up
with him, and let's just say we had a very physical discussion.
When my father came home, he was furious at us. He said, `Don't you
ever stoop to their level!'''
</P>
<P>
   Now he strolls to the microphone in front of the bleachers. The
applause is polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you know who Harriet Tubman is?''
</P>
<P>
   The students are blank-faced. A boy with a voice yet to descend
into the octaves of puberty raises his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, wasn't she a slave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes! What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She got the underground railroad going or something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good. What's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Zack. Stand up, please. Why did slaves have to be smuggled
north?''
</P>
<P>
   Zack turns red and stammers. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hand goes up. A girl rises. ``Something to do with
Abraham Lincoln?''
</P>
<P>
   Sims shakes his head in mock horror, then smiles reassuringly.
He tells the students about a Supreme Court decision. They grow
fidgety. Where does he go with this?
</P>
<P>
   ``A slave was still a slave back then because the Supreme Court
ruled that they were property. Not human beings. Property. So if
slaves are property, what does that make Harriet Tubman?''
</P>
<P>
   No hands go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an outlaw!'' he says. ``A thief. If slaves are
property, as the Supreme Court has ruled, Harriet Tubman was a
thief. They should have arrested her, right?''
</P>
<P>
   He is pacing, microphone in hand, trying, it seems, not to lose
the audience. His aim is to bring the story around to Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., a onetime outlaw. How to make it matter to the
Pokemon generation?
</P>
<P>
   Sims has never shied away from speaking out on issues important
to blacks in the Seattle area _ about police harassment, about job
discrimination. But those are matters of the public realm. The
occasion at the middle school seemed to require more, something
from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a searing story about his own childhood. He considered
telling one, he reflected later. A Tupperware party had been
planned, but the only black family in his Spokane neighborhood had
not been invited, and the white mothers left it up to one of their
boys to tell the Sims children that their mother was not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   He had told this story once to a different audience, and he
wound up regretting it, he said. Too personal. So looking at the
white students now assembled before him, he said, he decided in
midstream not to take the risk. He remembered how it came out the
first time, he said, how bitter he had sounded when he summed up
the story in the bluntest of terms: ``Let the two nigger kids go
tell their nigger mom that she can't come.''

   ASIAN IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION
</P>
<P>
   To see the current occupants of the governor's mansion in
Olympia is to realize how much this state has changed. A century
ago Asians were considered such a threat to white employment that
they were marched out of their homes at gunpoint and told never to
return. And not quite 60 years ago, Asian-Americans were again
uprooted, this time forced into internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gov. Gary Locke lives amid Chippendale mirrors and
windows fashioned after those at Monticello. For him, it is a
return to public housing, albeit with 27 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon sunlight pours into a cozy den; both the babies, Emily
and Dylan, are asleep, allowing Locke's wife, Mona Lee Locke, who
is also a child of Chinese immigrants, a chance to relax. A
35-year-old former television reporter who still makes documentary
films, she has the personality of young Champagne and the kind of
looks the camera loves. She is witty, fashionable, self-deprecating
and still somewhat awed by the life the Lockes are leading as the
crown couple of Asian-American politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of us realized the scope of all this,''
she says. ``People come up to Gary all the time and tell him what a
role model he is, that they hope he runs for higher office. Even
Republicans. And it's because of his race that they look up to him.
They see in him the American Dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke sees himself in those terms as well. On becoming
Washington's 21st governor, he noted in his inaugural address that
his grandfather had worked as a houseboy less than a mile from the
Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a hundred years to go one mile,'' Locke said. ``But
it's a journey that could only take place in America.''
</P>
<P>
   A fortuneteller in New York's Chinatown once told Jimmie Locke,
the governor's 83-year-old father, that one of his sons would be
famous. Locke doubted him. ``I said: `Famous? What the heck. He's
Chinese in America. What can you be famous for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now some Asian-Americans hope that Gary Locke will run for
president one day. But even his father's wildest interpretation of
the fortuneteller's prediction does not allow such a thought.
``President is still the white people's position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sims, the governor says he does not struggle to reconcile
his public and private personas. He is shy, and if he is
introspective he gives no hint of it. There are few lines on his
face; with his paintbrush black hair, he looks two decades younger
than his 50 years. His hobby is plumbing. His idea of a good time
is cleaning out his father's garage.
</P>
<P>
   Locke says he knows in his heart that despite the model-minority
tag, not every Asian is smart, and not every black gets a fair
shake in the state he holds up as a beacon of the racial future.
But he rarely uses the bully pulpit for social change.
</P>
<P>
   He did make a public fuss, though, for an issue that touched his
own life: affirmative action. Were it not for a race-conscious
admissions policy, he said, he would not have gone to Yale. ``I was
a three-fer,'' he said. ``Asian. From the West. Public school.''
But though he spoke against a 1998 ballot measure rolling back
affirmative action, the voters went their own way, removing racial
preference from state hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Voting was not an option when the Lockes came to America; most
Chinese could not even own property. And until 1943, with few
exceptions, the Exclusion Act made it against the law for a person
from China to enter the United States as an immigrant. As a legacy
of the law, the Locke family has shared a deep secret for three
generations: like a lot of Chinese-Americans, they had to lie to
get into the country; the governor's paternal grandfather told the
authorities that he had been born in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members of my family are still very nervous about
acknowledging what happened back then,'' Gov. Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Locke came to America from southern China with his father
in 1931, a boy of 13. Ten years later he was drafted into the Army
and fought the Germans in France. After the war, he and his wife,
Julie Locke, who was born in Hong Kong, had five children, Gary
arriving second. Growing up on Seattle's Beacon Hill, Locke was in
the middle of the melting pot: blacks lived next door, Japanese
across the street, Italians behind the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Ron Sims, Locke says he lived a childhood virtually
free of racial insults.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, he recalled several times when he was
made to feel embarrassment about his heritage. His third-grade
teacher once asked him what he had had for breakfast. When he
replied that he had eaten a traditional Chinese meal of porridge
and dried shrimp, the teacher struck him on the hand with a ruler,
unhappy that he was not eating like an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard _ doubting yourself, your culture, wondering if
your parents did something wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gary Locke called himself ``a Seattle kid.'' He loved
camping, Boy Scouts. What made him realize that he was thoroughly
American, he said, was when his parents took him to Hong Kong at
the age of 10 to stay with his maternal grandparents and learn
Chinese customs. He was appalled by what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother lived in a room, 8 feet by 8 feet. Dirt floor.
Cooked over an open fire. Scrounged around for kindling. There was
raw sewage outside. It was essentially a refugee camp. The plan was
to leave me with my maternal grandparents and be educated. I
rebelled.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only when he left Seattle, at the height of the Vietnam
War, that Gary Locke began to understand how some people in his own
country considered him foreign, if not the enemy. As he was leaving
for Yale, he and his parents, waiting in the airport, were
confronted by an American soldier, who cursed them and called them
gooks.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, Gary was often complimented on his English and asked
about his diet. ``People would come up to me and say, `Do you ever
eat steak? Ever eat fried chicken?' They had these stereotypes: you
only eat with chopsticks, you don't celebrate Thanksgiving, that
sort of thing.''

</P>
<P>
   He also learned for the first time that he had grown up in a
country whose official policy for 61 years had been to close the
gates to Chinese. His parents had never told him about the
exclusion laws, or the internment of Japanese-Americans, and the
subject had not come up in his textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just very, very sad that this was part of the history of
the United States,'' Locke said. ``Very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Locke family was more vocal about young Gary's future. They
hoped he would be an engineer or a businessman. Politics was
unseemly. But again, Gary went his own way, winning a seat in the
state Legislature in 1982, then rising swiftly to budget chairman.
In 1993 he defeated an incumbent to become the King County
executive.
</P>
<P>
   His rise excited the pan-Asian community, an unusual alliance of
Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese and Pacific Islanders who
make up about 6 percent of Washington's population. But Locke's
heritage was rarely mentioned, in press accounts or by opponents,
during any of his seven campaigns. His public life followed the
unspoken rule for nonwhites in American politics: to be successful,
be race neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask people for adjectives to describe Gary
Locke, you would get way down the list before the word Chinese
would come up,'' said Brian Ebersole, Locke's friend from their
legislative days together and now mayor of Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Locke was the picture of a policy wonk, the last person to turn
out the lights in the House of Representatives. One newspaper
headline called him ``The Man Who Mistook His Life for the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a Lonely Guy. Though he had been briefly married
while attending Boston University Law School, he had spent most of
his adult life searching for a perfect mate.  &UR;  &LR; Friends would
arrange blind dates for dinner parties, then sigh as he launched
into a discussion of the inadequacies of the state tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in middle age, alone and believing he had reached a
political plateau, the world opened up for Gary Locke. The
fortuneteller in New York had had it right.
</P>
<P>
   THE `ANGRY' BLACK MAN
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes into his speech, Ron Sims drops the talk of
slavery and summons the image of Bainbridge Island, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese have just bombed Pearl Harbor,'' Sims tells the
students. ``The United States Army came to Bainbridge Island to
round up the citizens who were of Japanese ancestry. You live here,
and these people are your neighbors. What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to go to Canada,'' one boy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada?'' Sims lets the answer sink in. ``OK. But most of
these people are United States citizens. They don't want to go to
Canada. They are your neighbors, remember? So what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The children look at one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive order says Japanese-Americans have to leave
their homes. It is the law. Are any of you going to break the law
to help them?'' Two dozen students rise.
</P>
<P>
   Sims himself was something of a militant once. In the turbulent
'60s he was one of a handful of black students who pushed for
change at Central Washington University, challenging teachers and
administrators on curriculum and admissions policies. He wore a
dashiki, grew an Afro and quoted Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned not only authority but his own core beliefs. At
one point he wrote a term paper on how Christianity had justified
slavery. He spent months researching the paper, growing
increasingly bitter about his faith, then took his work home to
Spokane to show his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said, `Brilliant.' And then he told me, `This is not
the God I know.''' Over several months, as Sims considered what his
father had said, his thinking changed. He ultimately chose the God
of his father, he said, coming to believe that most people were
capable of looking beyond their baser instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely does the old indignation seep out now. At a public
hearing on land use in the new suburbs east of Seattle two years
ago, a man stood up and shouted, ``Ron Sims, you are nothing but
bought and sold to special interests!''
</P>
<P>
   Sims shot back: ``There hasn't been a member of the Sims family
bought and sold since my great-grandfather was a slave. And this
member of the Sims family isn't for sale today.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter describes Sims as angry in a public debate, he
will challenge the characterization. ``That's code,'' he said. ``A
black man who is angry is a lethal label in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle school principal nods approvingly at the end of Sims'
exercise on World War II internment. The students applaud those who
stood and said they would help their neighbors. Having retreated
from the talk about slavery, Sims is back on comfortable middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING ON THE RECORD, NOT RACE
</P>
<P>
   When Ron Sims is unsure of himself, he turns to the friend who
served as best man at his wedding, Norm Rice, now 58. In many ways
Rice set the standard for how a nonwhite politician could govern in
the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when Rice held a meeting at his house to
solicit advice on whether he should run for mayor of Seattle, it
was Sims who made the comment that no one wanted to hear. He said a
black candidate could not be elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice proved his younger friend wrong. He served two terms,
becoming one of Seattle's most successful mayors. Under Rice, the
city rebuilt its downtown and improved its schools, the job and
housing markets boomed, crime plummeted and tax revenue rolled into
city coffers.

 BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash.: city coffers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going from popular leader of the state's biggest city to
governor seemed a logical next step for the mayor in 1996. But he
faced a formidable primary opponent in Gary Locke, then the King
County executive. A big question mark was race. Neither man had
mentioned the subject in earlier campaigns. But this would largely
be a contest between an Asian-American and an African-American. How
much attention should be drawn to a candidate's race?
</P>
<P>
   Rice's supporters were divided. Some wanted him to tell his
story about overcoming bigotry as a middle-class black in Denver.
It was a personal history with indelible moments like his first day
of college, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. As Rice
remembers it: ``I was waiting to meet my roommate. His parents came
in, took one look at me and said, `Goodbye,''' taking their son
with them.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice wanted to run on his record at the helm of the good
ship Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Norm, `You've got to get past what you did for
Seattle; they won't elect you governor for that,''' said Sue
Tupper, one of his strategists. ``People want to know you, the
person,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was unswayed. His response was that when race was brought
up directly, even in the context of defeating bigotry, it could
backfire, because then people would be asked to vote for a black
man instead of a mayor who happened to be black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue, I won't go there,'' he told Tupper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' she asked. ``You've got a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied. ``I have a great story about how my family
came to America. As good as Gary's. We just happened to have
different travel agents.''
</P>
<P>
   LETTING RACE PLAY A ROLE
</P>
<P>
   A different strategy emerged in the Locke camp. Locke was
sitting on a gold mine of personal narrative, an immigrant tale
echoing those of millions of white Americans. And no one was
advising him that a Chinese-American could not be elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus was that because Gary Locke was so good at what
he does, the voters would overlook race,'' said Lori Matsukawa, an
anchor at KING-TV, who had introduced him to Mona Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Gary married Mona in 1994, and she changed his life, he says. He
opened up, reached out, joked more easily. Even his wedding
proposal was out of character. He hired a plane to trail a banner
reading: ``Mona, I love you. Will you love me?''
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 she was not just a wife with star quality but a close
adviser. Though a novice in the nuances of politics, she knew how
to use television to tell a story. And rather than play down his
Chinese background, she advised her husband, he should use it.
</P>
<P>
   For Locke, it was a logical decision, part of his political
evolution as he reached beyond his base of support to a statewide
electorate less familiar with him. ``You can't hide your race,'' he
said. ``My hair, my eyes, my skin color: people look at me and know
I'm Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gary Locke who was introduced to voters in 1996 was married,
visibly happy and even openly affectionate with his new wife. And
suddenly he was calling himself ``a person of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether speaking to apple farmers in Yakima, Rotarians in
Spokane or suburban moms in Bellevue, he had a simple refrain when
he brought up his family history: ``I am Chinese, but I am
thoroughly American.''
</P>
<P>
   His self-description went to the heart of old white fears about
the Chinese in America: that their true allegiance was to the
ancient nation across the Pacific. He emphasized his biography the
entire campaign, first for the Democratic nomination, when a black
mayor, Rice, was his main opponent, and then in the general
election, when he faced Ellen Craswell, a white Republican and
Christian conservative of the far right. In a state that leans
Democratic and favors efficiency over ideology in its lawmakers,
Locke beat Craswell by nearly 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategy, Locke said, had nothing to do with the
race of any of his opponents but was a way to sell his biography.
And both the governor and the first lady said that his talking
about his heritage had been difficult at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never wanted to use race,'' Locke said. ``Washington is
mostly Caucasian, so there's no point. Gary's not comfortable. With
a Chinese heritage, you're raised not to talk about it. But once we
started talking about it, he felt more comfortable, because people
responded to his story.''
</P>
<P>
   The story they told was couched in terms familiar to most
Americans. ``We helped to build this country with our blood, our
sweat and our tears,'' Locke would say in his speeches. ``Now it's
time for us to share in governing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It bothers many Americans of Asian descent to be described, as a
group, as clever, diligent or shrewd. Those very words were long
used to keep Asians out of the country or to cast suspicion on
them. But by the late 1990s, Asian-Americans, at least those on the
West Coast, were finding they could use ethnic pride as Locke had,
as something that would appeal to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, however, could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tougher for a black than an Asian,'' said Mayor
Ebersole of Tacoma, who is white. ``If there are stereotypes about
race, the present stereotypes about Asians are positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Locke the old negative ones can resurface. When a
campaign-finance scandal enveloped a handful of Asian-American
contributors to the 1996 Democratic presidential race, he publicly
questioned whether Jews or Irish-Americans would have been
subjected to the same suspicions as the Asian-Americans.
Conservative pundits and Republicans attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was playing the race card,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fresh variation on the lesson that Rice and Sims had
been taught time and again. ``You can't be too black, or too
Chinese,'' as Ebersole put it.
</P>
<P>
   Locke crushed Rice in the primary for governor. The Seattle
mayor won only two small counties, far away from Seattle.

 BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash.: from Seattle.

</P>
<P>
   LEGACIES AND LATITUDES
</P>
<P>
   Locke's first year as governor was euphoric. President Clinton
put him under the spotlight in a State of the Union speech. The
governor and his wife went to China, where they were mobbed,
attracting more attention than Mel Gibson, who was making a movie
there.
</P>
<P>
   They journeyed to Jilong, the Locke ancestral village in
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the room where my dad was born, where my grandfather
was born _ a shed almost, with no electricity _ and the whole
experience was overwhelming,'' Locke said. He wept as he left the
village, people who were with him said. It was the first time
anyone could remember seeing him cry.
</P>
<P>
   While Locke was gathering high approval ratings as governor, Ron
Sims was learning the job that Locke had given up, touring the
housing developments and strip malls of a fast-growing King County.
As for Rice, he left politics after his second term as mayor, at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rice is the director of the Federal Home Loan Bank in
Seattle. When he talks about the governor's race, he attributes his
loss to no one but himself; he just ran a weak campaign, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked what the campaign had taught him about racial
politics today, this normally gregarious man struck a different,
more cautious note. ``I think that if people have a choice between
an African-American and an Asian-American, they will probably
choose the latter,'' he said. ``Whether people want to admit it or
not, there is a hierarchy of race.''
</P>
<P>
   When Locke was asked about that notion, he looked puzzled.
``Racial hierarchy?'' he said. ``You know, I've never really
thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A POLITICIAN GETS PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   The clock is winding down on Ron Sims' hour with the Bainbridge
students. He has taken them through discussions of slavery and
internment and brought some students forward to re-enact a scene
from the life of Dr. King. It is hard to tell if he has reached
them.
</P>
<P>
   He seems about to take questions, but does not. Instead he walks
to the edge of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you a story about myself,'' he says. Once he
starts, there is no hesitation. ``I'm a little boy, 4 years old. We
are driving across the country. In North Dakota, I fall out of the
car, while it's going slow. I fall to the pavement. Blood
everywhere. I'm lying there on the highway thinking, Please don't
leave me in North Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   He is seriously hurt, the back of his scalp peeled away, he
says. His family panics and races to the nearest hospital, in a
small town. As he speaks, the gym is as quiet as it has been all
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think happened to me?'' Sims asks. ``I was a black
kid in a white state, and blood was pouring out of my head. What do
you think they were thinking about our family? We went from one
town to the next. We ... were ... turned ... away ... six times.
Six times! Nobody would treat me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, a nun at a Catholic hospital took me in. I needed 200
stitches to put my scalp back together.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks back to the center of the room. ``I got to be King
County executive,'' he says, ``because one person made a decision
to treat me. One person made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneous applause. A standing ovation. The white principal,
Clayton Mork, takes the microphone for routine announcements, then
stops. He begins to weep. He tries to compose himself. ``I know, as
a middle-aged school principal, that, that there are not a lot of
things I can say that carry a lot of weight with you kids, but this
_ '' Again he is overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Sims walks forward and gives the principal a bear hug.
Afterward, a stream of awkward adolescents approaches Sims for hugs
or high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was great, Mr. Sims!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome!''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves the gym beaming. The next stop is a much bigger
audience, more than a thousand students at Bainbridge Island High
School.
</P>
<P>
   There he tells a story not about his family's past but about the
present, and perhaps about the future. He is married to a woman
from the Philippines, he tells them, and what an eye-opener that
has proved to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told my friends I was in love, they said, `You know
those Filipino women carry knives in their purses.' And when we
married, boy, did we get it from all sides _ her family and my
family. We were outcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   He has now been able to see America from an immigrant's point of
view, he says, and his wife, Cayan Topacio, has come to understand
how a native-born black sometimes has to strain for respect. Their
12-year-old son looks more black than Asian, and in watching how
people react to him, Topacio says, she has learned something about
the attitudes of her adopted country. Blacks are treated different
from Asians, she says, ``in little everyday ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sims ends his second talk with a request. ``You kids are
told all the time to be tolerant,'' he says. ``Well, don't be
tolerant of me because I'm African-American. That really bugs me.
Either include me or exclude me.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward he is again engulfed by students, parents, teachers _
all white. In the stands, one teacher turns to another and says,
``Hard to believe that guy's a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ferry ride home, Sims sits with the sheriff's deputy, his
bodyguard, and watches the city come into view. He appears drained.
Both speeches seemed to have worked, but those were impressionable
children, not hardened adults. In four years he may run for
governor. There is no way to know how voters would react. If he
told his racial story, would he win as Gary Locke had? If he went
the race-neutral route, would he lose as Norm Rice had?
</P>
<P>
   The boat pulls into Seattle. Several people approach Sims. He is
King County executive again. He straightens his tie. A woman asks
him about his habitat-preservation program for kokanee salmon. He
gives a very long, very detailed answer.

<P>
   BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, Wash. _ The ferry from Seattle is 10 minutes
from landing as first light slips through the silvered mist of
Puget Sound, and Ron Sims is still not sure what face he will
present to the world this day.
</P>
<P>
   Two school assemblies in Kitsap County, barely 10 miles across
the water but a world removed from King County, the one Sims
governs, will hear him. The question is: which Ron Sims will take
the stage?
</P>
<P>
   At a time when so much of politics is about conveying the
authentic personal narrative, Sims is a natural storyteller with a
compelling one to offer, a bootstrap tale about a journey from
anger to open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet friends and advisers have long urged him to keep a large
part of that story _ race _ bottled up, even if it is the one thing
that deeply affects how people view him. It would do him no good to
talk about it, they say. Especially if he personalizes it. The way
to succeed is to be seen but not seen. Flesh without color. What
people want to hear from the second-highest-ranking elected
official in the state are his views on property taxes, traffic,
growth.
</P>
<P>
   On this January day, however, Sims has been asked to talk about
race, and he is tempted, he says, to throw caution aside, to let
them see it through his eyes. But do they really want to hear what
it is like for a black politician to live in two worlds?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' he says, laughing. ``I lead a dual life. I
struggle with it every day. There is Ron Sims the person and Ron
Sims the public official. And my greatest fear is that in order to
govern, I will end up divesting myself from who I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington does not look like a state where a nonwhite
politician would have to anglomorph to succeed. The old boundaries
of race and power appear to be fading. When he was sworn in as King
County executive three years ago, Sims became one of three
nonwhites holding the top political jobs in the state. The others
were Gary Locke, the nation's first and only Chinese-American
governor, and Norm Rice, Seattle's mayor, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans have been elected to high office in Washington
state for 20 years, and black mayors have won not just in the
heavily Democratic Puget Sound area but in the overwhelmingly white
and Republican eastern part as well _ all this in a state that is
89 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters say that by putting a Chinese immigrant's son and
two descendants of slaves atop the governing pyramid of the state,
Washington state has transcended race; in the new century, in the
New West, the expressed hope is that politics has shed its color
barriers, and even its color consciousness. Not long after electing
Locke in 1996, the voters threw out all laws allowing Washington to
hire based on racial preference. No more affirmative action.
Competence was all that mattered. End of subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, people think we are beyond prejudice here,''
said Locke, 50. ``Certainly growing up in Seattle I never felt any
overt racism. And I think that's because of our newness. We are a
young state, open to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the old racial order _ of whites always on top _ has
eroded, a more complex one has replaced it. Now the system rewards
nonwhites who know how to make the largely white electorate see in
them what the voters see in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Locke, a popular Democrat seeking re-election this year,
has played up his family story _ an American immigrant's tale about
coming from poverty in China to a country where the Chinese had
long been barred.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Sims has concluded that the best way to get people to
listen to him in a state that is barely 3 percent black is to
shatter assumptions about black politicians and become an expert in
what the white majority cares about most.
</P>
<P>
   RESISTING STEREOTYPES
</P>
<P>
   When Sims was first elected to a county legislative post more
than 10 years ago, he was taken aside by Sam Smith, a Seattle
councilman and the dean of the city's black politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you sit on no health and human services committee,''
Smith warned him, Sims recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He followed his mentor's advice. ``And if you look at what Gary
Locke and Norm Rice have done, they took the same path,'' Sims
said. ``We all became budget chairmen _ the opposite of the
stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims, 51, has since become a national expert on the life cycle
of Pacific salmon, a Northwest icon now in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Locke knows stereotypes too. It was not so long ago, in the
mid-1980s, that a few former colleagues in the state Legislature
were not sure if he was Japanese or Chinese and, in any case,
assumed his family was no friend of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said: `Your people disrupted my life. I had to go off and
fight because of your people,''' Locke recalled. His people _
actually, his father _ also fought, also in an American uniform,
against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Chinese-American governor has not heard or seen
what the African-American county executive has _ the kind of thing
usually transmitted in a code that has become ever more
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will call me an `inner-city politician' whenever they
want to remind someone of my race,'' Sims said. No matter that he
grew up in the less populated, nearly all-white eastern part of the
state and now spends most of his time talking about suburban
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Locke lived in public housing as a boy in a
racially mixed part of Seattle; he is by far the more ``inner
city'' political leader. But that label has never been pinned on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Charting a course through the racial terrain of the
post-civil-rights era is tricky, Sims said. He saw what happened to
his best friend, Rice, when as a black mayor he tried to step out
of the urban political box by running for governor. And he has seen
how Locke, who defeated Rice in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary, has used a favorable public perception of Asian-Americans
to advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Sims cannot change his skin color, and if he tries to follow
Locke to the governor's mansion in four years, he has to find a way
on his own, he said. Asked by a reporter to talk about that
exploration, he did so over several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't deny your race,'' he said at one point. ``But it's
there. It's always there. It's like a huge anchor around your neck,
even though nobody ever asks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black politicians have learned certain approaches, he said:
``One thing we do is called the get-over technique. You know how
the world sees you. But in order for them to get-over it, you speak
their language.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best minds in American politics have told him as
much, saying that if he wants to be governor, he has to stay out of
the race zone. Be a black who does not run as a black, in the words
of Frank Greer, a political consultant who helped L. Douglas Wilder
of Virginia become the only black ever elected governor in the
United States. Keep it neutral, upbeat, informed, the way he talks
about salmon.
</P>
<P>
   This day will be different, though. Sims has been asked by his
hosts to talk about something other than salmon or sewers. The
person and the politician will be one.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY LESSON VS. LIFE LESSON
</P>
<P>
   A sea of white faces awaits Sims at Woodward Middle School on
Bainbridge Island. A murmur rolls through the assembly as the King
County executive walks in.
</P>
<P>
   On Bainbridge Island, an outpost of new wealth and settled
rhythms, blacks are a novelty, but throughout this side of Puget
Sound, racial troubles still surface. At a high school basketball
game in the southern part of the county a few days earlier, some
boys chanted ``Go rob a liquor store!'' at visiting black players
from Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Spokane, where a slim 1 percent of the population
of 175,000 was black, Sims felt the daily rub of racial
humiliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kid who used to run by our house every afternoon
and shout, `Nigger, nigger, nigger,' and then run off,'' Sims said.
He did not repeat that story to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sims approaches the microphone to polite applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you know who Harriet Tubman is?''
</P>
<P>
   The students are blank-faced. A boy raises his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, wasn't she a slave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes! What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She got the underground railroad going or something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good. What's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Zack. Stand up, please. Why did slaves have to be smuggled
north?''
</P>
<P>
   Zack turns red and stammers. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims tells the students about a Supreme Court decision. They
grow fidgety. Where does he go with this?
</P>
<P>
   ``A slave was still a slave back then because the Supreme Court
ruled that they were property. Not human beings. Property. So if
slaves are property, what does that make Harriet Tubman?''
</P>
<P>
   No hands go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an outlaw!'' he says. ``A thief. If slaves are
property, as the Supreme Court has ruled, Harriet Tubman was a
thief. They should have arrested her, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Sims is pacing, microphone in hand, trying, it seems, not to
lose the audience. His aim is to bring the story around to Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., a onetime outlaw. How to make it matter to
the Pokemon generation?
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION
</P>
<P>
   To see the current occupants of the governor's mansion in
Olympia is to realize how much this state has changed. A century
ago Asians were considered such a threat to white employment that
they were marched out of their homes at gunpoint and told never to
return. And not quite 60 years ago, Asian-Americans were again
uprooted, this time forced into internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gov. Gary Locke lives amid Chippendale mirrors and
windows fashioned after those at Monticello. For him, it is a
return to public housing, albeit with 27 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   On becoming Washington's 21st governor, Locke noted in his
inaugural address that his grandfather had worked as a houseboy
less than a mile from the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a hundred years to go one mile,'' Locke said. ``But
it's a journey that could only take place in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Now some Asian-Americans hope that Locke will run for president
one day.
</P>
<P>
   Locke rarely uses the bully pulpit for social change. But he did
make a public fuss for an issue that touched his own life:
affirmative action. Were it not for a race-conscious admissions
policy, he said, he would not have gone to Yale. But though he
spoke against a 1998 ballot measure rolling back affirmative
action, the voters went their own way, removing racial preference
from state hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sims, Locke says he lived a childhood virtually free of
racial insults, living as he did in a melting pot. What made him
realize that he was thoroughly American, he said, was when his
parents took him to Hong Kong at the age of 10 to stay with his
maternal grandparents and learn Chinese customs. He was appalled by
the squalor he saw.
</P>
<P>
   It was when he left Seattle, at the height of the Vietnam War,
that Locke began to understand how some people in his own country
considered him foreign, if not the enemy. As he was leaving for
Yale, he and his parents, waiting in the airport, were confronted
by an American soldier, who cursed them and called them gooks.
</P>
<P>
   Locke won a seat in the state Legislature in 1982, then rose
swiftly to budget chairman. In 1993 he defeated an incumbent to
become the King County executive.
</P>
<P>
   His rise excited the pan-Asian community, an unusual alliance of
Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese and Pacific Islanders who
make up about 6 percent of Washington's population. But Locke's
heritage was rarely mentioned, in press accounts or by opponents,
during any of his seven campaigns. His public life followed the
unspoken rule for nonwhites in American politics: to be successful,
be race neutral.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE `ANGRY' BLACK MAN
</P>
<P>
   In the turbulent '60s, Sims was one of a handful of black
students who pushed for change at Central Washington University,
challenging teachers and administrators on curriculum and
admissions policies. He wore a dashiki, grew an Afro and quoted
Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned not only authority but his own core beliefs. He
once wrote a term paper on how Christianity had justified slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely does the old indignation seep out now. At a public
hearing on land use in the new suburbs east of Seattle two years
ago, a man stood up and shouted, ``Ron Sims, you are nothing but
bought and sold to special interests!''
</P>
<P>
   Sims shot back: ``There hasn't been a member of the Sims family
bought and sold since my great-grandfather was a slave. And this
member of the Sims family isn't for sale today.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter describes Sims as angry in a public debate, he
will challenge the characterization. ``That's code,'' he said. ``A
black man who is angry is a lethal label in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING ON THE RECORD, NOT RACE
</P>
<P>
   When Sims is unsure of himself, he turns to the friend who
served as best man at his wedding, Norm Rice, now 58.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Rice set the standard for how a nonwhite politician
could govern in the Pacific Northwest. In two terms, he become one
of Seattle's most successful mayors. Under Rice, the city rebuilt
its downtown and improved its schools, the job and housing markets
boomed, crime plummeted and tax revenue rolled into city coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Going from mayor of the state's biggest city to governor seemed
a logical next step for Sims in 1996. But he faced a formidable
primary opponent in Gary Locke, then the King County executive.
</P>
<P>
   A big question mark was race. Neither man had mentioned the
subject in earlier campaigns. But this would largely be a contest
between an Asian-American and an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   How much attention should be drawn to a candidate's race?
</P>
<P>
   Rice's supporters were divided on that question, but Rice wanted
to run on his record at the helm of the good ship Seattle. He
believed that when race was brought up directly, even in the
context of defeating bigotry, it could backfire, because then
people would be asked to vote for a black man instead of a mayor
who happened to be black. ``I won't go there,'' he told an aide.
</P>
<P>
   LETTING RACE PLAY A ROLE
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Mona Lee Locke were married in 1994. She was a novice
in the nuances of politics, but as a filmmaker and former
television reporter, she knew how to use television to tell a
story. And rather than play down his Chinese background, she
advised her husband, he should use it.
</P>
<P>
   For Locke, it was a logical decision, part of his political
evolution as he reached beyond his base of support to a statewide
electorate less familiar with him. ``You can't hide your race,'' he
said. ``My hair, my eyes, my skin color: people look at me and know
I'm Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gary Locke who was introduced to voters in 1996 was now
married, visibly happy and even openly affectionate with his new
wife. And suddenly he was calling himself ``a person of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether speaking to apple farmers in Yakima, Rotarians in
Spokane or suburban moms in Bellevue, he had a simple refrain when
he brought up his family history: ``I am Chinese, but I am
thoroughly American.''
</P>
<P>
   His self-description went to the heart of old white fears about
the Chinese in America: that their true allegiance was to the
ancient nation across the Pacific. He emphasized his biography the
entire campaign, first for the Democratic nomination, when a black
mayor, Rice, was his main opponent, and then in the general
election, when he faced Ellen Craswell, a white Republican and
Christian conservative of the far right.
</P>
<P>
   Locke crushed Rice in the primary. The Seattle mayor won only
two small counties, far away from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then Locke beat Craswell by nearly 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   LEGACIES AND LATITUDES
</P>
<P>
   Locke's first year as governor was euphoric. President Clinton
put him under the spotlight in a State of the Union speech. The
governor and his wife went to China, where they were mobbed,
attracting more attention than Mel Gibson, who was making a movie
there.
</P>
<P>
   While Locke was gathering high approval ratings as governor,
Sims was learning the job that Locke had given up, touring the
housing developments and strip malls of a fast-growing King County.
</P>
<P>
   Rice left politics after his second term as mayor, at the end of
1997. He is now the director of the Federal Home Loan Bank in
Seattle. When he talks about the governor's race, he attributes his
loss to no one but himself; he just ran a weak campaign, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked what the campaign had taught him about racial
politics today, this normally gregarious man struck a different,
more cautious note. ``I think that if people have a choice between
an African-American and an Asian-American, they will probably
choose the latter,'' he said. ``Whether people want to admit it or
not, there is a hierarchy of race.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, Sims may run for governor. There is no way to
know how voters would react. If he told his racial story, would he
win as Locke had? If he went the race-neutral route, would he lose
as Rice had?
</P>
<P>
   A POLITICIAN GETS PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   On this January day, Sims' next stop is a much bigger audience,
more than a thousand students at Bainbridge Island High School.
</P>
<P>
   There he tells a story not about his family's past but about the
present, and perhaps about the future. He is married to a woman
from the Philippines, he tells them, and what an eye-opener that
has proved to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told my friends I was in love, they said, `You know
those Filipino women carry knives in their purses.' And when we
married, boy, did we get it from all sides _ her family and my
family. We were outcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   He has now been able to see America from an immigrant's point of
view, he says, and his wife, Cayan Topacio, has come to understand
how a native-born black sometimes has to strain for respect. Their
12-year-old son looks more black than Asian, and in watching how
people react to him, Topacio says, she has learned something about
the attitudes of her adopted country. Blacks are treated different
from Asians, she says, ``in little everyday ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims ends his second talk with a request. ``You kids are told
all the time to be tolerant,'' he says. ``Well, don't be tolerant
of me because I'm African-American. That really bugs me. Either
include me or exclude me.''

GAINS IN DIAGNOSING HYPERACTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By SUSAN GILBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has never
been easy. Doctors say that it frequently rests on nothing firmer
than judgment calls on difficult questions like these:
</P>
<P>
   Does the kindergartner who cannot sit still and pay attention in
class have the developmental disorder, or is he just immature?
</P>
<P>
   Does the first grader who has trouble concentrating on her
homework but no trouble concentrating on a computer game have it,
or is she lazy?
</P>
<P>
   Does the second grader who is bright but struggling to learn how
to read have the disorder, or a reading disability?
</P>
<P>
   But, armed with new findings on the symptoms of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder and the brain abnormalities that
cause them, many leading researchers say they can reduce the
guesswork of the diagnostic process and, with it, the number of
people who are misdiagnosed. The first step, they say, is for
doctors and parents to understand that, despite its name, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder encompasses more symptoms than
inattention, hyperactivity or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a disorder of kids who can't pay attention or
sit still,'' said Dr. Thomas Brown, associate director of the Yale
Clinic for Attention and Related Disorders. ``It's more complex
than most people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the editor of a new book, ``Attention-Deficit Disorders
and Comorbidities in Children, Adolescents, and Adults'' (American
Psychiatric Press), in which more than two dozen researchers
describe findings on the causes and symptoms of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The research underscores two major points that Brown and his
authors consider crucial to making more accurate diagnoses and
prescribing medication and behavioral therapies more judiciously.
One is that people with the disorder are at very high risk of
having or developing various other problems like depression,
bipolar disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities and, in
adolescence, substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, doctors fail to recognize that a patient has more
than one disorder, Brown said. ``The kid is medicated for attention
deficit,'' he said, ``but if he still can't get his homework done
he's pegged as lazy because no one realizes that he may also have a
reading disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that a problem that coexists with the disorder could
interfere with Ritalin and the other stimulant medications that are
often used to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   The second crucial point in Brown's book is that many people
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder appear to have
chronic difficulty with the brain's executive functions, a term
that encompasses short-term memory, planning and staying focused on
a task without being distracted by emotional impulses. Seen this
way, the disorder does not impair someone's ability to pay
attention across the board but rather the ability to keep paying
attention despite a lack of interest or frustration
</P>
<P>
   In one chapter, Brown and Dr. Rosemary Tannock, a psychiatrist
at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, cite studies showing
that people with the disorder have structural anomalies in areas of
the brain that are associated with executive functions.
</P>
<P>
   The view of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a
developmental disorder of executive functions, not merely of
attention or impulse-control, is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong circumstantial case that some individuals
with attention deficit have problems with executive functions,''
said Dr. Xavier Castellanos, who leads the attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder research unit at the National Institute of
Mental Health, and whose work is cited in Brown's book.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of circumstantial evidence is the way that the symptoms
change as a child gets older. ``Hyperactivity decreases with age,
but symptoms of inattention don't seem to diminish,'' Castellanos
said.
</P>
<P>
   A likely reason, he and other experts say, is that a person's
life becomes more demanding and requires a greater use of executive
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence comes from the seemingly contradictory symptoms
in individual patients. In particular, many people with the
disorder have trouble paying attention in some situations _ when
the teacher is talking, for instance, or when they must finish
their homework _ but not in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows people with attention deficit who can
concentrate well enough to play computer games for hours,''
Castellanos said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Gordon, chief clinical child psychologist at the
State University of New York Upstate Medical University in
Syracuse, notes that everyone has trouble with executive functions
from time to time, especially when they are under stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of us is potentially disabled if we get ourselves into a
competitive situation where our abilities are outstripped by the
demands,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown thinks that recognizing deficits in executive
functions as well as the possibility of coexisting disorders can
help doctors make more accurate diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention deficits are overdiagnosed in some people and
underdiagnosed in others,'' he said, noting evidence that it has
been underdiagnosed in girls, as well as in adolescents and adults,
because they are less likely than young boys to have the most
obvious symptoms, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that parents who are concerned that their child
might have the disorder should arrange for a comprehensive
evaluation by a pediatrician, psychologist or psychiatrist who is
experienced with the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this in one or two sessions,'' said Dr. David
Fassler, chairman of the Council on Children, Adolescents and Their
Families of the American Psychiatric Association. ``A comprehensive
evaluation means getting a detailed history of the child's early
development, medical conditions and problems in school and with
friends, as well as meeting with the child and the family.''

PUTTING DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By CLARA HEMPHILL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chemist took a dozen pills from plastic sandwich bags,
dissolved each in water, poured the solutions into tiny test tubes
and placed them on a machine attached to the computer. A robotic
arm then picked up each small vial and moved it into position,
while an automatic needle drew out several drops of solution for
the computer to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   The computer at the Alpha Chemical and Biomedical Laboratories
in Petaluma, Calif., tested various brands of glucosamine and
chondroitin, popular pills sold without a prescription to relieve
arthritis pain. The results of these and other lab analyses: nearly
one-third of the brands tested did not contain what their
manufacturers claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend $14 billion annually on dietary supplements,
which include vitamins, minerals, herbs and other ``natural''
remedies, for a whole range of ills, like joint pain, difficulty
urinating, memory loss and depression.
</P>
<P>
   But it is next to impossible for consumers to know exactly what
is in most of the pills and capsules they are buying, or what
effect they are likely to have.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not require manufacturers
to prove the safety or efficacy of supplements before putting them
on the market. Dosages are not standardized. And, unlike
prescription drugs or over-the-counter medicines like aspirin,
there is no federal quality control to make sure that what is on
the label reflects what is in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the gap, a new private company, ConsumerLab.com of White
Plains, N.Y., is testing various products for quality and potency
at independent laboratories across the country, including Alpha
Chemical. The magazine Consumer Reports and the Good Housekeeping
Institute, which tests products for Good Housekeeping magazine,
have also begun evaluating dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ConsumerLab.com, founded by a physician-turned-businessman and a
research chemist formerly with the Food and Drug Administration, is
posting the results of its tests on its Web site. It is also
licensing a seal, similar to the Good Housekeeping Seal of
Approval, for products that meet its standards. The company hopes
to make money by selling its seal to producers and its information
to third parties on the Internet, like health care Web sites and
online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a well-regulated area _ some would say it's not
regulated at all,'' said Dr. Tod Cooperman, ConsumerLab.com's
founder and president, and a physician. `People are throwing their
money out the window with some of these products.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the tests conducted so far show a wide variation
in quality among some of the most popular supplements. All 10
glucosamine products tested contained what the manufacturers
claimed. But nearly half the combined glucosamine-chondroitin
tablets flunked the test. Some had only 25 percent of the
ingredients that their labels claimed. Glucosamine, made from crab
shells, and chondroitin, made from cow, pig or shark cartilage, are
both sold to treat arthritis in the knee. They are among the
fastest-growing dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ConsumerLab.com found fault with 10 of 27 brands of saw
palmetto, an extract of palm tree berries marketed to reduce the
frequency and urgency of urination in men with enlarged prostates.
``One had only half of what it was supposed to have,'' Cooperman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratories found that one-quarter of the 30 brands of
gingko biloba, an herbal extract used to enhance memory, did not
have adequate levels of the active ingredient listed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   When the Food and Drug Administration considered regulating
these products in the early 1990s, manufacturers and health food
stores orchestrated a massive letter-writing campaign to oppose
stricter controls.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act
of 1994, which created a new category called dietary supplements,
subject neither to the regulations for drugs nor the manufacturing
standards of foods.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the sale of dietary supplements has boomed to $14.1
billion in 1999 from $8.3 billion in 1994. Once sold largely in
health food stores, herbal preparations like ginseng, ginger,
gingko biloba and garlic now consume whole aisles of drug stores
and pharmacies. Pharmaceutical giants like Bayer have joined the
small, little-known companies in developing and marketing some of
these products.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials may quibble with particular testing methods,
but they acknowledge that some companies' sloppy manufacturing
practices make it difficult for consumers to know what is in the
pills they are buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good situation,'' said John Cardellina, vice
president for botanical science at the Council for Responsible
Nutrition, a trade organization of 100 companies that sell herbal
remedies and other dietary supplements. ``The industry has to do
something to lift the quality of the products.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Food and Drug Administration may pull a product
from the market only after it has been shown to be dangerous. The
burden of proof is on the agency to show that it is harmful, rather
than on the manufacturer to show that it is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The food and drug agency is also charged with establishing
``good manufacturing practices'' for companies to follow when
making dietary supplements. An agency spokeswoman acknowledged that
it had been slow to draw up those standards but said they would be
out by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   An office of dietary supplements has also been established
within the National Institutes of Health to assemble fact sheets on
various vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements that will
summarize what is known about the safety and effectiveness of each
product. The National Institutes of Health also is conducting
long-term placebo-controlled clinical trials to determine the
efficacy of some of the most popular remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Pharmacopeia, the nonprofit organization that sets
standards for potency and dosages of drugs in coordination with the
Food and Drug Administration, is developing standards for herbal
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, tests by ConsumerLab.com and others are a
useful effort to fill the information gap, said senior researchers
at the United States Pharmacopeia and the institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any testing will certainly be useful,'' said Dr. Srini
Srinivasan, who directs the dietary supplement division of the U.S.
Pharmacopeia. ``Whether something works or not is another matter.
But you should at least be getting what the label says.''
</P>
<P>
   ConsumerLab.com's results are consistent with those found by
Good Housekeeping and Consumer Reports. ``It's kind of the wild,
wild West out there,'' said Ronni Sandoff, health editor of
Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   Chemists at the Good Housekeeping Institute analyzed eight
brands of SAMe, an herbal preparation marketed as a ``natural
Prozac'' to treat depression, and found that two had only half the
active ingredient promised on the label. One had none at all. On
the other hand, the Good Housekeeping Institute gave its seal of
approval to several supplements that met the standards of quality,
safety and efficacy required of the magazine's advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports, for its part, tested 10 brands of ginseng, an
Asian root marketed to build energy and endurance. Several were
found to have almost none of the active ingredient listed on the
label.

<P>
   FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. _ Escorted by a pair of frisky killer
whales, watched by glinty-eyed bald eagles, we're aboard the
Washington State Ferry Yakima, gliding past prettily timbered
islets and misty, fiord-like inlets.
</P>
<P>
   As we round Shaw Island on our approach to Friday Harbor, we're
lined up in the ferry's gaping mouth like impatient settlers
awaiting the start of a land rush.
</P>
<P>
   In front are the bicycle tourers, their mountain bikes loaded
with saddlebag-like panniers. Next come the sea kayakers, with
Crayola-bright boats affixed to the roofs of their SUVs. Behind
them are cars full of whale watchers clutching binoculars and
Dramamine, and bed-and-breakfasters with their wicker picnic
hampers.
</P>
<P>
   With a shuddering reverse of its engines the Yakima eases to a
stop at the pier, the mesh barrier across the ferry's mouth comes
down, and we all spill forth in pursuit of our own private island
pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, virtually everyone aboard the ferry would have
been a Washington resident. But on this day I count a healthy
smattering of out-of-state license plates _ evidence that the
enchanting San Juan Islands, once Seattle's private dominion, are
starting to make it onto the map for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   A forested archipelago of anywhere from 172 to 786 islands _
depending on who's counting and whether the tide is out _ the San
Juans occupy the strait between the northwest corner of the
continental United States and Vancouver Island, British Columbia _
a strategic position that, as we shall see, once led to the
silliest military engagement in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in the rain shadow of the snow-capped Olympic Mountains,
the islands get only half the annual precipitation of soggy
Seattle, 70 miles to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   They're home to potters and poets, winemakers and llama
breeders, Internet entrepreneurs and New Age shamans. Each island
has its own personality: Thirtysomething Microsoft millionaires
erect waterfront trophy homes on San Juan Island, while Franciscan
nuns in habits and Polarfleece sweaters operate the ferry dock on
Shaw Island.
</P>
<P>
   On the ferry ride over, I'd wondered how long it would be before
I heard The Question. It didn't take long. A 50ish couple was
studying the route map, and the woman turned to her husband and
said, ``Where's the island from that book - you know, San Pietro?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: In an author's imagination. The setting for David
Guterson's critically acclaimed novel and film, ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' San Pietro Island doesn't exist, although the puzzled
couple can be forgiven: There's an otherwise-accurate map in the
book showing it to the south of San Juan Island.
</P>
<P>
   Although the novel was largely based on events on Bainbridge
Island, 65 miles to the south in Puget Sound, longtime residents
say it accurately captures life in the San Juans half a century
ago. That life, though, has all but vanished. The strawberry farms
and the Japanese immigrants who worked them are long gone, and the
fishing trawlers have mostly disappeared from the harbor, replaced
by pleasure yachts and whale-watching boats. Taciturn Scandinavian
fishermen have given way to cell-phone-toting real estate agents.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Jeri, and I visited the San Juans twice in the past two
years, investigating three of the four islands served by ferry _
San Juan, Orcas and Lopez. What follows is a sampler of scenes from
those trips.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop in Friday Harbor was the Whale Museum, dedicated
to the islands' most celebrated inhabitants _ orcas, or killer
whales. About 90 orcas forming three resident pods _ named J, K and
L _ ply the salmon-rich Haro Strait between San Juan and Vancouver
islands, and museum visitors are invited, for a modest fee, to
adopt one. While a young male with the evocative name of K-27
looked particularly toothsome, I decided to pass for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   The museum had photos of every resident orca, an exhibit of
orcas in American-Indian art, orca skeletons and a pickled orca
brain. Playing in the background was the song of the orcas, a
series of atonal, vaguely New Age-ish screeches and shrieks.
They're the undersea world's Yoko Onos.
</P>
<P>
   The resident pods can often be seen from Lime Kiln State Park,
but for a closer look we boarded a whale-watching boat at Roche
Harbor, on the island's northern tip.
</P>
<P>
   As we wended through a labyrinth of tiny islets, we glimpsed
nesting bald eagles, a swimming otter and dozens of harbor seals
lolling on rocks _ but no orcas. We sailed into Canadian waters and
reached Saturna Island; time was running out. Then the call came in
on the radio: J pod had been spotted off Lime Kiln Point. At full
throttle, we motored south for 20 minutes and then cut the engine
so that we drifted on a path to intercept the northbound whales.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a 5-foot-high dorsal fin knifing through the
water, coming straight toward our boat. We let out a collective
gasp as it disappeared beneath the surface and popped up again on
the other side of us.
</P>
<P>
   Another orca thrust its head out of the water for a look around
_ a move known as a ``spy hop.'' Others, perhaps half a dozen in
all, rasped and exhaled an oily spray that turned
kaleidoscope-colorful as it caught the light. A minute later J pod
dove and vanished as one, and we motored home.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH CAMP
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes from Roche Harbor, we turned into a dirt parking
lot, walked down a forest path and emerged at British Camp _
hallowed ground of what has come to be known as the Pig War.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ceded Vancouver Island to the British
and everything else south of the 49th parallel to the United
States, but neglected to mention the islands in between. Both
nations coveted them, and for years their settlers coexisted
uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   In 1859, an American farmer, Lyman Cutlar, discovered a
Berkshire boar belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company uprooting his
potato patch. Cutlar shot and killed the pig, the British
threatened to haul him off in irons, and an international incident
was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Navy dispatched five warships full of Royal Marines,
and the U.S. Army sent an infantry company led by Capt. George E.
Pickett, who later, as a Confederate general, would lend his name
to an ill-considered charge at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers glared at one another across San Juan Island, but
before the shooting could start, both sides received orders to put
down their rifles. The United States was heading toward civil war,
and Britain was preoccupied by events on the Continent; neither
wanted a war over a tiny archipelago in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies decamped to opposite ends of the island and
eventually became friends, hosting each other to dinner parties and
Christmas celebrations, until the matter was adjudicated by _ of
all people _ Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, who awarded the San Juans
to the United States. It was the last armed conflict between the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the Pig War inevitably end with the line, ``and the
only casualty was the pig.'' This isn't quite true. Six Royal
Marines and 16 U.S. soldiers died during the 13-year occupation,
victims of drownings, disease and what a sign at the U.S. cemetery
calls ``a surprising number of suicides.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, British Camp is quiet and serene, with the surprisingly
intact blockade and barracks overlooking pretty Garrison Bay. If
nothing else, it's evidence that the British had a better eye for
real estate than the Americans, who set up camp at the south end of
the island on an exposed, wind-lashed peninsula.

</P>
<P>
   LOPEZ ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Island is known as the most bucolic and flat of the San
Juans, the best venue for a bicycle tour. With that reputation in
mind, we scrimped by renting cheap seven-speed bikes _ a big
mistake, it turned out. ``Most flat,'' we discovered, is not the
same as ``flat.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time we'd pedaled, huffing, up the seemingly endless hill
from the ferry landing into Lopez Village, we were exhausted. To
revive ourselves, we stopped at Holly B's Bakery for some
sensational cinnamon rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Country lanes lined with wild raspberry and blackberry bushes
took us through rolling farmland, past grazing cows, hay bales and
weathered red barns. Almost every residence, we noticed, sported a
whimsical mailbox in the shape of an orca or ferry or some other
island icon.
</P>
<P>
   And just about every motorist we passed _ bearded farmers in
Studebaker pickups; soccer moms in Dodge minivans; aging flower
children in aging rustmobiles _ saluted us with the Lopez Wave, a
subtle lifting of the right index finger off the steering wheel. In
response, I raised my own finger off my handlebar. I felt like a
local.
</P>
<P>
   Bald eagles and Canada geese swooped overhead, and blue herons
and oystercatchers worked the tidal flats. Dark, leaden clouds
gathered, and it began to drizzle. Giving thanks, we cut short our
circuit of the island and, pushing our clunky bikes up the steeper
hills, retreated to Holly B's Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ORCAS ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Orcas Island, it turns out, is not named for the local killer
whales, but for the erstwhile viceroy of Mexico, Don Juan Vicente
de Guemes Pancheco y Padilla Orcasitees y Aquayo Conde de Revila
Gigedo. If you go back and look carefully, you'll find an ``Orcas''
in there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped like an ineptly forged horseshoe, Orcas is the largest of
the San Juans, at 57 square miles, and also the highest, at the
2,407 feet (the summit of Mount Constitution.) It's home to
Eastsound, a pretty little New England-style village of white
clapboard homes and shops; to some of the archipelagos' finest
artisans and craftsmen; to the historic Rosario Resort; and to an
eclectic collection of bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   For years, we'd had our eyes on one B&AMP;B in particular: the
Spring Bay Inn. We'd been unable to get reservations on our first
visit, but we got lucky on our second.
</P>
<P>
   Down a long, potholed dirt road on the island's southeast tip,
we were just beginning to give up hope when we arrived at the
elegantly gabled inn. In the common room, with its high, vaulted
ceiling, a fire crackled in the large Rumsford fireplace. Big
picture windows looked out over the inn's private cove _ Spring
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Carl Burger and Sandy Playa, are former California
park rangers who made a career switch a decade ago. The
half-finished inn they took over and completed has five bedrooms,
each with its own fireplace, four-poster bed and assorted antiques;
one room has its own hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, we awoke to a tray filled with
croissants, fresh fruit, homemade granola and coffee. Then it was
time for the inn's signature event: A two-hour guided sea kayaking
tour.
</P>
<P>
   On the gravel beach steps from the back door, we donned life
jackets, slid into fiberglass kayaks and paddled out of the cove
into East Sound, with the snowy ridges of the distant Olympic
Mountains rising before us. Playa led the way, while Burger stayed
behind to assemble brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to lead all the kayak trips and Carl always did the
cooking,'' Playa said. ``But he finally had enough of that
arrangement, and now we switch off every other day.''
</P>
<P>
   We paddled through glassy-still water past a raft of odd-looking
birds with pronounced bumps on their beaks, rhinoceros auklets,
Playa told us. She pointed out a bald eagles' nest, and while I
examined it through my binoculars, two golf ball-like heads popped
up.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, a wedding-cake ferry pulled out of Lopez Island
and glided silently toward Shaw. On our way back to the inn, we
paddled around the point at Obstruction Pass for a view of snowy
Mount Baker, only to find it cloaked in thick clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the inn, brunch was waiting for us: cornmeal pancakes,
marionberry smoothies, homemade carrot juice, fruit salad and
vegetarian sausage patties.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I was idly scanning the inn's guest book when I came
across an entry far more literate than the scribblings you usually
find in these things.
</P>
<P>
   The prose style seemed vaguely familiar. In a clear, precise
hand, the author had described his morning paddle: ``. . . the
whistling wings of goldeneye, a few mergansers, eagles like
sentinels in the trees. The cove flat &AMP; green, the madrone-covered
slopes falling fast toward the water. The drone of a float plane,
the passing of a ferry, a surf-scooter traveling low.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's David Guterson, the guy who wrote `Snow Falling on
Cedars,''' explained Burger. ``He stayed with us a couple of years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterson had perfectly described my own morning paddle through
the emerald waters of Orcas Island. And, unlike San Pietro, I am
happy to say, this island is quite real.

COURT REJECTS ATTEMPTS BY STATES TO INTRUDE ON FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously struck down
a Massachusetts law aimed at boycotting companies that do business
in Myanmar, ruling that crucial differences between the state law
and existing federal sanctions against the former Burma
``compromise the very capacity of the president to speak for the
nation with one voice in dealing with other governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a rare excursion into the realm of foreign policy, the
court said that under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which
gives Congress the power to pre-empt state laws, the Massachusetts
law had to fall because it ``stands in the way of Congress'
diplomatic objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The court stopped well short of declaring that states have no
constitutionally valid means of taking positions with foreign
policy implications, as many did during years of protest against
the apartheid regime in South Africa. Rather, Justice David H.
Souter's majority opinion focused tightly on the ways in which
Massachusetts' Burma law, adopted in early 1996, was irreconcilable
with a federal law passed by Congress three months later and
carried out by a presidential executive order in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said that while Congress adopted a ``calibration of
force'' policy, giving the president great flexibility to impose or
lift sanctions as a form of diplomatic leverage, the Massachusetts
law was much more categorical in barring state agencies from doing
business in most circumstances with any domestic or foreign company
that conducted business in Myanmar. ``We see the state Burma law as
an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress' full objectives
under the federal act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling left proponents of cutting off trade with the Asian
country's repressive military regime with several other possible
approaches, including divestment by public pension funds of the
stock of companies that do business there.
</P>
<P>
   When arguments were heard on March 22 in the case, Natsios vs.
National Foreign Trade Council, 99-474, a comment by Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy foretold the court's ruling. A situation in
which 50 states might conduct 50 different foreign policies would
be ``inconsistent with what the Federalist papers say was the
purpose of forming the union,'' Kennedy remarked.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law had limited, with strict exceptions,
companies that did business in Myanmar from doing business with the
state. But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston declared
the law invalid, and the high court on Monday said the appeals
court was correct.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had asked the Supreme Court to rule
as it did. Members of Congress were split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling may not be the last the court will be asked to
address in the area of ``foreign policy,'' or at least foreign
trade policy, as addressed by states and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen states and dozens of local governments at one time
imposed various sanctions against South Africa. Several were
challenged in court, but they never reached the Supreme Court, and
it might be that that those dormant lawsuits (or others to be
crafted in the future) articulate issues that the justices would
have to consider.

STILL SHAKEN BY BEING NEAR DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By MICHAEL C. DOHAN, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adapted from the Annals of Internal Medicine (April 4, 2000)
</P>
<P>
   I am 63 years old and have been living with a form of chronic
leukemia for more than seven years. Two years ago, progression of
my disease forced me to make an important personal decision:
whether to receive a bone marrow transplant, a risky and difficult
procedure. I chose to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 months of chemotherapy, I qualified for an autologous
bone marrow transplant, one in which my own marrow cells would be
extracted, ``cleaned up'' and re-infused. At first I rejoiced, but
I also soon felt anxiety and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   My hospital room was small and had a special air lock to prevent
infections. Doctors, nurses, my wife and other visitors had to wash
and put on a mask and gloves to enter the room.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the staff addressed me as ``doctor,'' which made me feel
special, but I quickly realized that playing doctor-patient was a
struggle. As much as my professional life in medicine had been
about control, as a patient I needed to let go and trust someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Following intense chemotherapy, I was taken to a small room
where I would receive a lethal dose of radiation. The sessions were
lonely, and as I lay on a trampoline with an X-ray machine above
and below me the clicking of the machines seemed like the ticking
of a bomb. Lethality was always on my mind during my time in
therapy. I thought about the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
who had no one waiting in the wings to give them healthy marrow. I
wondered what might happen if something went wrong with my own
marrow and there was none to give back. The progressive and extreme
physical and mental weakness accompanied by constant nausea made me
want to withdraw from the world. I wished at times I could just
say, ``STOP! No more therapy!'' But I never said a word to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   On reflection I am struck by my inability to share my terror.
Perhaps admitting my terror would have made it impossible for me as
a physician to retain my belief in the science of the procedure.
During the radiation therapy, I just wanted to lie in bed and
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the last radiation treatment, my wife was in
the room as my team of doctors and several nurses gathered around
and returned my treated bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   As I recovered, I hung onto every day, hoping it might be the
day I'd go home. But as I approached discharge after three and a
half weeks in the hospital, I became nauseous and prone to dry
heaves. My nurse correctly attributed this to anxiety. That tiny
room, which at times seemed like a cell, was, along with the
support staff, a more important crutch for me than I realized.
</P>
<P>
   Once home, I did not talk to anyone about my experience in the
hospital. When I tried to talk about it, I cried. I was totally
surprised at my own reaction. I suspected that I was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder. My wife and I set up an appointment
with a psychiatric social worker. The first meeting was difficult;
I cried more than I talked. But that night, I had the first decent
sleep since coming home.
</P>
<P>
   It is still hard to understand why my experience was so
difficult. Was it because I had never been so sick before? Was it
the experience of being brought so close to death? Was it the
mental and physical helplessness? Was it something about the
therapy? Did a physician's perspective make it more difficult? It
was probably all these, and more.
</P>
<P>
   What I remember now, months later, was my sense of extreme
helplessness, and my inability to muster the strength to fight it.
Visitors helped just being there, but conversation was difficult
and there was little I wanted to do except occasionally listen to
music. Everything was out of my hands. I just had to wait, and
hope. As a doctor, I had always taken pride in caring for others,
and I was the one in charge. I was accustomed to feeling in charge
of my own health, too _ pursuing athletics and embracing a healthy
and vigorous lifestyle. My time in the hospital disrupted that
sense of control so completely that even now, more than a year
later, some emotional fragility remains.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the impersonalization of modern
medical care. The trust we place in our caregivers remains an
essential component in recovering from illness. My own physician
and other providers were with me every step of the way and their
support has been enormously important _ important enough that I
trusted them to kill me, and then bring me back to life.

CHESAPEAKE TUMBLES AFTER EARNINGS WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Stock prices are not the most recent.)

</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chesapeake fell sharply Monday after the specialty
packaging and merchandising services company warned that it would
report earnings that would be far lower than projections by
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Chesapeake revised its projected earnings to 10 cents to 15
cents a share in its second quarter _ less than half the consensus
estimate of 33 cents a share expected by analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial. The company's revised earnings expectations
of $1.85 to $2.05 a share for the fiscal year were also lower than
the $2.30 consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chesapeake were down 3 3/16, or 10 percent, at 29 3/8
in afternoon trading. Chesapeake's revised expectations for the
second quarter were comparable to its earnings of 14 cents a share
in the first quarter. The Richmond, Va-based corporation blamed the
projected stagnancy on delays by several major U.S. consumer
products companies of their promotional programs and new product
introductions _ delays that hurt U.S. point-of-purchase sales and
operating margins, a measure of operating efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Remes, a spokeswoman for Chesapeake, said the corporation
could not provide numbers for point-of-purchase sales or operating
margins. ``While we are disappointed with the near-term results in
our U.S. display business, order activity is strengthening and we
anticipate more favorable results in the second half of 2000, as
well as positive year-over-year improvement,'' Thomas H. Johnson,
Chesapeake's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the corporation was ``pleased'' with its other
businesses' performance, citing the progress of the integration of
Boxmore International, a leading European packaging company, and
anticipation of strong results in Chesapeake's European packaging
segment.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Keane, an analyst for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co., said most
other companies in the sector are not experiencing similar earnings
problems, and Chesapeake's difficulties are most likely ``a
short-term event.'' Keane said Chesapeake's business is focused on
the second half of the year, when display sales in the U.S. and
Europe increase because of holiday season purchases. ``They're
having their slower period now,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Keane added that Chesapeake's revised earnings projections are
to a certain degree ``not that surprising,'' since Procter &AMP; Gamble
has had problems lately that have hurt its new product
introductions. He said Procter &AMP; Gamble, which has faced a series
of earnings disappointments, may have been behind deferred orders
for point-of-purchase displays from Chesapeake.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. has a market outperform rating on
Chesapeake. It has done no recent underwriting for the company.
Chesapeake is slated to announce its second-quarter results on July
20.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new type of rocket engine under development could halve the
travel time between Earth and Mars _ should NASA ever decide to
send astronauts there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the technology that's going to take us to Mars,''
said Dr. Franklin Chang-Diaz, a shuttle astronaut and director of
the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on chemical reactions like conventional
rockets, Chang-Diaz's creation, the Variable Specific Impulse
Magnetoplasma Rocket, or Vasimr, uses radio waves to heat the fuel
and magnetic fields to direct a stream of ultrahot ionized gases.
</P>
<P>
   NASA last week announced that it was collaborating with MSE
Technology Applications of Butte, Mont., to develop the Vasimr
technology, still years away from use in space. MSE is creating
computer models for shaping the magnetic fields that form the
engine's nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   Space buffs have long dreamed of sending astronauts to Mars. But
that dream, which once looked like the next destination after Moon
landings, is still far from reality, stymied by hurdles as much
economic and political as technological.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s, pioneering rocket scientist Wernher von
Braun had already worked out a detailed, if fanciful, plan for
sending a fleet of 10 colossal spaceships to Mars, powered by
conventional chemical rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the engineering capability with chemical propulsion
to undertake a mission to Mars for years, for decades,'' said Les
Johnson, who heads the exploration transportation technologies
portion of the advanced space transportation program at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it boils down to,'' Johnson said, ``is, Is it safe
enough? Is it affordable?''
</P>
<P>
   Lifting one pound of material from the Earth's surface into
orbit costs about $10,000. With each of von Braun's interplanetary
behemoths weighing about 4,000 tons _ or about 10 times the weight
of the International Space Station once it is completed _ the price
tag of merely lugging the building materials into orbit would run
more than $800 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Neil Armstrong stepped on the Moon in 1969, von
Braun, then the director of the Marshall Space Center, had devised
a slimmed down, more realistic proposal to send a single nuclear
powered spaceship to Mars, with the first astronaut stepping onto
Martian soil in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 design still came in at about 800 tons, and fuel
accounted for three-quarters of the mass. The manned missions to
Mars never got off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, engineers have whittled away at that mass. A lighter
rocket reduces the amount of fuel needed. A more efficient rocket
engine also trims fuel requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket engines work by the same principle as throwing a baseball
while seated on slippery ice: because of conservation of momentum,
the thrower starts sliding in the opposite direction of the
baseball, and the harder the throw, the faster the thrower slides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, a rocket works by shooting material out the back at
high speeds,'' said Chang-Diaz. ``The higher the speed of the
material, the better the rocket is. The speed of the material
coming out the back is proportional to the temperature of the
material.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vasimr is part of NASA's frugal but continuing research in
new rocket technologies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chemical rocket engines _ like those of the space shuttle _
throw out propellant at the relatively low temperature of about
5,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and the relatively slow speed of 10,000
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting the temperature and speed of the exiting exhaust in
chemical rocket engines is possible, but that can cause another
problem: destroying the engine. ``You could try to go to a higher
temperature, but it would just melt,'' Chang-Diaz said. ``There's
no known material that can hold these gases.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasimr avoids the melting engine problem by containing and
guiding the gases with magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   The engine works by injecting the hydrogen fuel into a chamber
where it is bombarded by radio waves. ``Like a microwave oven,''
Chang-Diaz said. The radio waves heat the gas and strip away
electrons from the hydrogen atoms, creating a gas of positively
charged protons and negatively charged electrons.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting charged particles spiral around in a magnetic
field as radio waves further heat them until they escape out the
back of the engine at speeds of up to 650,000 mph, or about 60
times as fast as the exhaust from the chemical rockets.
</P>
<P>
   By altering the magnetic fields, the engine's nozzle can be
opened up for more thrust as the spaceship enters or leaves orbit
and can be throttled back for better fuel efficiency during the
trip. Chemical rockets, in contrast, fire much more powerful
bursts, but they can only be sustained for minutes. The continuous
firing of the plasma engine would cut the astronauts' Earth-to-Mars
trip from six months to three months, reducing the astronauts'
exposure to damaging cosmic radiation and calcium-draining
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chang-Diaz, the total mass sent to Mars via a
Vasimr-powered mission, with one spaceship carrying the astronauts
and a second carrying most of the supplies, would be about 400
tons.
</P>
<P>
   Chang-Diaz has built a small prototype. An in-orbit test of the
concept could come as soon as 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The technology can also be used for thrusters on Earth-orbiting
satellites. ``The limiting factor in the life of a satellite is its
propellant,'' Chang-Diaz said. ``They run out of gas and they
become space junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Conley, deputy manager of the advanced development
office at the Johnson Space Center, said, ``The Vasimr really looks
promising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vasimr is not the only engine being considered for a mission.
NASA studies still consider chemical and solar-powered propulsion
as the first option.
</P>
<P>
   Another option revives the notion of nuclear-thermal engines
used in von Braun's 1969 plan. In these, hydrogen gas is heated by
running it past the core of a nuclear reactor. Other engines with
exotic names like pulsed inductive thrusters and
magnetoplasmadynamic, or MPD, engines, are also under study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are more efficient than others,'' said Johnson of the
Marshall Space Center. ``Some might scale better to higher
energies. It's too early to say which is going to win the horse
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Any of these new technologies would raise a politically
sensitive issue for NASA. ``Any engine that is not a chemical
rocket will probably require a nuclear reactor,'' Chang-Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   A Vasimr engine does not directly use a nuclear reactor, but a
rocket powerful enough to send people to Mars would need to tap
into a 10-megawatt power source to generate the magnetic fields and
radio waves. That is more power than can be produced by solar
panels.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear issue is one reason NASA has not yet embraced the
newer engines. ``There could be some socio-political implications
if we pick nuclear right away,'' Conley said. ``If we could do it
with solar, we'd like to do it with solar.''
</P>
<P>
   The engine decision also depends on when, if ever, NASA decides
to send astronauts to Mars and how quickly it wants to get there.
``If we were going in 10 years, there would be one answer,''
Johnson said. ``There'd be another if we had 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear-thermal engine would be the easiest and quickest to
develop. The Vasimr is the most fuel efficient. Other engines have
other benefits and trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   For the present, the research is not a high priority. NASA
spends only a few million dollars a year exploring advanced
propulsion systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no NASA plan to send people to Mars,'' Johnson said.
``There is no NASA plan to send people beyond low-Earth orbit. What
we're doing is looking at options.''

AT&AMP;T WIRELESS TO BUY VERIZON'S OVERLAPPING BUSINESS IN THREE
CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Stock prices are not the most recent.) 
 By TIM ARANGO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Verizon Wireless, the wireless combination of Bell Atlantic,
Vodafone AirTouch and GTE, will sell off its overlapping business
in three cities to AT&AMP;T Wireless Group, the companies announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at about $3.3 billion, will expand AT&AMP;T's
wireless network to cover all of the San Francisco, San Diego and
Houston markets, and add more than 1.3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the agreements represented a major step
toward avoiding an overlap in cellular service operations that
would be created when GTE Wireless assets are integrated into
Verizon Wireless after the New York-based Bell Atlantic and Irving,
Texas-based GTE merge _ a deal approved by the FCC last week.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T Wireless, GTE and Bell Atlantic were up in
afternoon trading but Vodafone was trading lower. Shares of the
Redmond, Wash.-based AT&AMP;T Wireless were up 1 1/8, or 4 percent, at
28 3/4. Bell Atlantic shares were up 2 3/8, or 4 percent, at 57
7/16. GTE stock was up 3 11/16, or 6 percent, at 69 11/16.
Meanwhile, shares of the UK-based wireless giant Vodafone were down
1 5/16, or 3 percent, at 48 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday, John Zeglis, chairman and chief
executive officer of AT&AMP;T Wireless, said that acquiring the
wireless systems in the new markets has ``jump-started our strategy
of expanding our footprint and achieving our growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The group expects to hire another 1,400 employees as a result of
the acquisition. Zeglis added that the new markets, which cover a
combined population of about 15 million residents, will allow AT&AMP;T
Wireless to deliver its service to 90 percent of California
residents and 70 percent of those living in Texas. By including the
three cities in its coverage area, AT&AMP;T Wireless officials say the
company now has AT&AMP;T-branded wireless service in each of the
country's top 15 wireless markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really positive for AT&AMP;T because they're trying to
increase their footprint,'' said Peter Friedland, an analyst at the
San Francisco-based investment banking firm W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co.
Friedland said that acquiring the three additional markets was a
big step in the company's strategy to improve its cost structure by
covering more of the U.S., so it won't have to incur a lot of
off-network usage. But he cautioned that investors aren't likely to
see the benefits of the company's expansion on its bottom line for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains a target price of $32 per share by the middle of
2001. W.R. Hambrecht maintains a neutral rating on the stock, which
it does not underwrite. Though an analyst at ABN-AMRO in New York
called the deal a necessary transaction, as Verizon Wireless needed
to sell off its overlapping coverage areas, he said it should
benefit AT&AMP;T Wireless. The wireless group will now have branded
service throughout those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ABN-AMRO, an underwriter of the AT&AMP;T Wireless tracking stock,
maintains its longterm target price of $40 and has held its buy
rating since the stock went public. Since going public about seven
weeks ago, the AT&AMP;T Wireless stock has traded as high as $36 per
share, on May 1, before slipping to $24.375 per share on May 23.
ABN-AMRO also gives a buy rating to shares of Bell Atlantic, a
partner in the Verizon Wireless venture, with a longterm target
price for its stock of $90.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless had owned about 53 percent of the San Francisco
market before Monday's announcement. The new deal allowed the group
to acquire the remaining interest from Vodafone Airtouch. The
system covers a population base of more than 7 million residents,
including nearly 1 million CellularOne brand subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego wireless system is being bought from GTE and
covers an area of nearly 3 million people, including more than
200,000 GTE Wireless brand subscribers. AT&AMP;T Wireless is obtaining
the Houston wireless system from PrimeCo PCS, including a
population about 5.7 million people with 190,000 wireless
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&AMP;T, already
operates one of the largest wireless networks in the country, with
more than 10.1 million subscribers, according to company officials.
The group was spun off from AT&AMP;T this spring, with an initial
public offering that raised $10.6 billion on April 27. AT&AMP;T retains
about 84 percent of the company.

   NEW YORK _ Dr. Ferrel Loki Osborn loves elephants. But he also
loves the villagers of the Zambezi River Valley in northern
Zimbabwe, whose fields of carefully tended corn, cotton and banana
crops have long tempted elephants looking for a convenient midnight
snack.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the root of Osborn's years-long quest for the
ultimate elephant repellent _ and a potential career shift from
zoologist toward pepper-extract eco-entrepreneur. He has devised a
multipronged array of repellents, some of which rural farmers can
concoct themselves, all using capsaicin, the chemical that puts the
heat in hot peppers.

   This 33-year-old elephant expert, reared in Connecticut and
educated at Cambridge, began seeking a solution after he found
himself occasionally helping to shoot ``particularly cheeky'' young
bulls that were repeat offenders, sometimes despoiling fields in an
almost playful cat-and-mouse game with outraged, fearful farmers.
</P>
<P>
   To those who recoil at the thought of an elephant biologist
killing an elephant, he points out that the clash between
pachyderms and people has deadly consequences on both sides: close
to 200 people are crushed or gored by elephants in Zimbabwe each
year, leaving a strong impression in the minds of rural folk whose
hatred for elephants grows, as does the tendency to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Crop-raiding elephants have even become issues in elections in
several African countries, with rural communities demanding an
armed response by the government. The conflict also increases
peoples' resentment toward the parks and preserves that are the
elephants' haven.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Osborn said, a park official visited a
village that had seen the fruits of five months of tilling,
planting and weeding trampled to dust one night. He was tied to a
tree and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Osborn began studying why some elephants _ even at the height of
the rainy season when there is plenty to eat _ leave forests and
grasslands on moonless nights and pad silently into farms.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to New York City last week, he described his findings
to staff members at the Wildlife Conservation Society in the Bronx,
which has supported his recent work with several grants.
</P>
<P>
   He said crop raids by wildlife had happened ever since humans
first began practicing agriculture, with elephants being part of
the problem both in Africa and Asia at least for centuries. ``There
are Sanskrit records of this in India going back thousands of
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem has intensified in recent years, particularly in
places like northern Zimbabwe, as farmers have pushed farther into
forests seeking fertile soil to grow cotton and corn for cash and
food crops.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Zambezi River, there is an annual rhythm to the raids,
he said, which begin quite abruptly halfway through the wet growing
season, which runs from October to May. ``The trouble usually
starts in February,'' he said. ``They start coming out like
someone's flipped a switch.''
</P>
<P>
   The raiders are usually young bull elephants that roam in small
packs seeking females.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, at least, it appears to be an indulgence, taking
advantage of an easy snack, he said. ``Not to be anthropomorphic,''
Osborn said, ``but their behavior is often like that of young human
males.''
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of professional hunters, Osborn tested whether
shooting a few elephants in a pack of crop-raiding bulls deterred
the survivors from returning. When the presence of an elephant
carcass did not dissuade the others from coming back, he used the
findings to make a case to farming communities that shooting was
not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   But what was?
</P>
<P>
   In some places, costly electric fences have been built, often
with aid from conservation or international development groups, but
Osborn has watched savvy elephants snap the upper wires with their
tusks, then gingerly step over the lower ones. At more than $2,500
for a mile of fence, not counting repairs, this strategy is costly
and impractical, at best, he said.
</P>
<P>
   From days spent hiking in the American West, he said, he
recalled how hot pepper extracts were used in bear repellents. In
the East, they have been used to deter deer, skunks, and squirrels.
They are used in some ant repellents _ and capsaicin is an
ingredient in some self-defense sprays to deter human attackers, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Given elephants' reliance on smell and taste, he said, the
theory was ``it must hurt them 10 times more.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, over the last seven years Osborn began experimenting
with ways to use a spray against invading elephants.
</P>
<P>
   The first efforts involved homemade contraptions resembling fire
extinguishers that produced a peppery fog. But these required the
operator to get dangerously close to elephants, and a change in
wind direction meant trouble for the person as well as the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Birochak, a designer of defensive spray devices in Wayne,
Pa., devised a low-tech launcher using pressurized air _ pumped up
with a bicycle pump _ to lob a small pepper-spray grenade 60 or 70
yards.
</P>
<P>
   But that fairly complicated device has since been reserved for
the most recalcitrant elephants, Osborn said.
</P>
<P>
   For the main effort, he has gone several steps further down the
technology ladder, devising a layered pepper defense that starts
with the design of the farm itself.
</P>
<P>
   Many farms in the river valley are laid out rather haphazardly,
with no clearly defined ``edge'' that elephants can recognize. So
he worked with some farmers to help them create a cleared path
between forest and fields. He said elephants' behavior changes when
they venture into fields, showing that they are cognizant that they
are on hostile terrain.
</P>
<P>
   To make a raid more difficult, the farmers then plant hot
peppers and dense, thorny thickets of sisal _ a source of poles and
cord fiber _ around the field perimeter. Elephants tend to avoid
unpalatable or thorny plants, Osborn said.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the cash crop, generally cotton, which elephants eat
grudgingly. Deepest in the field, the farmers plant the most
desirable food crops, like corn.
</P>
<P>
   Around the edge, he helped villagers at six sites erect a flimsy
pepper-coated fence, consisting only of lengths of rough twine
strung between hand-hewn poles. The strings were smeared with a
mixture of grease and an extremely concentrated extract of
capsaicin from habanero peppers, the hottest of the hot.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper intensity is measured in Scoville units, a system devised
in 1912 by Wilbur Scoville, a Detroit pharmacologist. Jalapeno
peppers rate 2,500 to 5,000 units. The habanero extract used by
Osborn registers 1,000,000 Scoville units.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Osborn imported the substance from American hot-sauce
suppliers, but he is planning to set up a small factory in Zimbabwe
to begin producing the extract from locally grown peppers,
hopefully creating a new market for the country's farmers and
providing a local source of anti-elephant essence.
</P>
<P>
   A research assistant, Kinos Mariba, came up with another weapon:
adobe-like briquettes of elephant dung and ground hot chilies.
</P>
<P>
   On the moonless nights that elephants prefer, farmers set small
fires around their fields. When they hear intruding elephants, they
poke the embers into a blaze, creating a haze of acrid,
trunk-stinging smoke. (The dung does not seem to contribute to the
repellent effect but is simply an abundant burnable medium, he
said.)
</P>
<P>
   The operation, at least for the first year, was a success, he
said. ``You'd see elephants looking with confusion at the tip of
their trunk,'' he said. ``If they pushed through the fence, they
got it on their sides and try to wipe it off with their trunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The response, almost invariably, was that the elephants would
shuffle off in search of easier fare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   This year, the goal is to see if the farmers at the test sites
pursue the strategy on their own as the growing season approaches.
``This will only work if they want it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While in the United States, he has bought a large supply of
habanero and tabasco pepper seed to bring back to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   A secondary goal, he said, is to create a line of gourmet hot
sauces that could be produced in northern Zimbabwe and sold
internationally to raise money for the elephant research.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the frustrations of being a zoologist is that you don't
really produce anything,'' he said. This way, he said, he may be
able to create jobs, a market for a new crop, and perhaps save a
few elephants _ and a few farmers.

<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: The next time you plan to fly to San Francisco,
consider Oakland Airport _ for two reasons. First, San Francisco
Airport is chronically congested, and prone to heavy fog. If it's
doubtful a flight from Southern California will be able to land on
schedule, the pilot is routinely required to cool his jets on the
ground here before being permitted to take off. Oakland, much
farther inland, is rarely subjected to fog. Second, United Airlines
has a stranglehold on San Francisco and seems to price its flights
accordingly. You can often get a much better fare from Southwest
into Oakland. The drive across the Bay Bridge to the city center
usually takes about 20 minutes. If you drive from the L.A. area,
San Francisco is about 355 miles via Interstates 5 and 580, 440
miles via Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDIO PARTICULARS: The easiest approach is probably from
Lombard Street (Highway 101) just south of the Golden Gate Bridge.
In the Marina district, Highway 101 veers sharply right from
Lombard onto Richardson Avenue on its approach to the bridge. To
enter the Presidio, continue on Lombard _ which actually requires
you to get into a left-turn lane to avoid Richardson and the stream
toward the bridge. Once in the park, follow the signs to the Main
Post, where the visitor center is housed. It is open from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. daily (closed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day).
The Presidio is the rare national park that requires no fee to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Hotels in the low $100s are rare in San Francisco, but
you'll find one such option at the no-frills Marina Motel, at 2576
Lombard St. _ just two blocks from the Lombard Gate entrance to the
Presidio. Many rooms open onto an inner courtyard, which blunts the
din of traffic on Lombard. Rooms are almost claustrophobically
small, but who spends any time in a hotel room in San Francisco?
The grounds are lovingly tended, with flower pots and planter boxes
overflowing with geraniums, roses and bougainvillea. Murals are
painted on a couple of the courtyard walls. And this might be the
property's strongest asset: Parking is free and plentiful _ in
garages, no less. Don't judge this place by its exterior. The neon
sign, left over from the 1950s (``Drive In,'' it implores) was
retained for kitsch. Look for it while driving westbound on
Lombard. If you get to Linoleum Larry's, you've gone too far.
Information and reservations: (415) 921-9406 or (800) 346-6118.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: There are some outstanding trattorias in this area,
where seating is confined to a handful of tables and service is so
attentive you feel as if you've dropped in at somebody's house.
Curbside Too, serving country French, is probably the best. Try the
warm goat-cheese salad ($7). Entrees (most in $20s and $30s) are
served with a startling variety of vegetables. The wine prices are
so low, you at first wonder if they are misprints (only $28 for a
1997 Chateau de Bellevue Burgundy Morgan, for example). The chef,
wearing his apron over jeans, twice stopped by our table to make
certain everything was satisfactory. The restaurant is at 2769
Lombard St.; phone (415) 921-4442. Other options: Bistro Aix, 3340
Steiner St., phone (415) 202-0100; and Ristorante Bonta, 2223 Union
St. (in the Pacific Heights district), phone (415) 929-0407.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Presidio Visitor Center can be reached at (415)
561-4323. Web: www.nps.govrsf. At Fort Point, efforts are made to
conduct two tours daily, but that hinges on the availability of
volunteers to lead them. It's best to call the morning of the day
you intend to visit: (415) 556-1693. For general tourist
information on San Francisco, call (415) 391-2000. Web:

An oasis by the Bay &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Once a fortified military base, San Francisco's Presidio is now at
the center of a battle over its future &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Story by Eric Noland/Travel Editor &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The city presses up against its borders like a
fungus. Walk along Lake, Filbert or Jackson streets and you observe
San Francisco in its quintessence: residences and buildings jammed
together, stacked on top of one another, oozing over every vacant
square foot, conferring priceless value on an unobstructed view of
water or a sliver of parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Cross the boundary, however _ over Lyon Street or West Pacific
Avenue _ and it's as if you've stepped into a different world, a
world in which time literally seems to have stood still.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Presidio, which was a military post for 218 years
and has been a national park for the past six. As San Francisco
real estate boomed over the past century, this 1,480-acre parcel at
the northern tip of the city operated in a federal vacuum,
blissfully oblivious to the burgeoning growth that besieged its
edges. And visitors today are the richer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Here is open space lushly overgrown, winding roads and trails
that follow spectacular coastal bluffs, gullies choked with
forests, and charming buildings that date to the Civil War, with
discreet expanses of undeveloped land around them. This is what
makes the Presidio so unique: It is a sprawling urban oasis on the
edge of the most densely settled city in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It came into being in 1994 as part of the wave of military-base
closures that followed the conclusion of the Cold War. It had been
prime defensive turf since 1776, when Juan Bautista de Anza III
stood on a bluff overlooking the mouth of San Francisco Bay and
determined that this would be the ideal site for an adobe fort to
guard one of New Spain's most important harbors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing years, it would be home to Union Army garrisons
during the Civil War, a biplane airfield in the early 1900s, a
defense-intelligence training ground for Japanese-American soldiers
during World War II ... and home to more varieties of menacing
cannons than you can count.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of this, the post has long been a fairly open
environment. San Franciscans could wander in for a walk or a picnic
or a romantic moment, knowing that they might encounter nothing
more disconcerting than an armed patrol tramping by. In the few
years since the National Park Service replaced the Sixth Army as
the Presidio's steward, visitors to the city have begun to discover
it _ and embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the park is very much in a state of flux. While the
Presidio was a pretty peaceful place during its military days (even
during the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846, U.S. Commodore Robert F.
Stockton referred to his ``quiet and undisturbed possession of the
defenseless port''), it is now a battleground involving the park
service, the Presidio Trust, and San Francisco's active
environmental and no-change-now-that-I'm-here groups.
</P>
<P>
   Congress decreed four years ago that the Presidio would have to
be a self-sufficient enterprise by 2013, and the Presidio Trust was
commissioned with the task of generating the park's $35 million
annual operating budget. That is to be done by leasing former
military buildings for commercial and residential uses. A plan to
let filmmaker George Lucas raze a fabulously ugly hospital to build
a movie production center has drawn particular fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the remainder of the park is a hive of activity.
Renovations are planned for some of the Presidio's 510 historic
buildings, many of which are great to look at but are barely
habitable. A new visitor center and museum is due to open next
month. And Crissy Field, an area of bay frontage that was used for
landfill in the less environmentally sensitive time of 1915, is
being restored to its original state as a tidal marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Even as these projects proceed _ and the various factions
wrestle over whether the existing buildings are destined to become
a bustling business park _ the Presidio remains a delightful place
to visit. There are remote paths that afford stunning views of the
Golden Gate Bridge and the craggy coastline below the bluffs. There
are narrow, squiggly lanes ideal for bicycle riding and other forms
of exertion. There are fascinating buildings that provide a kind of
architectural timeline of the post. There is rich history of
military vigilance at the entrance to the bay, even though,
thankfully, it was never tested.
</P>
<P>
   Any visit to the Presidio should begin with a stop at the
visitor center, which occupies a corner of the centrally located
Main Post (near the corner of Montgomery Street and Lincoln
Boulevard, just west of the Lombard Gate entrance to the park).
This stop is essential for one reason only: to acquire a map.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike San Francisco itself, which is laid out in a reassuring
grid of streets, the Presidio's roads date to horse-and-buggy days,
and they twist and turn along the natural contours of the land.
Thus, plunking down $2.71 for the Official Map &AMP; Guide to the
Presidio of San Francisco, published by the Golden Gate National
Parks Association, is sure to spare you a good deal of aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   During my visit in May, a tourist pulled her car to a sudden
halt within a few feet of me and, in obvious exasperation, asked
for directions to ``the road back to the city.'' She had been
driving in circles _ less than half a mile from one of the exits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to explore the Presidio's hidden delights
is to take a walk on some portion of the Coastal Trail, which
meanders 1.5 miles from near the southern promontory of San
Francisco Bay to the broad expanse of Baker Beach along the Pacific
Ocean. (The map is helpful here, too, because the path isn't
particularly well-marked.)
</P>
<P>
   Over its course, the trail passes beneath the Golden Gate
Bridge, picks its way along coastal bluffs and skirts seven
different gun-battery sites from different eras, including some
earthen-work defenses that date to 1876.
</P>
<P>
   Take your camera. The trail affords some stunning views of the
Golden Gate Bridge, sometimes through breaks in the verdant forest.
For one of the best views of the bridge, locate the concrete shell
that is Battery Boutelle (it's on the map), climb its staircase and
iron ladder, and venture out to the edge of the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Early one weekday morning, the trail was all but deserted. The
hum of inbound commuters approaching the bridge toll booth on
Highway 101 competed with the deep, plaintive blasts of foghorns.
The morning fog was so thick that it collected on tree boughs and
dripped like rain. Wildflowers along the trail were shoulder-high
in some stretches. The air was rich with the scent of cypress
needles. Waves assaulted the rocks far below. And the city felt
far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular walk is the Ecology Trail, which describes a
two-mile loop at the center of the Presidio grounds, beginning and
ending at the Main Post. Along this route, you'll get a sense of
the Army's prodigious tree-planting efforts in the final few years
of the 19th century. The Army stuck 100,000 trees in the ground
over an 11-year period, mostly eucalyptus, Monterey cypress and
Monterey pine. Today, the park service and the trust lament the
fact that the soldiers didn't choose trees native to California,
but why quibble? The forests are nonetheless lush and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   At many points along the path, flowers grow in thick patches,
brightening the landscape with clusters of nasturtium and San
Francisco lessingia.
</P>
<P>
   Near its conclusion, the walk follows a ramrod-straight stretch
lined with street lamps. This is Lovers' Lane, so named because in
the 1860s it was the primary route for soldiers headed for town.
</P>
<P>
   On its final leg toward the Main Post, the walk crosses an 1885
footbridge over El Polin Creek. Alas, this quaint, 115-year-old
structure has been despoiled with spray-paint graffiti _ one of the
unfortunate byproducts of increased public access to a former
military reservation. It makes you wish the area was still
patrolled by sticklers for order with fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   The Main Post itself is laid out in precise, military fashion, a
tidy rectangle configured around a former parade ground. Typical _
although the beauty of San Francisco Bay lies about a quarter-mile
away _ not one building has a bay-view aspect.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of historic architecture on this post, and some
of the most intriguing buildings are right here, along Funston
Avenue. They are former officers' quarters, dating to 1862, built
in Queen Anne/Stick style. Stroll among these structures and you
might feel as if you're in a small town in Pennsylvania,
contemplating the latest act of President Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio grounds feature some hidden quirks _ including a
cemetery where the pets of some post residents were buried _ as
well as several locales that have been well-trodden by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Beach stretches along the Pacific coast in the southwest
corner of the park. Once again, the views of the Golden Gate Bridge
to the north are terrific, especially if you're lucky enough to
find it partly shrouded in fog. However, parents with young
children and those of modest sensibilities should be forewarned:
Baker Beach appears to be exceedingly popular with San Francisco's
aging, overweight male nudists.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, Fort Point is a favorite. Docents dress up in
Civil War uniforms and conduct free, hour-long tours of the
prison-like fortress that stands in the shadow of the Golden Gate
Bridge's southern footings. Our guide, Chris Burgin, was
exceptionally knowledgeable, holding interest even as most of us
shivered in the drafty, depressing edifice of granite, brick and
concrete that was commissioned in 1850 to protect the newest state
in the union.
</P>
<P>
   On a walk through the former powder magazine, we were told that
soldiers commonly put their socks on over the shoes before
entering, because a shoe nail striking a floorboard nail could
generate a disastrous spark.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the sun was shining on the Golden Gate Promenade, a
broad, three-mile path that hugs the edge of the bay from Fort
Point nearly to Fisherman's Wharf. It seemed a welcomed antidote to
the bowels of the fort, but it passes alongside the massive
construction project that is the Crissy Field restoration, so it
figures to have considerably more appeal when the work is completed
next spring. Even so, it was crawling with walkers, joggers,
cyclists and skaters.
</P>
<P>
   In its six years as a national park, the Presidio has proven to
be quite a curiosity, and its positioning on the edge of a major
city has undoubtedly contributed to a crush of visitation. Some 14
million people wander through here annually, according to park
spokesman Roger Scott. Thus, it ranks behind only Great Smoky
Mountains National Park (in North Carolina and Tennessee) in
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of Central Park,'' said Scott, who came
to the Presidio from the nation's only other urban national park,
New York's Gateway. ``With the environmental concern that
Californians have, and certainly the awareness that San Franciscans
have, they want to hold on to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifics of the Presidio's future use might be uncertain as it
strives for self-sufficiency, but there is probably little cause to
fret that its unique ambience will be significantly altered. There
are precious few urban treasures such as this.

NEW ALCHEMY: BONE AND CARTILAGE FROM A SNIPPET OF SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By GREG WINTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a less-traveled path in the quest to replace damaged
organs with parts grown in the laboratory, a professor at the
University of California at San Francisco reports that he has
changed human skin and gum cells into bone and cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like science fiction, doesn't it?'' said the
researcher, Dr. Rajendra Bhatnagar, who is head of the university's
graduate bioengineering group. ``But that's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhatnagar's findings, detailed in the latest issue of Cells and
Materials, a peer-reviewed journal, provides one of the first
alternatives to researchers' widespread reliance on stem cells, the
primordial cells from which all others emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For several decades, researchers have tried to find a source of
living cells to coax into new tissues. Most are focusing on stem
cells, because, in theory, they can be manipulated to form any
organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   But they are difficult to harvest. Stem cells are found in bone
marrow, but make up only one out of every 10,000 cells, or even
less as patients age, making them extremely difficult, not to
mention painful, to excavate and isolate through biopsies and other
means.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryos offer another source of stem cells, but the
prospect of mining bio matter from fetuses raises obvious moral
questions. In 1994, President Clinton banned the use of money from
the National Institutes of Health for experiments that either
create or destroy embryos, a policy Congress later adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Using embryonic stem cells also has immunological complications.
Just as the body rejects transplanted organs from donors, it can
also often reject tissues grown from donated cells.
</P>
<P>
   Skin, however, is not only the largest organ in the body,
providing researchers with a seemingly unlimited number of cells to
work with, but it is also the most accessible. Within the dermis,
the middle layer in the folds of human skin, sit an abundance of
fibroblasts, the particular cells Bhatnagar and his researchers
convert into bone and cartilage. So it is with gums as well, where
fibroblasts are plentiful and, Bhatnagar reports, equally pliable.
</P>
<P>
   From a near painless snippet of skin or gum tissue no more than
a few cubic millimeters in volume, Bhatnagar says he can generate
enough tissue to fill a hole in bone or cartilage many hundreds of
times that size. And because the fibroblasts come directly from the
donor, there is no risk of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have enormous impact in the field,'' said Dr.
Antonios Mikos, vice president of the Tissue Engineering Society
and editor of Tissue Engineering, an industry journal that in 1999
published a paper by Bhatnagar on converting a type of fibroblast
found in gums into bone. ``There are many technologies trying to
isolate stem cells from bone. The problems of those technologies
may be solved if one can use dermal fibroblasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhatnagar's newest paper describes the transformation of a
different type of gum cell, the gingival fibroblast, into bone _
research that has already made its way to the marketplace. Last
November, CeraMed Dental, a small, Denver-based firm owned
primarily by the dental product giant Dentsply International, got
approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell a product
based on Bhatnagar's research for patients with advanced
periodontal disease. CeraMed paid the university for the rights to
use the research; Bhatnagar says he has no financial interest in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Inserted wherever teeth have eroded, CeraMed's product, Pepgen
P-15, works by transforming fibroblasts in the gums into bone,
CeraMed officials say. In clinical trials required for FDA
approval, the product proved 38 percent more effective than current
methods of plugging holes in teeth, and generated new growth over
roughly three-fourths of deteriorated areas. In one test, a
middle-aged man whose jaw had become too dilapidated to bear false
teeth had his gums packed with the pasty substance. After six
months, he had grown what amounted to a new jaw, somewhat crudely
formed, but solid enough to withstand drilling and support fake,
screw-in teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Bhatnagar hopes the technology can be adapted to avert costly
surgeries for other degenerative diseases. Osteoarthritis,
characterized by a breakdown in the joint's cartilage, is the
principle cause of nearly half a million knee and hip replacements
each year, according to the American Association of Orthopedic
Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fibroblasts are not supposed to turn into bone or
cartilage. Biologists have long believed that cells do not change
course once they fully differentiate.
</P>
<P>
   But Bhatnagar pays them no mind. After spending more than 40
years tinkering with the laws of nature, he has learned to be
irreverent. ``There is no dogma that has any true basis,'' he is
fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   His skeptics disagree. Dr. Arnold Kaplan, a founder of Osiris
Therapeutics and one of the first scientists to isolate the stem
cells found in bone marrow, said he was not familiar with
Bhatnagar's work but speculated that the professor was unknowingly
experimenting with another type of stem cell, called a pericyte,
which also inhabits blood-rich tissues like skin and gums.
</P>
<P>
   Pericytes, virtually indistinguishable from fibroblasts, are as
flexible as their counterparts within bone marrow, and may explain
how Bhatnagar's findings seemingly throw the developmental process
into reverse. ``We don't know that you can take one type of tissue
cell and get it to back up,'' Kaplan said. ``In the cases that have
been looked at with some rigor, that isn't how it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bhatnagar said his years of experimenting left him certain
that it was the fibroblasts that were changing their properties,
and as he publishes more findings he is convincing a growing number
of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   His work with fibroblasts began in the late 1980s. Bhatnagar
sent his graduate students to the university's medical clinic,
where they collected the discarded foreskins of just-circumcised
babies. Then he extracted the fibroblasts and placed them on a
matrix that closely mimicked the properties of bone.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by minerals, held fast by P-15, a string of sticky
amino acids that allowed them to interact, the skin cells conformed
to the new environment as if they always belonged there. Within
three weeks, the cells began producing proteins found only in bone.
The same was done with more fibroblasts, this time from gum tissue,
with the same results.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers packed fibroblasts tightly together and
deprived them of oxygen, imitating the conditions of cartilage.
Once again, the cells responded, as if they knew the lines of
different characters and delivered them as soon as the set was
changed. ``They completely forgot how to be skin cells,'' said
Bhatnagar. ``We played mind games with the cells. We made them
think of home.''

THE SIMPLE CHARM OF CHESTNUT STREET

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The appeal of San Francisco lies in the fact
that its many parts produce such a delightful sum. More than a
city, it is confederation of neighborhoods, each with a distinct
sense and soul.
</P>
<P>
   One such region is Chestnut Street, a five-block stretch of
simplicity, charm and funk in the Marina district, tucked neatly
between the Presidio and Fisherman's Wharf. Chances are, you've
passed very near to it without being aware of its existence. It
lies parallel to Lombard Street, which serves northbound Highway
101 traffic on what for many is a hell-bent dash toward the Golden
Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, slow down, turn off and explore a tiny San Francisco
neighborhood that is as comfortable as an old bedroom slipper. No
tourist promenade this. It is a working street, with an independent
grocery store, two ancient movie theaters, several Chinese-run
laundries and dry cleaners, even a shoe-repair shop that appears to
be stubbornly resisting the digital revolution (its shelves are
stacked with old cardboard boxes holding laces, heels, soles).
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, there are small eateries and coffee houses _ most
with sidewalk tables _ that have no affiliation with any national
chains.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll along Chestnut between Divisadero and Fillmore,
you might notice that the crowd seems primarily composed of
neighborhood residents, and there is almost a European feel to the
place. Planter boxes brim with flowers on the sidewalk and
second-story window ledges. An elegantly dressed lady was seen
guiding two yappy dogs on leashes into the Pottery Barn (OK, there
are a few chain outlets), and nobody so much as blinked. In a
convenience store early one morning, not only was the TV off, but
the shop was filled with the gentle strains of Mozart's Piano
Concerto No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great place to browse through shops or catch a bite to
eat. Or both. A few of the highlights (Chestnut Street addresses in
parentheses):
</P>
<P>
   Earthsake (2076) is a narrow, deep, airy shop with an impressive
selection of untreated fabrics in linens, clothing and bedding
items. It also stocks an eclectic supply of greeting cards, candles
and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of enormous, impersonal Staples and Office Depot
outlets, it's encouraging to find an independent stationery store,
Kimmel's (2144), with about 10 feet of street frontage _ but,
somehow, carrying just about everything you'd require.
</P>
<P>
   The Marina Super grocery store (2323) displays its produce in
bins on the sidewalk. It also has a butcher shop. And when was the
last time you encountered a market that promised free delivery?
</P>
<P>
   Mathray's Flowers (2395) also makes maximal use of the sidewalk,
exhibiting many of its colorful and pleasantly scented wares there.
</P>
<P>
   Books Inc. (2251) is part of a small Bay Area chain of a
half-dozen stores. The rear quarter of this store is devoted
entirely to children's books, its walls colorfully painted in
cartoon characters. The shop also carries a selection of
international newspapers and features a great number of books on
cooking, gardening and travel.
</P>
<P>
   You might wonder how Frank's Shoe Service (2412) can subsist
entirely on replacing worn heels or securing loose luggage straps,
but a sign in the window offers a clue: The proprietor bills
himself as an expert on Birkenstock sandals. In this corner of the
Bay Area, that probably means he'll be able to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut Street also features several inviting cafes, delis and
coffee houses. Don't be surprised, however, if cash is the only
form of payment accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove (2250), a popular locals hangout, is a friendly place
to stop for morning coffee or breakfast _ and it will keep you out
of a cookie-cutter Starbucks down the street. The Grove offers six
different gourmet coffee drinks daily. Be advised that the
breakfast menu leans heavily toward vegetarian items.
</P>
<P>
   For heartier fare at breakfast or lunch, it's hard to beat
Judy's Cafe (2268). The portions are substantial and diverse,
including a breakfast scramble featuring smoked salmon, Bermuda
onions and cream cheese. Andale Taqueria (2150) can also attack a
robust appetite with its mesquite-grill Mexican items.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for sandwiches for a picnic on the grounds of
the Presidio, the best option is probably Lucca Delicatessen
(2120), an Old World deli that is worth a stop just for the rich
smells within. &QL;

  Hollywood Bowl expands program 
to accommodate more world music 
(For use after Tues., June 20, 2000 by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On that fateful day in 1963 when he first heard John Coltrane's
``India,'' Tom Schnabel suddenly realized there was more to popular
music than do-wop and surfer ditties.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane's music ``was putting me into a trance state,''
Schnabel writes in ``Rhythm Planet,'' his highly readable 1998
collection of essays on world music makers.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforward, the Palisades High School student was ``on a
journey, a search for something deeper than what my life as a
middle-class adolescent in a Southern California suburb had to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years later, Schnabel's polyglot musical tastes
have helped refashion those of his once-provincial hometown. As the
former host of KCRW-FM's groundbreaking ``Morning Becomes
Eclectic'' from 1979 to 1989, and now host of the station's popular
weekend program ``Cafe L.A.,'' Schnabel has introduced many
Angelenos to such globally far-flung performers as Youssou N'Dour,
Caetano Veloso and Angelique Kidjo. He has also produced several
world music CD compilations, taught world music at UCLA and
consulted on several motion picture soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Schnabel has another bully pulpit for proselytizing the
polyrhythmic gospel.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, the Hollywood Bowl will launch its 79th
season with the first of six ``World Music'' concerts programmed by
Schnabel and sponsored by KCRW. Dubbed ``Fiery Flamenco,'' the
concert will explore various global permutations of Spain's
propulsive dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Bowl's inaugural ``World Festival 1999'' drew
50,000 listeners to hear acts like Tex-Mex accordion master Flaco
Jimenez, superstar Celtic fiddler Natalie MacMaster (who returns
here July 30) and Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, heir apparent to the
late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, king of Pakistan's Sufi devotional
singers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two seasons, the addition of ``World Festival,''
and an eight-concert jazz series headlined by L.A.'s
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, have substantially altered the
Bowl's cultural topography.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but steadily, the venue's longtime diet of classical and
pops, served by white-coated musicians to the wicker-hamper crowd,
has given way to a funkier, more wide-ranging musical smorgasbord.
Just as the Beach Boys' wistful harmonies no longer exclusively
define the Southern California sound, the Bowl has come to reflect
the rapidly mutating tastes of the diverse city that encircles it.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is not the same place I grew up in the '50s and the
1960s, and I think it's better,'' says Schnabel, who's been
appointed program manager of world music for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Association. ``I think a more multicultural society is
(more stimulating) than one where everybody is sort of like someone
in a Henrik Ibsen play.''
</P>
<P>
   For world music aficionados, this summer is shaping up as one of
L.A.'s richest ever. The Bowl's six subscription concerts offer
intriguing pairings of established and lesser-known artists. Many
trace their overlapping musical bloodlines to the mass exodus of
native Africans to the New World.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Global Divas,'' a July 16 concert hosted by
current ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' frontman Nic Harcourt, links
South African song empress Miriam Makeba with Albita, the
androgynous platinum-blond avatar of classic Cuban !ital!guajiras
</P>
<P>
   and !italsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiery Flamenco'' combines French gypsy guitarist Thierry
``Titi'' Robin-Gitans with Del Monte Flamenco/Anjani's Kathak, a
troupe that melds Moorish-influenced Spanish dance and kathak, the
classical dance form favored by the Rajastan court of India. A
separate, non-subscription Bowl concert on July 1, ``Tropical
Serenades,'' showcases Grammy-winning, falsetto-voiced Brazilian
Milton Nascimento alongside Juan-Carlos Formell's supple guitar
evocations of his Cuban homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Other world music attractions playing L.A. this summer include
the great South African jazz-pop horn player Hugh Masekela, June 29
at the California Plaza Watercourt downtown; the Jewish-fusion
ensemble the Klezmatics, July 9 at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre
in Hollywood; and a free Aug. 24 zydeco double bill at the Santa
Monica Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Want more ululating vocalists and swinging reggae-sambaists? You
may want to book ahead for the Bowl's Aug. 2 jazz series concert
profiling Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes and his quartet. Even this
past weekend's Playboy Jazz Festival had a distinctly Latin flavor.
</P>
<P>
   David Prather, an actor who's in his fourth year of hosting the
annual kid-oriented ``Open House at the Hollywood Bowl,'' thinks
world music has helped fill a kind of spiritual void in mainstream
Western pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the pop music in America has been either just
innocuous on one level or nihilistic,'' Prather says, ``and you
listen to your basic salsa or South African music and it's so
vibrant, so positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bowl is suddenly turning its back on its
traditional pops and classical constituency in favor of ``world
music,'' a dubious moniker that's been applied to everything from
Congolese rumba to Celtic pop.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Bowl's 70 performance events between June and September,
29 are pops concerts, 25 are classical, nine are jazz-oriented and
seven are world music. The Bowl's prime Friday and Saturday night
slots are reserved for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its pops
counterpart, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But after drawing 50,000 total listeners last summer, when it
was lumped in with Sunday-night pops concerts, world music has been
granted its own separate subscription series this season. Patricia
Mitchell, chief operating officer of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
Association, says her organization is still testing the depth of
local interest in the catch-all world genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year does not a trend make,'' Mitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   However, anecdotal evidence and solid box-office numbers
convinced the Philharmonic to continue the series begun last year
under departed Philharmonic executive vice president and managing
director Willem Wijnbergen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have only to go through Tower Records and see the
expanding world music section to see there's a tremendous interest
in world music and in world music marketing,'' says Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Wijnbergen's mysterious and abrupt departure from the
Philharmonic last June, after only 15 months on the job, raised
questions about the long-term outlook for jazz and world music at
the Bowl, two of the Dutch-born administrator's pet projects.
(Wijnbergen has declined to speak with reporters since leaving the
organization.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schnabel believes that ``the Bowl still has its heart'' in
world music.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, evidence abounds that Los Angeles has reached a
critical mass of world music culture and appreciation. Relatively
new clubs like the Conga Room in the Mid-Wilshire District
regularly pack the floor with salsa and samba devotees. Schnabel
credits outgoing UCLA Performing Arts director Michael Blachly with
helping to popularize world music here through his support of
artists like Cesaria Evora, Zap Mama and Baaba Maal.
</P>
<P>
   Schnabel also points to the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival as a
local world beat watershed, when innovative avant-gardists like
Peter Sellars gave Angelenos ``a big taste of maybe something we
weren't even ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was sort of a turning point in terms of exposure to some
really new stuff,'' Schnabel says, ``and I think that the lesson
was not lost on presenters.''
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, world music's rising commercial profile is
evidenced by the mass-market appeal of pop stars like Ricky Martin
as well as the astonishing crossover success of Buena Vista Social
Club.
</P>
<P>
   As global culture grows into a vital two-way exchange _ not
simply a cliched cross-pollination of ``Third World primitivism''
with Western technological know-how _ Schnabel believes that
Americans' cultural attitudes are becoming much more cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Until relatively recently, he said, ``People didn't travel as
much, people didn't have the curiosity about Sufism or the Dalai
Lama, America was so kind of insular and in love with itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Schnabel says, ``People are getting acupuncture and reading
Rumi (the 13th-century mystic poet Jalaluddin Rumi) and Deepak
Chopra. They're so much more receptive to different ways of seeing
things. I think that's part of the reason for the acceptance of
world music.''

&HT;     COURT BANS STUDENT-LED PRAYERS BEFORE FOOTBALL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Strictly upholding the wall between church and
state, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that a Texas school district
violated the Constitution when it allowed a student to lead prayers
before high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   In a sweeping, 6-3 decision, the court said that by granting the
student the right to use the school's public address system to
speak to a large gathering at a school-sponsored event, the local
board of education gave preferential treatment to a particular
religious viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible''
because it tells ``nonadherents'' in the audience ``that they are
outsiders, not full members of the political community, and (it
sends) an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders,
favored members of the political community,'' Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delivery of such a message _ over the school's public
address system by a speaker representing the student body, under
the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school policy
that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer _ is not
properly characterized as private speech,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the Constitution ... prohibits any public school
student from voluntarily praying at any time before, during or
after the school day. But the religious liberty protected by the
Constitution is abridged when the state affirmatively sponsors the
particular religious practice of prayer,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Bagenstos, a Harvard law professor, noted that the ruling
strongly reaffirmed the court's 1962 landmark decision banning
organized school prayer. ``This decision is consistent with the
court's traditional stance of keeping a pretty high wall between
church and state,'' Bagenstos added.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' last major ruling on school prayer came in 1992.
In that decision, the court, by a slim 5-to-4 vote, barred
clergy-led prayers, invocations and benedictions at public school
graduation ceremonies.Monday's ruling _ which comes as many school
districts around the country are considering ways to allow prayer
in public schools _ should give officials more precise instructions
on how to avoid the constitutional minefield in church-state
relations, Bagenstos said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of school prayer denounced the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who had filed a brief urging the
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court to uphold such student-led prayer, said, ``I
support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all students to
express their faith freely and participate in voluntary student-led
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Vice President Al Gore, also running for president,
</P>
<P>
   had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jan LaRue, a spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, a
Washington-based conservative group, said, ``Allowing students to
speak about their faith in public in their own words does not
create a government endorsement of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of school prayer hailed the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision signals a reaffirmation of the
appropriate role of religion in public schools _ one in which
private religious expression is constitutionally protected, but
officially sanctioned religious observances are not,'' said David
Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, a New
York City-based civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas case began in 1995 when the Santa Fe Independent
School District, located near Galveston, was sued by two families,
one Catholic and one Mormon, who objected to the policy of letting
students elect a classmate as ``chaplain'' to lead prayers at
graduation ceremonies and home football games.
</P>
<P>
   After their lawsuit was filed, the policy was changed. Under the
new rules, the student body each year elected a student to deliver
a ``message or invocation'' before the home games and at graduation
ceremonies. It was up to the elected invocation leader to decide
whether to deliver a prayer or other more general, inspirational
comments.
</P>
<P>
   The school district maintained that the election and the
invocation leader's choice in selecting the content insulated the
district from impermissible entanglement in promoting religious
conduct. Instead, they argued, any prayer led by the invocation
leader is protected free speech that the courts are powerless to
block.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the
case that students had to keep their graduation-ceremony comments
and prayers ``nonsectarian and non-proselytizing.'' The court also
decided that the student-led prayers at high school football game
were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   School officials appealed both parts of that ruling, but the
Supreme Court focused Monday only on the football game issue,
passing up the graduation-ceremony dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, in upholding the ban on any student-led prayer before
the games, said the court recognizes ``the important role that
public worship plays in many communities, as well as the sincere
desire to include public prayer as a part of various occasions so
as to mark those occasions' significance.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``Such religious activity in public schools, as
elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who wrote the dissenting
opinion supported by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas,
said the majority ruling ``bristles with hostility to all things
religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said the school's policy of allowing students the
right to vote for a representative to speak before the games and
then allowing that representative the freedom to choose the subject
of the speech meant that the district never ``endorsed or
encouraged'' prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, who represented the Santa Fe school district in
arguments last March before the high court, said the ruling ``will
interject additional confusion into the area of protected religious
expression in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven R. Shapiro, legal director of the New York-based
American Civil Liberties Union, said the Court's decision affirmed
the principle that the Constitution does not allow school officials
to hold elections to decide whether and when students should pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ruling should effectively put an end to so-called
student-initiated prayer at all school sponsored events, including
graduation,'' he added.

<P>
   Probably the most useful piece of travel advice I was ever given
was: ``Never pack anything you have to plug in, iron or worry about
losing.'' Probably the second-best was: ``Every glass of `free'
mint tea you drink in a Moroccan carpet shop will end up costing
you $600.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of us has a few nuggets of hard-won road wisdom, perhaps
half-forgotten and languishing in some dusty corners of our minds.
As we pull out our suitcases in preparation for summer adventures,
I asked some fellow travelers to share their best advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just landed in a strange city and want to find a great
restaurant? Tell your taxi driver, `Take me to where you would go

in Ireland, a dog dish in the Philippines, a Dutch cap in
England.''

smaller the plane.''

to Rio de Janeiro to be 19 hours late because of a snowstorm in
Japan, you haven't traveled much.''

cheap.''
</P>

mind. On the other hand, Joyce's `Ulysses' is a great guide to
Dublin.''

   ``If, as Nelson Algren once said, you should never eat at a

   RADIO-TOPMARKET _ ATLANTA _ Traffic jams, a shortage of radio
stations, and advertisers with fat wallets have something in
common. They are making Atlanta's fragmented radio market
especially attractive to broadcasters trying to control more of the
dial. ``Atlanta is the radio beachfront property. It's not unusual
to pay a premium for it,'' says John Hogan, an Atlanta-based senior
vice president for Clear Channel Communications. One of his
competitors -- Cox Radio, which already operates five of Atlanta's
15 top stations -- recently signed a deal to acquire fourth-ranked
Kiss 104.7. The station's $280 million price tag apparently is the
highest ever paid in Atlanta, competing broadcasters say. (Kempner,

   RADIO-TOPMARKET _ ATLANTA _ Traffic jams, a shortage of radio
stations, and advertisers with fat wallets have something in
common. They are making Atlanta's fragmented radio market
especially attractive to broadcasters trying to control more of the
dial. ``Atlanta is the radio beachfront property. It's not unusual
to pay a premium for it,'' says John Hogan, an Atlanta-based senior
vice president for Clear Channel Communications. One of his
competitors -- Cox Radio, which already operates five of Atlanta's
15 top stations -- recently signed a deal to acquire fourth-ranked
Kiss 104.7. The station's $280 million price tag apparently is the
highest ever paid in Atlanta, competing broadcasters say. (Kempner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

NANCY MARCHAND, CHARACTER ACTRESS OF STAGE AND SCREEN, DIES AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
  By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled
at playing wise and imperious authority figures _ newspaper
publishers, queens and mesdames _ and who achieved perhaps her
greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss in the
television series ``The Sopranos,'' died on Sunday at her home in
Stratford, Conn., one day short of her 72nd birthday. She also had
a home in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   According to her daughter Katie Sparer Bowe, no specific cause
of death was given, but for several years the actress had been
suffering from cancer and chronic pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
   A wide diversity of playwrights _ among them Chekhov, Shaw and
Shakespeare as well as Jean Genet, Paul Osborn and A.R. Gurney _
was within Marchand's range. She once described her physical
presence as ``a strange combination of being very imposing and
down-to-earth,'' an accurate assessment of the seemingly
contradictory image she projected.
</P>
<P>
   That description could be applied to the overburdened wife she
played in the 1980 Broadway revival of Osborn's ``Morning's at
Seven,'' her patrician publisher on the long-running ``Lou Grant''
television series and her portrayal of Livia Soprano, the monster
mother of them all, a woman bred into the Mafia who without a blink
of hesitation sets up her son, Tony, to be assassinated because he
has moved her to a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Except for her indomitability, Livia was in direct contrast to
all the ``tasteful ladies'' Marchand played in her busy career. At
70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new
popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic
character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of
Caligula's mother in ``I Claudius,'' a woman also named Livia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her career, Marchand gave her roles an unexpected
edge. Even when her characters were at their most officious, they
retained a measure of charm, and her more affectionate characters
could also be sardonic. She was an expert at both light and more
serious comedy, moving effortlessly from the outrageous antics in
the movie spoof, ``The Naked Gun,'' to Lady Bracknell in ``The
Importance of Being Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   In plays like ``Morning's at Seven,'' she warmed an audience's
collective heart, but she never wore her own heart on her sleeve,
avoiding the cul de sac of sentimentality. Instead she was wily in
performance, turning in an instant from comedy to poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Often she acted on stage with her husband, Paul Sparer _ in
everything from ``A Phoenix Too Frequent'' by Christopher Fry to
Edward Albee's ``Delicate Balance'' to Gurney's ``Love Letters.''
Sparer also had his own rewarding career in plays that included
Elie Wiesel's ``Zalmen or the Madness of God'' and ``The Burnt
Flowerbed'' by Ugo Betti.
</P>
<P>
   Sparer died in December. In addition to her daughter Katie, an
actress who lives in Stratford, Marchand is survived by a son,
David of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Rachel Sparer Bersier, an
opera singer of New York City; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Marchand was the reverse of so many of her
strong-willed characters, a woman with a natural sense of
insecurity, someone who felt uneasy in social situations. ``I'm
always very uncomfortable with people.''she once explained in an
interview in The New York Times. ``It's something that I get upset
with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And
when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe.
There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't
use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can
experience and share when I'm on a stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Her roles, she said, were more a question of chance than choice.
But whatever she was called on to do, even if it meant being as
malevolent as Livia Soprano, she did it with enthusiasm. As always,
she was captivated by her profession. Looking back on her career,
she said, ``Acting was something I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand was born in Buffalo, N.Y., on June 19, 1928.
After studying theater at Carnegie Institute of Technology in
Pittsburgh, she made her first professional appearance on stage in
1946 in ``The Late George Apley'' in Ogunquit, Maine. It was while
acting in Shakespeare and Shaw at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge,
Mass., that she met _ and then married _ Sparer. When they moved to
New York, she appeared on live television, playing Jo in a
dramatization of ``Little Women,'' and then playing the female lead
opposite Rod Steiger in the original television version of Paddy
Chayefsky's ``Marty.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, she made her Broadway debut in ``Miss Isobel,'' and two
years later won an Obie award for her role as Madame Irma in the
Off Broadway premiere of Genet's ``The Balcony.'' For several years
she played leading Shakespearean roles with the American
Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. As an original member of
the APA, she was Lady Sneerwell in ``The School for Scandal,''
Arkadina in ``The Seagull,'' Dona Ana in ``Man and Superman'' and
other classic characters.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing her devotion to repertory theater, she joined the
theater at Lincoln Center to act in plays by Schiller (Queen
Elizabeth in ``Mary Stuart''), Gorky and Sean O'Casey (``The Plough
and the Stars'' with Jack MacGowran).
</P>
<P>
   Marchand worked with equal ease on Broadway, Off Broadway and in
regional theater, as well as in movies and on television. In the
1980s she played the title role in Christopher Durang's ``Sister
Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' Bessie Berger in Clifford
Odets' ``Awake and Sing'' at Circle in the Square, Klytemnestra in
Ezra Pound's ``Elektra'' and the august mother in ``The Cocktail
Hour'' by Gurney.
</P>
<P>
   In the following decade, she moved on to Jon Robin Baitz's ``End
of the Day'' at Playwrights Horizons, and, in 1993, acted in a
double header of Peter Shaffer plays, ``Black Comedy'' and ``White
Liars'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. That same year she also
played the wicked stepmother in a revival of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Cinderella'' at the New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Her movie appearances included ``The Hospital,'' two films with
the team of Merchant Ivory, ``The Bostonians'' and ``Jefferson in
Paris,'' and the remake of ``Sabrina,'' in which she played
Harrison Ford's mother. When she played Mrs. Pynchon, the publisher
of The Los Angeles Tribune on ``Lou Grant,'' the role became a
keystone of her career; she won four Emmy awards for the role. Some
years later on television's ``Spearfield's Daughter,'' she switched
cities and became the publisher of The New York Courier.

</P>
<P>
   When Marchand played Livia Soprano on ``The Sopranos,''
television viewers wondered how her son, Tony, played by James
Gandolfini, and his wife (Edie Falco) could put up with her malice
and her prejudices. The answer, of course, was that there was
nothing much they could do against this self-dramatizing force of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show's first season, Tony was about to smother
his mother with a pillow, but a stroke got there first and she was
left gasping for breath in a hospital bed. David Chase, the creator
of the Home Box Office series, said Monday that he had always
planned to bring Livia back for a second year. He added that he was
impressed by Marchand's courage as she continued to perform despite
her illness.
</P>
<P>
   When that season ended, Marchand said she was looking forward to
the second round: ``Who knows what lurks in the mind of Livia?''
Viewers soon found out: more of the same.

   During the last show of the second season, there was a sudden
twist in the narrative. Tony gave his mother airline tickets so
that she and his aunt could fly to Arizona. Before she could get on
the plane, Livia was stopped by men from airport security. The
tickets were stolen property. Frantically, she telephoned her son.
</P>
<P>
   Because filming on the third season of ``Sopranos'' is not
scheduled to begin until Aug. 1, that scene represents Marchand's
final appearance: about to be arrested and furious at Tony for
putting her in that predicament. Chase would not discuss
forthcoming events in the series, but if the actress had lived,
undoubtedly the mother-and-son battle would have continued and
Livia Soprano would have had the last word.

   HEARTLAND-ILLINOIS _ Summer in Illinois means heat. Sun baked
farmers worry about drought. Sweaty Chicagoans crank their air
conditioners during the first steam bath, then wait for the city's
electrical distribution system to overload and crash. Cubs fans
grouse about beer sales being cut off in the sixth inning at
Wrigley Field. This year's heat will create a torpid calm before a
political storm. Illinois is among a handful of states predicted to
hold the key to the White House in this year's presidential
election. Its huge, ancestral Democratic clubs of Chicago are
evenly offset by its suburban and downstate voters whose inborn
conservativism dates to the days of the prairie schooner and helped
spawn the Republican party. And then there is the Peoria factor.
The phrase ``does it play in Peoria,'' is shorthand for whether an
idea will get support from the nation's vast political middle. That
middle ground _ found in Peoria as well as places like Dayton,
Ohio, Midland, Mich. and Allentown, Pa., _ is where many expect the
White House to be won or lost. (Bebbington, Dayton Daily News). 60.

to pay a premium for it,'' says John Hogan, an Atlanta-based senior

SIDESTEPPING HORMONE REPLACEMENT WITH NATURAL ALTERNATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Mass., Ind., Germany, Japan)  (The Science Times) 
 By LAURIE TARKAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When women reach menopause, many struggle with the decision of
whether to take hormone replacement therapy. It often comes down to
weighing the compelling benefits against the disturbing drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are relief of symptoms like hot flashes and
insomnia as well as a lowered risk of osteoporosis and of high
cholesterol. (Until recently, many doctors believed that hormone
replacement therapy also reduces risk of heart disease, but that
finding has now been questioned.) The drawbacks, most notably, are
an increased risk of blood clots and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of postmenopausal women, however, are trying to
sidestep the decision altogether by choosing a third route. They
have turned to ``natural'' alternatives to hormone replacement,
including foods and herbal supplements containing plant estrogens,
phytoestrogens, which have estrogen-like effects when taken by
humans. They are also using creams made with the hormone
progesterone, and cocktails made up of vitamins, minerals and
herbs. At low doses, most experts say, most of these natural
remedies are probably safe. But they worry that some women are
being overzealous in their self-treatment and taking supplements in
unsafe doses.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern is for women with estrogen-dependent breast
cancer. They are advised not to take hormone replacement because
the estrogen in it may feed breast cancers, but some are taking
large doses of these phytoestrogens that may be just as harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is how women are not willing to go on hormone
replacement therapy, but willing to go on a supplemental medicine,
without any information but hearsay that it's safe,'' said Dr.
William Helferich, an associate professor of nutrition at the
University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of supplements for menopause have risen greatly in recent
years. In 1999, sales of soy isoflavones, the phytoestrogen in soy,
rose to $21 million in supermarkets and drug stores, more than
triple 1998 sales. Sales for all in-one menopausal formulas were
$36.20 million last year, an increase of 197 percent, according to
Spins and ACNielsen, market research firms. Sales of other popular
herbs used to treat symptoms of menopause, like black cohosh,
flaxseed, red clover, dong quai and wild yam, are also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Eating soy and their isoflavones are the most popular natural
way to increase estrogen. Soy has estrogenic properties, and like
hormone replacement, appears to lower cholesterol and reduce bone
loss in postmenopausal women, though studies have not shown that it
reduces hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies suggest that soy foods may prevent cancers. This
research, largely based on population surveys, has found that women
in Japan, who eat a lot of soy, also have a low incidence of breast
cancer, although the relationship is far from proven.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory and animal studies have found conflicting results,
with some studies finding that soy isoflavones act as anticancer
agents and others finding that the isoflavones may promote some
breast tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be that isoflavones do both. Some scientists
theorize that when eaten early in life, as in Japan, foods with soy
in them may help prevent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it may be protective in young women is that the
phytoestrogens may hasten the maturation of breast cells, and once
they're mature, they're less susceptible to the effects of
carcinogens,'' said Dr. Margo Woods, associate professor of
medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, who specializes in
diet, hormones and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Soy, when added to the estrogen that is normally present in
young women, may make breast cells mature at a much faster rate and
protect against cancer. However, researchers believe that girls who
menstruate early, and also are exposed to added estrogen, are not
similarly protected, because without soy, levels of estrogen are
too low to help mature breast cells.
</P>
<P>
   But many American women are introducing soy into the diet late
in life, or are bypassing the tofu and going directly to
supplements that contain concentrated doses of soy protein or
isoflavones. This high-level, late-in-life intake, these scientists
say, may promote cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wise to use soy foods, like soy milk and tofu, in
moderate amounts in your diet,'' said Dr. Sadja Greenwood, an
assistant clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the
University of California at San Francisco. ``But to use the
isolated soy proteins or the isolated isoflavone pills is very
unwise, as we don't know the effects of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Isoflavones are a hundred to a thousand times less potent than
the estrogen used in hormone replacement, but one can easily
consume hundreds of times more of them in the supplements on the
market _ far more than what Japanese women consume. Some capsules
contain as much as 500 milligrams of isoflavones, while the average
daily intake in Japan is 25 to 50 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   Proving most promising for relieving hot flashes is black
cohosh, an herb long used in American Indian cultures and studied
in Germany for more than 50 years. It is the most thoroughly
studied herb for treating symptoms of menopause, and research has
found it fairly effective against hot flashes, mood changes and
vaginal dryness, said Dr. Varro E. Tyler, professor emeritus of
pharmacognosy at Purdue University. It may be the safest too. No
studies have found any known phytoestrogens in the herb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it works _ it may have unknown
phytoestrogens or it may work in some other way to reduce hot
flashes,'' said Dr. Fredi Kronenberg, director of the Richard and
Hinda Rosenthal Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the jury is still out whether this is OK for women
with breast cancer or not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, black cohosh, like other supplements, is being sold in
higher and higher doses in the United States, encouraging women to
consume more than what has been used in traditional cultures.
Capsules today contain as much as 250 milligrams; in Germany, where
herbal remedies are regulated, the recommended dose is 40. And in
Germany, women are advised not to take it for more than six months,
because there are no long-term studies.

&HT;     RICHARDSON TAKES THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scrub Energy Secretary Bill Richardson as a
potential running mate for Vice President Al Gore this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, really. Richardson is a smart politician with a
big heart. He is an energetic campaigner and a jolly soul spilling
over with the warm comradery that Gore can't seem to muster.
</P>
<P>
   But public figures with the whiff of scandal about them do not
get named to national presidential tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The security problems that have surfaced at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory are not Richardson's fault. But the controversy
happened on his watch, and Republicans are determined to hold him
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopee! Another Clinton administration scandal to hype just
when earlier ones were petering out.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP senators promptly called for Richardson's head after
it was discovered that two computer hard drives containing secret
data on nuclear weapons were missing at Los Alamos for weeks. They
were recently found tucked behind a copying machine under murky and
alarming circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   (Maybe there's a poltergeist around. Remember how Hillary
Clinton's long-lost law firm billing records mysteriously appeared
one day on a White House table? No one has yet acknowledged having
a hand in either the disappearance or the amazing recovery.)
</P>
<P>
   The call for Richardson's resignation is a predictable political
response. But even the Republicans seem more interested in throwing
mud on the administration than in actually forcing Richardson out.
</P>
<P>
   Sen Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, launched a campaign to make Richardson
the poster boy for every security breach that has popped up lately.
This includes missing documents at the State Department and CIA,
with which Richardson has absolutely no connection.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott agreed: ``There's a pattern in
this administration of laxity on security,'' he said ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Security issues are complicated by the fact that they are of
necessity surrounded by secrecy. The details that surface publicly
are seldom the whole story. But in politics facts often matter less
than the appearance of things. And it appears that officials are
entirely too careless with information that may harm our interests
if it falls into what is euphemistically called ``the wrong
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's basic problem is that he overpromised and his
department didn't deliver. Last year scary allegations were made
that scientist Wen Ho Lee had stolen nuclear secrets from the lab
to give to China. The affair created quite a stink although Lee has
not been charged with espionage and the allegations against him
remain unproven.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Richardson stoutly shouldered all responsibility
for lab security and promised that he had made policy changes to
henceforth protect national secrets. Now he looks like a braggart
who is all hat and no cattle.
</P>
<P>
   In this, Richardson is not alone. Most administrations have
sheltered Cabinets containing lots of proven braggarts. There are
worse things.
</P>
<P>
   But as the campaign season's hot new Republican target,
Richardson would poison the Democratic ticket. Gore will look
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, weighed in on the issue
to blame the administration for ``confusion and chaos'' at Los
Alamos. But security laxity may be an awkward issue for him.
</P>
<P>
   His father's administration established the current relaxed
attitude toward handling ``secret'' data with new rules that
reduced safeguards previously in place. The looser accounting
procedures were not supposed to affect material classified ``top
secret,'' but such distinctions are known to become blurred.
</P>
<P>
   The information on the formerly missing Los Alamos hard drives
was classified ``secret'' rather than ``top secret'' even though
they contained data on the wiring and design of U.S., Russian and
other nuclear warheads that could be used by terrorists. In the
aftermath of the Lee case, an internal debate has raged among
security experts about whether to reclassify certain sensitive
information. The debate remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is conducting a criminal probe into the missing hard
drives and is focusing on a few scientists who gave contradictory
answers on polygraph tests. This story will go on for some time,
and Richardson will be forever tarnished even if it turns out the
discs were simply misplaced by accident with no intention of
spying.
</P>
<P>
   We non-scientists aren't experts on what exactly it is that goes
on at Los Alamos and other nuclear research centers and how much
secrecy is really necessary. But it's the look of the thing that is
troubling. And it looks bad.

UNDATED: long-term studies.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women are taking a number of other phytoestrogens, like dong
quai, red clover and flaxseed to relieve hot flashes, but there is
little research on their effectiveness and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dong quai has been used in combination with other herbs in
traditional Chinese medicine to treat hot flashes, but many
Americans are taking it alone, though one controlled study found it
ineffective on its own. Red clover, a potent phytoestrogen, has not
been used to treat menopause symptoms in traditional cultures, so
little is known about its safety and effectiveness. Flaxseeds are
even less studied.
</P>
<P>
   Those women hoping to lower their risk of heart disease by
taking phytoestrogens may want to reconsider the strategy. Two
recent studies challenge the long-held belief that taking estrogen
protects against heart disease. One study found that undergoing
hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progestin (a form of
the hormone progesterone) for four years failed to lower the risk
of heart attacks in women who already had heart disease. A second
study that measured the arteries of women with heart disease found
that taking hormones did not slow the buildup of cholesterol in
their arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are taking high doses of these phytoestrogens also
need to consider their risks for endometrial cancer, a cancer of
the uterine lining. More than two decades ago, a form of
progesterone was added to the estrogen in hormone replacement
therapy, because taking estrogen alone was found to increase the
risk of this cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So should women taking phytoestrogens also be taking
progesterone? ``We just don't know,'' said Kronenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Some women use creams derived from plants like wild yams, which
some have thought acted like progesterone, to try to counter the
risk. But in fact, wild yams have been found neither to relieve
symptoms of menopause nor prevent endometrial cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the yam scam,'' said Tyler. Wild yams can be
converted to progesterone in the laboratory, but not so in the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Taking vitamin E is another approach to alleviating hot flashes.
Studies have found some minor benefits when women take high doses _
about 800 International Units, known as IU's. (A recent report from
the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of
Sciences, warned that higher does of Vitamin E could be harmful.)
</P>
<P>
   Many women have turned to the all-in-one menopausal pills, which
seem to contain low doses of every supplement and herb that has
ever been used in the same sentence with the word ``woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting subtherapeutic doses of everything in these
capsules, but we don't know if subtherapeutic A plus subtherapeutic
B equals an effect, or if it's useless because it's not enough of
anything,'' Kronenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Postmenopausal women who are worried about their risk of heart
disease and osteoporosis can lower their risks through lifestyle
and diet. To minimize bone loss, postmenopausal women are advised
to do weight-bearing exercise and take calcium and vitamin D
supplements. To lower risk of heart disease, women should exercise,
not smoke, keep weight in the normal range and eat a healthy diet.

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Penninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided Penninsula,

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ There are reportedly more

prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along
and bear witness to one of these exchanges at the Kosovo-Serbia
border to tell the story of these families being reunited. (Coker,

&HT;     COURT RULES THAT MASSACHUSETTS CAN'T HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that only the president can make U.S.
foreign policy, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that
Massachusetts overstepped its authority when it used economic
sanctions to punish the repressive government of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The court voted unanimously to strike down a Massachusetts law
that prevented the commonwealth's government from making purchases
from companies that do business with Myanmar, also known as Burma.
The court ruled that the Massachusetts statute was pre-empted by
the federal government's own sanctions against the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state act is at odds with the president's intended
authority to speak for the United States among the world's nations
in developing a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to bring
democracy to and improve human rights practices and the quality of
life in Burma,'' Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   According to Douglas Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine
University in Malibu, Calif., the court's decision puts into
question dozens of state and local government laws that restrict
business with firms operating in such countries as China, Cuba,
Nigeria and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the courts have the opportunity to take a look at each
state or city law sanctioning foreign governments and to decide if
they infringe on foreign policy,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of such state and local statutes hailed the court's
decision, saying cities and states are making foreign policy
decisions that should be left to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 30 state and local sanction laws are on the books in
states and cities across America (and) it is time for those
jurisdictions to begin the process of rescinding those measures,''
Frank Kittredge, president of the National Foreign Trade Council
(NFTC), a Washington-based business lobby group that was the
successful plaintiff in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights groups said the court's decision will hurt
efforts to stop governments from abusing their citizens and
environments.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was criticized by Nick Penniman, spokesman for the
Alliance for Democracy, a Boston-based human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people of Massachusetts want to use their economy to
punish a dictatorship, they should be allowed to do that,''
Penniman said. Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly called the
ruling ``disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this law addressed basic human rights and allowed the
state to decide with whom it did business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFTC, along with a coalition of 34 firms represented by the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, challenged the Massachusetts law in 1998.
Each of the companies had business ties to Myanmar, which prevented
them from bidding for contracts with the government of
Massachusetts. The NFTC was concerned that ``the mounting patchwork
of state and local sanctions was threatening to seriously hurt U.S.
interest _ while at the same time threatening a coherent U.S.
foreign policy,'' Kittredge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding fathers did not intend for Massachusetts to make
foreign policy,'' he added. Massachusetts enacted the so-called
Myanmar law in 1996 to protest the jailing of Nobel Peace Prize
winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who overwhelmingly won the 1990
presidential election but was never allowed to take the post. The
European Union and Japan also joined the NFTC lawsuit, saying firms
in Britain, Germany or Japan should not be forced to choose between
doing business with Myanmar or Massachusetts. Last June, the First
Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston agreed and struck down the law.
Writing for the appeals court, Judge Sandra L. Lynch said that
while there was no dispute over the ``deplorable'' conditions
imposed by the military government in Myanmar, a state had no
constitutional authority to regulate conduct beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar_ one of the world's poorest countries, according to the
United Nations _ has been ruled for 38 years by a military
dictatorship that has brutally put down several democratic
movements.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Massachusetts argued that
nothing in the Constitution ``requires the states to trade with
dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth attorneys also noted that 23 states and 80 cities
once had laws restricting purchases from firms with interests in
South Africa to protest that country's policy of racial apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in our federal Constitution denies to the states the
right to apply a moral standard to their spending decisions,'' the
commonwealth brief said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday the high court rejected that argument, saying that
the state law made the ``ultimate goal of restoration of democracy
in Burma'' more difficult because it stood as an obstacle to
devising comprehensive, multilateral strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Massachusetts law) compromises the very capacity of the
president to speak for the nation with one voice in dealing with
other governments,'' Souter wrote.

`MACBETH' WILL CLOSE AFTER ONLY 10 DAYS ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. And that's
pretty much it for the Broadway production of Shakespeare's
``Macbeth,'' starring Kelsey Grammer in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the ill-received revival said Monday that they
would close the production on Sunday, five weeks before its planned
closing, after being battered by most of the city's theater
critics.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which opened last Thursday at the Music Box
Theater on West 45th Street, will have played only eight previews
and 13 regular performances, making it one of the shortest runs in
recent years. Having opened just after the Tonys _ officially the
end of the old Broadway season and the start of the new one _
``Macbeth'' also takes its place as both the first show to open in
the 2000-2001 season and the first show of that season to close. It
will have lost some $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The production, staged by the British director Terry Hands,
nearly closed in Boston last month after mixed-to-poor reviews but
continued on to New York after Grammer assured producers that he
would help bear any financial losses they incurred.
</P>
<P>
   But the reviews in New York were no better. Writing in The New
York Times, Ben Brantley called it a ``blunt-witted new
production'' with ``a plodding quality that matches the lumbering
and circular steps with which the actors have been encouraged to
move.'' Other critics were less kind.
</P>
<P>
   In published interviews, Grammer said he knew it was a
professional risk to take on ``Macbeth,'' which is widely
considered one of Shakespeare's most difficult plays and is the
subject of much theatrical mythology. (Superstitious theater
professionals call it ``the Scottish play,'' rather than evoking
the legendary bad luck that seems to follow productions of it.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grammer said he had long wanted to play the role, for
which he was an understudy in a 1981 production at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, at least, his classical credentials did not seem
completely lacking. He attended though he did not graduate from the
Juilliard acting program, and he received good notices for his
performance as Cassio in a 1982 production of ``Othello'' with
James Earl Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With the early closing, however, Grammer's stage credits are
likely to compare unfavorably with his career in television, during
which he created the character of Dr. Frasier W. Crane, the fussy
and fitfully unhappy psychiatrist on the long-running NBC sitcom
``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a regular on that show for 10 years before spinning off
the character into its own successful series, ``Frasier,'' in which
he is still starring on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Monday neither the show's producers nor Grammer would comment on
the early closing, which will probably spare the show further
losses. But perhaps an explanation can be drawn from the play
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were done when 'tis done,'' says Macbeth in Act I,
``then 'twere well it were done quickly.''

 &HT;    NEW PROPOSAL CALLS ON CONGRESS TO APOLOGIZE FOR SLAVERY
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil rights advocates led by Rep. John Lewis on
Monday helped exhume a proposal to have Congress formally apologize
for America's prominent role in slavery, nearly three years after
the first attempt was buried beneath a torrent of hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, D-Ga., signed on as an original co-sponsor of a
resolution that would have Congress apologize ``to
African-Americans on behalf of the people of the United States, for
the wrongs committed against their ancestors who suffered as
slaves...''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would have Congress ``recognize the
nation's need to redress these events.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right thing to do,'' Lewis said. ``It is the fair
thing to do. It is the just thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was written by Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who first
proposed the idea of having Congress apologize for slavery in 1997.
Hall's first attempt didn't raise the issue of ``redress'' or
reparations, which is why Lewis and other black leaders were cool
to the idea three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new resolution, introduced on the ``Juneteenth'' anniversary
that is recognized as the day 135 years ago the last of America's
slaves learned they'd been freed by the Civil War, would create a
commission to study the historical economic impact of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would explore the possibility of creating
scholarships and a national monument to slavery, in addition to
creating a foundation of information that could be used to develop
a plan for reparations. Hall's legislation stops short of seeking
reparations specifically, but does ask Congress to express a
``commitment to rectify misdeeds of slavery done in the past...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I believe there ought to be some kind of
reparation, some kind of restitution,'' Hall said. ``I believe the
apology is only the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do more than ask to be forgiven,'' he said of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And it is that element that drew a contingent of black civil
rights and religious leaders to support the new legislation at a
news conference on the Capitol grounds. While Hall's original
resolution was never formally addressed by the Congressional Black
Caucus, Lewis said Monday a ``great majority'' could be expected to
endorse the new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black folk are tired of words without substance,'' said the
Rev. Mark Pollard, president of the National Common Ground
Coalition in Atlanta, an umbrella organization of religious and
civil rights groups, who spoke at Monday's event.
</P>
<P>
   He said his group consulted with Hall during the drafting stage,
when Hall decided to add a section raising the issue of
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (resolution) is simply a continuation of our goal of
healing the nation,'' Pollard said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Hall agreed, too, that the climate for a resolution on
slavery is better today than it was three years ago. Religious and
civil rights groups have made declarations in support of slavery
apologies, as have a growing number of state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, President Clinton visited Africa on an 11-day state
visit in 1998 that including a dramatic stop at Goree Island off
the coast of Senegal, an infamous way station for slave traders
hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton declined to apologize for America's
involvement in the slave trade, but he did express a regret that
was applauded by many in the black community as a significant
gesture for race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to the time before we were even a nation,'' Clinton
said on that trip, ``European-Americans received the fruits of the
slave trade, and we were wrong in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Monday that President Clinton will leave
the matter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's made perfectly clear how wrong he thinks
slavery was,'' said
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for adoption the new slavery resolution may be no
brighter than the last, despite the new support of black leaders.
The legislation would have to be routed through the House Judiciary
Committee, which has so far refused to take up a separate bill on
reparations offered each year by its highest-ranking Democratic
member, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, who is the
fourth-ranking member in the House and is the GOP's only black
member, said he couldn't comment on the apology legislation because
he hadn't yet seen it. But he seemed open to its potential to help
improve racial tensions in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real reconciliation, real healing is ... about repentance.
Forgiveness,'' Watts said. ``There was a spiritual basis for what
Congressman Hall tried to accomplish here a couple of years ago.''

   SIDE EFFECTS: Cola Is No Boon for Bones, Study Says
</P>
<P>
   Young women dashing about, say, the lacrosse field and then
swilling soda to celebrate victory seems like the kind of image
commonly seen in television commercials. But a new study adds a
jarring note to this scene.
</P>
<P>
   Those girls have a much higher chance of suffering a fractured
bone, especially if their soda of choice is cola, Harvard
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Grace Wyshak, a professor at the School of Public Health,
reported that active girls who drink cola were five times as likely
to have had fractures as were girls who did not drink any soda. The
study appears in this month's Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent
Medicine, and was based on interviews of 460 9th and 10th graders.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wyshak, the study confirms earlier research that
found a link between bone fractures in physically active people and
cola.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors believe that the phosphoric acid in cola drinks is
to blame, because it may affect calcium metabolism and bone mass.
Others cite dietary preferences, with cola replacing the milk that
young people need to develop strong bones.
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Medical Students' Biases Can Begin Early
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have found that medical diagnoses and treatments
are often different depending on whether a patient is black or
white.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at Duke University believe that they have found
evidence that the attitudes that affect the behavior of doctors can
be seen in the earliest stages of a student's medical school
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of The American Journal of Medicine,
researchers said racial and sexual bias surfaced when first- and
second-year students were asked to assess the conditions a black
woman and a white man who they believed were real patients. In
fact, the two were actors using identical scripts.
</P>
<P>
   With the information provided, the medical students should have
been able to diagnose a condition of angina in both ``patients.''
Instead, the white students, who made up 86 percent of the 164
participants in the study, were more likely to diagnosis angina in
the white patient than in the black one. And they were more likely
to rate the white patient's overall health as ``good.'' By
contrast, the minority students in the study made similar
evaluations of the two patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is,'' Dr. Kevin Schulman, the lead author of the
study, said, ``is that behavior that people bring with them to
medical school? Or is this something we're teaching medical
students?''
</P>
<P>
   If students arrive with biases, he said, then medical schools
need to teach them about the pitfalls of making racial assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   AT RISK: Alcohol Heightens Risks of Tobacco Use
</P>
<P>
   Smoking and heavy drinking are two risky behaviors that often go
together. But when combined, it now seems, they play an increased
role in causing a genetic mutation linked to lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is known to produce changes in the tumor-suppressor gene
p53, and to be the major cause of lung cancer. The tobacco-cancer
link is so great that Dr. Steven Ahrendt of the Medical College of
Wisconsin, whose research team sought lung-cancer patients for a
new study, said, ``We had to get 140 just to get 10 nonsmokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy alcohol use, on the other hand, while implicated in some
cancers, has not been tied to p53 mutations.
</P>
<P>
   But the study, published in last week's issue of Cancer
Research, found that regular drinkers who smoked were nearly twice
as likely to have p53 changes as nondrinkers who smoked, and five
times as likely as those who did not smoke or drink.
</P>
<P>
   TIMING: Slower Angioplasties Can Threaten Lives
</P>
<P>
   Emergency angioplasty is a proven way to save the lives of
patients having heart attacks, but two new studies suggest that for
it to be most effective, time is of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   One report, by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
found that for the best survival rate, the procedure should be done
within two hours after a patient arrives at the hospital. The study
looked at more than 27,000 heart attack patients treated at 661
hospitals from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the time period, only about 50 percent met this goal of
less than two hours,'' said Dr. Christopher Cannon, the lead
author. ``So we've got some work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In angioplasty, a balloon is threaded through a patient's
arteries to the heart and then expanded, clearing the blocked
artery so that that blood can resume pumping normally. Angioplasty
can also be done as an elective procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon, who reported his findings in last week's Journal of the
American Medical Association, said that when delays of more than
two hours occurred, the mortality rate rose by 40 to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other study appeared last month in The New England Journal
of Medicine and confirmed the longstanding belief that patients
given emergency angioplasties at hospitals that perform large
numbers of the procedures have lower mortality rates. Patients who
went to high-volume hospitals had a 28 percent lower mortality rate
in the hospital, amounting to two fewer deaths for every 100
patients treated.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing theory holds that surgeons get better with
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead author of the study, Dr. John Canto of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, said researchers had also
found that the failure of smaller hospitals to administer the
angioplasty quickly enough appeared to play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies said that how quickly hospitals can get an
angioplasty in place should considered when doctors weigh whether
to use the balloon therapy or instead administer so-called
clot-buster drugs.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE LAB: A Shampoo That Highlights Head Lice
</P>
<P>
   A pediatrician at Yale says he has developed an improved
technique for detecting lice eggs, known as nits, raising hope for
the day when parents will not have to spend long hours delousing
their children _ only to find that a few missed eggs forces them to
begin all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sydney Spiesel, an assistant professor at the Yale School of
Medicine, has invented a shampoo that, after a single application,
stains the lice and their nits so that when exposed to commonly
available ultraviolet or black light sources, they glow brightly.
The nits, the size and color of a grain of sand, can then be easily
spotted and removed.
</P>
<P>
   Lice, which cause an estimated 12 million infestations a year in
this country, do not pose a health risk by themselves. But they do
cause itching, social stigma and much grief for parents.
</P>
<P>
   New strains, moreover, have become resistant to traditional
chemical treatments, leaving nit-by-nit removal as the only
effective remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new shampoo is not yet available, Spiesel has
obtained a patent for it and is meeting with potential
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   He even has a name in mind, courtesy of a girl who attended a
day care center in New Haven where he worked as medical adviser and
was required to certify that children were lice-free before they
could return. The girl, now 13, suggested ``Headlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a solution, Spiesel said he recalled his days as a
biology student and the nature of the hard exterior of lice and
their eggs, which are made of a substance called chitin. The chitin
is often stained by researchers as part of their lab work, and
Spiesel found that several stains, already widely used in products
like laundry detergents, worked well on the nits, without affecting
the hair or scalp.

MLADIN ROARS TO SUPERBIKE RECORD AT LOUDON

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Mat Mladin originally planned to spend Monday
behind the wheel of his motorcoach on a leisurely trip to Columbus,
Ohio, where he would deliver his rig for an AMA Chevy Trucks US
Superbike event at Mid-Ohio July 14-16 before jetting off to his
residence in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But those plans were put on hold when rain forced the
postponement of Sunday's Superbike event at the 77th AMA Loudon
Classic at New Hampshire International Speedway. So Mladin, who won
the pole position in record fashion with a lap of 1 minute 9.947
seconds (82.345 miles per hour), rode his American Suzuki hard and
fast Monday to win the 38-lap race in a record pace of 81.047
m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he had a motorcoach to Columbus to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping this race would be good to us,'' said Mladin,
who expanded his lead over Nicky Hayden in the Superbike standings
from a scant 1-point (171-170) to a robust 14 (209-195) at the
halfway point of the season. ``Nicky had done a great job last week
(sweeping a doubleheader at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis.) but
we honestly believed we were beaten by horsepower. This week,
unfortunately, you can't use all that horsepower because it comes
down to getting around the corners quick and making sure your tires
last the race and we obviously did the best job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-born Mladin, 27, won for the second time at NHIS
(he also won in 1997) to give his Suzuki team its fourth victory in
six events this season. He negotiated the winding, 12-turn,
1.6-mile road circuit without incident to beat runner-up Eric
Bostrom and third-place finisher Jamie Hacking, who recorded his
first podium effort of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden dropped back in the standings after finishing sixth. He
injured his right knee on Lap 26 when he struck a pylon in Turn 3
and was hampered for the remainder of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Mladin, who led start to finish, pressed the pace early to build
a commanding lead. The toughest part of his day, arguably, came
when he had to pass the lapped Ducati belonging to John Kocinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to thank John for his decency for not coming up inside
on me and overtaking me again, because he could've easily come back
underneath me, but that was nice of him,'' Mladin said. ``It would
have been a little nicer if he had taken a glimpse over his
shoulder and noticed that I was there for a couple of laps. The
Ducati accelerates hard and I really had to make sure that I could
get off Turn 2 hard so I could outbrake him (in Turn 3).''
</P>
<P>
   Mladin knew such a maneuver would not have been possible had he
been forced to race Sunday in extremely wet conditions. But after
track officials huddled with AMA officials and riders _ in a
somewhat contentious meeting on pit road _ it was decided that the
race would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard call for everybody,'' Mladin said. ``It's hard
on the fans to try and come back here. I was totally against
running (Sunday). I believe this racetrack isn't suitable for us to
race in the rain and I think probably 8 out of 10 riders believed
the same Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson rider Pascal Picotte, who turned a fast lap of
1:24.8 during Sunday's session, expressed a desire to race that day
in hopes of delivering his manufacturer its first Superbike
victory. However, he was in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it would've been nice to win a race,'' said Mladin,
``but to win a race when the other 14 guys really don't care to be
out there really couldn't be satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speak for myself. I think (the AMA) made the right
decision. I was out there and I had only done one lap and didn't
feel good at all. I tested a couple of spots and they were slick. I
think they made the right call and I have to thank the AMA for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it meant delaying his trip to Columbus by a day.

AMERICAN RESCUER OF LONDON'S ROYAL OPERA RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Kaiser, the American theater manager who helped rescue
London's Royal Opera House from the financial crisis and internal
feuding that plagued its recent $360 million redevelopment,
announced Monday that he would step down at the end of the
2000-2001 season after just 18 months as chief executive of the
Covent Garden complex.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, a former executive director of American Ballet Theater,
said in a statement that the decision had been ``the most
profoundly difficult'' of his career. ``But, for personal reasons,
it is time for me to return to my home'' in New York, he said.
Kaiser, who is 47, said he was announcing his intention now to
allow time for an orderly transition.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had no fixed-term contract, he predicted in an
interview early last year that he would need three to five years to
have the Royal Opera House operating without financial restraints.
He also expressed excitement over the challenge of bringing order
to a legendary theater that had known three board chairmen and
three directors in as many years, even pointing to a newspaper
headline that greeted him his first day at work: ``Chaos Reigns as
Kaiser Enters Opera House.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Covent Garden reopened last December after a
30-month makeover, Kaiser had virtually eliminated the budget
deficit and created a permanent endowment fund. He also had done
much to revive morale in both the Royal Ballet and the orchestra
and chorus of the opera house after the tabloid-pleasing scandals
that preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   After a year-long honeymoon with the British press, however,
Kaiser was criticized for pricing seats beyond the reach of many
opera lovers and for allowing an independent producer to operate
the house during the off-season months of July and August. He also
faced embarrassing teething problems with a new computerized stage
that forced cancellation of one entire opera production and
resulted in several breakdowns during early performances.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the consensus was that, having previously restored
financial health to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and to
American Ballet Theater, he had once again lived up to the nickname
of ``Mr. Turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, with Anthony Pappano to succeed Bernard Haitink as
music director in 2002 and Ross Stretton to succeed Sir Athony
Dowell as director of the Royal Ballet next year, an entirely new
team seemed to be in place. The first press reports this weekend
that Kaiser was planning to leave Covent Garden, therefore, came as
a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser could not be reached for comment beyond his formal
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Sir Colin Southgate, the Royal Opera
House's board chairman, praised Kaiser's ``countless'' achievements
at Covent Garden. ``He has approached this enormously challenging
job with unrelenting energy, commitment and determination,'' the
chairman said. ``The Royal Opera House is now on a very sure
footing both financially and artistically and we owe him a huge
debt of gratitude.''

 &HT;    SUPREME COURT PICKS HANG HEAVY OVER ELECTION
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects date of Roe v. Wade in 2nd graf
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in Washington and politics category
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not much discussed in campaign appearances,
but the question of who will win the power to appoint the next
Supreme Court justices _ maybe up to four in the next four years _
hangs heavy over this year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two major presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore
has raised the court issue most often. And when he does, it is
usually to evoke the specter of a Republican president undoing Roe
v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that guaranteed a woman's
right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a Supreme Court majority that is in keeping with
the philosophy of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, that is what is
at stake in this election,'' Gore said during the Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, while less talkative on the subject of judicial appointments,
is nonetheless mindful that the next president's appointments could
have enormous influence on a nine-member court that is closely
divided on contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, ironically, he has linked himself to Ronald Reagan rather
than to his father, George H.W. Bush, in putting forth a ``strict
constructionist'' view of judicial appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same position that Governor Reagan, soon to be
President Reagan, took in the '80 debate,'' Bush said during the
Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of Supreme Court appointments bubbled to the
surface of the presidential contest Monday with the court's 6-3
ruling that student-led prayers before high school football games
violates the constitutionally required separation of government and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case from Texas that included a brief
from Bush urging the high court to uphold such student-led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But abortion is the central issue in the political debate over
the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the presidential primaries began this year, the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) ran
television ads in New Hampshire last December warning that Bush
would appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   And since the primaries, President Clinton has joined the fray,
noting earlier this year that there is ``absolutely no question in
my mind that whether Roe vs. Wade is preserved or scrapped depends
on what happens in the presidential election, and to pretend
otherwise is naive.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other divisive issues before the justices, however.
And one new justice could change the court's thinking on such
issues as racial preferences, separation of church and state,
voting rights, sex discrimination, criminal law and the power
relationship between Congress and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is the hinge _ nearly every important vote is
5-4,'' said Herman Shwartz, a constitutional law professor at
American University's Washington College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   The three oldest justices are Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
75, Justice John Paul Stevens, 79, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
70. Two of them _ Rehnquist and Stevens _ have already exceeded the
average length of services of justices, 23 years. And O'Connor will
mark her 23rd year on the court in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Of those appointed since 1986, the oldest is Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, 66, who has undergone surgery for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to predict when a court opening will occur,
however. Three of the last four justices to retire did so when they
were well into their eighties: William Brennan at 84, Thurgood
Marshall at 83 and Harry Blackmun at 85.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Gore and Bush camps clearly anticipate that the
next president could appoint enough justices to affect domestic
politics well into the 21st century, beginning with abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he would look for justices ``who understand that
our Constitution is a living and breathing document, that it was
intended by our Founders to be interpreted in the light of the
constantly evolving experience of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he has indicated he would ``not use a litmus test''
regarding abortion rights in selecting justices, he has vowed that
``you could rest assured that a Supreme Court majority appointed in
a Gore administration would support a woman's right to chose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would name judges ``who will strictly interpret
the Constitution and not use the benches from which to legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has cited Justice Antonin Scalia, perhaps the court's
most conservative member and most outspoken opponent of abortion,
as the justice he respects most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed very encouraging that Scalia is the type of judge
that Bush would look to (for the court),'' said David O'Steen, the
executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, the
most active anti-abortion organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American
Way Foundation (PFAWF), countered: ``If the far right succeeds in
remaking the court in the image of Scalia ..., the result would be
a disaster for millions of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as it is impossible to predict when a Supreme Court
vacancy will occur, so it is to predict how a new justice will
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are still seething over the appointment of David
H. Souter to the court. Souter, who was appointed by President
Bush, is counted among the court's liberals in most instances and
has voted solidly in favor of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, when asked about his father's appointment of
Souter, ducked the question. ``Nice try,'' Bush responded. ``I'm
not going into all of that.''

SURGING WOODS A PURE TERROR FOR OTHER PROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Always with Tiger Woods, there is
anticipation. What will he do next? It is a source of joy for golf
fans, but for those who must compete against him, it translates
into fear.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo, for example, was upbeat and almost charming when
talking to the media Sunday after his US Open scores of 69-74-76-71
produced his first top 10 finish in a major in four years _ until
he was asked about Woods's demolition of the field at Pebble Beach
Golf Links. Fear, though he would not admit it, overcame Faldo, who
had just sweated out four days of high-intensity, gut-wrenching
golf, played to perhaps his greatest ability, and still finished 18
shots behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen shots. Think about that. Woods could have given Faldo
two a side for all four days and still beaten him.
</P>
<P>
   And Faldo finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But there was the six-time major winner being asked about the
prospects of Woods at St. Andrews, site of the British Open, the
next major. ``I think St. Andrews will help the rest of us,'' said
Faldo, whose second of three British Open titles came at the Old
Course in 1990. He sounded as if he were trying to convince himself
more than the assembled media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a true links course, with big greens, and you can play it
with no real scare. The fact that there's no water will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Faldo went, temporarily overcome with fear, we assume,
rationalizing that the wide-open terrain of St. Andrews will allow
players to take gambles where Pebble Beach, with its treacherous
cliffs and deep rough, did not.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, golfers were saying a month ago that the
USGA set-up at Pebble Beach would bring Woods back to the field,
that the narrow fairways, deep rough, and rock-hard greens would
bring more players into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that picture was totally out of focus, because only one
player was in it.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, of course. By 15 shots over his nearest challenger, which
is so absurd a victory margin that you would have to talk to Willie
Smith to get a sense of what it feels like, since he was the only
other player to post a double-digit win in any of the previous 99
US Opens. Of course, ol' Willie did his deed in 1899, so good luck
getting a quote.
</P>
<P>
   How dramatic a victory was it? Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --In the previous 20 US Opens, the average victory margin was
1.1 shots.
</P>
<P>
   --You have to go back 30 years, to Tony Jacklin's seven-shot
cushion at Hazeltine, to find a US Open that was decided by more
than three in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   --Jack Nicklaus, whose 18 major conquests is the record Woods
dreams about, won his four US Opens by a combined 12 strokes (which
includes his three-shot playoff win over Arnold Palmer).
</P>
<P>
   Incredible stuff? Yes. Unbelievable? Not to Tom Watson, who
knows greatness when he sees it. Twenty-five years ago, Watson
wanted to be the best, and to that end he had to travel a route
directly through Nicklaus, a challenge he accepted without
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters are classics _ 1977 at Augusta, 1977 at
Turnberry, 1981 at Augusta, 1982 at Pebble Beach, major
championships all won by Watson, with Nicklaus second _ but unless
something changes quickly, we won't see a repeat of such a rivalry,
said Watson, because Woods is frightening away the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said a number of times that Tiger Woods has the best
swing on Tour,'' said Watson. ``Couple that with the fact he's the
longest hitter on Tour, has the best short game on Tour, and is one
of the best putters on Tour, and you know why he's got a 10-shot
lead in the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all playing for second,'' Watson added Sunday, and
that may be the case again next month at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bomber's and a putter's course,'' said Nick Price.
``Perfect for him. That's his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt for the longest time that someone was going to
come along who could drive the ball 300 yards and putt like (Ben)
Crenshaw. Well, this guy drives the ball better than anyone I've
seen and putts better than Crenshaw. A phenomenon, no doubt about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Clarke agrees. He was one of those players allegedly set
to enter the picture because the Pebble Beach set-up was going to
hinder Woods. Clarke pointed to a USGA staple _ thick rough _ as
proof that people did not have a true vision of what was going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Woods's third-round drive at the par-5 sixth
hole, which went into rough right of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us would have punched it out, maybe 30 yards,'' said
Clarke. ``He knocks a 7-iron up the hill and on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   A 7-iron from 201 yards, no less. Uphill, directly on line with
the pin, even though it flirted with a cliff to the right that
invited double-bogey. Woods made the birdie, one of 21 he made in
four days. Consider that David Duval and Phil Mickelson made a
combined 22 birdies and you understand why Clarke, though friendly
with the 24-year-old living legend, is not going to send Woods any
invitations to play European events before the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is playing a different game than the rest of us,'' said
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   It's an overpowering game, to be sure, but if the course is set
up to throttle his power, as Pebble Beach was, then he'll rely on
an umatched short game to finesse his way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was first in greens in regulation and sixth in putting,''
said Clarke. ``That's an amazing combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The next show is expected to get under way July 6 at the Advil
Western Open outside of Chicago, though Woods rarely confirms his
schedule that far in advance. But he is the defending champ there
and, besides, it offers a nice tune-up to the real task at hand _
the chance to complete the career grand slam at a time when he is
playing ferociously well and on a course with four par-4s that he
could drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much better than this,'' said Woods, the
championship hardware from the US Open sitting right next to him.
``Pebble Beach and St. Andrews.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of his challengers are fearful that he's
right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: Should I say anything to an employee who
I know is trying to flatter me so that I will give him a better
raise or think of him for a promotion? It's nice to be
complimented, but he has carried this to an extreme. Any
suggestions? T.R.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: All that you need to say to an employee whose
communication is laced with compliments is, ``Thanks.'' There are
many ways for employees to create grief for their managers, but
this is one of the most benign.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, this employee may have heard or read
that managers enjoy receiving positive feedback from the troops, as
this can leave a positive image in the manager's mind when
opportunities arise. Your employee has misinterpreted this
information by assuming that if some flattering may help, then
massive amounts should put him over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that his behavior is over the top. Rather than
confronting him and possibly embarrassing him for trying to look
good, it will make more sense to provide him with more information
on the criteria that determine pay increases and advancement in the
company. Let him see that raises, promotions, and special
opportunities are provided to employees who demonstrate the highest
levels of performance, productivity and commitment, as opposed to
those who demonstrate the highest levels of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been with this company for three years, and there are
sleazy rumors concerning one of the top leaders. I have no
first-hand experience regarding the content, but it comes as no
surprise to me. None of us have any respect for this individual,
but the owners of the company give him their full support. I was
just given an assignment that will put me in more regular contact
with him, and I'm wondering if I should try to get out of it. D.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you simply try to get out of an assignment, management may
assume that you should simply get out. In a word, it is not a great
idea to base work decisions on rumors. At the same time, if you
have credible co-workers who have had specific problems with this
particular leader, it is impossible for you to totally ignore their
comments.
</P>
<P>
   In approaching this new assignment, you should try to keep your
mind open, but keep your eyes open, too. In the event that you
encounter any of the so-called sleazy antics that may have given
birth to the rumors in the first place, you should be ready to take
assertive action. This means directly advising this individual that
his behaviors are not acceptable and must stop. And if he persists,
you should go to the owners and provide them with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   If you enter this assignment expecting to find problems, your
behaviors may actually help bring them out. You should approach the
work with the expectation that it will be challenging,
growth-oriented, and fulfilling. But if your manager flips into a
sleaze mode, you should flip into your assertive mode.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The last time I made a formal presentation before our group,
a few people came in after I started, so I summarized what they had
missed. My manager told me afterwards that if they did not get
there on time, that's too bad for them, and there's no need to
waste everyone else's time recapping what they missed. Does that
seem like good advice to you? O.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: If this is your manager's meeting and this is how he wants to
run it, then the best advice is to follow his advice. He is sending
an indirect message to all of the group indicating that if they are
not present for the full meeting, they are going to miss out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a few problems with his approach. For
example, rather than sending indirect messages to the employees, it
makes more sense to communicate directly so that they clearly
understand the need to get to these meetings on time. It may also
be helpful to look into the reasons why employees are straggling in
late in the first place. This can include a careful look at the
scheduling, length and overall structure and usefulness of the
meetings. Perhaps a future agenda should include a discussion of
the ways to increase timely attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Taken to an extreme, if employees continue to wander into the
meetings every five minutes or so, it is possible that no more than
five minutes of information could ever be imparted. At the same
time, a prohibition against recapping information for late arrivals
ultimately leads to misinformation and errors. Your group and
manager should get together for a meeting of the minds on this
issue.

END OF SUPREME COURT CASE DOESN'T END TROUBLE IN TEXAS TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The same week last year that a girl's prayer propelled a Texas
school district to the U.S. Supreme Court, a 13-year-old boy was
lingering on lunch break in the Santa Fe junior high schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   Four students, maybe more, surrounded eighth-grader Phil
Nevelow. In a singsong voice, they chanted:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler missed one! No more Jews!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler missed one! He should have gotten you!''
</P>
<P>
   That Friday night, at the opening football game, high school
senior Marian Ward prayed for sportsmanship, safety and fans'
``good behavior'' in ``Jesus' name'' at the Santa Fe High School
Indians' game, beginning a season that ended Monday in a 6-3 defeat
at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, a town of 10,000 people in western Galveston County
only 20 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, the first court case is
over.
</P>
<P>
   A second may be only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nevelow was bullied all year, his family says. Now, three
teen-agers face juvenile charges in connection with a May 16 threat
on a school bus to ``hang'' Nevelow, the son of a ranking officer
in the Galveston County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   According to the family, he is the only Jewish student among
4,300 in the Santa Fe schools.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Nevelow said the family has yet to discuss suing the
school district, but that school officials have done ``nothing''
all year about slurs against her son, only phoning when he fought
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, this school district has to learn how to accept
outsiders, how to accept another culture, religion or race,'' she
said Monday by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to change. It's going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're the ones who will have to insist on change.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mormon and Roman Catholic ``John Doe'' families
winning the football game prayer lawsuit had remained publicly
anonymous _ by a judge's order after school officials began prying
and began interrogating students _ the Nevelows talk publicly about
life in a working-class town of 10,000 people, including two Jewish
families by Donna Nevelow's count. The 1990 census reported nine
African-American residents.
</P>
<P>
   Both Donna Nevelow and her husband, Sheriff's Maj. Eric Nevelow,
grew up in nearby Galveston. He is a 25-year veteran of the
sheriff's office. They've lived in Santa Fe 15 years and attend a
Galveston synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community is not just divided'' over the prayer case, she
said. ``It's fractured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town is hurting. Us, the Catholic families, the Mormon
families _ it's as if this is war and we're all on the other side.
Everybody else is against all of us. Nobody will even have a
logical discussion. You try to start a conversation, and people
just start shouting at you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Justice John Paul Stevens meant when he
wrote for the Court majority that public school students can never
be treated like religious ``outsiders'' by a bullying majority of
``insiders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news this morning,'' Donna Nevelow said. ``I'm
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I'm concerned how it will affect us. I'm
concerned how much more separation and resentment this will
create.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nevelows' first meeting with school officials is fatefully
well-timed. They are scheduled to meet Tuesday morning, Donna
Nevelow said. The Nevelows will ask the district to send employees
to cultural awareness training and to add cultural diversity
lessons in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 16 incident, two 16-year-old boys and a 15-year-old
boy each face a misdemeanor charge alleging a terroristic threat.
Phil Nevelow told police that one boy said, ``We're going to hang
you, you dirty Jew,'' and that one of the boys said he should
``wander the desert for 40 years.'' They were arrested by Santa Fe
police.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for one of the boys has asked for a jury trial, said
a prosecutor in the Galveston County district attorney's office.
Lawyers for the other boys are considering plea bargain offers
before their next hearings, scheduled on July 12 and July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Nevelow said she taped a local newscast when the school
superintendent called the case a ``teen-age prank.''

 &HT;    Chicago bracing for Sosa departure
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Tap your heart and blow a kiss. Tap your heart again
and say goodbye to Sammy Sosa's reign as Chicago's most beloved
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, the Cubs' ultra-popular right fielder, is engulfed by
trade rumors as he arrives in Atlanta for a three-game series
against the Braves at Turner Field starting tonight.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the unimaginable in the Windy City has now become
the anticipated: The Cubs probably will part with Sosa before the
July 31 trading deadline. Shop owners around Wrigley Field are
bracing for it, and so are Sosa's fans and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing for the Cubs for 13 years,'' first baseman
Mark Grace said. ``I've seen everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so, Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem here,'' Sosa said. ``I'm employed, just
like everybody else. I see myself here, no doubt about it. I'm
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa, 31, probably won't be with the Cubs for long. Cubs
general manager Ed Lynch last week dispatched his top scouts, Ken
Kravec and Keith Champion, to watch minor-league teams of the Mets,
Red Sox and Yankees. Those three teams reportedly are expressing
the most interest in acquiring Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, the 1998 National League MVP, is being paid $10 million
this season and $11 million in 2001. Sosa's current contract
expires after next season and he reportedly wants a new deal that
will pay him between $15 million and $20 million per year. Sosa and
his agent, Adam Katz, want a new contract before July 31.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs seem unwilling to spend almost one-third of their
$60 million payroll on one player _ even Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that can happen: There could be a
(contract) extension, there could be a trade, or nothing could
happen,'' Cubs president and CEO Andy McPhail said. ``I really
don't have the probability on any of those three.''
</P>
<P>
   Souvenir shops around Wrigley Field are betting that Sosa is
traded. Since last week, several stores have been running Sosa
clearance sales, trying to unload everything that bears the
slugger's likeness or his No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's love affair with the bleacher bums of Wrigley Field
doesn't seem to be what it was two summers ago, when Sosa and
McGwire led baseball's comeback with their remarkable home run
race. Most Cubs fans figure that, if the franchise can acquire a
core of young stars for the aging superstar, they're better off
without Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy is the subject of all the talk in the bar and dining
room,'' said Grant DePorter, managing partner of Harry Caray's
Restaurant. ``A lot of people are just hoping the Cubs do something
that will help them win. If that means trading Sammy, I think
people will believe it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when the Cubs and White Sox met at Comiskey Park
in an interleague series, a fan held up a ``Sammy Meter'' sign that
included nine Ks, which represented Sosa's nine strikeouts in the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times said, ``Sosa is
shrinking,'' because the Cubs continue to badmouth and degrade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every unfair insult, every internal and external attack,
every reminder that the Cubs no longer want him, an icon is
becoming an eyesore,'' columnist Jay Mariotti wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 40 percent into this season, the Cubs already trail the
St. Louis Cardinals by 10 games in the National League Central. And
the future isn't much brighter, with most of the team's top players
_ Grace (35 years), outfielder Henry Rodriguez (32) and pitchers
Rick Aguilera (38) and Kevin Tapani (36) _ nearing the end of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs haven't ruled out trading Sosa because they realize his
value might never be higher. He has hit 149 home runs since Opening
Day 1998, a total second only to Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire's
160. Through 68 games this year, Sosa is hitting .311 with 20
homers and 62 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The trade speculation) is not going to stop me from going out
and playing or doing the best that I can,'' Sosa said. ``Whatever
happens off the field is not my problem. I've just got to take care
of business on the field. ... I believe everything is going to
settle down. If not, I don't have any control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's critics claim he has gained weight the past two seasons,
which has caused him to steal fewer bases and has reduced his range
in the outfield. Sosa also strikes out at an alarming rate. In the
last three seasons, he has fanned at least 171 times. Sosa is the
only big-leaguer besides former Tiger Rob Deer to have three
seasons with at least 170 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa is what he is,'' Cubs manager Don Baylor said. ``He is a
home-run hitter, and one flaw home-run guys have is they strike
out. The (Mickey) Mantles. The (Reggie) Jacksons. The McGwires. The
(Mike) Schmidts. That is their M.O.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor and Sosa say they have repaired their relationship after
a public spat earlier this month. When Baylor insinuated that Sosa
needed to play harder in the field and steal more bases, Sosa said
Baylor had ``no class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see (Sosa) being the problem,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs think that Sosa could be the solution to their
long-term problems. With Kerry Wood struggling to recover from
elbow surgery that caused him to miss all of last season, the
team's pitching staff is in disarray. Sosa could command as many as
three or four players, including at least a pair of highly regarded
pitching prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do everything I want to determine the value of a player,
but the other people are going to determine his value, what the
demand is on their end,'' Lynch said. ``The offers that come in for
any player determine what his value is.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sosa is traded, Lynch says, it will take time to complete the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are ahead of themselves,'' Lynch said.
``Anytime you're talking about trading an impact player, it takes
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs outfielder Glenallen Hill, one of Sosa's closest friends,
says the decision will come down to money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy doesn't want to leave,'' Hill said. ``He loves it here.
With Sammy, it's just about money.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sosa, however, his future could be about more than money.
Taped to his locker in the Wrigley Field clubhouse is an
advertisement torn from a magazine. It includes a picture of the
Yankees celebrating last year's World Series victory and the
headline, ``Winning Is Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa knows a trade could put him in the middle of a pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible I could go a lot of places,'' Sosa said. ``I
don't know where I'm going to go.''

 &HT;    Mayfield nudges Earnhardt to claim Pocono victory
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Jeremy Mayfield is NASCAR's newest overnight
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield won Monday's Pocono 500 with an outrageous and daring
manuever against Winston Cup's most feared competitor. Dale
Earnhardt, known as ``The Intimidator'' for his rough style of
driving, was less than 700 feet from victory when he was nudged in
the rear bumper by Mayfield. To the roaring approval of the crowd
at Pocono Raceway, the No. 3 Chevy slid up the groove and Mayfield
and two other drivers passed.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayfield cruised on his victory lap around the 2.5-mile
tri-oval, many other drivers signaled a thumbs up. Earnhardt drove
side by side with Mayfield momentarily, making a taunting gesture
with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said later he was telling Mayfield, ``You're No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second victory of the season for Mayfield and third
of his eight-year Winston Cup career. He was overwhelmed by fans as
he walked from the winner's circle to the garage area. Only hours
earlier, he went through the same route to pit road unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intentionally tried to wreck (Earnhardt) or nothing,''
Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Ford, said with a grin. ``We just
wanted to rattle his cage a little bit and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt had used the phrase ``just wanted to rattle his cage''
when he bumped leader Terry Labonte into the wall on the final lap
of August's Bristol race. Earnhardt passed Labonte for the
controversial victory and showed no remorse in post-race comments.
</P>
<P>
   The bump at Bristol was much more severe than Monday's last-lap
contact, which might have been Earnhardt's fault. Earnhardt, a
seven-time Winston Cup champion, mishandled his car in the second
turn, sliding to the top groove and losing valuable seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield took the second turn perfectly and built up enough
momentum to catch up with Earnhardt in the final corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like a hard hit; it didn't wreck him,'' said Dale
Jarrett who finished second. ``I'm glad to see that Dale didn't
wreck, but again (the bump) did its purpose and makes for exciting
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett paused for quick smile and said, ``We all know
(Earnhardt) wouldn't have done that if he would've been the car
behind, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the key members of Earnhardt's team criticized Mayfield
or protested the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt: ``It felt like he hit me. I don't know if he did or
not. What did it look like on TV? He took the air off something.
... It was a good race, though. You don't ever have a win until the
checkered flag falls. I got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Richard Childress said: ``Mayfield just knocked him out of
the way to win. It was just racing. There will be another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Kevin Hamlin said: ``I don't know; it's just racing.
Some days, we're going to be running second and come out in the
lead at the end. Some days, we're going to be in front and finish
fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield and Earnhardt have a history of mixing it up. Mayfield
said Monday was another chapter. ``I'm not intimidated by Dale
Earnhardt,'' he said, ``and never will be.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A band of showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain with
local flooding in the northern Mississippi Valley and western Great
Lakes as a vigorous cold front sweep across these regions. Some of
the storms will have damaging winds and hail. In the wake of the
front, strong winds from the northwest will deliver chilly air and
a few showers to the northern parts of the Rockies and Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will persist from the southern Plains to the
Southeastern states. Converging winds near a warm front will
produce thundershowers in the Tennessee Valley and near the
southern Appalachians. A broken band of thunderstorms will erupt
during the heat of the afternoon from the western Ohio Valley to
central Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn with patchy fog, the Northeast will be sunny
and seasonable. Clouds will increase late today in the interior as
the area of showers approaches from the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE LONGEST SEASON
</P>
<P>
   The official start of summer is at 9:48 p.m. EDT Tuesday, and
astronomy, not meteorology, is the deciding factor. It is then that
the northward trek of the sun's direct rays across the planet will
cease. For the next six months, the direct rays of the sun will
move inexorably south, culminating in the winter solstice on Dec.
21. But the summer season is the slowest to fade. As a result of
the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the sun, the
Northern Hemisphere's summer lasts 93 days while winter is 89 days
long. &QL;

A STRONGER HATE-CRIMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been 20 months since the savage beating of Matthew
Shepard, the University of Wyoming student murdered because he was
gay. His memory should not be allowed to fade without national
action on hate crimes. An amendment to give the federal government
a stronger role in prosecuting crimes of bias deserves swift
approval when it is taken up in the US Senate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by US Senator Edward Kennedy, the amendment adds
violence motivated by gender, sexual orientation, and disability to
the roster of hate crimes. Currently, federal hate crimes are
limited to those committed on the basis of race, religion, or
national origin, and then only if they interfere with a narrow list
of six ``federally protected activities'' such as trying to vote or
registering for school. These restrictions allow thousands of hate
crimes a year to elude federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy amendment does not allow for enhanced penalties or
added sanctions, but it does offer the assistance of the FBI or
other federal resources to local law enforcement authorities in
investigating such crimes. Although 40 states have some sort of
hate crime statutes, many are limited to race or religion, and many
other states do not have the technical or forensic tools to pursue
a thorough investigation. The amendment respects local authority by
requiring that the US Justice Department consult with state law
enforcement officers and determine that the state either does not
have jurisdiction or requests the federal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative amendment by Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of
Utah, would authorize a study of hate crimes. It is little more
than a red herring. But because of Senate rules, members will be
allowed to vote on both amendments Tuesday, and, if both pass, they
will be subject to complicated negotiations that could muddy the
waters. All 12 New England senators, with the exception of the two
in New Hampshire, are co-sponsors of the Kennedy amendment.
Supporting both would send a mixed message.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government should be enhancing justice for all
Americans victimized simply for being who they are. This amendment
is an important start.

BANKING ONE FOR BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Bank has been criticized in recent years for a lack of
transparency and accountability. As an institution, the bank has
tried to explain its role in financing economically beneficial
projects and, under President James Wolfensohn, has striven to
become more open and accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that effort is being undercut, however, by the bank's
preparations to underwrite a project in China's western Qinghai
province, a traditional homeland for Tibetan and Mongol herders.
The project would place the World Bank in the position of financing
the resettlement of 58,000 Chinese farmers on Tibetan lands and
displacing the indigenous people who had been living there.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the bank should not allow itself to become a
collaborator in Beijing's colonialist policy of expunging Tibetan
cultural identity by submerging the Tibetan population under waves
of resettled Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, no such concern for the cultural survival of indigenous
people has deflected the bank from pushing ahead with the project.
It has persisted on this course despite opposition from two of its
primary lenders, the United States and Germany, and in the face of
criticism from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, human rights
groups, and environmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bank management has made a bad situation worse by hiding from
public view a report it commissioned on the project by an
inspection panel of three independent development specialists from
Holland, Senegal, and Canada. A letter co-signed by Democratic US
Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Nancy Pelosi of
California and Republicans Benjamin Gilman of New York and Frank
Wolf of Virginia castigates the bank for not making the report
public ``until after the World Bank Board votes on whether or not
to continue the project.''
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, the panel faults the bank for
failing to observe its own policies and procedures on involuntary
resettlement and on assessing the environmental impact of the
project and its effects on displaced indigenous peoples.
Accountability should mean that the bank answers to all countries
and all peoples, not merely to its biggest borrower, the People's
Republic of China.

IN A GAMBLE, U.S. SUPPORTS RUSSIAN GERM WARFARE SCIENTISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   OBOLENSK, Russia _ At this sprawling, rundown research complex
where Soviet scientists once secretly worked to turn plague,
tularemia, glanders and anthrax into weapons, the Clinton
administration is taking what many consider a perilous gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been financing cutting-edge research here
and at other institutes throughout the former Soviet Union by
scientists who only a decade ago manipulated genes to make deadly
viruses and bacteria even hardier and resistant to vaccines and
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the U.S. government has spent $20 million helping
some 2,200 former Soviet scientists at 30 institutes turn their
deadly skills to public health and other peaceful research.
Administration officials say this money _ which, according to the
General Accounting Office may increase tenfold to $270 million by
2005 _ is also intended to prevent the Soviet scientists from
selling their expertise to Iran, Iraq, and other ``rogue'' states
or terrorist groups trying to acquire germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most of the support came from the State, Defense
and Energy Departments. But prompted by the threats of
bio-terrorism and naturally emerging diseases to American health
and the nation's food supply, the Agriculture, and Health and Human
Services Departments, and others have now joined the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most intriguing newcomers is the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, the military group that helped
invent the Internet and which is known for supporting avant-garde
research. DARPA has cautiously and quietly allocated more than $3
million since 1998 for work, including some here at Obolensk, that
in many ways resembles research that was once the source of
America's greatest fears.
</P>
<P>
   The administration knows that this assistance could help Russia
continue developing germ weapons, if, as some suspect, research
continues at its four, still-closed military labs. Can the
Russians, who doubled the size of their massive covert germ warfare
program after signing the 1972 treaty banning such weapons, now be
trusted?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows,'' said Wendy Orent, an expert on the
former Soviet program, in ``American Prospect'' a liberal magazine
last month.
</P>
<P>
   But in a report to Congress last January, the Pentagon concluded
that the access gained to Obolensk through such assistance gave it
``high confidence'' that neither Obolensk nor Vector, the former
Soviet viral weapons complex in Siberia, were now engaged in germ
warfare-related activities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the administration maintains that the risk of not
helping Russian scientists far outweighs the risk of doing so.
DARPA argues that tapping the knowledge of the Russian scientists
who continued making ever deadlier germ weapons two decades after
President Richard Nixon ended America's program in 1969, will
benefit science and strengthen American national security.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risks are obvious here at Obolensk.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the place is a monument of sorts to communism's
failure. Many of its 90 buildings are half-built; several labs
appear abandoned. Weeds have replaced the grass shown in photos of
the installation in its prime.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty miles southwest of Moscow but unlisted on Soviet maps,
Obolensk until recently was closed not only to foreigners, but also
to Soviet scientists who were not part of the germ warfare program.
Last month, however, Gen. Nikolai N. Urakov, the institute's
long-serving director, invited an American reporter to attend the
first large, open scientific conference Obolensk has ever
sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of germ warfare research are still eerily evident:
the heavy metal door-locks on the third and fourth floors of
Building No. 1, which confined the most deadly of Obolensk's
collection of 2,000 strains of pathogens to air-tight rooms; giant
pipes that carried breathable air to scientists in contaminated
areas, emergency telephones, fire extinguishers, alarms, and even
the space suits on display at the building's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   While such suits are still worn on the third floor where
scientists still study the most dangerous agents, Russia says that
these labs are now dedicated to preventing and curing disease.
American scientists with proper vaccinations have been permitted to
visit the ``hot'' labs in Building 1, the nine-story,
glass-and-metal heart of this vast complex.
</P>
<P>
   Aid from the United States, much of it channeled through a
multinational group known as the International Science and
Technology Center, pays roughly half of the institute's costs.
Obolensk employs 1,125 scientists and technicians, about half its
peak size.
</P>
<P>
   With $3.45 million in grants from the multinational group,
Obolensk has become the second-largest recipient of American
biological aid after Vector. Andy Weber, a special adviser to the
Pentagon's Office of Threat Reduction, told conferees last month
that aid to Obolensk rose sharply in 1997 after General Urakov
rejected Iranian overtures to share his center's biological
expertise with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few officials deny the potential danger in American
financing of Obolensk's most cutting-edge work. Consider DARPA's
$175,000, two-year grant to Igor V. Abaev, a senior researcher and
weapons program veteran. His goal is to isolate and compare genomes
of Burkholderia, which causes glanders, an inflammatory disease
that strikes horses, mules and other animals and sometimes people.
There is no human vaccine to prevent glanders, and once contracted,
the disease is not always curable.
</P>
<P>
</P>

   Abaev combines single strands of DNA from two different types of
Burkholderia. The DNA parts that are identical, or extremely
similar in both strands, then form a double strand with each other.
The parts that do not pair up, or pair up poorly, are unique to
those species. This process, called subtractive hybridization,
enables scientists to identify, and later to clone the fragments
that differentiate the two species. This, in turn, produces
diagnostic markers that could lead to vaccines designed to
emphasize those differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``As weapons, such organisms represent a serious potential
biological threat,'' said Stephen S. Morse, program manager in
DARPA's defense sciences office. ``But because these two species
primarily affected horses, American scientists stopped working on
them decades ago. As a result, we now know all too little about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, he noted, a scientist at the Army's research
lab at Fort Detrick, Md., who was trying to develop a glanders
vaccine accidentally contracted the disease, an incident that
Washington is still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Abaev enthusiastically displayed the new equipment that the
American grant had enabled him to buy, including a hybridization
chamber, which allows him to mix the DNA fragments. Though such
machines are standard in the United States, they remain rare in
cash-strapped Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another joint project generating both excitement and concern is
a $500,000 grant from the International Science and Technology
Center to a collaboration that includes Nikolai Staritsin, an
expert on anthrax, the Soviet Union's germ weapon of choice, and
American researchers at the Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff, and at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Using DNA fingerprinting, molecular typing, plasmid profiling
and other modern techniques of molecular epidemiology to identify
anthrax strains by region and help scientists distinguish among
virulent and nonvirulent strains, the team hopes to better
understand what specifically causes anthrax outbreaks. Although the
United States and Russia have vaccines to prevent the disease and
antibiotics that supposedly cure it, Staritsin said ``there is much
we don't know about the DNA fragments we have already examined,
such as why some genes are latent and others are not.''
</P>
<P>
   While both the United States and Russia made weapons from
anthrax, Ken Alibek, a senior scientist who defected from the
Soviet secret program, argues that Russian scientists have produced
anthrax strains that are hardier and more virulent than those of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American scientists first understood just how advanced the
Russians were in 1995 when Staritsin and Andrei Pomerantsev,
another Obolensk scientist, reported in 1997 that they had
transferred genes from Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that normally
does not cause disease in humans, into anthrax, which if untreated,
is highly lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamsters that were given this new agent did not respond to
Russia's vaccine against anthrax. This news caused furious debate
among Western scientists, who wondered why the Russians were
bothering to create such a strain, and deep anxiety over whether
the Americans' vaccine would be able to block the new Russian
creation. Washington has been eager to obtain a sample of the
strain ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Staritsin insisted in an interview that he and his colleagues
had not tried to develop a modified disease impervious to anyone's
vaccine or antibiotics when they performed the manipulation in
1993. They decided to transfer the genes, he said, because the two
organisms were ``closely related and often found in soil in close
proximity.'' They feared that one day the two organisms might
naturally exchange genes without any external intervention. ``We
wanted to understand what the result might be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he said, the new strain was too unstable to be
useful in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some will view this work as evidence that Russian scientists
``were trying to make an even nastier weapon,'' one American said.
``Others will not. How do you gauge intent?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russia is honoring President Boris Yeltsin's 1992 pledge
to end the secret germ warfare program may never be known. But in
Staritsin's case, concerns are diminishing, U. S. officials say.
Shortly before the Obolensk conference, he and a Russian colleague
traveled to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta and to Fort Detrick to give American scientists samples of
two rare Russian strains from Obolensk's collection of 3,000
anthrax strains, believed to be the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ``Tzenkovsky'' strains, named for their late
19th-century Russian inventor, are nonvirulent and hence, usable
only in vaccines, the exchange established the legal and scientific
precedents for future trades of virulent strains, like the
genetically modified strain that American scientists have long
coveted. The exchange will probably occur later this year or early
next, Russian and American experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't need us to do their research,'' said an American
scientist as he sipped one of the endless tiny glasses of vodka
that lined a dinner's banquet table during the conference. ``They
were way ahead of us in many areas despite their obsolete equipment
and bulldozer investigative techniques. So we have every interest
in helping them overcome their past and join the world's
transparent scientific community.''

&HT;     GROUPS PROTEST PLAN TO LET TRUCKERS DRIVE LONG HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the official start of summer, the nation's
highways could become more hazardous if a new federal proposal goes
into effect allowing truckers to drive up to 12 hours before taking
a break, a group of lawmakers and safety advocates warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under 60-year-old federal regulations, truckers can drive up to
10 hours straight, followed by at least eight hours off, leaving
open the possibility of driving as many as 16 hours in a 24-hour
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed a rule that
would give truckers more rest but allow them to drive up to 12
hours straight per day.
</P>
<P>
   According to government figures, 755 people are killed and
19,000 injured each year in accidents caused by fatigued truck
drivers. Overall, more than 5,300 people are killed and 127,000 are
injured annually as a result of truck-related crashes. Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., said in a statement that the new rule would ``only
lead to an increase in truck-related crashes and fatalities. And
that is just not acceptable. We know that overly tired truck
drivers put themselves and the public at risk. Why increase that
risk?'' Boxer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gillan, a vice president with Advocates for Highway and
Auto Safety here, said, ``Truck drivers are falling asleep after
eight or nine hours. To allow them to drive 12 hours (per day)
makes no sense at all. We are concerned that this rule is a step
back for highway safety. Those additional two hours can make a big
difference between a fatigued driver and a rested driver,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based
health and safety advocacy group, said, ``This is not someone just
sitting behind a desk. This is someone driving a huge rig that can
kill other people.'' If truckers ``take their eyes off the road for
a second, they can crash.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Longo, a DOT spokesman, argued that the proposal would
actually boost safety because it would increase the rest time
drivers are required to take, from 8 hours a day to 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Critics) say we are increasing driving time, but what we are
concerned about is providing drivers with more rest,'' Longo said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when the proposal was first announced, Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said it would save 115 lives while
preventing 2,600 crashes and 3,000 serious injuries annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Daphne Izer, co-chair and founder of a Lisbon Falls,
Maine-based group called Parents Against Tried Truckers, charged
that the DOT proposal would encourage drivers to pull long shifts
and drive 12 hours straight. Izer, whose son was killed when his
car was struck by a driver who nodded off, said the long shifts
would result because many drivers are paid by the mile and not on
an hourly rate. So the more miles they can log, the more they get
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations have scheduled a news conference Tuesday
in front of the Capitol to protest the rule, which has received a
mixed response from the trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Associations, which represent truck
owners, said the proposal would force them to put additional trucks
on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal could mean a 50 percent increase in the number
of refrigerated and dry van trucks on our already-crowded
highways,'' the associations said in a statement. ``That translates
into as many as 180,000 additional drivers and trucks on the road
just to keep the current economy moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Black, a spokesman for the Teamsters Union, which represents
about 175,000 truck drivers that the rule would affect, said the
labor organization is ``concerned'' over the increased time behind
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   DOT is allowing the truck drivers and owners as well as
interested citizens to submit comments until October. Afterward,
the agency could take several more months to publish a final
regulation.

NADER LAWSUIT SAYS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES ARE TOO MUCH LIKE BEER
ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Presidential debates are so dependent on corporate
sponsorship they are getting to look like the Bud Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the complaint expressed in a lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court here Monday by Ralph Nader, the Green Party
presidential candidate, along with celebrity plaintiffs Susan
Sarandon and Phil Donahue and others.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which the plaintiffs say could affect this fall's
presidential debates, says that corporate financing of the debates
amounts to an illegal corporate campaign contribution. It asks the
court to strike down the Federal Election Commission regulations
that allow corporations _ like Anheuser-Busch, the maker of
Budweiser and a sponsor of this fall's debates _ to contribute
millions of dollars to the staging of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turning our presidential debates into a beer
commercial,'' Nader said in a telephone interview. ``And these
companies are really sponsoring an exclusive to our campaign
commercial for Bush and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907, almost all corporate financing of campaigns has been
banned; only a few small exceptions are allowed, like money for
general get-out-the-vote efforts. But the FEC's rules specify that
if presidential debates establish objective criteria for selecting
candidates who take part, then they can receive corporate financing
without it being considered a campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   That is wrong, said John C. Bonifaz, executive director of the
National Voting Rights Institute, a nonprofit group specializing in
campaign finance litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Giving money to the debates ``is, in our view, a means by which
major corporations curry favor with the major parties in a way that
completely undermines the very spirit and essence of the
prohibition on corporate contributions,'' Bonifaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Lewis, a lawyer with Palmer &AMP; Dodge, a firm in Boston that
is handling the suit with the National Voting Rights Institute,
also used the beer commercial analogy: ``The debates this fall look
like the Bud Bowl,'' he said in a statement. ``Federal law requires
an overhaul of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints are not new to the Commission on Presidential
Debates, which was set up in 1987. At least two other challenges to
the debates are under way this year, said Janet H. Brown, the
commission's executive director. There has also been a similar
challenge raised by the Libertarian Party in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined to comment on the election law that allows the
corporate financing. But, she said, ``I can say that the
commission's donors do not have, and never have had, any input on
any substantive decisions that we have made, whether it's regarding
the number, schedule and format of the debates, who is invited to
debate or any other substantive piece of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has set three criteria this year for who can
debate, she said: The candidate must be constitutionally eligible
for the presidency (that is, old enough and native born); must be
on enough state ballots to have a chance at securing enough votes
in the electoral college to win; and must be garnering at least 15
percent in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Recent national polls show support for Nader at about 4 to 6
percent, although one recent survey put his support in California
at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that if the court ruled against him but he earned
enough support to take part in the debate, he would participate.
But ``one of the first things I would say is that these debates
should never be funded by corporate money in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debates are scheduled for Boston on Oct. 3, then
Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis. Brown declined to comment on
the suit's chances of derailing the debates. She said only, ``The
plans we have under way are the result of already more than two
years' worth of work, and I hope very much they will stay on
track.''

VENTURE FUND TIES FUTURE TO GENOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With a first draft of the map of the human genome still
pending, Applied Genomic Technology Capital Fund LP Monday became
the first venture firm devoted exclusively to forming companies
that sell genome-related products and services to the
pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. fund, which has a San Francisco office,
plans to create as many as 30 companies over the next three years.
The companies will apply genetic information and discoveries to
computer software and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to take the discoveries from genomics and the
tools from information technology and find commercial
applications,'' said Noubar B. Afeyan, founder and managing
partner. Afeyan said his firm seeks to ``create a new breed of
company with a different investment thesis, one that will get
revenues and grow more quickly than the biotech firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Afeyan is no stranger to biotechnology. He created PerSeptive
Biosystems of Framingham, an advanced instruments company, in the
early 1990s before selling it to what is now PE Corp. of Norwalk,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   His new firm, Applied Genomic, has commitments for $70 million
in initial capital. Its goal is to raise $150 million to $200
million from a combination of institutional investors and
corporations, Afeyan said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him at Applied Genomic are David K. Stone, the former
managing director and biotechnology analyst at Cowen &AMP; Co. in
Boston; Nancy M. Crowell, a former partner and managing director at
Cowen in San Francisco; and Edwin M. Kania Jr., cofounder of
OneLiberty Ventures, one of the key sponsors of the new venture
capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Afeyan said the new venture firm was formed by OneLiberty
Ventures and NewcoGen Group, a company Afeyan launched last fall to
develop new concepts in the life science and information technology
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Other early investors in Applied Genomic are Affymetrix Inc. of
Santa Clara, Calif., Antigenics Inc. of Woburn, Millennium
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge, Paine Webber Group Inc., and
some private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Applied genomic companies combine information technology,
specifically the use of software and the Internet, with knowledge
of the human genome _ the 46 chromosomes containing strands of DNA
that run 3 billion letters long. A sequencing of the DNA, the first
draft of which is due out this summer, fits on a CD-ROM; it is
considered biology's equivalent to chemistry's periodic table of
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new map to create drugs, diagnostic exams, and other
medical therapies is part of the field known as applied genomics.
It is expected to be the major focus of pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies over the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Genomic Technology, along with other biotech and health
care venture capital companies, wants to provide the software tools
and other products and services that will enable drug companies to
develop the next generation of genetically based medicines.
</P>
<P>
   MPN Capital of Cambridge, which recently raised $600 million in
a new venture fund, plans to invest in applied genomic companies as
part of its biotech strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applied genomics is the new buzzword among venture
capitalists, some of whom are forming new funds that put biology
and information technology together,'' said Thomas Salemi, editor
of Venture Capital and Healthcare, a Wellesley-based newsletter
published by Asset Alternatives Inc. that follows the venture
capital industry.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier &AMP; Co., a nine-year-old health care venture capital firm
in Seattle, recently formed Frazier Technology Ventures, whose
mission includes funding the development of start-ups that combine
genomics with computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not focused exclusively on genomics, but we are looking
at it very closely as a new investment area,'' said Philip Borden,
an analyst at Frazier Technology Ventures.

NIGERIA FINDS MILLIONS LOOTED UNDER ABACHA IN LIECHTENSTEIN BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Representatives of Nigeria said Monday that they had
found bank accounts in Liechtenstein that probably held tens of
millions of dollars looted under Gen. Sani Abacha, the former
dictator of Nigeria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sums in Liechtenstein are in addition to much larger
accounts already located in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Britain.
Officials estimate that $1.6 billion in accounts in those countries
is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In Liechtenstein, documents show that more than $150 million had
been transferred to two banks and that a third bank had five
accounts where sizable deposits had been made by members of
Abacha's family, according to lawyers for the Nigerian government.
They are trying to have the money returned to the government.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to report the exact amounts are under way with
Vaduz. In the past, the tiny principality between Switzerland and
Austria did not report any figures. But a stepped-up campaign to
rid links to money laundering has made cooperation much more
likely, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have irrefutable proof of the transfer of sums stripped from
the Central Bank of Nigeria, which were then sent to
Liechtenstein,'' the chief lawyer for the Nigerian government in
the case, Enrico Monfrini. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The paper trail shows that $100 million was transferred to the
Verwaltungs-und Privatsbank and $50 million to the Liechtenstein
Landsbank from banks or companies with ties to Abacha family
members, a lawyer said. Abacha is accused of stripping Nigeria's
oil wealth of billions of dollars in his five years in power. He
died in 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five family accounts have also been found in the Liechtenstein
Global Trust Bank, controlled by Prince Philipp, brother of the
country's monarch, Hans Adam II, according to investigators. The
police in Liechtenstein raided the bank last week as part of an
inquiry into money laundering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of large sums of money is quite likely to add to
pressure on Liechtenstein, a well-known tax shelter, to change its
secretive banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has accused Abacha, his family and business associates of
embezzling billions, much of it through the central bank. The
largest suspect sum is $654 million in Switzerland, including in
Credit Suisse, one of the largest banks. Investigators said they
had found $630 million in MM Warburg &AMP; Co., a private bank in
Luxembourg, under false names used by the general's sons, Mohammed
and Abba. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Swiss authorities indicted Mohammed Abacha, who is
already in jail in Lagos while awaiting trial in the murder in 1996
of the wife of the late opposition leader. The Swiss charged him
with corruption and money laundering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the millions deposited in the Landsbank were part of an
estimated $250 million in bribes given for General Abacha's support
of $2.5 billion in steel-related projects, a lawyer for Nigeria
said. The Ajoakutu steel works has been at the center of much of
the investigation. Investigators said they had found $300 million
in the United Kingdom in recent months, transferred there to pay
Russian companies to build the factory. A financier Geneva is
seeking that money. He contends that the Russians signed over the
debt to him.

SENATE TO VOTE ON HATE CRIMES BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crimes shocked the country as much for their
evidence of bigotry as for their gruesome quality: an
African-American man, dragged to his death in Texas; a gay college
student tied to a fence and beaten to death; Jewish schoolchildren
in California, terrorized by a gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for the first time, the US Senate will hold a recorded
vote on whether these ``hate crimes'' should be punishable under
federal law, and whether the current law should be expanded to
prosecute violence motivated by gender, sexual orientation, and
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides in both parties said the measure, sponsored by
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has a strong chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is expected to be close, and some Senate aides were
predicting a 50-50 tally _ meaning Vice President Al Gore could
make the dramatic political gesture of breaking the tie. Gore has
criticized Texas Governor George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, for his objection to a hate-crimes
law in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is seen as having dim prospects in the House, where
Republican leaders succeeded in killing a similar measure last
year. But in the Senate, sentiments, and some votes, have shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death on a dusty Texas
road, something happened to me. I was horrified beyond my ability
to express it,'' Senator Gordon Smith, Republican of Oregon, told a
hushed Senate chamber Monday. ``When Matthew Shepard was beaten to
death on a Wyoming prarie, left on a fence to die, something
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had been reluctant to create a special crime
category for gays because he does not support their lifestyle,
which he described as a ``sin.'' But ``I have come to realize that
hate crimes are different. Hate crimes are visited upon one person,
but they're directed at an entire community,'' said Smith, who is a
cosponsor of Kennedy's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying to fellow Christians everywhere is that it's
time to say to the gay community, I do not agree with you on
everything, but I can help you,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The current law allows federal prosecution of hate crimes under
limited circumstances. The crimes must be based on race, color,
religion, or national origin, and prosecutors must show that the
victim was prevented by the crime from participating in some
federally-protected activity, such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy proposal, offered as an amendment to a Defense
Department spending bill, would require the Justice Department to
prove only that the crimes interfered with interstate commerce _ a
very broad criterion. Further, it would expand protection to
victims of crimes motivated by sexual orientation, disability and
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes ``wound not only the individual, but they also wound
and scar a community,'' Kennedy said during the floor debate. ``We
have had enough of Matthew Shepard cases. We have had enough of the
kinds of vicious murders based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's bill would also allow the Justice Department to award
grants of up to $100,000 to state and local law enforcement
agencies that incur extraordinary expenses in prosecuting hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation have long argued that ``all crimes
are hate crimes'' and say the prosecutions should be left to the
states. Forty-two states, including Massachusetts, have hate-crimes
laws, but not all are as sweeping as the Kennedy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill, ranging from the families of Shepard and
Byrd to law enforcement officers and President Clinton, continued a
heavy lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes that are motivated by hate really are fundamentally
different, and I believe should be treated differently under the
law,'' Clinton told guests at a reception for the Southwest Voter
Registration Project in Houston. Earlier, the president met
privately with Byrd's sister and nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views toward this issue went 180 degrees after I got
involved in the investigation of Matthew's death,'' said David
O'Malley, commander of the Laramie, Wyo., police department.
O'Malley will be in Washington Tuesday to lobby for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's bill faces two major obstacles to becoming law: a much
weaker, competing measure by Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of
Utah, and the adamant opposition to hate-crimes legislation in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has the option of approving one or both of the
hate-crimes proposals. To become law, the House would have to agree
to it in a House-Senate negotiations conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of now, the chances are really slim, because the Republican
leadership is dead-set against it,'' said Representative Barney
Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, a backer of the Kennedy measure.
But ``political pressure has been known to turn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents hope that the weight of a recorded vote passing the
legislation would nudge the House to accept it. The horrific tales
of the victims of bias-based violence may also force the House's
hand, backers hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they (the GOP leadership) have softened, as least
from my perception,'' said Representative Mark Foley, Republican of
Florida, who arranged a meeting between Shepard's parents and House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were taken by both the police officers' arguments
and by the Shephards' loss. I think there is a bit of a more
intellectual understanding of what we're trying to accomplish
here.''

HEARING TO WEIGH SKAKEL'S CULPABILITY IN MOXLEY MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years after teenager Martha Moxley was discovered
murdered on her Greenwich, Conn., estate, Michael Skakel will enter
a juvenile courtroom Tuesday to discover whether he will stand
trial in the brutal slaying of his former next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old nephew of Ethel Kennedy, whose entire adult life
has been shadowed by speculation linked to the killing, will hear
what evidence the prosecution has collected to convince Judge
Maureen Dennis that ``reasonable cause'' exists to try him for the
crime as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, to be held in a small courtroom in Stamford, Conn.,
will be a mini-trial that is expected to last several days. Because
Skakel was 15 at the time of the murder, Dennis also must decide
whether any trial should be held in juvenile or Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel would face from 25 years to life if convicted as an
adult. The stabbing and bludgeoning death shocked exclusive
Greenwich and prompted a quarter-century of speculation and
innuendo, as well as true-crime books, fictional accounts, and
extensive print and broadcast coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Michael ``Mickey'' Sherman, Skakel's attorney, said he remains
confident the state does not have the evidence to reach the
``reasonable cause'' threshold required in juvenile cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm familiar with the quality of the state's case . . . and I
believe it will never pass scrutiny,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   When the state begins to press its argument for a trial,
prosecutor Jonathan C. Benedict is expected to question former
students from the Elan School, a Maine treatment center for
adolescents with substance-abuse problems, who reportedly heard
Skakel confess to the murder during his stay there from 1978 to
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly with the Elan people, the (prosecution) will try to
connect Michael Skakel to that crime,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman will be allowed to cross-examine state witnesses, but
juvenile-court rules in Connecticut do not allow defense witnesses
in ``reasonable cause'' hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sherman and Benedict have indicated that, if Dennis does
not find ``reasonable cause,'' Skakel is likely to avoid any future
prosecution in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, the state's attorney for Fairfield County, could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he expects Benedict will also call Greenwich police
officers to the stand as well as other crime-scene witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That scene horrified residents of the gated Belle Haven
neighborhood in Greenwich. Moxley, 15, had been struck savagely
with a golf club belonging to Skakel's late mother. She also had
been stabbed with the club's shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel originally told police that he and a group of teenagers
had left Moxley to drive his cousin home on the night of Oct. 30,
1975, and that he had gone to bed when he returned later.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a private investigation commissioned by his family
in 1992, Skakel reportedly said that, before going to bed, he
walked on the Moxley property and tried to attract Martha's
attention without success.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective who wrote
a book about the Moxley murder, has theorized that this altered
alibi is Skakel's attempt to account for his whereabouts if new
evidence places him at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman named Skakel as the likely suspect in his 1998 book
``Murder in Greenwich.'' That same year, Benedict requested that a
grand jury be named to reexamine the evidence, resulting in
Skakel's indictment this January.
</P>
<P>
   For Dorthy Moxley, Martha's mother, the hearing is vindication
of her years-long effort to retain public interest in the case.
Moxley will travel from her New Jersey home to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad when it's over,'' Moxley said last week.

IN BERLIN, THE DOG POLICE TRY TO CURB DANGEROUS PETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ With a German husband, 13 years in Germany and three
children born here, Stacy Wiedenmann of Chicago thought she had a
fair grasp of her adoptive land. But that was before Cora stepped
into her life.
</P>
<P>
   Cora is a mid-size black mongrel that scarcely advertises her
power to metamorphose a life. But take her out onto the leafy
streets of Berlin and the effect on people is dramatic: German
reserve abruptly gives way to Neapolitan gregariousness.
</P>
<P>
   How sweet, the passersby coo as they coddle Cora, how simply
lovely. When did you get her? Where? Is she already house-trained?
Well, isn't that something! How about meeting to walk our dogs and
compare notes?
</P>
<P>
   Wiedenmann, 39, is in a state of shock. She had one child, then
another, then a third, walked with them in her neighborhood and
nobody ever said a word. No candy was offered, no hair ruffled, no
age asked, no tenderness displayed. The children seemed as
invisible as Cora seems conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing; everyone suddenly talks to me,'' said
Wiedenmann, who acquired Cora a few weeks ago. ``Perhaps Germans
like dogs more than kids; certainly they talk to you through dogs.
I think they feel more comfortable because a child is personal,
perhaps too personal. So a dog becomes the ideal passport to social
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a formal country, full of regulations governing
everything from times of day when children are supposed to be quiet
to the lace curtains to be placed on certain windows. But dogs defy
Germanic rules _ unleashing passions, unbuttoning the standoffish,
unveiling a charged universe of canine chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So charged that Otto Schily, the interior minister, recently
spent two days locked in dog discussions with his counterparts in
Germany's 16 states. Newspapers were full of images of raging pit
bulls and hideous dog-bite wounds as the ministers debated what to
do about the growing number of so-called Kampfhunde, or attack
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the weighty weekly Die Zeit joined the fray with a
prominent article offering the view that, ``If nuclear power
stations in this country had caused as many dead and injured people
as attack dogs, they would all have been shut down a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   When Berlin's interior minister proposed a ban on Kampfhunde,
the owners of such dogs called for a demonstration at which their
pets would wear a Star of David meant to symbolize what they
claimed was Hitler's comparable hounding of Jews. After protests
from the Jewish organizations, an apology was offered and the idea
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the general brouhaha that the ministers were unable to
reach any firm decisions. In a statement last month, they noted the
importance of appropriate training, suggested that the aggressivity
of a particular breed was not easy to assess, and left states to
determine whether certain dogs deemed dangerous should be banned,
heavily taxed, or made available only with special licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, nothing changed. With approximately 200,000 dogs in
Berlin, perhaps 14,000 of them attack dogs, and an estimated 50,000
people a year getting bitten by dogs in Germany, tensions between
dog owners and their opponents continue to run high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The German dog lobby is like the Miami Cuban lobby _ nobody
can touch it,'' said Peter Schneider, a Berlin author distressed by
the ministers' indecision and this city's proliferation of dogs.
(The Berlin police reported 2,600 bites in the city last year,
compared with 1,750 in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog is so close to the German soul that not even an
estimated 20 tons of dog excrement a day, much of it on the street,
produces an official response.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that while in general Germans see their role as not
only obeying laws but also enforcing them _ denouncing a car
illegally parked or a branch illegally cut from a protected tree _
they display no similar zeal for reporting canine infractions like
soiling city streets to the police. At once objects of love and
complete control, dogs thrive here.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay called ``Of Dogs and Germans,'' inspired a decade
ago by an outburst of national soul-searching over what to do with
the 5,000 dogs that had guarded the Berlin Wall and were marooned
by its fall, Schneider concluded that a German without a German
shepherd was incomplete and that the German capacity to empathize
with a dog's suffering was boundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Adolf Hitler was so disappointed with his Germans that he
shot himself inside his bunker, he not only left his people without
their Fuehrer, but a German shepherd without its master _ an event
that inspired Guenter Grass to write a 700-page novel entitled `Dog
Years,''' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wiedenmann's dog years have just begun; to keep them calm she
has enrolled Cora at Pro Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Courses at Pro Dog, an obedience school for mutts and pedigrees
alike, include seminars on dog psychology, leash technique and
human-canine communication. Training is also offered in
``high-stress dog situations,'' such as riding the subway and
taking your dog shopping or to a restaurant, all popular practices
here.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-week courses are of a kind widely followed in a country
where dog discipline is taken seriously and woods echo to the
come-hither cry of ``Platz!'' The courses lead to a qualification
called Hundefuehrerschein I, a sort of dog degree.
</P>
<P>
   An advanced degree, comparable to a dog doctorate and known as
Hundefuehrerschein II, involves advanced canine concepts such as
managing your dog without a leash. It can be had with another 10
weeks of study under Renate Albrecht, the animal psychologist in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a bad breed of dog, only bad and
ignorant dog owners,'' contended Albrecht, who trained in
Switzerland. ``All this talk about attack dogs is rubbish meant to
generate mass hysteria and pressure politicians to do something.
The only thing required is that people learn how to look after
their dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate her point, Albrecht has five dogs _ Charlotte,
Amanda, Archibald, Goofy and Bandit _ four of which are
mastiff-like dogues de Bordeaux that are officially classified as
Kampfhunde. The official danger list also includes pit bulls and
American Staffordshire bull terriers.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs sprawl on her office floor, presenting nothing more
menacing than their snoring and intermittent stench. Apologizing
for the smell, Albrecht explained that a dog is not a human.
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to squeeze a dog's nose to convey displeasure,
Albrecht noted. She squeezed Amanda's amorphous nose to show what
she meant; Amanda acquiesced. ``You see how good she is,'' Albrecht
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody sees that goodness. ``People regularly come up
to me when I am walking my dogs and say the dogs should be
gassed,'' Albrecht said. ``Can you imagine? Gassed. With our
history. Gas them all, they say. It makes me shudder.''
</P>
<P>
   The obverse of such anger is an overflowing canine compassion.
Take Cora. Her mother was found injured on a Greek beach and
brought to Berlin for treatment. Abandoned dogs are regularly
brought back from vacations in Spain and Italy for salvation
through German goodness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are crazy,'' Wiedenmann said. ``They'll do
anything for a dog and they really, deeply believe that dogs should
be well-adjusted psychologically.''

NASDAQ JAPAN OPENS WITH LOW-VOLUME TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese offshoot of Nasdaq began trading eight
stocks Monday in a technically smooth but low-volume start to what
represents the first time a stock exchange has tried to go global.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a bit of time to really unfold in its full
form, but it's going to succeed,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq
market in the United States. He likened the new market's opening to
planting a flag on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was extremely low, with only about 660,000 shares
changing hands, as opposed to the hundreds of millions of shares
that are routinely traded daily at Nasdaq Japan's American cousin.
But the low volume had been expected because Japanese law imposes
severe restrictions on how many shares small start-up companies can
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Daily limits on price movements in Japan may have contributed to
the low volume as well. When shares are driven to extremely high
prices, there are difficulties in matching buy orders and sell
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the low volume Monday was the impending
public offering of shares in the Japanese units of Morningstar, the
U.S. investment research firm, and ETrade, the online brokerage
firm. Those stocks will list in the next couple of weeks, and there
was speculation that investors who might have bought shares on the
new exchange Monday were waiting until then.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight issues that began trading on the new exchange
Monday, four were up, one was unchanged and three fell.
</P>
<P>
   Masternet, an Internet mail service provider that transferred
its shares from Jasdaq, the over-the-counter market that
historically was Japan's answer to Nasdaq, provided a good example
of how an inability to buy and sell might affect the market. Only
18 of its shares changed hands, but that was enough to move its
share price by 300,000 yen, or about $2,830 at current exchange
rates, to 1.65 million yen each.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Nasdaq Japan has ambitions to become the market of
choice for the new economy, it was odd that shares of Sugi
pharmacy, a retail drugstore operator that went public Monday, were
the new market's best performers and accounted for most of the
volume. Sugi shares rose 2,000 yen, their limit, to 9,000 yen, with
651,000 changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   While foreign brokerage firms and asset managers have commended
Nasdaq Japan for its efforts to enhance disclosure and bring new
companies to market, the Japanese reaction has been more tepid.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the muted reaction by Japanese brokers and fund
managers reflects a diminished appetite for technology-related
stocks, which dominate the new exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers here also note that investors who bought shares that
float on Mothers, a similar exchange started in December by the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, have largely been disappointed. Seven of the
10 stocks listed there are currently trading below their initial
public offering price.
</P>
<P>
   The new market has also been dogged by some early missteps of
the National Association of Securities Dealers and its joint
venture partner in Nasdaq Japan, the Softbank Corp., the Japanese
Internet investment company. The partners did not give Japanese
officials an early warning about their plans, which reportedly
rankled some bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the establishment's wariness of the new market has been
reflected in recent stories by the Yomiuri Shimbun, a large
conservative daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Its English-language paper ran a story on the front page Monday
headlined, ``Nasdaq Japan to face close scrutiny,'' in which it
reported that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission,
which polices Japan's markets, would be monitoring the new exchange
from its headquarters in Tokyo, not the regional office that
oversees the Osaka exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said the agency wanted to guard against the
manipulation that can happen when there are a relatively limited
number of shares and daily restraints on price movements. But
Hiromitsu Mori, deputy director of the coordination and inspection
division of the agency, said it also monitors the Mothers exchange
from the Tokyo headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In neither its Japanese version nor its English-language version
did the Yomiuri point that out.

COURT BANS STUDENT-LED PRAYERS AT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Ala.)  (See also SCOTUS-TRADE) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Strongly reaffirming its earlier decisions against
officially sponsored prayer in public schools, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday that prayers led by students at high school football
games are no exception: As officially sanctioned acts at events
that students feel great social pressure to attend, they are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens said that
even when attendance is voluntary and when the decision to pray is
made by students, ``the delivery of a pregame prayer has the
improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act
of religious worship.''
</P>
<P>
   The case came from a small school district in South Texas,
typical of communities across the South where the practice of
prayer at graduations, assemblies and athletic contests has
persisted as officials have attempted to navigate the obstacle
course created by Supreme Court and lower court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New
Orleans, had ruled that students could offer prayers at graduations
_ where members of the clergy cannot, under a 1992 Supreme Court
decision _ but not in the ``far less solemn and extraordinary''
setting of a football game.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday did not explicitly address graduation
ceremonies, but the majority's analysis cast serious doubt on the
increasingly popular practice of student-led graduation prayers.
The justices have been asked to hear a challenge to an Alabama law,
upheld last year by a federal appeals court, that permits
``student-initiated voluntary prayer'' at graduations as well as
other events.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision Monday was not a surprise, given the
justices' evident skepticism about the Santa Fe Independent School
District's prayer policy when the case was argued in March, it was
nonetheless notable in several respects. One was the majority's
firm rejection of the school district's central argument in defense
of its policy: the prayers were private student speech that could
not be attributed to the school district itself and that could not
be considered an unconstitutional ``establishment'' of religion in
violation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the district had argued, to hold that students could not
express their religious views would create a separate First
Amendment problem, amounting to the censorship of religious speech
in a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not private speech and a football game is not a
public forum for unbridled free expression, Stevens said. ``These
invocations are authorized by a government policy and take place on
government property at government-sponsored school-related
events,'' he said, adding that any member of the audience would
perceive the student prayer as stamped with the school's ``seal of
approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said: ``Contrary to the district's repeated assertions
that it has adopted a `hands-off' approach to the pregame
invocation, the realities of the situation plainly reveal that its
policy involves both perceived and actual endorsement of
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in contrast to a public forum, in which
contrasting views are welcome, the Santa Fe policy ``allows only
one student, the same student for the entire season, to give the
invocation.'' He said the policy clearly indicated, without saying
so explicitly, that what was expected was a religious message,
``suggesting that a solemn, yet nonreligious, message, such as
commentary on United States foreign policy, would be prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   In an acerbic dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said the majority opinion ``bristles with hostility to
all things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``neither the holding nor the tone of the opinion
is faithful to the meaning of the Establishment Clause,'' at least
as understood by George Washington, who proclaimed a day of
``public thanksgiving and prayer'' at the request of ``the very
Congress which passed the Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said the majority was adopting so rigid a view of
church-state separation that ``under the court's logic, a public
school that sponsors the singing of the national anthem before
football games violates the Establishment Clause'' because the
concluding verse contains the phrase ``And this be our motto: `In
God is our trust.'''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined the chief
justice's dissenting opinion. The majority opinion was joined by
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens appeared to go out of his way to refute the dissenters'
charge that the majority was hostile to religion. ``By no means,''
he said, did the Constitution ``impose a prohibition on all
religious activity in our public schools'' or stop ``any public
school student from voluntarily praying at any time before, during,
or after the school day.'' He added: ``But the religious liberty
protected by the Constitution is abridged when the state
affirmatively sponsors the particular practice of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe, No.
99-62, began in 1995 when two families, one Mormon and the other
Catholic, sued to stop a variety of religious practices in the
4,000-student district near Galveston, Texas. Permitted by the U.S.
District Court to proceed anonymously because of the possibility of
harassment, the plaintiffs won an initial ruling that prompted
several changes in the school district's policy as the litigation
continued.
</P>
<P>
   As it came before the Supreme Court, the latest policy _ which
had never taken effect because of the lower court decisions _
provided for two student elections, one to decide whether there
would be prayer at football games, and a second to select the
student who would lead the prayer for the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices objected Monday that the majority lacked
a basis for striking down the policy on its face, but should let it
take effect and see if any problems developed. But the majority
declared firmly that there was no need to wait. In fact, Stevens
said, the election system itself was part of the constitutional
problem ``because it establishes an improper majoritarian election
on religion'' and ``encourages divisiveness along religious
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Also notable was the majority's rejection of the school
district's effort to describe the policy as a ``content-neutral''
effort to provide a solemn atmosphere at football games. ``We
refuse to turn a blind eye to the context in which this policy
arise,'' Stevens said, ``and that context quells any doubt that
this policy was implemented with the purpose of endorsing school
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who signed the state's brief in
support of the school district, called the ruling
``disappointing.'' In a statement put out by his office in Austin,
he said: ``I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in
voluntary, student-led prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards
Association, praised the decision and said she would now advise
school districts to regard student-led prayers at graduation as
unconstitutional as well. ``This decision emphasizes that we don't
have prayer at school-sponsored events, period,'' she said in an
interview, adding: ``Children shouldn't be made to feel excluded or
coerced.''

`PLOWING THE DARK': IMAGINARY LIVES, BUILT IN EMPTY ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two protagonists of Richard Powers' new novel, ``Plowing the
Dark,'' each spend their days in empty rooms, living through their
imaginations. These two characters never meet each other; their
stories never converge. The first, a woman named Adie, is an artist
who is helping to construct a virtual-reality chamber in Seattle in
the late 1980s; the second is an American hostage in Lebanon, a man
named Tai Martin, who passes his days in captivity trying to
reimagine his former life.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these two characters form the armature of
Powers' highly schematic novel of ideas, a static if often
provocative book that reads like a series of essays with a couple
of glittering fictional set pieces tossed in to grab the reader's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The central theme of ``Plowing'' is the human urge to recreate
the world, be it through the imaginative transactions of art, the
generative miracles of science or the grinding gears of memory.
This rage to simulate reality comes, Powers suggests, from our
desire to control our environment, somehow to subdue the random
terrors of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old utopian dream of creating a world obedient to our
will, a world where ``all countries move steadily toward democratic
free markets,'' where ``zealots, on the road to some mass
persecution, fall down blind and rise ecumenical,'' where
``criminals come across life-changing novels in prison,'' where
``each day ends in some illustrative sunset, shattering or
subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   The utopian undertaking in which Adie is involved concerns the
construction of the Cavern, a ``second-generation, experimental,
total-immersion environment modeler'' for a huge Seattle-based
high-tech company that sounds a bit like Microsoft. The Cavern is a
sort of postmodern version of Plato's cave: a room that will
transport visitors to virtual realms where they will be bewitched
and bedazzled by a magical shadow show made up of ``a few trillion
bits of math.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a theme-park feel to the Cavern: it's part World's Fair
exhibit, part Disneyland, but with a messianic gloss. Its creators
see it as a stepping stone on the way to a digital future in which
transistors will be implanted in the human brain and
``belief-quality graphics'' will adorn the living room walls of
every middle-class home.
</P>
<P>
   While Adie doesn't really buy into her colleagues' faith in a
high-tech future, much less understand the tools of their craft,
she does see the Cavern as a wonderful plaything, a new medium in
which to work her gifts as an artist. She designs one virtual realm
modeled on a Rousseau painting, a jungly room with monkeys and
snakes and palmy trees; another is modeled on van Gogh's painting
of his room in Arles, its tilted floorboards and walls all
meticulously reproduced through the alchemy of algorithms and
computer code.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his 1995 novel ``Galatea 2.2,'' Powers uses his
interest in technology to raise a host of questions, in this case
questions about the relationship between reality and illusion,
science and art, truth and perception. While these questions are
initially engaging, he natters on about them at tiresome length, to
the point where cerebral speculation overwhelms the story of Adie
and her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much talk about the Cavern and how it works and what
it means that Adie's nonvirtual encounters _ her affair with an old
friend and fellow worker named Steve and their visit to an ailing
college friend in Ohio _ begin to feel like hasty afterthoughts
grafted on to a philosophical treatise. Matters are not helped by
Powers' portentous references to the momentous changes taking place
in the world beyond the Cavern: Tiananmen Square, the fall of the
Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the beginnings of
the Persian Gulf war.
</P>

   As for the second story line in ``Plowing the Dark,'' the story
concerning the kidnapping and imprisonment of Tai Martin by
terrorists in Lebanon, it reprises many of the themes of Adie's
tale. But while Adie and her Cavern friends rely upon technology to
midwife their visions, Tai has nothing but his own imagination to
wallpaper the drab walls of his cell. As his weeks in captivity
stretch into months, he tries to pass the time by rerunning novels
like ``Great Expectations'' in his head, and trying to reconstitute
his former life with mosaic shards of memory and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Powers does a persuasive job of conveying the terror, loneliness
and wasting boredom that Tai faces day after day: the appearance of
a mouse in his grungy cell thrills him with the prospect of making
a connection to another living creature; the tapping on the wall
from a prisoner in another cell gives him hope that gives way to
despair when the tapping abruptly stops.
</P>
<P>
   That Tai's story has far more emotional resonance than Adie's,
however, has less to do with the traumatic nature of his adventures
than with Powers' restraint in embroidering his story with the sort
of lugubrious philosophizing that weighs down the other portions of
this novel. Both stories illuminate the author's thesis about the
powers of the human imagination, but Adie's tale, which makes up
the bulk of this novel, remains a clumsy, paint-by-numbers
illustration, an illustration that, oddly enough, lacks the
requisite imagination to become a persuasive fiction.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Off Welfare Without Insurance &QL;   &UR; By Laura J. Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000
States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (June 19) - Pennsylvania ranks
15th nationwide for the largest number of uninsured adults,
according to a study released Monday by Families USA - a group
lobbying for universal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a parent works full time that parent is not going to
qualify for Medicaid in Pennsylvania.,'' said Rachel Klein, the
report's author. ``What we know of low-wage workers is that the
employer usually does not offer health insurance and if they do, it
is frequently too expensive for that worker to afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, basing her study on Census Bureau and state government
statistics, asserted that 945,880 low-income adults with children
were bumped from the Medicaid rolls nationwide since welfare reform
started in 1996. In the same period, 75,975 low-income Pennsylvania
parents became uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, a Pennsylvania parent in a three-person
family was dropped from Medicaid if he or she had an income of more
than $10,080 - 71percent of the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Income eligibility levels are set individually by each state. In
the report, a parent making more than 22 percent of the poverty
level, $3,168 a year, is ineligible for Medicaid in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid rolls have declined in the past four years by 27
percent, from 3.5 million to 2.5 people million nationwide. Georgia
had the largest decline in the percentage in parent Medicaid
enrollment with 51 percent leaving its rolls. In California 155,846
were dropped - the highest number for one state.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that many parents lost medical coverage when
state computers automatically took them off Medicaid when they
moved from welfare to work - as was the case in Pennsylvania.
Parents in other states also lost their coverage when caseworkers
failed to tell them about their continued Medicaid eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   While the report puts Pennsylvania among the top 15 states with
the largest number of uninsured parents, Klein also contended that
the some of the reasons that contributed to the number of uninsured
were being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Aspey, deputy press secretary for the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Welfare, said the computer glitch had been
fixed. And in April, 1999 the state sent out 32,000 cards to inform
former welfare recipients that they may be eligible for Medicaid
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The state plans to spend $17.5 million on the outreach effort -
including television advertisements and brochures placed inside
county offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably the only state that has seen a slight
increase,'' in the number of parents on Medicaid, Aspey said.
</P>
<P>
   Aspey said that while the number of Medicaid-insured adults
declined from 1.6 million in 1996 to 1.39 in December, 1999, there
was an increase of approximately 110,000 to 1.41 million this May.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Tom Ridge has proposed using the money Pennsylvania
gained from settling a lawsuit with tobacco companies last year to
insure those kicked off of Medicaid and without insurance.
Pennsylvania will receive $11 billion over the next 25 years from
the lawsuit, which was settled in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office expects the state legislature to take up
his proposal this fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the stern visage of Leon Trotsky glaring from a huge screen
behind the lectern, Dr. Joseph Lykken, a particle physicist at the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., launched
into his best parody of a coffee-house radical railing against the
counterrevolutionary tendencies of the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the many crimes of the bourgeois overlords of HEP and
their running dog lackeys is to have allowed the misapprehension
among students (and the public) that particle physics is almost
done,'' he declared in a manifesto delivered near the end of an
international conference on particle physics last August at
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``HEP,'' in the jargon, is high-energy physics, the attempt to
use powerful particle accelerators to study the tiniest pieces of
matter. Lykken was tired of hearing some of his own colleagues
lament that this centuries-long pursuit had run out of intellectual
steam and was coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trotsky was right,'' Lykken proclaimed as the image of the
dour Bolshevik and advocate of never-ending political upheaval
grimaced through his goatee. ``In fact high-energy physics is
exciting and will remain exciting precisely because it exists in a
state of permanent revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of impasse, the study of subatomic particles has
been undergoing something of a renaissance. A new generation of
physicists is stretching its collective mind and coming up with
radical ideas about how the universe may be constructed. Some are
proposing the existence of extra dimensions. Others are building
bridges between islands of thought that once seemed hopelessly
remote, rekindling hopes of a unified ``theory of everything'' that
would explain all the particles and forces of nature. Still others
are looking for the very building blocks of space and time. And,
most surprising of all, the young physicists are finding ways to
test indirectly even some of the wildest ideas with experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting time in high-energy physics,'' said
Dr. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a 28-year-old physicist at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory whose ideas on extra dimensions have
helped inspire a rethinking of superstring theory, the attempt to
explain matter and energy in terms of tiny vibrating strings.
``Three years ago, everyone thought that all possibilities for what
one could imagine seeing at high energies had been realized,'' he
said. ``This new work shows that you can see completely different
bizarre things.'' The ``whole shebang,'' he said, might be ``right
around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Spiropulu, a 30-year-old physicist who is getting her
doctorate in August, is searching for the hypothetical extra
dimensions by poring over data from accelerator experiments at
Fermilab. ``Whether it is extra dimensions or extra-anything that
will lead us to answers about how nature swings, we can only find
out really by means of experiment,'' she said. ``If it's not extra
dimensions, it will be something as crazy as extra dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   While she was studying physics, Congress canceled the
Superconducting Supercollider, a powerful accelerator that
theorists said was necessary to test recent ideas about the
universe. She was not upset one bit, and is determined to find
clever ways to try out new theories using the equipment already at
hand. ``How can anyone say that high-energy physics or whatever
field is over and dead? she said. ``We're always asking approximate
questions and giving approximate answers. Every time we phrase the
questions better, we have to work hard to get a better answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge is being led by people in their 20s and early 30s,
who chose to enter the field in the thick of the malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas have been coming so fast that Lykken, part of an older
generation who got doctorates back in the early 1980s, is convinced
that physics, far from being over, has barely begun. ``There is no
reason to imagine that we are near the end of this process,'' he
said in his lecture, ``barring the collapse of our civilization _
by which I mean, our funding gets cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Though exaggerating for effect and preaching a bit to the choir,
he was countering what until recently was a growing sense of gloom.
Particle physics, many wistfully believed, may have reached its
pinnacle some 30 years earlier with the soaring piece of
architecture called the Standard Model. According to this theory,
the culmination of decades of theorizing and experimentation,
matter is made from two kinds of particles: lightweight
``leptons,'' like the electron and neutrino, and quarks. Animating
these building blocks, causing them to join together and break
apart, are three kinds of forces: electromagnetism and the strong
and weak nuclear reactions. The forces are also made from
particles, called quanta. The photon, for example, carries
electromagnetism.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the Standard Model has been, surviving one
experimental challenge after another, there is much that it has not
explained. For one thing, it does not mention the fourth force,
gravity, which is described by a completely different theory called
General Relativity. Nor can the Standard Model say why the hundreds
of different particles come in such a bewildering variety of
masses, or why there are 4 forces instead of 5, or 27 or 43.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard Model seemed, when it was devised, like a rest stop
on a march toward something greater: a Grand Unified Theory
encompassing all the forces and explaining where the seemingly
arbitrary masses come from. But in the succeeding years, attempts
to go beyond the Standard Model hit one snag after another. The
feeling of discouragement reached its peak in 1993, with the death
of the Superconducting Supercollider. The tunnels that had been
partially dug to house the accelerator were abandoned. One company
inquired about using them as a mushroom farm.
</P>
<P>
   In its January millennium issue, Wired magazine, a barometer of
what is supposed to be technologically trendy, listed quarks among
tired old 20th-century ideas that would fade. ``Particle physics
has been gut-shot ever since the spectacular failure of the
Superconducting Supercollider,'' wrote Bruce Sterling, the
science-fiction writer who compiled the list. ``The next generation
of physicists is going where the real money is _ computer science.
At the end of the 20th century, the only thing more pitifully dated
than being an atom splitter is being a rocket scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the recent revival, even people in the field sometimes
feared becoming scientific has-beens. ``There were a lot of
depressed people running around,'' Lykken said.
</P>
<P>
   Some had put their hopes in superstring theory, which holds that
beneath the level of quarks and leptons are tinier entities called
strings. For the idea to work, the superstrings seemed to need the
extra wiggle room afforded by an inconceivable space consisting of
nine dimensions (10 counting time). But to explain why humans only
experience three of the dimensions, theorists were forced to assume
that the others must each be curled up too tiny to detect.
Superstring theory, some critics retorted, was more like medieval
theology than science: reality would be explained through pure
reason without the need for experiment. Adding to the frustration,
there seemed to be five candidate string theories with no sign of
which one explained this universe.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of superstring theory, more traditional approaches to
soup up the Standard Model also failed. Quarks come in three
different types whimsically called ``colors'': red, green and blue.
Maybe, some hoped, an even more abstract quality called technicolor
would solve the problems. Or perhaps a concept called
supersymmetry, which predicted a mirror world of particles with
names like squarks and sneutrinos, would plug the gaps in
understanding. But none of the embellishments seemed to help.
Either the ideas were wrong and the particles did not exist, or
physicists would need far more powerful accelerators _ and brains _
to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the mid-1990s, the conceptual logjam began to break.
The first wave of excitement came when theorists realized that the
five different string theories were just varying perspectives of
the same underlying idea. Five blind men had been looking at the
same elephant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Building on this and other ideas, a 29-year-old Argentinian
theorist named Juan Maldacena made a conceptual leap in 1997 that
many hope will point the way toward grand unification. In a paper
that caused a sensation among string theorists, he uncovered hints
of unexpected links between superstring theory and the Standard
Model. If he is right, then what seemed like two different
theoretical worlds, each with a different language, might be
reflections of a single underlying truth _ the ultimate theory.
</P>
<P>
   Maldacena's paper caused so much excitement that theorists at a
string theory conference the next year in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
literally danced for joy, grinding through the steps of the
macarena, shouting physics-filled lyrics that climaxed with the
refrain, ``Ehhh, Maldacena!''
</P>
<P>
   For all the light shed by Maldacena's conjecture, physicists
were still left with the problem of how to prove the existence of
the tiny dimensions. In 1998, Arkani-Hamed, then a 25-year-old
Stanford postdoctoral researcher, suggested a possible way out of
the dilemma. He and two colleagues _ another young physicist, Dr.
Gia Dvali, and a senior Stanford professor, Dr. Savas Dimopoulos _
made the startling suggestion that at least one of the extra
dimensions might be large enough to measure. What people had been
thinking of as the universe may actually be part of something
grander: a three-dimensional island floating inside a
fourth-dimension no more than a centimeter wide. (This may be
somewhat easier to visualize if you think of this universe as a
sheet of paper, a two-dimensional ``flatland'' light-years in
length and breadth, floating inside a narrow sliver of space.)
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a tight fit, but a centimeter is gargantuan
compared with the prevailing idea that the hidden dimensions are 10
to the minus 33 centimeters in size _ a billion trillion trillion
times smaller. This sprawling higher dimension has gone unnoticed,
the three scientists proposed, because the particles that make up
our own universe are stuck to the surface of the island, barred
from entering the surrounding space. But gravitons, the carriers of
gravity, can occasionally trickle into the netherworld. This
suggested ways to search for the extra dimension by looking for
hints of gravitational leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, two more theorists, Dr. Lisa Randall and Dr.
Raman Sundrum, both in their mid-30s, devised another theory in
which the universe is surrounded by a higher dimension, this one
infinite in size. Evidence is also being sought in accelerator
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ideas don't have to be realized in nature,''
Arkani-Hamed said. ``But if they are, this will run counter to the
whole idea of things being at an end and physics being reduced to
philosophy. I think it's amazing that it took 20 years until the
very simple but certainly radical ideas that we propose sort of
crashed the Standard Model and made it possible that traditional
particle physics could be string theory in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, two 30-year-old Stanford physicists, Dr. Shamit Kachru
and Dr. Eva Silverstein have been using large extra dimensions and
other ideas to try and explain a glaring problem in cosmology.
Scientists are becoming increasingly convinced that a strange
energy field described by a term called the cosmological constant
is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. Particle
physics, as it is currently understood, explains how this kind of
inflation can occur, but it predicts that the phenomenon should be
far more intense _ that the universe should be growing in leaps and
bounds, or rapidly collapsing in on itself. ``It looks like we are
really missing a crucial piece of physics here,'' Kachru said.
</P>
<P>
   The remedies they suggest are still very tentative, but
Silverstein said the joy was in the chase. ``It can be quite
thrilling to pursue an idea one finds exciting, or simply to
understand something about physics better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning idea of the quantum revolution in the early 20th
century was that energy is not smooth and continuous but comes in
discrete packets, the quanta. Another challenge of physics is to
see if time and space also have an internal structure. ``I always
thought that if we could look really close, space and space-time
would turn out to be not smooth and geometrical, as in Einstein's
theory, but `bumpy' and made up of building blocks,'' said Dr.
Fotini Markopoulou Kalamara, 29, a postdoctoral researcher
currently at Imperial College in London. She is part of a group of
theorists trying to show that space and time are built from
mathematical units called spin nets.
</P>
<P>
   With a slightly different turn of fate she might not have gone
into physics. As an undergraduate she spent a summer at a national
physics laboratory in England: ``My supervisor there told me many
times that I should not go into particle physics, that the era of
accelerators and great experiments was all over and it was a dying
field,'' Markopoulou said. ``In fact, he advised me to do biology,
which he thought was the science of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of all this, Arkani-Hamed said, is that theorists
should never assume they have already thought of every possibility
for how the world works. ``What it says to me is that you should
never underestimate the feebleness of the human imagination,'' he
said. ``We're really struggling in the dark.''

privatization, however, the company has done much worse. The price

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ When surgery showed that Dr. Henk
Laane's 77-year-old patient, a woman who had been in his care for
more than a decade, was riddled with cancer, she immediately asked
him to help her die.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Laane said no. There was no unbearable suffering, he
argued. There were still good times ahead. But when several months
had passed and she was in the grip of chronic diarrhea and nausea,
so much so that not an hour went by uninterrupted, Laane finally
agreed to help.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to die on her birthday and gathered her family around
her at home. When Laane arrived, she had a traditional Dutch bon
voyage cake ready for him and one for his nurse, and she asked that
the cakes be eaten first.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with everyone gathered at her bedside, Laane gave her an
injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never easy to help someone die,'' said Laane, a month
later. ``You take it with you. You bring it home. You don't sleep
so well after.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, mercy killings and assisted suicide of
terminally ill patients have been widely tolerated here. Over the
years, regulations have been developed making it less and less
likely that a doctor would be prosecuted for such acts.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the Netherlands is expected to adopt the least
restrictive law on mercy killing and assisted suicide in the world,
and Laane's actions last April 15 would be legalized. The new law,
which almost everyone here expects will be passed in the fall,
would allow help to die for people ranging from Alzheimer's disease
sufferers to perhaps even terminally ill children as young as 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch are not alone in Europe in moving toward legalization
of mercy killing and assisted suicide. Belgium has been debating
legalizing euthanasia for months, with more than 40 witnesses
appearing before its parliament. Switzerland allows assisted
suicide under some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many other European countries have high-powered committees
reviewing the issue, including one in France that recently
recommended that euthanasia be considered in certain cases. And,
euthanasia activists say their ranks are growing. For less than a
year, euthanasia was legal in part of Australia, but that law has
since been repealed. In the United States, Oregon allows assisted
suicide in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Netherlands remains the only country that has
tolerated it for years, and now lawmakers and health officials say
the aim of the new legislation is to make sure that what happens
during a patient's final hours happens in the open, where it can be
scrutinized and regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say that between 1990 and 1995, when new
regulations made it easier to admit to euthanasia, the percentage
of cases reported to the authorities more than doubled. But even
then, anonymous surveys indicate, doctors were not reporting 60
percent of their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it remains a punishable offense, we will never see the
transparency that we are aiming for,'' said Jacob Visser, a
spokesman for the medical ethics division of the Health Ministry
which, along with the country's Justice Ministry, helped shape the
bill. ``To get that, we must get this out of the criminal system.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over euthanasia has raged here for more than two
decades. But surveys show that it has increasingly won popular
support. A 1998 survey showed that more than 90 percent of the
population is now in favor. Yet the details of exactly when it
should be administered and to whom are still hotly contested.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, unveiled last fall in parliament, triggered more than
540 questions from legislators and activists during the review
process, among the most government officials had ever gotten. They
say they are still scrambling to answer all those questions before
the summer break. Many experts believe that some changes will be
made before the bill is voted on this fall, including raising the
age of patients permitted to ask for help in dying to 16 or 18 from
12.
</P>
<P>
   But the core of the bill is not likely to change. Doctors'
actions in helping patients to die would no longer be reviewed by
prosecutors but instead by a committee of doctors, lawyers and
ethicists. To qualify for help to die, a patient's request must be
``lasting,'' he or she must face ``unbearable suffering'' and have
no ``reasonable alternative'' to death. The doctor must also
consult one other independent physician before helping a patient to
die.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the country's medical association is training 1,000
doctors to be specialized consultants in the field. The three-day
course is by most accounts emotional and draining. These doctors do
not intend to perform euthanasia, but to give a second opinion and
advice and information to other doctors considering such action.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum ranges from teaching doctors to resist pressure
from their patients to technical information on relieving pain and
other conditions that may have become unbearable for the patient,
such as incessant itching, inability to swallow or slow suffocation
from blood in the lungs. Some of the course focuses on telling the
patient's story so it can be properly reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No physician has been taught in medical school how to write
about the ending of someone's life,'' said Dr. Gerrit Kimsma, a
professor at Free University in the Netherlands, who is helping to
train the doctors. ``Their stories are often not rich enough. When
you look at the papers you can't see the nature of the suffering,
so we teach them that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite wide support for euthanasia, the medical profession and
indeed the country is still gripped in a debate over its details.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill introduces for the first time the possibility of an
``advance directive'' so that a patient could indicate ahead of
time that he or she wishes to die at a certain point. It will for
the first time open the door for patients suffering from dementia
and Alzheimer's disease to get help dying if they have signed such
a directive early in their illness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such patients have not qualified because they are
not considered by some to be suffering ``unbearably.'' While their
condition may cause anguish to their families, they themselves may
be unaware of it.
</P>
<P>
   The advance directive has caused an uproar in some circles and
may end up being deleted from the bill. For the Christian Right
Association, which has supported some euthanasia bills, the new
bill goes too far. The opposition party objects to both the advance
directive and the cessation of the review process by the
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is going down the slippery slope,'' said Clemence
Roos, a spokeswoman for the Christian Right. ``Eight years ago, we
were hearing `never' for dementia. `How dare you suggest that we
will go that far?' And now, it's being treated like it's just a
fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of this legislation seems to be: just tell us what
you do, it doesn't matter what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, some euthanasia activists feel that some of the
language in the proposed new law may actually make it more
difficult for patients to control at what point they want to die.
The law seems to tighten some of the criteria used in the past to
regulate the decision. For instance, it says the patient's decision
must be ``durable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This may imply some sort of time element that wasn't there
before,'' said Dr. Rob Jonquiere, the managing director of the
Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society. ``There are a couple of things
like that which actually may be a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, fewer than a handful of doctors have been
prosecuted for helping patients die with injections such as the one
Laane gave or by supplying them with drugs to take their lives when
they were ready. But thousands of cases have been reported to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The country has built a body of data on the subject, largely
from two huge studies conducted in 1990 and 1995. The data show
that 90 percent of the patients requesting euthanasia are in the
final stages of cancer. Most die in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and opponents of assisted suicide and mercy
killing use the statistical evidence to bolster their cases.
Supporters say euthanasia remains rare despite the lack of
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   While such cases rose slightly between 1990 and 1995,
researchers said they would expect that, given several factors
including the aging of the Netherlands' population and the relative
increase in cancer patients. The surveys showed that 9,000 patients
asked their doctors for help in dying in 1995 and 3,600 got such
help. Overall, there were about 150,000 deaths in the Netherlands
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people think, ah, in Holland you go to a doctor and
you get an injection,'' said Reina van de Valk, who helped evaluate
doctors' decisions to perform euthanasia in 1999. ``But they don't
realize how hard it is for doctors. The whole process is so
emotional. It is so difficult after trying to save a patient, to
preserve life, then to change course.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say anonymous surveys have actually shown a
decrease in the ``slippery-slope areas,'' the number of cases where
a doctor helps a patient die without an explicit directive. In most
cases, this involves patients with mental illness who are suffering
but incapable of making a request or newborns with congenital
disorders. But opponents of euthanasia look at the numbers
differently. Many include decisions to stop treatment or to use
painkillers that may hasten death as cases of euthanasia. Opponents
argue that they do, in fact, see a dangerously high number of
slippery-slope cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the Dutch model make it difficult to compare it
to what is going on or what might go on in other countries. For one
thing, medical care is virtually free in the Netherlands, so
concern over the cost of care would presumably not influence a
decision here, as it might in America.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the medical system here revolves around the general
practitioner, who usually has known his or her patient for years.
Such a relationship can make it much easier for a doctor to be
comfortable with a patient's decision.
</P>
<P>
   While the new law would legalize euthanasia if the rules are
followed, it does not give a patient the right to euthanasia. The
doctor always has the final say on whether to help. Surveys
indicate that 10 percent of doctors in the Netherlands are opposed
to euthanasia in principle. No one knows how many have balked at
the last minute for emotional reasons, but it does happen.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Jager still shakes when describing what happened when her
mother wanted help dying five years ago. Diagnosed with a brain
tumor, her mother signed a paper saying she wanted help dying when
circumstances became ``unbearable.'' She thought she had her family
doctor's promise that he would help when things got too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Her condition deteriorated rapidly. One day, she smeared butter
all over the walls. She was then placed in a nursing home where she
soon became paralyzed and could only say yes or no to questions.
But when she indicated to her daughter that she wanted to die, the
doctor said he just could not do it. Jager tried to find another
doctor to help, but none would.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she went to her mother and took her by the hand: ``I
said I was sorry, but I was not going to be able to do anything to
help her. I told her that if she really wanted to go, she had to
stop eating and drinking, and so she did. It took three days.''

COURT REJECTS ATTEMPTS BY STATES TO INTRUDE ON FOREIGN POLICY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously struck down
a Massachusetts law aimed at boycotting companies that do business
in Myanmar, ruling that crucial differences between the state law
and existing federal sanctions ``compromise the very capacity of
the president to speak for the nation with one voice in dealing
with other governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a rare excursion into the realm of foreign policy, the
court said that under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which
gives Congress the power to pre-empt state laws, the Massachusetts
law intended to undermine the government of Myanmar, the former
Burma, and therefore had to fall because it ``stands in the way of
Congress' diplomatic objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The court stopped well short of declaring that states have no
constitutionally valid means of taking positions with foreign
policy implications, as many did during years of protest against
the apartheid regime in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Justice David H. Souter's majority opinion focused
tightly on the ways in which the Massachusetts law adopted in early
1996 was irreconcilable with a federal law passed by Congress three
months later and carried out by a presidential executive order in
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said that while Congress adopted a ``calibration of
force,'' leaving the president great flexibility to impose or lift
sanctions as a form of diplomatic leverage, the Massachusetts law
was much more categorical in barring state agencies from doing
business in most circumstances with any domestic or foreign company
that conducted business in Myanmar. ``We see the state Burma law as
an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress' full objectives
under the federal act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling left proponents of cutting off trade with the Asian
country's repressive military regime with several other possible
approaches, including divestment by public pension funds of the
stock of companies that do business there.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stumberg, a law professor at Georgetown University who
has provided legal advice to ``free Burma'' coalitions around the
country, said Monday that along with divestment, other options
included seeking public disclosure of corporate activities in
Myanmar as well as pushing for new legislation from Congress that
would disavow any desire to pre-empt state and local efforts.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable sympathy in Congress for state and local
anti-Myanmar efforts. Stumberg filed a brief for 78 members of
Congress who said they had not intended to pre-empt local laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued strongly that beyond its
specific provisions, the Massachusetts law was unconstitutional as
an incursion into the federal government's exclusive foreign policy
role.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that broad ground that the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Boston, struck down the state law last year. The court
Monday did not go so far, limiting its analysis to the specific
ways in which the state law conflicted with ``Congress' specific
delegation to the president of flexible discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``once you get outside the Burma context, this
decision is of limited utility in trying to beat back state and
local efforts to make foreign policy,'' Peter J. Spiro, a professor
at Hofstra Law School, said Monday. He said the decision ``doesn't
close the constitutional case on state and local foreign
policy-making generally.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and
Philadelphia, have adopted similar laws restricting municipal
purchases from companies that do business in Burma. Vermont is the
only other state with such a law.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, including Indonesia, Nigeria, and Switzerland,
have recently been the targets of selective purchasing legislation,
most of which has not passed. But Miami has adopted an embargo
against Cuba that is stricter than the federal embargo and is
almost certainly unconstitutional under Monday's ruling, according
to Pamela S. Falk, a professor at the City University of New York
law school.
</P>
<P>
   The court Monday took note of the state and local sanctions
against South Africa that were widespread during the 1980s. But no
challenge to those laws ever reached the court, so there was no
particular lesson to draw from that recent history, Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiro said that many of the South Africa sanctions ``would have
had a tough time surviving'' the analysis of Monday's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the subject of intense interest overseas. The
European Union and its 15 member states, which filed a protest
against the state law with the World Trade Organization, filed a
brief asking the justices to declare the law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given the wider political climate, the case
also became a lightning rod for anti-globalization sentiment;
demonstrators showed up outside the Supreme Court on the day of the
argument carrying such signs as ``Boston Tea Party 2000'' and ``EU
out of Boston Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474,
was brought in 1998 against the Massachusetts law by the trade
organization, which is based in Washington and is made up of 550
companies that engage in foreign commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four of the National Foreign Trade Council's members were
on the state's restricted-purchase list of companies that did
business in Myanmar. The council won a permanent injunction against
the law's enforcement from the U.S. District Court in Boston, in a
decision that the appeals court affirmed. (When the case first
reached the Supreme Court, it was known as Natsios vs. National
Foreign Trade Council.)
</P>
<P>
   While the court's holding Monday was unanimous, Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas refused to sign Souter's opinion
because, they said in an opinion by Scalia, they objected to the
majority's analysis of the legislative history of the federal Burma
law. The meaning of the federal statute was obvious on its face and
the effort to probe the minds of its sponsors was ``utterly
irrelevant,'' Scalia said.

ZIMBABWE'S GOLD MINES STRUGGLE AMID COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC, POLITICAL
TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Battered by low gold prices during
the last year and squeezed by a currency crisis at home, Zimbabwe's
gold mines are struggling to function.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, the country's biggest export after tobacco, is a crucial
source of foreign currency, and the collapse of the industry would
be a severe blow to an economy already in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Many mines in Zimbabwe are running perilously low on imported
supplies like cyanide, which is used to dissolve gold from crushed
rock. Some mines say that they could be forced to shut down in a
matter of weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation continues, we will become totally
uneconomical, and we will have to close,'' said Frank Purcell,
managing director of Delta Gold Zimbabwe, one of the country's
largest gold producers. ``It's not going to take long.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the big producers, Rio Tinto Zimbabwe, acknowledged
the troubles of the last several months, but said none of its mines
were yet on the brink. ``Given the price of gold, and the current
exchange rate, we are finding it difficult, but we have no planned
closures,'' said Frank Webster, the company's director of personnel
and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to exert some pressure on the government of President
Robert Mugabe, the Chamber of Mines in Zimbabwe issued a stark
warning this month about the state of the industry and urged action
to avert the closing of the country's mines.
</P>
<P>
   But with parliamentary elections just days away, and the
president's party facing a credible challenge for the first time in
the country's history, the ruling party that dominates government
is focusing attention on its own survival.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what the Ministry of Mines and the Reserve Bank could do
to avert a shutdown in the industry is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the state has been short of money. Inflation has
soared as high as 70 percent, foreign currency reserves have
plunged and the Zimbabwe dollar has remained artificially pegged to
the U.S. dollar, far above its true value. For the gold mines,
which must sell their production to the government's Reserve Bank
at prices calculated according to the official exchange rate of
about $38 Zimbabwe dollars to $1, the cap on the currency has
driven up the cost of materials, which must be bought at far higher
rates that reflect a more realistic value for the Zimbabwe dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of freeing the Zimbabwe dollar to let market forces
determine its value has been going on for weeks, and such a move
would almost certainly lead to a sharp devaluation. So far nothing
has happened.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation would help lower the cost of Zimbabwe's exports
and could help stimulate the economy. But Hester Le Roux, who is a
director of Gold Fields Minerals Services, a precious metals
research firm in London, says that even if there is a devaluation,
it will ``merely be a first step, and that other steps will need to
be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Purcell of Delta Gold said he did not believe a devaluation was
necessarily the answer.
</P>
<P>
   If the president is to be believed, however, far more sweeping
changes could be in store for the mining industry in Zimbabwe. In
an interview published last week, Mugabe told a British newspaper
that his government would soon turn its attention to the mines as
part of its campaign to redistribute the country's resources to the
black majority.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how the country's efforts at agricultural land
reform floundered before erupting in pre-election political
violence this year, his words were little comfort to the mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For now, mining businesses are just watching the situation,
hoping the election on Saturday and Sunday, whatever the outcome,
opens the door to a turnaround in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, the gold miners, like the tobacco farmers, say
that damage has been done and that undoing it will take months, if
not years. In particular, most mining businesses have scaled back
or even halted their exploration and development efforts in the
last couple of months, averting layoffs but imperiling the mines'
future production.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe produced almost 30 million ounces of gold last year,
just over 1 percent of the world total and a fraction of the nearly
450 million ounces produced by neighboring South Africa, the
world's biggest producer of gold. Indeed the loss of the Zimbabwe
production, ranked 16th worldwide, would hardly register on
international gold markets.
</P>
<P>
   But for a poor country like Zimbabwe, which relies heavily on
its agriculture and mining industries, the effects would
reverberate among the nation's 12 million people, many of them
already out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Only tobacco, the most profitable crop in the country's
agriculture, is more important than gold. While it only directly
accounts for about 30,000 jobs and about 3 percent of the gross
domestic product, tobacco provides about 12 percent to 13 percent
of the foreign currency earnings and about 15 percent to 16 percent
of the export earnings, according to Tony Hawkins, a University of
Zimbabwe economist.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Off Welfare Without Insurance &QL;   &UR; By Laura J. Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000
States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (June 19) - Pennsylvania ranks
15th nationwide for the largest number of uninsured adults,
according to a study released Monday by Families USA - a group
lobbying for universal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a parent works full time that parent is not going to
qualify for Medicaid in Pennsylvania.,'' said Rachel Klein, the
report's author. ``What we know of low-wage workers is that the
employer usually does not offer health insurance and if they do, it
is frequently too expensive for that worker to afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, basing her study on Census Bureau and state government
statistics, asserted that 945,880 low-income adults with children
were bumped from the Medicaid rolls nationwide since welfare reform
started in 1996. In the same period, 75,975 low-income Pennsylvania
parents became uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, a Pennsylvania parent in a three-person
family was dropped from Medicaid if he or she had an income of more
than $10,080 - 71percent of the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Income eligibility levels are set individually by each state. In
the report, a parent making more than 22 percent of the poverty
level, $3,168 a year, is ineligible for Medicaid in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid rolls have declined in the past four years by 27
percent, from 3.5 million to 2.5 people million nationwide. Georgia
had the largest decline in the percentage in parent Medicaid
enrollment with 51 percent leaving its rolls. In California 155,846
were dropped - the highest number for one state.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that many parents lost medical coverage when
state computers automatically took them off Medicaid when they
moved from welfare to work - as was the case in Pennsylvania.
Parents in other states also lost their coverage when caseworkers
failed to tell them about their continued Medicaid eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   While the report puts Pennsylvania among the top 15 states with
the largest number of uninsured parents, Klein also contended that
the some of the reasons that contributed to the number of uninsured
were being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Aspey, deputy press secretary for the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Welfare, said the computer glitch had been
fixed. And in April, 1999 the state sent out 32,000 cards to inform
former welfare recipients that they may be eligible for Medicaid
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The state plans to spend $17.5 million on the outreach effort -
including television advertisements and brochures placed inside
county offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably the only state that has seen a slight
increase,'' in the number of parents on Medicaid, Aspey said.
</P>
<P>
   Aspey said that while the number of Medicaid-insured adults
declined from 1.6 million in 1996 to 1.39 in December, 1999, there
was an increase of approximately 110,000 to 1.41 million this May.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Tom Ridge has proposed using the money Pennsylvania
gained from settling a lawsuit with tobacco companies to insure
those kicked off of Medicaid and without insurance. Pennsylvania
will receive $11 billion over the next 25 years from the lawsuit,
which was settled in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office expects the state legislature to take up
his proposal this fall.

COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW CURTAILING BUSINESS WITH BURMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a blow to human rights activists who use state and local laws
to battle abuses abroad, the US Supreme Court Monday struck down a
Massachusetts statute that restricted state purchases from
companies doing business in Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in a unanimous decision, declared that the
Massachusetts law interferes with the federal government's ability
to conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts had argued that it had a right to apply a ``moral
standard'' to its spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court said the 1996 Massachusetts law is pre-empted
by the federal government's own sanctions against Burma, referring
to a 1997 executive order signed by President Clinton banning new
investment in the country because of its repression of human rights
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state act is at odds with the president's intended
authority to speak for the United States among the world's nations
in developing a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to bring
democracy to and improve human rights practices and the quality of
life in Burma,'' Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burma human rights advocates said they consider the
ruling merely a ``setback,'' saying the decision still allows them
to use other strategies such as boycotts and shareholder
resolutions to generate economic pressure on firms doing business
with the military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Simon Billenness, a senior analyst with
Trillium Assett Management in Boston and co-author of the statute,
acknolwedge that the selective purchasing law was the most
effective tool in the fight for human rights there and in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the Supreme Court ruled this way in the 1980's it would
have severely blunted the anti-apartheid movement in the US,''
Billneness said. The Burma law had been modeled after the selective
purchasing laws that were adopted by 25 states and helped end the
racist regime in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have documented frequent abuses of rights in
the country, including harsh treatment of dissidents and
suppression of democracy in Burma, also known as Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts statute, which was the only state selective
purchasing law aimed at Burma in the nation, had created a serious
conflict between America and its major trading partners,
particularly the European Commission and Japan. European leaders
had appealed the case to the World Trade Organization, concerned
that European companies would be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   And they feared passage of similar laws now under debate,
including a Massachusetts lawmaker's proposal to punish firms that
trade with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the White House dispatched trade officials to
Beacon Hill to ask lawmakers to repeal or amend the law, but they
were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the decision was hailed by the US businesses that
operate overseas and those in the legal field, who have long
claimed that the law -- and similar other statutes passed by a
number of cities including Los Angeles -- had created serious
confusion and disrupted the country's international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blow for rationality,'' said Andrew Grainger, president
of the New England Legal Foundation, which represented the
Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the Retailers
Association of Massachusetts in the case. He said the Burma law had
raised the cost of public contracts ``without achieving any
demonstrable impact on human rights halfway around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   David Schmahmann , a partner in the Boston firm Nutter McClennon
&AMP; Fish, said he is ``not the tiny bit suprised'' at the court's
decision because, he said, the US Constitution clearly assigns the
role of foreign policy to the federal government and that ``country
has to speak with once voice.''.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to foreign trade, you can't have one set of laws
passed by the federal government and another inconsistent set of
laws passed by cities and states,'' said Schmahmann, who has
represented business clients that were covered by the law. But
Robert Stumberg, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center
viewed the court's decision more narrowly. Stumberg, who
represented members of Congress who supported the state's law,
noted that the court was very specific in its ruling that the law
is only pre-empted because there is a federal statute addressing
the same policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a decision with sweeping constitutional impact,''
Stumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow to the law came in 1998 when US District Court
Judge Joseph Tauro in Boston struck down the statute, saying it
interfered with the federal governments right to conduct foreign
policy. Tauro's ruling was interpreted at the time on a more
general prohibition on states' meddling in foreign policy. That
ruling was upheld in a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Stumberg said if the federal appeals court decision had stood
without further challenge, human rights advocates would have faced
more restrictions on the kinds of activities they could employ to
pressure other repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional claims were most sweeping in the opinion of
the (appeals court),'' Stumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, using the decision as a guide, state Represenative Byron
Rushing, the Democrat who sponsored the Burma law, said he is now
ready to push the House and Senate to pass a bill that would ban
the investment of state pension funds in firms that do business in
Burma. That bill is currently before a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to find ways to put pressure on companies doing
business in Burma, ways that are constitutional,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law was not an outright ban on state commerce
with firms conducting business with Burma. Instead, it penalized
them, making it hard for them to win government contracts by adding
10 percent to any bids the companies proposed.

   New York Seaway Trail Gets an Upstate Center
</P>
<P>
   The New York Seaway Trail is a 454-mile scenic alternative to
modern highways along Lake Erie, the Niagara River, Lake Ontario
and the St. Lawrence River. To introduce visitors to the abundant
cultural, historical and recreational resources along the trail,
the Seaway Trail Foundation will open the Seaway Trail Discovery
Center on July 15 in Sackets Harbor, just west of Watertown on Lake
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The center, a three-story federal building built in 1817 as the
Union Hotel, has nine rooms with interactive exhibits on the
history, architecture and natural resources of 10 counties of New
York _ St. Lawrence, Jefferson, Oswego, Cayuga, Wayne, Monroe,
Orleans, Niagara, Erie and Chautauqua. Exhibits focus on the 27
historic lighthouses along the route; on local battles in the War
of 1812; woodlands, wetlands and beaches; famous residents, among
them Susan B. Anthony, Frederic Remington and George Eastman; and
agriculture. An exhibit features Federal and Victorian houses and
the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and Frederick Law Olmsted, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The Seaway Trail Discovery Center, at Ray and West Main Streets
in Sackets Harbor, will be open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through
Labor Day, then Monday through Saturday through October. Admission
is $4, $3 for students and ages 65 and up, $2 for ages 4 to 17.
Information: (800) 732-9298.

   Priceline Adds Choices For Renting Cars
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, which lets people propose online the price they
will pay for air fares, hotel rooms, groceries and other services,
this month added two car rental companies, Hertz and Alamo, to its
vendors. In November, the Budget and National chains began renting
cars through Priceline.com. The four companies have about 70
percent of the domestic car rental business at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of filling out the online bidding form, customers
are notified by e-mail if their bid is accepted. Vehicles are
available only at airports, and bidders do not choose which company
supplies the car. They can select any type of passenger vehicle,
all of which come with unlimited mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com said its vendors are renting cars at 100 locations
and adding more each week. It said that by the end of March, it was
processing 20,000 vehicle-days of car rentals each week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bidders will get the best deals on days, and in places, where
the rental companies have excess vehicles in their parking lots. If
a bid is accepted, there is a fee of $5 a rental. In addition,
customers pay normal rental taxes, which are disclosed in advance
at the bidding site. The Web site, www.priceline.com, accepts bids
from drivers 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   A Very Big Picnic For Bastille Day
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, tanks will roll down the Champs-Elysees and fighter
planes will swoop overhead for the traditional military parade that
marks the birthday of the French Republic. Across the nation, there
will be fireworks and open-air dances.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Bastille Day 2000 calls for something special. Last
November, schoolchildren started planting thousands of saplings
along the Paris Meridian, the line running 2 degrees 20 minutes 14
seconds east of Greenwich, from Dunkirk to Prats-de-Molo on the
Spanish border. On Bastille Day, this 597-mile tree line sets the
stage for the largest dejeuner sur l'herbe in French history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 405 miles of checkered tablecloth will be spread over
picnic tables _some of them up to six-tenths of a mile long _ along
the Meridian. Three million people are expected to bring picnic
baskets or stock up on regional delicacies at adjoining market
stalls. An air show and a multidisciplinary relay race _ on
everything from bicycles to roller skates to horses _ following the
picnic path will round out the festivities.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On or off the meridian, each town is adding its own flourish to
the nationwide party. Amiens puts an Aussie accent on the holiday
with a brass band from Canberra, boomerang lessons and a giant
Australian barbecue. Avignon will see off the Provencal lap of the
Tour de France bicycle race. And in Paris, over seven miles of
tables will be set up from the Porte de Montmartre to the Porte de
Gentilly _ a track that slices though the Avenue de l'Opera, the
Louvre courtyard and the Jardin du Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   News on the festivities is available at www.wmevent.net (in
French only) or www.2000enfrance.com.

<P>
   Tall Ships to Visit Boston Between Races
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Tall Ships 2000 Race Series, an international
fleet of more than 100 tall ships will visit Boston Harbor July 11
to 20 for Sail Boston 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The International Sail Training Association is sponsoring the
races, which started in April in England and Italy. After races
from Southampton and Genoa finished in Cadiz, the ships competed in
a trans-Atlantic race to Bermuda. From Bermuda, the fleet will
cruise north to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The tall ships are expected to start arriving in Boston on July
8. At 9 a.m. on July 11, the fleet will enter the harbor in a Grand
Parade of Sail, escorted by the USS Constitution, Old Ironsides,
the oldest commissioned warship in the world, whose berth is at the
Charlestown Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The ships will be docked at the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal,
the World Trade Center, the North Jetty and the Navy Yard, and the
public will be allowed to board various ships, including the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, free. Scheduled events range from
a Blessing of the Sails at Old North Church to a jazz and blues
festival to two displays of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, the ships will parade out of the harbor for the next
leg of the race, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After Halifax, the ships
will race back across the Atlantic to Amsterdam. But some tall
ships will remain on view until July 21.
</P>
<P>

LONDON FIRM TO BUY UNITED ASSET MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Old Mutual PLC, an insurer and mutual fund management
firm headquartered in London, agreed Monday to buy Boston-based
United Asset Management, the money management holding company that
started in 1980 with an innovative model but has stumbled of late.
</P>
<P>
   The deal underscored two trends, analysts said. First, even
institutions in Boston's venerable mutual fund industry are on the
auction block, following purchases by out-of-towners of banks,
media outlets, and department stores. Second, overseas interest in
US mutual-fund companies is at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   The UAM acquisition, for $1.4 billion or $25 a share _ a 22
percent premium over Friday's closing price _ is seen as a good buy
for Old Mutual, which is looking to diversify. The deal closely
follows announcements in the past month that CDC Asset Management
of France will buy Nvest Cos. for $2.2 billion and UniCredito
Italiano will acquire the Pioneer Group Inc. for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is the final throes of mass globalization
of the industry,'' said Robert Powell, a former editor of Dalbar's
mutual fund newsletter and now launching moneycast.com, a financial
education Web site. ``There's going to be more consolidation and it
will probably accelerate. For a foreign player to come in and buy
this money management firm, that's an attractive proposition. They
can buy a semi-floundering business and distribute it overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   UAM, founded by Norman Reamer from Putnam Investments 20 years
ago, has $188 billion under management in a collection of 40
affiliated money-management companies. But UAM had to endure $7
billion in withdrawals in the first quarter of this year, part of a
trend of outflows attributed to retiring money managers, hot hands
that turned cold, and an emphasis on traditional pension-fund
investing.
</P>
<P>
   UAM's units include Pilgrim Baxter &AMP; Associates Inc. and Barrow,
Hanley, Mewhinney &AMP; Strauss Inc. James Orr III, president and chief
executive of UAM, said the affiliates will maintain their autonomy
after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment business in general is going through a period
of restructuring,'' Orr said. ``We were pleased to deliver a good
value to our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Anstee, finance director for Old Mutual, said in an
interview from London the deal ``broadens our capability'' and was
a ``good strategic fit for our business.'' He said the affiliates
will be encouraged to do more cross-selling and work more closely
together.
</P>
<P>
   Old Mutual, South Africa's largest insurer, has been looking to
expand into asset management. It bought British broker and fund
manager Gerrard Group for $796 million in January.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT DENOUNCES PREDICTIONS OF ELECTION FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo on Monday assailed
opposition candidates who have warned of possible irregularities in
the July 2 election for president.
</P>
<P>
   Using sharp words for a normally mild-spoken chief executive,
Zedillo accused the opposition candidates of ``sowing mistrust'' in
the federal agency that is overseeing the vote.
</P>
<P>
   He said they were also trying to discredit the election with
``intransigent positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zedillo did not mention anyone by name, his comments
seemed directed at Vicente Fox, a right-of-center candidate who is
challenging the governing party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a
left-leaning contender. The two candidates have been battling each
other furiously from the campaign trail, but last week they joined
in a pact to guard against voter coercion before the election and
against fraud during the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, Cardenas proposed to all the candidates
that if the election is not clean, no one should declare victory.
Fox has predicted that if the governing party candidate, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, does not win by at least 10 points, many Mexicans
will not believe that he won fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said Monday, ``Those who proclaim election results
before the citizens have voted, and insinuate that they will not
recognize the outcome if they do not win, show no democratic
convictions or respect for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   His salvo echoed a speech Labastida made on Sunday in Mexico
City before tens of thousands of followers of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. The candidate
said this year's elections would be ``the cleanest and most
competitive in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   To shouts of joy, Labastida said, ``Only those who already feel
defeated would cry fraud ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that this election is far more open and fair
than any other Mexico has had. The Federal Electoral Institute,
which for the first time is largely independent from the
government, has spent $918 million to level the playing field for
the candidates and build a foolproof system for tallying the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI, which has held presidential power for seven
decades, remains intertwined with the government and has a
tradition of using handouts or threats to sway the vote. Both
Mexican and international election observers have reported numerous
incidents that indicate that the PRI is making widespread use of
questionable tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of making this kind of comments, President Zedillo
should demonstrate his own democratic good will by taking his hands
off the electoral process and stopping the vote-buying by the
federal government,'' Marta Sahagun, Fox's spokeswoman, responded
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After months of being on the sidelines, Zedillo has become more
active in promoting Labastida and the PRI. According to the
newspaper Reforma, since April 1 Zedillo has been exceptionally
busy inaugurating public work projects around the country, worth a
total of $435 million.
</P>
<P>
   The president also ignored a call from the federal elections
agency to cancel advertising of government programs in the final
weeks before the election. Every day, the Mexico City newspapers
are filled with full-page ads touting the successes of federal
programs. Leading television and radio news shows are punctuated
with spots carrying the same message.

   Living history: Putting a village together through artifacts
</P>
<P>
   By Dann Stupp
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Norm MacIntyre could easily crack open an Ohio
history book and learn all about the area's Fort Ancient
settlements. Of course, he prefers doing things the traditional
way.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's chiseling fish hooks from animal bones, digging out
a canoe or helping to revive a tall-grass prairie, the live-in
historian is helping to piece back together a Fort Ancient village.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre, a retired cop and now handyman extraordinaire for
SunWatch Indian Village, can stroll through his back yard on the
bank of the Great Miami River and learn firsthand about what daily
life was like 800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first moved in, it was like letting a cat loose in a
seafood store,'' he says. ``There were all the raw materials I
needed here. People were always donating bones and hides and
feathers, and I had some spare time. I started just making stuff
for our museum's exhibits, but then I couldn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre's creations will be featured at this weekend's annual
SummerFest at SunWatch, which celebrates American Indian culture
with demonstrations of crafts, sports, games and skills. There will
be dance performances, singing, storytelling, a children's activity
area and food.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre, 63, moved onto the site in 1990. But he was one of
the first volunteers to begin work on the salvation of the
prehistoric village in 1970. He would work a 4 p.m.-to-midnight
shift as a Xenia police officer and then work until 2 a.m.
excavating a site that, at the time, seemed to be nothing more than
a cornfield. He and the other original volunteers soon learned that
a whole village was buried just 12 inches under the ground's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, SunWatch is home to a semi-restored village
with several reconstructed homes, including the Big House, which
served as the village's community center in the 1200s. In addition,
MacIntyre helped create exhibits of the villagers` tools, methods
of storing grain, houses and all aspects of their daily lives for
the SunWatch Indian Village Museum with the other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   He also leads tours and educates students from all over the
area. However, he knows a traditional classroom approach won't cut
it with his younger visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With third- and fourth- and fifth-graders, talking about
something just isn't like doing it,'' he says. ``So I got busy
making some instruments. A lot of drums, rattles and whistles _ all
things we had found when digging. Now the kids can go out there and
make a little music and get a big kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His love of tinkering with clay, bone and stone eventually
became a passion. So a few years ago, he enrolled in sculpting
classes at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, and now his works
have become a favorite in SunWatch's gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like stealing,'' he says. ``I can't believe what
people pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people can believe it, including Tess Little, associate
professor of art at Sinclair and MacIntyre's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great knack for putting things together,'' says
Little. ``He can find things, and he knows how to transform them.
He makes some really fun things that sell just as quick as he makes
him.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his latest pieces involved affixing tiny sculpted lizards
onto a log he found in the Great Miami. The piece, fittingly called
Lizard Log, is a prime example of his ability to see everyday
objects as potential creations.
</P>
<P>
   His style, which Little says is folklike, with an American
Indian touch, has become an important part of the village as well
as the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Little says it's more than an eye for creativity that makes
MacIntyre an asset to her classes. She says a big heart and a
passion for art makes him one of her most-cherished students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good man that goes out of his way to help
people,'' she says. ``He had the whole class over (to SunWatch) for
a picnic supper one time. The students were thrilled. He's such a
knowledgeable man about American Indian history and the region.
He's one of those students who really cares about giving back to
the community. SunWatch is very lucky to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a Jack Russell terrier named Katy, MacIntyre lives
alone on the 10-plus acres of SunWatch. The peaceful setting was a
welcomed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when when I retired, I said I never wanted to tell
anybody what to do or to have anybody tell me what to do,'' he
says. ``It's worked out pretty well for me and, I believe, for
SunWatch, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A heart problem forced MacIntyre to slow down nearly a decade
ago. He knew it was time to retire, but he wasn't about to quit
enjoying life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really worried about retirement my whole life because
there were so many things I like to do,'' he says. ``I like to fish
and garden and travel and work with my hands. This was the perfect
chance to do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And others know how perfect it is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word was out after my recent heart surgery,'' he says.
``SunWatch got a call from somebody that wanted to know if my
apartment was available because they heard I had died. Word travels
fast, but I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't plan to leave anytime soon. From his corner of
SunWatch, he can see the rebirth of an 800-year-old village that
he's spent most of his adult life recreating. According to
MacIntyre, there's nothing more satisfying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in graduate school, a friend who thought I needed to
get out of the lab more often pointed out a newly arrived graduate
student she thought I might find attractive. I remember saying,
``He looks like a bird.'' I did not mean this in a nice way.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill turned out to be rather a gem of a husband and for the
life of me, I do not know why I said he looked like a bird.
</P>
<P>
   All this is by way of saying, great treasures are not always
instantly recognizable as such.
</P>
<P>
   Even Charles Darwin, one of history's celebrated geniuses, did
not recognize the importance of the Galapagos Islands _ the
archipelago that would become forever enshrined in history as the
inspiration for his world-changing revelation on evolution _ when
he first set foot on their shores 165 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Darwin, it was the animals he would observe and
collect there that would provide his first inkling that species
were not immutable as the theological thinking of the day
proclaimed. Instead, he would realize that the species he saw
before him were continually being shaped and changed over time;
that is, they evolved.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to imagine Darwin, then the naturalist aboard the
ship known as the HMS Beagle, walking into what would become the
most important five weeks of his life as an eager explorer,
thrilled by each animal and plant encountered, his mind afire with
grand ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But Darwin himself told a rather different story, penning in his
diary at the time: ``gloomy sky ... The plants also smell
unpleasantly ... what we might imagine the cultivated parts of the
Infernal regions to be ... most disgusting, clumsy lizards ... such
insignificant, ugly little flowers as would better become an arctic
than a tropical country. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Our hero can hardly be blamed, however. For sheer biological
exuberance and diversity, the Galapagos are no match for the rain
forests of the South American mainland that Darwin also visited,
with their green scenes full of towering trees, threaded with vines
and overflowing with squawking, chittering, garish, noisy life.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast, the volcanic Galapagos are bleak and
desert-like, dry and jagged scrapes of black lava dotted with
unimpressive shrubs and cactuses and inhabited by a relative few
types of creatures.
</P>
<P>
   But while these islands did not dazzle young Charles with
tropical pizazz, they were free of confusing excesses of species,
and so better displayed evolution's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   The Galapagos' inhabitants had reached these remote islands by
flying, swimming, riding on downed trees or being blown the 500
miles out from the mainland. Each had made the most of the
solitude, diversifying into constellations of sometimes bizarre new
species to take up new ways of life and fill the empty islands with
creatures never before seen.
</P>
<P>
   With each new arrival, evolution had played out the same story.
A different variety of giant tortoise (which give the islands their
name, Galapagos meaning tortoises in Spanish) could be found on
every island, each with its own style of oversized dome and
comically scrawny neck. Land-loving iguanas had spun off the most
curious of the island's unique species: a marine iguana that dives
in the sea for its dinner, the only lizard in the world to do so.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Galapagos blossomed a multitude of finches,
apparently descended from one standard, little seed-eating type of
bird that made its way to these far reaches and whose descendants
had evolved all manner of beak to feed on all manner of food. As
scientists have since learned, these finches are no longer confined
to seeds, but can make their living on nectar, by prying insects
out of dead trees with sticks, by plucking ticks off tortoises and
iguanas, or feasting on leaves and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home to England, Darwin hinted at the
possibility of evolution in these finches in his book ``Voyage of
the Beagle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small,
intimately related group of birds,'' he wrote, ``one might really
fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago,
one species had been taken and modified for different ends.'' His
fully fleshed out notions of evolution and natural selection would
not be published, however, until ``The Origin of Species'' came out
20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the Encantadas or Enchanted Islands as the
Galapagos are also known are designated as Ecuadorean National
Park. Tourists are asked to tread lightly as researchers work to
restore what has been destroyed in these habitats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems is the toll taken by visitors like
those aboard the HMS Beagle. In the 1800s, such islands were
viewed, not as hallowed cathedrals of nature, but one-stop shopping
centers, a kind of 7-Eleven for the sailing ships of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting was easy as the animals of the Galapagos have always
been strangely tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little birds ... not frightened by stones being thrown at
them,'' Darwin wrote in his diary. ``Mr. King killed one with his
hat and I pushed off a branch with the end of my gun a large
hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   Giant tortoises were popular game as they could be kept alive on
shipboard for weeks or months to provide fresh meat on demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tortoise is so abundant that a single ship's company here
caught 500-600 in a short time,'' Darwin noted. He himself could
not resist the urge to meddle with the beasts. ``They were so
heavy,'' he wrote, ``I could scarcely lift them off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not help either that many of the creatures were also
quite tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived on the meat of the tortoise fried in the transparent
oil, which is procured from the fat,'' he wrote toward the end of
his stay. ``Young tortoises make capital soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists are working to save both the giant tortoises
and the land iguanas, which have already disappeared off a number
of the islands. (In contrast, Darwin described the iguanas as
infinite in number, and he constantly tripped over their burrows
while trying to find a place to camp.) Scientists are even
searching for a mate for a tortoise known as ``Lonesome George,'' a
centenarian thought to be the last of his subspecies, a kind of
turtle found only on Pinta Island.
</P>
<P>
   Even as scientists work to save the species, the islands
continue to give rise to new ideas and new research. Studies out of
Princeton on Darwin's finches show these birds' beaks evolving
before researchers' eyes. Studies from Wake Forest University on
the masked boobies illuminate curious tendencies to kill siblings
that have intrigued biologists.
</P>
<P>
   From today's perspective, the species of the Galapagos seem to
cry out ``Evolution!'' and Darwin's conclusions seem foregone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when he set sail on the Beagle, he was 22, had little in the
way of scientific training, and in his five-year round-the-world
journey was bombarded with social, cultural, geological as well as
biological information. Remember too that he was not in search of a
universal theory to explain biological diversification. Add to that
the fact that this was a man who had nearly passed up the journey
of a lifetime because he did not want to miss the opening of
partridge hunting season in England, and it all seems quite a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a very real sense, he was a young man, like any young man, on
an adventure, a brief detour from the life his father had decreed
for him of ministering in a quiet, country parsonage.
</P>
<P>
   One sees this, the simple humanity of Charles Darwin, most
easily in the pocket notebooks in which he scrawled his thoughts on
the journey, unedited. There he made memos to get his watch fixed
or kept his shopping lists: ``Night-caps, black ribbon, pill-boxes,
Bramah pens, 2 lbs. common soap, tobacco.'' He meditated for
himself on the tropical scene: ``Twiners entwining twiners, tresses
like hair, beautiful lepidoptera, silence . . .''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this light, Darwin _ and other foolish youths as well _
may perhaps be forgiven their youthful inability to recognize the
value of the very handsome opportunities life has set before them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   For while the Galapagos may have signified little to Darwin as
he first set foot on them, he surely understood their importance
later in life when he attributed all his ideas to those lonely
isles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fine opportunities for geology and for studying the
infinite host of living beings!'' he would later say of his
travels. ``If I was to throw it away, I don't think I should ever
rest quiet in my grave. I certainly should be a ghost and haunt the
British Museum.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Marietta Square deal hits a snag
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposal for a 12-story high-rise on the Marietta Square may
have risen again, but both sides now say compromise may yield a
more lasting victory than an all-or-nothing fight.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether opponents in the battle can reach any
sort of agreement that appeases both the business and historic
preservationist communities in downtown Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman, square landlord and developer Philip Goldstein
is now negotiating with opponents of his proposed high-rise, which
is expected to have a fourth vote before the Marietta Historic
Board of Review within the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which would set one block of the square on Mill
Street, has tentatively been approved once and denied twice by one
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Patti and Van Pearlberg, co-chairs of Cobb Landmarks and
Historical Society, and Goldstein all say they're trying to reach a
compromise on the height. Both sides have indicated eight stories
might be acceptable, although it would require concessions from the
city of Marietta, such as closing Denmead Street, a dead-end road
adjacent to the building site.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side has wholeheartedly supported going up or down
much with the size of the building, which the board has approved
for six stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to work together and come up with
something that is in between his first choice and our first
choice,'' said Patti Pearlberg, vice president of asset management
at Coro Realty Advisors. ``I think if the community embraced the
building the community could get the street closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much taller? That's what we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb Landmarks is meeting with architects to drum up any
alternate plan that might provide Goldstein and developer Peter
Bright with enough square footage to shorten the building. The last
application was submitted not in Bright's name but in the name of
Mary Goldstein, Philip Goldstein's mother, who owns the property
jointly with her son.
</P>
<P>
   Initially when the controversy started to boil in March, neither
side showed much interest in compromising. Goldstein and developer
Peter Bright insisted on 12 stories. Cobb Landmarks and other
preservationists said six was the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Now compromise is being wrapped in the mantra of civic
responsibility. In reality, Goldstein has fought to bring a
high-rise to the Marietta Square, where his family owns about half
the real estate, for more than 12 years. He got one 10-story
project approved but failed to bring it to fruition.

chronic disease: asthma, auto-immune problems, birth defects,
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Exposure to chemical changes in the environment _ industrial
solvents, tobacco smoke, pesticides, smog _ are believed to foster
development of some chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There is no national system for tracking the occurrence of
most chronic diseases, and no statistical means of comparing
environmental problems with rates of chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Answers: True, true and true _ and deeply problematic.
Infectious diseases, from HIV/
</P>
<P>
   AIDS to tuberculosis to E. coli O157:H7, are monitored by local
and state health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Though the CDC tracks a number of chronic
diseases such as asthma and cancer, there is no comparable local or
state structure feeding it more detailed data.
</P>
<P>
   A Web-based effort has set out to change that. Health Track
(health-track.org), a joint project of the Pew Charitable Trusts
and Georgetown University, is an elegantly designed,
easy-to-navigate site with a definite point of view: that chronic
disease problems should be monitored nationally and locally, and
that the Internet provides the means to do it. The effort, which
recently began national newspaper advertising, offers downloadable
research reports, links to national organizations and scorecards on
local environmental conditions.

COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW CURTAILING BUSINESS WITH BURMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a blow to human rights activists who use state and local laws
to battle abuses abroad, the US Supreme Court Monday struck down a
Massachusetts statute that restricted state purchases from
companies doing business in Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in a unanimous decision, declared that the
Massachusetts law interferes with the federal government's ability
to conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts had argued that it had a right to apply a ``moral
standard'' to its spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court said the 1996 Massachusetts law is pre-empted
by the federal government's own sanctions against Burma, referring
to a 1997 executive order signed by President Clinton banning new
investment in the country because of its repression of human rights
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state act is at odds with the president's intended
authority to speak for the United States among the world's nations
in developing a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to bring
democracy to and improve human rights practices and the quality of
life in Burma,'' Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burma human rights advocates said they consider the
ruling merely a ``setback,'' saying the decision still allows them
to use other strategies such as boycotts and shareholder
resolutions to generate economic pressure on firms doing business
with the military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Simon Billenness, a senior analyst with
Trillium Assett Management in Boston and co-author of the statute,
acknolwedge that the selective purchasing law was the most
effective tool in the fight for human rights there and in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the Supreme Court ruled this way in the 1980's it would
have severely blunted the anti-apartheid movement in the US,''
Billneness said. The Burma law had been modeled after the selective
purchasing laws that were adopted by 25 states and helped end the
racist regime in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have documented frequent abuses of rights in
the country, including harsh treatment of dissidents and
suppression of democracy in Burma, also known as Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts statute, which was the only state selective
purchasing law aimed at Burma in the nation, had created a serious
conflict between America and its major trading partners,
particularly the European Commission and Japan. European leaders
had appealed the case to the World Trade Organization, concerned
that European companies would be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   And they feared passage of similar laws now under debate,
including a Massachusetts lawmaker's proposal to punish firms that
trade with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the White House dispatched trade officials to
Beacon Hill to ask lawmakers to repeal or amend the law, but they
were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the decision was hailed by the US businesses that
operate overseas and those in the legal field, who have long
claimed that the law -- and similar other statutes passed by a
number of cities including Los Angeles -- had created serious
confusion and disrupted the country's international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blow for rationality,'' said Andrew Grainger, president
of the New England Legal Foundation, which represented the
Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the Retailers
Association of Massachusetts in the case. He said the Burma law had
raised the cost of public contracts ``without achieving any
demonstrable impact on human rights halfway around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   David Schmahmann , a partner in the Boston firm Nutter McClennon
&AMP; Fish, said he is ``not the tiny bit suprised'' at the court's
decision because, he said, the US Constitution clearly assigns the
role of foreign policy to the federal government and that ``country
has to speak with once voice.''.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to foreign trade, you can't have one set of laws
passed by the federal government and another inconsistent set of
laws passed by cities and states,'' said Schmahmann, who has
represented business clients that were covered by the law. But
Robert Stumberg, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center
viewed the court's decision more narrowly. Stumberg, who
represented members of Congress who supported the state's law,
noted that the court was very specific in its ruling that the law
is only pre-empted because there is a federal statute addressing
the same policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a decision with sweeping constitutional impact,''
Stumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow to the law came in 1998 when US District Court
Judge Joseph Tauro in Boston struck down the statute, saying it
interfered with the federal governments right to conduct foreign
policy. Tauro's ruling was interpreted at the time on a more
general prohibition on states' meddling in foreign policy. That
ruling was upheld in a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Stumberg said if the federal appeals court decision had stood
without further challenge, human rights advocates would have faced
more restrictions on the kinds of activities they could employ to
pressure other repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional claims were most sweeping in the opinion of
the (appeals court),'' Stumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, using the decision as a guide, state Represenative Byron
Rushing, the Democrat who sponsored the Burma law, said he is now
ready to push the House and Senate to pass a bill that would ban
the investment of state pension funds in firms that do business in
Burma. That bill is currently before a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to find ways to put pressure on companies doing
business in Burma, ways that are constitutional,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law was not an outright ban on state commerce
with firms conducting business with Burma. Instead, it penalized
them, making it hard for them to win government contracts by adding
10 percent to any bids the companies proposed.

 &HT;    Online hospitals improve quality of care
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Grady just knew something wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   Her newborn baby, Crystal, wasn't eating. Her family doctor had
chalked it up to Grady's not knowing how to breast-feed. But Grady,
of Austell, didn't believe that was the problem with her second
child.
</P>
<P>
   So she phoned Children's Healthcare of Atlanta's call center,
newly outfitted with a computer program armed with artificial
intelligence designed to help nurses make quick and detailed
diagnoses. In minutes, nurse Cathy Dandelikas determined that
Crystal wasn't having feeding problems but was probably struggling
for her life.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the baby underwent emergency surgery to correct a
blocked aorta, the heart's main artery. Today, Crystal is a happy,
healthy 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you ever express how grateful you are?'' asked Grady,
35. ``If she hadn't stressed to me how important it was to go (to
the emergency department) _ and to go immediately _ I would have
lost my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people, medical technology means newfangled gadgets:
lasers, tiny cameras, heart monitors and whirring MRI machines. But
as hospitals become increasingly wired with sophisticated computer
systems and online capabilities, those behind-the-scenes
technologies are proving to be an important way to improve overall
health care. As a result, patients may see safer and better
treatment all the way from the emergency room to the surgical wing
to the billing department.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, two hospital systems _ Children's Healthcare of
Atlanta (www.choa.org) and Promina Health System (www.promina.org)
_ were named among the nation's Top 100 wired hospital systems by
the trade journal Hospitals and Health Networks. The list also
included the Medical College of Georgia Hospital in Augusta
(www.mcg.edu) and Memorial Health System in Savannah
(www.memorialhealth.com).
</P>
<P>
   They earned the distinction in part because of a wide array of
computer-based technology that is in place or will be within 18
months:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Children's Healthcare has a secure, encrypted Internet system
that allows doctors to view patients' medical records and
laboratory results from their personal computers at home. Within
six months, the hospital system hopes to give doctors PalmPilots to
expand their mobility and the amount of information at their
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some doctors' offices that are part of the Promina network
have complete electronic patient records, which let them verify and
order prescription refills faster. They also can ship the data
electronically to patients' pharmacists and notify patients of drug
recalls within hours of an alert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Children's Healthcare plans to install a new computer system
at Egleston and Scottish Rite hospitals and clinics to protect
patients from medication errors. Under the system, patients would
receive a bar code at admission. Before any medication is
administered, a nurse would swipe a patient's bar code and a drug's
bar code to make sure they match. When used elsewhere, the system
has been shown to reduce pharmaceutical errors, which account for
at least 7,000 deaths per year nationwide, by up to 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Piedmont Medical Center, an anchor hospital of the Promina
Health System, is building electronic records that can follow
patients from the cradle to the grave. This record system will
allow physicians to have a more comprehensive view of a patient's
overall health. It will include ``expert system technology,'' which
will flag lab results that seem abnormal when compared with the
patient's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   And Children's Healthcare has installed almost 30 computers in
nurses' homes so that they can help handle more than 40,000
emergency calls a month. ``The only difference between the nurse at
home and the nurse at work is the nurse at home may be in her
pajamas,'' said Cathy Addison, a manager of the call system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Simon, vice president of Informatics at Children's
Healthcare of Atlanta, said such information technology is ``the
wave of the future for health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, new technology also brings new complications and
concerns. Hospital preparations last December for potential Y2K
glitches _ which never materialized _ underscored how
computer-dependent health care facilities have become more
vulnerable to an electronic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There's also lingering concern about keeping patient records
confidential, as more files become computerized and accessible to
doctors and nurses. Although many hospitals say their Internet
communications are encrypted, they face the same security issues as
any other company doing business over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is always that quicker, faster and better will
translate into disaster, disaster, disaster,'' said Mike Donio of
the People's Medical Society, an Allentown, Penn., nonprofit
patient-advocacy group. ``We don't want to be Luddites, we need
progress, but we also need to use caution on who is going to get
access (to records) and how it's going to be sent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, more hospitals are grappling with such issues. But
many hospitals across the state are still playing catch-up and
haven't had to deal with many of the ethical dilemmas that more
wired facilities face.
</P>
<P>
   Although all of the state's hospitals already do electronic
billing _ and about half have Web sites _ a majority are just
starting to branch out and explore the hundreds of different
applications that could strengthen and streamline their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals are gathering data on their performance:
examining statistics on patient recovery, mortality, infection and
return visits. Of course, most aren't willing to share _ even in
the most basic way _ what they learn with their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Other hospitals are experimenting with ways to reach their
patients through their Web sites and e-mail. For example, most of
the top 100 wired hospitals offered online information about
asthma, depression, stroke and HIV, according to Hospitals and
Health Networks.
</P>
<P>
   And in the near future, Children's Hospital hopes to allow
parents, who would have normally called the 404-250-KIDS hotline,
to contact nurses through its Web site instead. More complicated
than e-mail, the new program will ask parents a list of questions
about their child's symptoms and how soon they need a call back,
Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing new opportunities emerging,'' said Glen Pearson,
executive vice president of the Georgia Hospital Association. ``Now
the question is how do we assess the best way to use these new
kinds of information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   There's so much interest that the Georgia Hospital Association
has created an ``Internet Technology Advisor Group,'' which hopes
to help hospitals evaluate what is valuable and what is merely
trendy. Its first meeting was in March.
</P>
<P>
   This new health care trend is still in its infancy. Among the
top 100 wired hospitals in the nation, only 58 percent of the
doctors could access their patients' records and 61 percent could
view lab results via the Internet. And only 10 percent of patient
appointments could be scheduled through the Internet, according to
Hospitals and Health Networks' survey.
</P>
<P>
   But already, experts say wired hospitals result in better care.
And no one believes that more than Grady, 35, and her husband,
John.
</P>
<P>
   After their daughter was stabilized at Cobb Hospital, she was
transferred to Egleston for emergency surgery. In the course of
that treatment, doctors also discovered two heart murmurs. But
everything was repaired, and now Crystal is an active 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fine, she's healthy,'' Grady said. ``And we're happy.''

 &HT;    Nothing perky about this Lea Thompson
 &HT;    TV, movie star returns to stage for `Cabaret'
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lea Thompson as Sally Bowles, the down-on-her-luck saloon singer
in ``Cabaret''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Caroline in the City's'' Lea Thompson? ``Howard the Duck's''
Lea Thompson? ``Back to the Future's'' Lea Thompson?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and if notices in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are any
indication, she's buried her perky image and fully embraced the
cheap chanteuse who's dancing in her undies and desperately seeking
love in 1929 Berlin. Hitler is waiting in the wings, but for Sally
and her friends at the seedy Kit Kat Klub, it's better to drink,
drug and debauch than worry about what might or might not happen in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Isherwood, who created Sally in his ``Berlin
Stories'' (1946), says, ``She sang badly, without any expression
... yet her performance was, in its own way, effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson describes Sally as ``just a really fun girl who is
trying to survive in the only way she knows how. She's a little
lost, and she's looking for love, so I find her very likable. . . .
It's just set in a really wild, terrible time. How awful to be
stuck in history and be that vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the actress, is anything but vulnerable onstage, a
place where she feels at home, she explains, intermittently yawning
through a late-morning conversation from Baltimore, ``Cabaret's''
last stop before Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent from the time I was 9 until I was 21 onstage,'' she
says. Thompson grew up in Minneapolis, the youngest of five
children, and danced for most of her life. It was only after moving
to New York and realizing that she wasn't going to be as good as
she wanted to be (Mikhail Baryshnikov reportedly told her she was
``too stocky'') that she turned to acting.
</P>
<P>
   And although she's known for her TV and film work, Thompson has
never really left the stage, having done a half-dozen or so roles
on the West Coast, including Tony Kushner's ``The Illusion'' and
Cherie in William Inge's ``Bus Stop.''
</P>
<P>
   She comes from a family of performers. Her oldest brother,
Andrew Thompson, dances with the Colorado Ballet. Another brother,
Barry Thompson, is an actor in Los Angeles. And, Lea says, she's
living out her mother's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom,'' Thompson says of Babah Hanson, ``is very talented.
She did just about everything. Big-band singer. Great piano player.
A wonderful actress. . . . She's also a director, songwriter,
sculptor. It goes back to my grandpas who were in the Chautauqua
circus and my uncles who were minstrel men. It was just always
around. Art and singing and dancing, that's how we played. We
didn't even have a TV. It was predetermined genetically that some
of us were going to become artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists. An interesting word to describe Sally Bowles, who in
this version of ``Cabaret'' inhabits a darker, more frightening
world than the one in the 1966 original with Joel Grey or the 1972
movie. Thompson is the latest in a line of Sallys in the current
production, beginning with 1998 Tony Award winner Natasha
Richardson and including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Teri Hatcher, Susan
Egan and Joely Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson auditioned for Sally in March 1999, while still doing
``Caroline.'' She sang ``Maybe This Time,'' Sally's last number in
Act 1, for choreographer and co-director Rob Marshall and ``a whole
huge amount of people.''
</P>
<P>
   She thought it went well, but heard nothing for a ... long ...
time. ``Caroline'' finished its fourth and final season on NBC.
Thompson took a year off and turned down a number of other jobs,
instead spending time with her husband, movie director Howard
Deutch, and daughters Madelyn, 9, and Zoe, 5. Finally, the call
came. ``This was really the one thing I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson will tour with ``Cabaret,'' a four-time Tony winner in
'98, until Aug. 1, then begin a three-month run on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   For now, she's anticipating the next challenge: Atlanta and the
4,600-seat Fox Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it, even in that big hall,'' she says.
``These older places just fit the show.''

 &HT;    Jane admits to Oprah: `I changed'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Fonda, who has remained relatively mum about her separation
from Ted Turner, opens up and tells all to Oprah Winfrey in the
second issue of O, the Oprah Magazine ($2.95).
</P>
<P>
   Fonda confesses that she has struggled with the ``disease to
please'' for most of her life and accepts much of the blame for the
separation. ``I changed,'' she tells Winfrey. ``I changed probably
more than he did, and we need to see what that means. ... Whatever
happens in terms of our living arrangements, we will always be
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda also says she regrets posing with an antiaircraft gun for
a picture in North Vietnam in 1972. ``It was the most horrible
thing I could possibly have done.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, she talks about ``finding her voice'' for the
third act of her life, building a loft apartment with 20-foot
ceilings in a downtown Atlanta ``'hood,'' and finding spirituality.
She says she attends Providence Missionary Baptist Church as well
as other churches in Atlanta. And despite Turner's having once said
that ``Christianity is for losers,'' Fonda says he's hostile toward
organized religion, not God. ``Ted has read the Bible cover to
cover, twice. He can quote Scripture better than most preachers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More Jane: In a less revealing interview in The Season
($3.95), Fonda talks about her work with the Georgia Campaign for
Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention to new Associate Editor Kathleen
Neal, and this year's fund-raising premiere of the movie ``The
Perfect Storm'' June 27 at the Fox Theatre. The event is expected
to raise $500,000 for G-CAPP, and includes an appearance by Fonda's
brother, Peter, who will auction off a trip for four people to join
him on a motorcycle ride from his Montana ranch to Sturgis, S.D.,
where he'll be inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Season Editor Gloria Lane says she's expanding the focus of the
Atlanta-based magazine to cover more lifestyle topics such as
dining, fashion, shopping and homes. The summer issue features
travel destinations from Switzerland and France to Dahlonega and
Florida's Emerald Coast.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peeping passion: In its cover story, Time ($3.50) takes a
keyhole look at ``Survivor,'' ``The Real World,'' ``1900 House''
and other voyeuristic TV shows. Why are so many people watching
these shows, as well as clicking in on the Internet's 24-hour
Webcam sites? For one thing, says Paul Romer, creator of ``Big
Brother,'' there's always the possibility of a surprise. ``It's
like a baseball game. Even when the game isn't interesting, you
wait and stay because the next hit could be a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Behind the scenes: So just who is the brain behind
``Survivor''? Men's Journal ($3.95) visits with creator Mark
Burnett, who grew up in London, joined the British army during the
Falklands War and has supported himself as a nanny. Burnett says
he's simply holding up a mirror to modern culture and the American
dream with his show. And, he adds, he probably would be the first
to be voted off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Also in this issue is an entertaining profile of George Clooney,
whose idea of a fun evening is cutting his own hair and spending
the night alone with a plate of pasta and ``The Baby Goat
Murders,'' Mississippi writer Larry Brown's true story about life
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Heir apparent: The royals haven't been in the news lately,
what with the news moratorium placed on Princess Diana's sons after
her death. That apparently is over now that Prince William turns 18
on Wednesday. Newsweek ($3.50) features William as its cover story,
with the inside scoop on his life out of the spotlight. So what's
the scoop? Well, now we know that he drives a Volkswagen Golf and a
motorcyle, likes techno music, was rumored to be interested in
Camilla Parker Bowles' niece Emma, and plans to study art history
after taking a year off to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: AMI Auto World Weekly ($2.49) debuts today with
72 pages of buyer-friendly reviews, price comparisons and ``spy
photos'' of the newest, not-yet-released vehicles such as the
Lincoln pickup and the Audi A8. ... U.S. News &AMP; World Report
($3.50) takes a similar route with a look at the sleek new cars
marketed to appeal to baby boomers with empty nests and full
wallets. Models include the Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Chevrolet
SSR: a hybrid of a truck and a convertible.

CENDENT SUES ERNST &AMP; YOUNG, CHARGING COMPLICITY IN MERGER FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cendant Corp. contended in a court filing Monday that the
accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young knew of widespread fraud at CUC
International, a predecessor to Cendant, by 1997 and chose to help
the fraud along rather than expose it.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young immediately responded by attributing the fraud in
part to Cendant's current chief executive, Henry Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   Three former CUC officials pleaded guilty to fraud charges last
week, with one saying the fraudulent accounting practices began as
early as 1983. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in bringing
a civil action against Cendant, concluded that the fraud had begun
by the late 1980s and might have started much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   In an amended complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court in
Newark, N.J., Cendant contended that ``by 1997 at the latest, E.&AMP;Y.
knew that the financial statements of CUC did not fairly reflect
its financial position and knew that CUC senior management was
fabricating the supposed support for its financial statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The amended complaint contends that the auditing firm concealed
the fraud ``first by negligence, then by conscious avoidance and
eventually by active facilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fraud was exposed in April 1998, a few months after CUC
merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant. Cendant's current management,
largely the former management of HFS, says that it relied on Ernst
&AMP; Young for assurances in completing the merger after it was denied
access to information by CUC officials, ostensibly out of concerns
that HFS might become a competitor if the merger collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young has previously sued Cendant and its executives,
contending that by March 1998, when the accounting firm signed off
on the 1997 annual report, the former HFS officials had discovered
that CUC was manipulating merger reserves ``to manufacture phony
earnings,'' but did not tell the auditing firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are suing Henry Silverman and others responsible at Cendant
because they knew there was fraud and did not inform their auditors
or anyone else,'' said Larry Parnall, a spokesman for the
accounting firm. ``They made the conscious decision to keep that
from the public. We are ready, willing and able to litigate this
case in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those merger reserves also figure prominently in the new Cendant
complaint against the auditing firm, which contends that it was
Ernst &AMP; Young that had information that the merger reserves were
phony but nonetheless certified the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cendant complaint contends that Kenneth Wilchfort, a partner
in Ernst &AMP; Young, wrote the documents the company used to explain
an inflated merger reserve created for the deal that formed Cendant
and then inserted them in the file as company documents. Similarly,
in manipulating a reserve related to another merger, the complaint
says that Simon Wood, a manager for the auditing firm, wrote a
memorandum for CUC officials to sign that justified fraudulent
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contention that Ernst &AMP; Young officials knew of the
fraud, the new Cendant complaint says that CUC officials ``were
careful not to place E.&AMP;Y. in the awkward position of knowing too
much or lacking documentation for its audits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognized,'' the complaint continues, ``that although
E.&AMP;Y. would facilitate the fraud, it would insist at all times on
`deniability.'''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint contends that the auditing firm ``tipped'' CUC
officials about what items would be audited so that much of the
fraud could be concentrated in areas that would not be audited.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant shares traded for more than $40 each in early April
1998, soon before the fraud was disclosed, but fell to a low of
$6.50 in the fall of that year. Monday, they fell 12.5 cents, to
$13.375.

FOR BRITISH, NOTHING LIKE A GOOD ARGUMENT OVER CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Last October, at his party's annual conference, Prime
Minister Tony Blair declared that Britain's class war was over.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair forgot to check with the British people, not to
mention his cabinet, most of whom seem to relish nothing more than
a good argument over class.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the debate has raged on the front pages and
newscasts as Britain's most privileged defend a system they
consider a meritocracy, while others plead for more equality of
opportunity in education, health care and employment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Blair's insistence, the class war in Britain, like the
soccer rivalry between Manchester United and Arsenal, is never
over.
</P>
<P>
   According to many Britons, even those who wish it weren't the
case, class is the biggest single issue facing them _ bigger than
race, bigger than their ambivalence toward the European Union and
integration with Europe, bigger even than soccer, the national
pasttime, bigger than anything.
</P>
<P>
   And while the conventional wisdom holds that Britain is a
country where a dwindling number of aristocrats cling to a
crumbling pedestal of privilege, class prejudice cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Blair proclaimed the class war over, members of
his Labor Party applauded a quartet of teenagers who played some
jazz for them. At the end of the performance, the students' teacher
informed the gathering that the quartet hailed from a exclusive
local private school. The cheers then turned to boos.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the class divide delight in labeling the
other. The upper classes are derided as toffs, judged by their
``posh'' accents. Rich people dismiss the poor as ``working
class,'' the words dripping with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Blair's allies guffaw at his claim that the class
war is over. One Labor member of parliament, Alan Simpson, _ who,
unlike the former US senator whose name he shares, is an avowed
liberal _ dismissed Blair's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be daft to pretend that a problem goes away just
because you decide not to talk about it,'' said Simpson, who
represents Nottingham.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Wheen, an historian and author of a recent biography of
Karl Marx, said Blair is not the first British prime minister to
claim the class war was over. Harold Macmillan did it in 1959.
Without a trace of irony, Macmillan went on to name a cabinet that
included a duke, a marquess, and three earls, Wheen said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The English,'' Jeremy Paxman, who as the host and
chief interrogator on BBC's ``Newsnight'' is the Ted Koppel of
British television, says the English are ``class-obsessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxman says the widespread interest in the homes of rich people,
including the aristocracy, is part of the British obsession ``to
see how the other half lived and to imagine themselves in their
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Britain is far less class-ridden than it was
when Macmillan declared the class war over. Yet the British
political system remains class riven, with the two major parties
identifying themselves with the extremes while battling for the
biggest group, the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives have long represented the interests of the
upper classes, including the aristocracy, while Labor was built on
the back of the working class. With the two extremes more or less
set in stone, the two major parties spend most of their time
striving to make themselves appear more in tune with what is known
as Middle England. Parliamentary observers claim that Conservative
leader William Hague has suddenly rediscovered the Yorkshire accent
he lost while studying at Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an 18-year-old honor student named Laura Spence
poured gasoline on the simmering class war when she accused Oxford,
Britain's most prestigious university, of rejecting her because she
had a working-class accent and attended a comprehensive, or public,
high school. Spence, who will instead attend Harvard on a full
scholarship, became the darling of the tabloids, and an object of
derision for the elite, who sought to brand her as an immature girl
hurling sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But showing just how volatile and seductive the issue of class
is, many of those championing Spence are members of the very elite
she says perpetuates institutional discrimination against
working-class and middle-class kids like herself. Several members
of Blair's cabinet publicly backed Spence.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Blair himself, and nearly every member of his
cabinet, like nearly every British minister over the last two
centuries, is a product of the exclusive private school system and
Oxbridge _ Oxford and Cambridge universities.
</P>
<P>
   Oxbridge graduates control much of Britain. Eight of the last
ten prime ministers attended Oxford. Three-quarters of the nation's
judges, two-thirds of its civil servants, and many leading
journalists are Oxbridge graduates.
</P>
<P>
   But while the influence Oxbridge's graduates wield is
undeniable, some see the attack on Oxford by Blair's top aides as
being disingenuous and opportunistic, a case of pandering the
majority who can't get in. Noting that Labor's latest offensive in
the class war came as the Conservatives have finally begun to chip
away at Blair's massive popularity, The Economist magazine
observed, ``To assault leading universities for being elitist is
nonsensical. You might as well attack the England football team on
the same grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Economist and other opinion shapers contend, the real
problem is not the class of those getting into the universities,
but the wide gap between the academic performance of mostly poor
children at publicly-funded state schools and wealthy children at
expensive private schools, which confusingly are called ``public''
schools in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of British children attend private schools, but
they get nearly half the places at Oxford and Cambridge. It is that
divergence in achievement, and a corresponding gap in spending at
public and private schools, that Blair's critics say perpetuates
the class divide, not the selective admissions at the elite
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Leanda de Lisle, who writes an occasional column for The
Guardian newspaper and who went to a private boarding school before
attending Oxford, says most of her classmates were not elitist. But
she rejects the claim by defenders of the Oxbridge system in
particular, and of the status quo in general, that Britain is a
meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merit,'' she says, ``is never enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others maintain that it matters more here than anywhere
else in Europe where your family comes from, where you went to
school, what kind of accent you have _ and that all of those things
are linked.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Guardian, de Lisle said the class stratification
in London is stifling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely hear an English regional accent in London,'' she
said. ``Everyone I meet talks with the same BBC-style received
pronunciation. That way, I suppose, they can be understood by the
aristocrats that attend any party thrown by the metropolitan elite.
It seems the rich and powerful need to have access to a class that
you have to be born into to feel really special.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair has used legislation to break down the hold of privilege.
Britain was the last country in Europe to end the practice of
giving the traditional nobility legislative powers _ in the House
of Lords, Britain's upper house of Parliament _ as a birthright.
Last year, Blair got rid of the so-called hereditary peers, who
have for centuries held a majority in the House of Lords and have
traditionally been very conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, however, has had less success in changing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be Oxford student Spence said that when she sat down for
her old-fashioned interview with a panel of Oxford dons, one made a
condescending remark about her accent. In the United States, and in
many other European countries, such a remark would be grounds for a
discrimination complaint. Not here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, the laws dealing with discrimination are about 30
years behind the times,'' said Paul Kelley, the American-born head
teacher at Monkseaton Community High School near Newcastle, which
Spence attends.
</P>
<P>
   Because affirmative action is considered reverse discrimination
and is illegal here, Britain has been less successful than America
in integrating police and fire departments, and the military. While
blacks and other minorities make up more than five percent of the
59 million people in Britain, they hold about one percent of the
police, fire, and military jobs. In London, where about 20 percent
of the 7 million population is minority, the percentages are
roughly the same as the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley says the inability of Britain to integrate its public
sector is as much about class as it is about race and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British in general don't think they are racist or
classist. They point to other places, like America, and see more
extreme forms of racism and delude themselves into thinking they
are not capable of such things. They are in complete denial,'' said
Kelley, a native of Berkeley, Calif., who was an activist in the
American civil rights movement of the 1960s. ``Class is the last
taboo here. My guess is they'll be talking about the class war long
after I'm gone.''

   U.S. Lines Redux
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently saw an advertisement for United States Lines. Is
this a rebirth of the old cruise line of the SS United States and
the America? _ Jan Heck, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The U.S. Lines is returning to the high seas, but it is not
the line you remember. The name was acquired by the American
Classic Voyages Co., a holding company with a collection of
passenger lines: American Hawaii Cruises, the Delta Queen Steamboat
Co., Delta Queen Coastal Voyages and now, United States Lines. It
operates from the Robin Street Wharf in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Roderick McLeod, the chief executive
officer, said American Classic had acquired the rights to the name
from an heir of a former director of the old line, which last
carried passengers in 1969. It became a cargo business, then went
bankrupt in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   For the new line, American Classic has contracted for the first
new oceangoing passenger ships to be built in the United States in
45 years. These 72,000-ton vessels, to carry 1,920 passengers each,
are being built at Ingalls Shipbuilding Yard in Pascagoula, Miss.,
and are expected to sail in 2003 and 2004, McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also acquired the 1,212-passenger Nieuw
Amsterdam from Holland America; after some refitting, it will be
used for weekly seven-day cruises among the Hawaiian Islands,
starting Dec. 9. The ship has been renamed the Patriot, and will
fly the American flag and have an American crew. When ready, the
two new ships will also be used in Hawaii, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot will differ from other liners mainly in its American
ambience, McLeod said. ``Some of it will be in the food,'' he said.
``A lot of it will be related to the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes on the ship are the removal of the casino,
since Hawaii does not allow gambling; replacing it is a Hawaiian
cultural center. The old United States Lines will be evoked in the
names of lounges _ No. 1 Broadway, the old line's address, and
Digby's Bar, after the old telephone exchange of its headquarters.
The ship has two outdoor pools, and children's activity centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian cruises on the Patriot will leave Honolulu on
Saturday and dock at Nawiliwili, Kahului, Hilo and Kona, then
return to Honolulu. Rates are $1,599 to $4,249 a person, double
occupancy. Reservations and information: (877) 330-6871, and

   World War I Sites
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there travel agencies specializing in tours of World War
I battlefields in France? I am particularly interested in Verdun. _
Jack R. Siegelbaum, Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most American military tour specialists seem to deal with the
Civil War or World War II. But a Virginia company, Military
Historical Tours, has several tours that may interest you.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patrick Mooney, the company's executive vice
president, there will be four to six World War I tours next year,
including a two-week general overview in September 2001 that visits
Verdun.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company has a Western Front Battlefields tour
from Aug. 16 to 25. It doesn't go to Verdun but does visit the
Marne, the Somme, Flanders and Ypres Salient. The cost is $2,495 a
person, including round-trip air fare from Newark, hotels, buses
and at least two meals a day.
</P>
<P>

COURT BARS SCHOOL-SPONSORED PRAYER ON PUBLIC PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutional
separation of church and state Monday, reaffirming its longheld and
much-challenged position that there is no place for
school-sponsored prayer on public property, including high-school
football fields.
</P>
<P>
   In a case brought by two families _ one Mormon, one Catholic _ a
6-3 court majority ruled that a Texas public-school district cannot
allow a designated student to lead football fans in a pre-kickoff
``invocation,'' even if the solemn message is ``nonsectarian and
nonproselytizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the
court majority said the First Amendment's ``establishment clause''
forbids the state _ in this case, a school district _ from imposing
its religious views on its citizens. ``The district asks us to
pretend that we do not recognize what every Santa Fe High School
student understands clearly _ that this policy is about prayer,''
Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the Constitution ... prohibits any public-school
student from voluntarily praying at any time before, during, or
after the school day,'' Stevens added. ``But the religious liberty
protected by the Constitution is abridged when the state
affirmatively sponsors the particular religious practice of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, joined by Justices Clarence
Thomas and Antonin Scalia, vehemently objected to the majority's
``distortion'' of the Constitution, which, Rehnquist wrote,
President Washington got right when he heeded the request of
Congress and ``proclaimed a day of public Thanksgiving and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the
court's opinion,'' Rehnquist wrote. ``It bristles with hostility to
all things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has struggled with questions about public
observance of private faith for 40 years. In a landmark decision in
1962, the high court struck down school-sponsored prayer. A year
later, it outlawed Bible-reading and recitation of the Lord's
Prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians predictably praised the ruling and hailed
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer for joining Stevens to form
a solid majority on a court that so often splits 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great decision for religious freedom because it
guarantees that religious majorities cannot ride roughshod over
minorities at government-sponsored events,'' said Barry Lynn,
executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church
and State.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, who argued the case for the Santa Fe Independent
School District before the high court, said the decision amounts to
censoring students and will cause more confusion about the bounds
of religious expression in public schools. ``The decision distorts
the First Amendment by exhibiting hostility toward student
speech,'' said Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for
Law and Justice, which was founded by evangelist Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who filed a brief urging the
justices to let the football-game invocations stand in his state,
said he was disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in voluntary
student-led prayer,'' Bush said in a statement released by his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore made no public statement on the decision.
Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for his presidential campaign, said
Gore supports private prayer in school but in the Texas case, ``the
prayer was found to be government-sponsored, and participation was
not truly voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Prayers at high-school football games are a time-honored
tradition in Texas, and the political winds blew so strong across
this case that the state Republican Party put a nonbinding
referendum on its primary ballot in March, asking whether
student-initiated prayer should be allowed at school sporting
events. The measure was endorsed by Bush and supported by 94
percent of the Texas GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1995, when two families in Santa Fe, a town of
10,000 about 40 miles southeast of Houston, sued the local school
district, alleging it was engaged in promoting Christianity by
distributing Gideon Bibles on school grounds, encouraging
membership in religious clubs, and permitting prayers at graduation
and football games. The American Civil Liberties Union represented
the families, who said they feared intimidation and harassment in
their community and never allowed their names to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   To pass constitutional muster on the prayers, the school
district changed its policy of appointing student chaplains and
instead set up school elections to select student speakers and to
decide whether there should be invocations at games and graduation.
The modifications, aimed at drawing a distinction between what is
public speech and private expression, did not persuade the federal
district and appeals courts; both said the invocation policy still
violated the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court heard the case in March, and narrowed its
focus just to prayer at football games. In 1992, the court in Lee
v. Weisman ruled that graduation prayers organized and sanctioned
by public schools are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, Stevens wrote that the court ``refused to turn a
blind eye'' to the fact the school district was changing its policy
but not its purpose, which was to promote football game prayer. And
he dismissed the school district's argument that attendance at
football games was voluntary for students, noting that
cheerleaders, band members, and football players were required to
be there, and social pressure was strong on other high-school
students to attend as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible
because it sends the ancillary message to members of the audience
who are nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of
the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents
that they are insiders, favored members of the political
community,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delivery of such a message _ over the school's
public-address system, by a speaker representing the student body,
under the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school
policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer _ is
not properly characterized as private speech,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Court experts said they doubted this would be the last judicial
word on school prayer. Both Gary Bauer, a social conservative who
ran against Bush in this year's GOP primaries, and Ralph Neas, head
of the liberal group, People for the American Way, said they hoped
this ruling would elevate the status of who serves on the Supreme
Court as a campaign issue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said the ruling was neither unexpected nor definitive on
the issue of school prayer. Several more cases on student-initiated
prayer at high-school graduations are pending in federal courts and
could work their way to the Supreme Court as early as next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been litigating school prayer for 40 years, and I expect
it will be litigated for another 40,'' Sekulow said.

 &HT;    Chicago suburb reflects swing decision in Illinois
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLIET, Ill. _ The battle line in Illinois politics has always
run between Democrat-steeped Chicago and the Land of
Lincoln-Republicans elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign 2000, those forces will face off in Will County.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest of Chicago, Will County's northern fringe of farmland
is getting bought up, subdivided and paved at one of the fastest
rates in the nation. Many of the homes go for $200,000 to $1
million, with developers offering deals including no down payment
for buyers who agree to paint their new home's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Couples with young children and Chicagoans fleeing skyrocketing
rent and condo prices are flooding Naperville and Bolingbrook,
looking for good schools, a bit of yard and a two-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, this is uncharted water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody understands who is out there yet,'' U.S.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said recently in an interview with the
The Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's suburbs tend to lean Republican and, in the Naperville
area in Will County's developing northern tier, Republicans have
been able to recruit committee members in 18 of 21 precincts.
Democrats have none, according to a county political directory.
</P>
<P>
   But Will County also has its share of labor-Democrats and
moderate voters who have cast ballots for Bill Clinton. And,
interviews show, they are inclined to give Vice President Al Gore
the benefit of the doubt for nurturing today's good economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the way the Democrats have handled the last two
terms, with the environment and economically,'' said Jeff Arthur,
43, an electronic engineering technician at the federal Fermi Labs
complex in the Naperville area. ``I don't have a lot of faith in
(Texas Gov. George W.) Bush. I don't think he's proved himself
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the 3-year-old, $60 million Neuqua Valley
High School campus, Scott Storms, 32, took a break from moving into
his home in a new subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Storms, a resident of the area all of two days and a manager for
IBM, is ready to vote for Gore as well, because of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel it should be somebody's right to choose,'' Storms
said.
</P>
<P>
   Will County, Illinois' fourth largest, extends from the
southwestern Chicago suburbs, past blue-collar Joliet into Illinois
farmland, and wraps around southern Cook County to the Indiana
line. The candidate who does well here is doing well among swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The county went for the winning Republican candidates in the
1980s, Ronald Reagan twice and Bush in 1988. But Clinton won here
twice, getting an assist from Reform Party Ross Perot's 33,000
votes in 1992, when Clinton's winning margin over President George
Bush was 1,300 votes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Will County Republican Chairman Jack Partelow thinks
Bush has a good chance to return Will County to the Republican
column. The primary in March showed far more Republican voters
county-wide than Democratic, even though both primary races were
locked up by then.
</P>
<P>
   Partelow was encouraged because the busy suburbanites typically
do not bother with primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to primary elections you can't pry them out for
anything, we'll have 7 percent turnout,'' he said. ``Then in the
general election they'll come out like gangbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   Partelow believes Bush will have the numbers on his side if the
county party can organize new residents the old-fashioned way: door
knocking, phone calls, precinct captains and grass roots contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the thing's we're going to bring to bear is grinding it
out on the ground,'' Partelow said. ``We're going to do a Woody
Hayes thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide open spaces in the eastern Will County have seen a
decade-long battle over whether to site a third major Chicago
airport there, possibly in Will Twp., near the village of Peotone.
The long-suffering project has created strange political
bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat whose district includes
southern Chicago suburbs, is in favor of the project as a jobs
creator, as is Republican Gov. George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, the protector of O'Hare Airport,
has fought against it, along with the conservative farmers who live
around Peotone.
</P>
<P>
   Will Twp. Supervisor Everett Schurman, a 70-year-old farmer, has
cast a virtually automatic Republican ballot for decades, but the
threat of losing his family farm to a runway has gotten him to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this time around I'd have to think about it a bit
more,'' Schurman said. ``Gov. Ryan is supporting the airport and if
Bush came in, there could be the possibility of the airport coming
faster than otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schurman has lived amidst the Peotone airport debate for
10 years. He figures he has time to decide whether the airport
issue alone is worth picking Gore over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't look at that until (Election Day),'' he said.

 &HT;    Ilinois seens as a key state in presidential battle
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Summer in Illinois means heat, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sun baked farmers worry about drought and sweaty Chicagoans
crank their air conditioners, then wait for the city's electrical
system to crash.
</P>
<P>
   But as it does every four years, this summer's looming inferno
will be a calm before a political storm. Like it or not, Illinois,
with 22 electoral votes, holds a key to the White House. The state
voted for the winning candidate in 23 of 25 presidential elections
in the 20th century, and is up for grabs this year. A poll taken in
early May showed Texas Gov. George Bush and Vice President Al Gore
running even, 41-41.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so close, somebody doing a really dumb stunt, or somebody
running a really brilliant campaign, it can make a difference,''
said John Jackson, political science professor at Southern Illinois
University at Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, the huge, ancestral Democratic clubs of Chicago are
balanced by the city's suburban voters and by conservative voters
downstate, where the Republican Party has its roots.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top Democrat, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, has less
power than his father, Chicago icon Richard J. Daley, but still
controls a huge party machine. The state's top Republican, Gov.
George Ryan, turns to the massive and growing Chicago suburbs for
support, but has been damaged politically _ even though not
directly implicated _ by a corruption scandal stemming from his
tenure as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   And the state's voters are known for crossing party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illinoians have a great reputation for being ticket
splitters,'' said Charlie Wheeler, director of public affairs
reporting at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Despite summer doldrums and distractions, the campaigns have
begun to do battle in this important state. In May, the Democratic
and Republican national committees started airing television ads in
selected markets here and in other key states. The Democrat ads
promote Gore's support for adding prescription drug coverage to
Medicare. The spots for Bush push his proposal to allow workers to
invest some of their Social Security contributions in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign will ignore other areas of the country, but in
Illinois, as in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, each with its a
history of swing voting, the candidates _ and voters _ are in for a
long, humid Midwestern summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who carries all four of those states you just mentioned
wins the election,'' said Jack Partelow, a retired vice president
for Dun and Bradstreet and Republican chairman of Illinois' fourth
largest county, Will County.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rule in Chicago and some counties directly across the
state, near the Quad Cities along the Mississippi River, and again
southeast of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Illinois is mainly Republican. The first Republican
president was Illinois attorney Abraham Lincoln, and Republicans
haven't lost much ground downstate since.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of issues percolating near the top of political
discussions here, from $2 gas to Gov. Ryan's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But during recent interviews all across the state, people
repeatedly mentioned their children.
</P>
<P>
   Grumbling over gun safety often boiled down to keeping guns away
from kids, or protecting children and families from crime.
</P>
<P>
   And schools were the front-line of concern, whether the voter
lived in the massive Chicago Public School district or a
high-performance suburban district.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Goodwin, president of a property management company
based in South Side Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, represents
one conundrum for the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the burgeoning black middle-class in Chicago, Goodwin
sends his son to a private high school. He has one chance to give
his son a good high school experience and figures his odds are
better there than in Chicago schools.
</P>
<P>
   But long-term, Goodwin sees public schools as the only thing
that will keep society from pulling itself apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his store-front office on a busy city street, Goodwin
said he vehemently opposes Bush's support for school vouchers, even
though parents like him would be a target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to mean people like me could get a free education
at a private school but the people on the bottom will still be on
the bottom,'' he said. ``We'll have a permanent underclass.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 miles to the south in Decatur, blue-collar city of
about 82,500, schools also are at the heart of local conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur reluctantly made national headlines last fall when a
video-taped melee in the football bleachers led to the suspension
of four high school students. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and others
protested that the students involved were punished too harshly. The
region has launched a flurry of racial initiatives and programs
aimed at getting people of different color speaking with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   But voters black and white said what really matters are schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many were disgusted that city voters have repeatedly rejected
new school taxes _ leading the school district to close one of
three city high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they are inclined to give their vote to the
presidential candidate who can connect their policies to better
local schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make sure about the future,'' said Sabrina
Hall, 27, of Decatur, who has a son finishing kindergarten. ``I
don't have any (presidential) preferences. (Education) is going to
be a factor for years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, as elsewhere, Gore can try to ride the coattails of
the nation's longest economic expansion. Many voters here said they
were inclined to keep him around in order to keep a good thing
going.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the good economic times, there are large pockets of
Illinois where the surging stock market is a distant murmur.
</P>
<P>
   Farm prices remain low, and the downstate economy is built on
the growing, trading and processing of corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the economy whole and moving along is certainly on the
minds of the people in southern Illinois because we're not as
prosperous as the rest of the state,'' said Jackson, the SIU
professor.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago _ where abandoned public housing projects are being
razed for $600,000 condominiums _ the differences between the haves
and have nots are becoming bizarrely obvious. One developer, in
fact, has proposed a condominium complex, with the cheapest unit
going for $200,000, for a neighborhood near the infamous
Cabrini-Green public housing project.
</P>
<P>
   In South Side Chicago, one of largest African American
communities, Gore will have to play the economy card carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a restaurant on East 35th Street, Clarence Walker,
63, looked out on the Bronzeville neighborhood and mused about the
odd pressures brought on by the strong economy. The neighborhood,
home to former Black Panther and current U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, is
seeing its share of the economic good times. But housing prices are
rising quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The neighborhood) is getting what it needs now but it's
chasing most of the poor people out,'' Walker said. ``I can go
along with demolition, but you have to have replacement housing. If
I quit working it could be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks away, in the bright and bustling Spin Cycle
Laundromat, Vira Booker, 44, a hospital clerk on medical leave,
watched TV while waiting for for a load of clothes to finish.
</P>
<P>
   She has been worried more about her own finances than the
presidential race. In March, she said, the rent for the apartment
she had lived in for 21 years rose from $450 a month to $800. Her
neighborhood was gentrifying, and her landlord had rehabbed some of
the building and was trying to recoup the investment. Booker paid
the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid for that building over time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the South Side offers a potential avalanche of votes for
a Democrat who can motivate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 dogfight between Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and
incumbent President George Bush, Clinton obliterated Bush on the
South Side. He earned about half of his statewide 700,000-vote
margin of victory in just the 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts,
which take in the South Side and some politically like-minded south
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gore's biggest advantage is that Bush has an even
tougher hill to climb here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I prefer (Gore) so much as I don't like Bush and
the Republican agenda,'' said Goodwin, the real estate management
president.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republicans' message hurts them on the South Side.
Bush's call for programs that help the middle class or even the
lower middle class does nothing for the poorest of the poor, said
Goodwin, whose neighborhood includes the Robert Taylor Homes
housing complex, one of the country's largest and poorest public
housing complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to live with the underclass; (Republicans) don't have
to live with them,'' he said. ``We see them everyday, walking the
street, begging for money, unable to get jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstate, too, the economy has been frustratingly inconsistent.
Riverboat gambling has brought new money into Joliet. In Decatur,
the huge industrial plants of grain processor Archer Daniels
Midland and the manufacturing yards of Caterpillar are busy again,
but the city still shows the effects of crippling strikes of the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The city's unemployment rate was 6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Lehman, 68, a retired cable company worker, said the key to
the election will be his pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have money, they're happy,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman retired once, then went back to work cutting grass and
helping friends on their farms.
</P>
<P>
   He backs Gore, as do many in the Decatur area, but said he would
have liked if Arizona Sen. John McCain had stayed in the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain received 159,000 votes, 22 percent, in the Illinois'
Republican primary March 21, even though he had suspended his
campaign two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a registered Democrat but McCain, he cared about working
people,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   If the South Side can be the cornerstone of a Gore win, suburban
Chicago offers Bush a foundation. Due west of Chicago's downtown
loop, Brookfield and scores of other Chicago suburbs long ago
knitted together into a political force, mainly a conservative one.
The area is so consistently conservative Bill Clinton did not carry
Park Ridge _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's hometown _ in either 1992 or
'96.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Doig, 80, kneeling delicately to plant flowers alongside
her trim, Brookfield bungalow, said she is paying attention to the
presidential race and will likely vote for Bush. Folks in this area
make do for themselves, and the Republican message of self-reliance
has strong believers here.
</P>
<P>
   Doig is underwhelmed by the pandering to senior citizens in the
campaign so far and all the attention devoted to Social Security
and subsidized prescription drugs for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors can't expect a free ride,'' she said, brushing dark
soil from her garden gloves. ``We believe you work and save to take
care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Doig figures, Social Security is not in crisis yet. She
expects nothing to change until it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too political,'' she said. ``They're not going to touch
it. Ten years from now, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstate in the rural farmland, Bush's support for gun owners
is finding an ear among a strong hunting and pro-gun constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside highways in southern Illinois, gun supporters have
sequences of small signs that, like Burma Shave advertisements, are
meant to be read at 50 MPH.
</P>
<P>
   ``No gun has ever ... committed a crime ... time upon time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not campaigning in a vacuum, however. His honorary state
chairman, Republican Gov. Ryan, is being hurt by the ongoing
federal probe into bribes and the sales of truck driver's licenses.
Ryan has not been implicated directly in the scheme that stems from
his time as secretary of state, and has said he inherited a
secretary of state's office in which corruption was built into the
system.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan's approval ratings have plunged statewide, and Bush
must juggle whether it helps or hurts him to tour Illinois with
Ryan at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore also must decide how to get the most mileage out
of their money and time in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional approach _ visit Chicago, get on its television
stations, and reach half the state's voters _ has pitfalls. Those
campaign stunts don't really satisfy the Chicago voter, and then
make downstate folk feel ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Maher, the auditor for Will County, southwest of Chicago,
was county campaign chairman for three Kennedy presidential bids,
working for John, Robert and Ted. He believes Gore would make a
mistake just focusing on Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people running the campaigns in Chicago figure the collar
counties (which ring Chicago) are part of the same television
viewing market,'' Maher, 70, said. ``It ignores the fact that
people like to press the flesh. They like to talk to the candidate.
When they look at him on the tube instead of in person it has a
dampening effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has moved away from that practice, visiting the
downtstate capital of Springfield and other outlying cities during
a one-day swing through Illinois in March.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the race for the heartland, however, Bush and
Gore are not just fighting each other, they're battling for
attention, especially over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of the two candidates excites people right now,''
Maher said. ``I think when McCain and Bradley . . . were both out
of the picture, the interest waned considerably. We are in a lull
period. We're in that trough right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Springfield,'' added the University of Illinois'
Wheeler, ``the presidential race isn't even on the radar screen
yet. We have a mini-drought underway already.''

PIAZZA KEEPS MAKING THE BIG HITS WITHOUT VIDEO OR REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he is at the plate, Mike Piazza gives himself
instant feedback. He processes the pitches he sees and the way his
swing feels. Beyond that, he keeps it simple. There is too much
analysis of hitting, Piazza believes, and he does not need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go by total feel,'' Piazza said. ``That's just the way I've
always been. I've never really looked or bothered to analyze it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza never studies video. He just hits, and he has been
extraordinary this season, with a .365 average, 18 home runs and 50
runs batted in. He leaves it to others to uncover the mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza lashed a game-winning home run in San Diego last
month, the Padres' right fielder, Tony Gwynn, put his head down and
ran back. There was no way this ball was going out, Gwynn thought,
but in an instant it was gone, crashing violently from a back wall
to the trunk of a palm tree. Padres closer Trevor Hoffman, one of
the many star pitchers Piazza destroys, was the victim.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gwynn watched the homer on video. Piazza had hit
it off the end of the bat, with his backside pointing to the
third-base dugout, and yet the ball carried as it would from a
left-hander's bat. Gwynn was amazed: nobody else in the league
would have hit that out, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn later asked Piazza how he did it, and Piazza was
nonchalant. ``Hey, I don't know,'' he responded. ``I just got a
good swing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the brute strength displayed in that home run was
impressive, more impressive to Gwynn is how often Piazza hits the
opposite way. Gwynn, who has won eight batting titles, thinks
Piazza has the perfect temperament and the perfect stroke to win
one himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps the barrel in the hitting zone like a contact
hitter,'' Gwynn said. ``He stays in the hitting zone a lot longer
than your average power hitter. Most of your power hitters are guys
that get to the ball, through the ball, and then they cut their
swing off. But he just stays through the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That ability to angle the bat so it can meet the ball in any
spot allows Piazza to hit to all fields, though he said it is not
by design. His strength is not pulling, so Piazza naturally guards
against that, staying inside the ball and giving himself more time
to recognize the pitch because he knows he can hit to right.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza does all this without letting the physical pains of
catching disrupt the mechanics of his swing. Then again, there is
not much to keep in line. While other hitters use movement to
generate power, Piazza often seems to hit from a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Mets first baseman Todd Zeile said Piazza has always had a
simple swing. That is why he hits for such a high average. ``Less
moving parts, less to go wrong,'' Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his swings are freakish,'' said Cubs second baseman
Eric Young, a teammate of Piazza's with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
``He's able to go deep with just a flick of his bat. He can get
fooled and still hit a line drive. We were just in awe of some of
the things he can do with the bat. He puts good wood on the ball
every single swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' hitting coach, Tom Robson, said posture is the most
important thing for Piazza, and that he doesn't really flick his
home runs. ``He uses his legs better than anybody, but he gives the
illusion that he's using his hands,'' Robson said. ``The only thing
you can see is the end.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finishes his swing, Piazza sometimes twirls his bat
above his shoulders, like a conductor waving his wand after a show.
That flourish comes from the enormous force of the ball hitting a
bat moving so quickly with such mass behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Robson has never timed a player with better bat speed than that
of Piazza, whom he has timed at 0.14 seconds from the moment he
starts his swing until he makes contact. Paul Molitor, who had more
than 3,000 career hits, is the only other player Robson has seen
who can match that.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Piazza's mass. He is 6 feet 3 inches, 215 pounds,
and a sight to behold, especially for teammates watching him daily
for the first time. Mets outfielder Jay Payton, who is muscular but
smaller, marvels at the advantage Piazza gets from his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, he's just a good hitter,'' Payton said. ``Then
he has remarkable strength, and he knows how to use it. He knows he
can be very quiet at the plate and track the ball as long as he
can. A lot of times you see him hit balls out, and it looks like he
takes them right out of the catcher's mitt, because he's able to
wait so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``As strong as Mike is, he can get away with doing things other
guys can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets starter Mike Hampton said no player is stronger from
the forearms down than Piazza. Hampton, who has allowed eight hits
to Piazza in 24 at-bats, compared Piazza's strength to Mark
McGwire's.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the difference is that Mike hits more balls on the sweet
spot,'' Hampton said. ``He's less prone to a lot of different
pitches; he doesn't have very many holes. He might have one spot
where you might be able to get him three out of four times, but
that fourth time might be a home run that could be the difference
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   To Piazza, who said he tries to humanize the game's top
pitchers, the most important thing about hitting is discipline. He
is not afraid to hit with two strikes, he said, and he knows the
third strike is often toughest for a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell he is swinging well when there is no tension at the
plate, when he is not thinking about the count or the situation.
When he is late on pitches or pulling balls foul, Piazza knows he
must focus on hitting up the middle. But his basic tenet is simple,
unbending: hit the ball hard.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking on Piazza is to challenge him inside, to make him
pull the ball. Piazza can hit the inside pitch, but his preference
is to follow advice from Ted Williams, the Hall of Famer, who
visited the teen-age Piazza and famously remarked that the kid had
a good swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody was talking to Ted Williams one time, saying this
particular hitter had trouble hitting the high pitch,'' Piazza
said. ``And Ted Williams said, `Well, tell him not to swing at it,'
meaning it's a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I had trouble hitting the inside pitch for a time, so
I said to myself: `All right, well, don't swing at it. Or if you
do, make sure you approach it the right way.' The inside part of
the plate _ to get a strike, usually it's off the plate, because
they don't want to miss on the plate. When they do miss on the
plate, you can hit it a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   A hitter gets four at-bats a game, and the way Piazza sees it,
that means he has 12 strikes to use. If he can't hit four balls
hard out of 12 chances, Piazza said, something is very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows there are days that will not happen. It was
Williams, after all, who said hitting a baseball is the most
difficult task in sports. Piazza believes that, and it gives him
perspective. As close as he is to perfecting his craft, he knows he
will never master it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to accept that you're going to have times where you
don't feel like you can hit anything,'' Piazza said. ``You just try
to be consistent and stay with what's been successful for you.''
</P>

SURF THE NET CAREFULLY, OR YOU COULD END UP SWIMMING WITH THE
FISHES
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's all harmless fun, but I'm a little troubled by the
news that organized crime (the Mafia) and disorganized crime
(Congress) are both investing heavily in the Internet these days.
</P>
<P>
   This disturbs me nearly as much as Procter &AMP; Gamble's recent
announcement that it's developing special cartridges to bring
smells to computers. Oh, joy. Not only does technology furnish us
the opportunity to go into an America Online chat room and talk to
a 55-year-old loser named Ed who's pretending to be a leggy,
redheaded divorcee named ``HotMamma4U,'' now we'll be able to sniff
Ed's armpits too.
</P>
<P>
   You probably heard something about the Mafia's newfound interest
in the Internet. Last week, the FBI arrested 120 people, including
Robert ``Little Robert'' Lino, Frank ``Frankie'' Persico and other
members of New York's five most powerful crime families, on charges
of securities fraud. (Far be it from me to offer advice to the mob,
but what ever happened to the tradition of scary gangster names?
Frankie? Little Robert? For crying out loud, how about trying
something a little meaner for the Internet age, like Robert ``The
Spammer'' Lino or Frank ``The Delete Button'' Persico?)
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says these wise guys teamed up with shady stockbrokers
to talk thousands of investors into sinking $50 million into
companies of dubious merit. The sudden influx of cash drove the
company's otherwise worthless stocks up, enabling Little Robert,
Frankie and pals to dump their shares at a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that's how Wall Street ordinarily conducts business,
especially with Internet start-ups, but apparently it's quite
illegal. Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   The alleged scams, not surprisingly, include quite a few dot-com
stocks. In one case, the FBI says the mobsters were lining up
investors for a company that was supposedly planning to unveil a
new online trading system July 4. But oops the company never
bothered to seek regulatory approval for the system.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet outfit, E-Pawn.com, is also under scrutiny. USA
Today reported, rather cryptically, that the company sells time
shares at race tracks. (``Pssst, I got a three days, two nights at
Preakness for $450. Great place to take your little filly. The
offer heh heh won't last furlong. Whaddya say?'')
</P>
<P>
   The company touts itself as ``the world's yardstick of great
value and fun.'' I'm guessing this was a tip-off to the feds. I
mean, who measures fun with a yardstick? Cement, maybe, but fun?
</P>
<P>
   In time, I'm sure the feds will be able to herd the Mafia into a
tiny, manageable corner of the Internet. Maybe the FBI can set up a
nice suite of chat rooms next to Ed, the leggy redhead, and keep an
eye on the mobsters from there.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure Congress will be so easily controlled, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's newly released financial disclosure statements show
that its members _ like many Americans _ are investing heavily in
hi-tech companies. At least 63 senators have substantial
investments in big-name firms like Microsoft, AOL, and Lucent
Technology, according to The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing illegal about this, of course. But the
investments become problematic, as always, when lawmakers take up
bills that could benefit sections of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., drew attention
this spring when he led an effort to try to help NextWave, a
bankrupt wireless company, hold onto a Federal Communications
Commission license. It turns out Torricelli has substantial
investments in Global Crossing, a telecommunications company that's
sinking money into NextWave to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's office says he wasn't even aware that Global was
investing in NextWave. I have no reason to doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, though, I'm hoping somebody is keeping an eye on
the flood of tech money flowing through the bank accounts and
campaign funds of our elected officials. Call me cynical, but I
don't need a special cartridge from Procter &AMP; Gamble to tell me
these arrangements could turn smelly rather quickly.
</P>

FIRST SPACE TOURIST TO PAY ABOUT $20 MILLION FOR DREAM OF
LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling it the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, a
wealthy American money manager and former rocket engineer has
signed on to become the first tourist in space on a mission to the
Russian space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tito, a 59-year-old California multimillionaire, said on
Monday that going into space would satisfy an ambition that he has
had since childhood and was worth the price, estimated to be about
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a life's dream,'' Tito told a news conference
here via a telephone hookup from Moscow, where he is undergoing
medical and psychological tests to see if he qualifies for
spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this dream over 40 years ago and at that time, I didn't
have a penny to my name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Money is no longer a constraint, he said, and it is time to live
out the fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one life to live on this Earth and my commitment is to
fulfill all of my dreams which are healthy and legitimate,'' Tito
said. ``I am optimistic that I do have the right stuff to make this
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito, who has degrees in aerospace engineering and worked for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for five years
before becoming an investment analyst, said he wanted to spend part
of his time in orbit conducting special photography of the Earth
using a new system he was working out.
</P>
<P>
   Tito founded Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., in the
1970s to apply computer concepts to investment strategy, and the
company now manages about $10 billion in assets and is best known
for its Wilshire 5000 stock index.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Tito could be visiting the space station Mir
on a 10-day trip during the first half of next year, said officials
of MirCorp, a firm in Amsterdam that is raising money to continue
operating the aging Russian station.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp, which is 60 percent owned by Russian interests and 40
percent by American investors, earlier this year secured rights to
commercially market the aging, 130-ton space station that the
cash-starved Russian government had stopped supporting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two Russian astronauts returned to Earth after a
73-day, MirCorp-financed mission to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts, with the help of supplies from two cargo flights
to the station, also paid for by the corporation, repaired several
air leaks, replaced deteriorating batteries and revitalized the
station's life support systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The renovated Mir has now been declared ready for commercial
flights,'' said Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, a MirCorp director and
telecommunications entrepreneur who is an investor.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp has raised about $100 million to support Mir, including
more than $40 million in cash from investors and the rest in goods
and services from RSC Energia, the Russian company that built and
operates Mir and owns 60 percent of MirCorp, Kathuria said.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp officials declined to say exactly now much Tito would
pay for his trip, but said it was close to the $20 million that the
firm had stated such missions would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Kathuria said the company was talking with at least six other
individuals who have expressed interest in a trip into space.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp's president, Jeffrey Manber, speaking from Moscow,
acknowledged that space travel was not yet routine and that his
company's ``Citizen Explorers'' program was proceeding cautiously
in picking participants who could safely withstand the rigors of
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a game,'' Manber said. ``We are cutting no corners
here. It is a serious business which requires serious training.''
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp officials said a public stock offering is expected early
next year. Several potential ventures, including television
programming, advertising and promotion from space, and Internet
activities also are being discussed, officials said. Long-term
plans also include opening Mir to manufacturing involving exotic
materials and pharmaceuticals, and possibly using the station as a
base to assemble and launch satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Manber said the company will decide next month when the next
flights will go up to Mir, including a timetable for Tito's journey
if he is cleared to take it.

COMMUNIST VIETNAM TESTS STOCK-TRADING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ This week, 25 years after unifying under communism,
Vietnam is testing the systems that will run the country's first
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The opening bell may ring next month, but like Vietnam's
tentative experiments in recent years with ``market socialism,''
the tests are getting mixed results and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing will be believing,'' said J. Mark Mobius, a prominent
money manager who started a Vietnam fund in 1994 for Templeton
Asset Management Ltd., believing that the country would embrace
free-market reforms and make good on plans to open a stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials will not say exactly when the market will
open, though reports in government-controlled media have tipped a
July launch. In 1996, the government established a State Securities
Commission to create a stock market. But bureaucracy and corruption
have hindered efforts to lure foreign investment and privatize
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   There were some early indications on Monday that the Ho Chi Minh
City Securities Trading Center was getting off to a rocky start,
despite assistance from the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Mock
trading scheduled for Monday was reportedly thwarted by a power
outage that crippled the electronic trading board.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the board worked, it would report the stock prices of
just two companies _ the Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Corp.
and the Cables and Telecommunication Materials Joint Stock Co. They
are the only companies that have registered for a listing.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mobius' Vietnam fund, it withdrew from most Vietnam
investments in 1998 and broadened its focus to Southeast Asia.
Mobius said he remained unconvinced that Hanoi's communist leaders
could allow a free market to flourish in the former Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' he said. ``I'm not getting on the first
plane to Vietnam. I've been there. Done that.''

COURT BARS SCHOOL-SPONSORED PRAYER ON PUBLIC PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutional
separation of church and state Monday, reaffirming its longheld and
much-challenged position that there is no place for
school-sponsored prayer on public property, including high-school
football fields.
</P>
<P>
   In a case brought by two families _ one Mormon, one Catholic _ a
6-3 court majority ruled that a Texas public-school district cannot
allow a designated student to lead football fans in a pre-kickoff
``invocation,'' even if the solemn message is ``nonsectarian and
nonproselytizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the
court majority said the First Amendment's ``establishment clause''
forbids the state _ in this case, a school district _ from imposing
its religious views on its citizens. ``The district asks us to
pretend that we do not recognize what every Santa Fe High School
student understands clearly _ that this policy is about prayer,''
Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the Constitution ... prohibits any public-school
student from voluntarily praying at any time before, during, or
after the school day,'' Stevens added. ``But the religious liberty
protected by the Constitution is abridged when the state
affirmatively sponsors the particular religious practice of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, joined by Justices Clarence
Thomas and Antonin Scalia, vehemently objected to the majority's
``distortion'' of the Constitution, which, Rehnquist wrote,
President Washington got right when he heeded the request of
Congress and ``proclaimed a day of public Thanksgiving and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the
court's opinion,'' Rehnquist wrote. ``It bristles with hostility to
all things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has struggled with questions about public
observance of private faith for 40 years. In a landmark decision in
1962, the high court struck down school-sponsored prayer. A year
later, it outlawed Bible-reading and recitation of the Lord's
Prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians predictably praised the ruling and hailed
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer for joining Stevens to form
a solid majority on a court that so often splits 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great decision for religious freedom because it
guarantees that religious majorities cannot ride roughshod over
minorities at government-sponsored events,'' said Barry Lynn,
executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church
and State.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, who argued the case for the Santa Fe Independent
School District before the high court, said the decision amounts to
censoring students and will cause more confusion about the bounds
of religious expression in public schools. ``The decision distorts
the First Amendment by exhibiting hostility toward student
speech,'' said Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for
Law and Justice, which was founded by evangelist Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who filed a brief urging the
justices to let the football-game invocations stand in his state,
said he was disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in voluntary
student-led prayer,'' Bush said in a statement released by his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore made no public statement on the decision.
Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for his presidential campaign, said
Gore supports private prayer in school but in the Texas case, ``the
prayer was found to be government-sponsored, and participation was
not truly voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Prayers at high-school football games are a time-honored
tradition in Texas, and the political winds blew so strong across
this case that the state Republican Party put a nonbinding
referendum on its primary ballot in March, asking whether
student-initiated prayer should be allowed at school sporting
events. The measure was endorsed by Bush and supported by 94
percent of the Texas GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1995, when two families in Santa Fe, a town of
10,000 about 40 miles southeast of Houston, sued the local school
district, alleging it was engaged in promoting Christianity by
distributing Gideon Bibles on school grounds, encouraging
membership in religious clubs, and permitting prayers at graduation
and football games. The American Civil Liberties Union represented
the families, who said they feared intimidation and harassment in
their community and never allowed their names to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   To pass constitutional muster on the prayers, the school
district changed its policy of appointing student chaplains and
instead set up school elections to select student speakers and to
decide whether there should be invocations at games and graduation.
The modifications, aimed at drawing a distinction between what is
public speech and private expression, did not persuade the federal
district and appeals courts; both said the invocation policy still
violated the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court heard the case in March, and narrowed its
focus just to prayer at football games. In 1992, the court in Lee
v. Weisman ruled that graduation prayers organized and sanctioned
by public schools are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, Stevens wrote that the court ``refused to turn a
blind eye'' to the fact the school district was changing its policy
but not its purpose, which was to promote football game prayer. And
he dismissed the school district's argument that attendance at
football games was voluntary for students, noting that
cheerleaders, band members, and football players were required to
be there, and social pressure was strong on other high-school
students to attend as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible
because it sends the ancillary message to members of the audience
who are nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of
the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents
that they are insiders, favored members of the political
community,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delivery of such a message _ over the school's
public-address system, by a speaker representing the student body,
under the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school
policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer _ is
not properly characterized as private speech,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Court experts said they doubted this would be the last judicial
word on school prayer. Both Gary Bauer, a social conservative who
ran against Bush in this year's GOP primaries, and Ralph Neas, head
of the liberal group, People for the American Way, said they hoped
this ruling would elevate the status of who serves on the Supreme
Court as a campaign issue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said the ruling was neither unexpected nor definitive on
the issue of school prayer. Several more cases on student-initiated
prayer at high-school graduations are pending in federal courts and
could work their way to the Supreme Court as early as next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been litigating school prayer for 40 years, and I expect
it will be litigated for another 40,'' Sekulow said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly a million low-income parents have lost
Medicaid coverage and have probably become uninsured since Congress
and the states began overhauling the nation's welfare programs in
1996, a consumer group said in a new study Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Families USA, said the number of low-income parents
enrolled in Medicaid in 15 states had declined by 945,880, or 27
percent _ to 2,557,673 in December 1999, from 3,503,553 in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those states are home to 70 percent of the uninsured adults who
are under the age of 65 and have incomes less than twice the
federal poverty level, or under $28,300 for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   When it passed a landmark welfare law in 1996, Congress tried to
guarantee continuation of Medicaid coverage for people losing cash
assistance. But many states did not carry out the requirements of
the law, and until recently federal officials said they were
unaware of any serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, people leaving welfare are automatically
entitled to health insurance under Medicaid for six months to a
year, but states have not always provided this coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA did not trace individual families who left welfare,
but other studies have found that adults in such families typically
take low-paying jobs that do not offer health benefits. Even if
parents are offered health insurance by employers, they are often
unable to pay the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said:
``Our study shows that hundreds of thousands of low-wage working
parents were cast adrift without health insurance when they did the
right thing and found jobs. Most parents moving from welfare to
work are in jobs that provide no health coverage, but they are
losing their Medicaid lifeline.''
</P>
<P>
   The study said that Medicaid enrollment of parents dropped by
155,846, or 19 percent, in California; by 123,630, or 25 percent,
in New York; by 95,854, or 42 percent, in Ohio, and by 106,012, or
46 percent, in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said that New York and Ohio had liberalized eligibility
standards for Medicaid in the last year so more parents would
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the number of people on welfare and Medicaid
might be expected to decline in a booming economy, which has
reduced the unemployment rate to the lowest level in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Pollack said: ``If Medicaid enrollment
declines while the number of uninsured grows, there is obviously a
problem. Reductions in Medicaid enrollment are, in fact, fueling an
increase in the number of people who are uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health
and Human Services, said: ``The report by Families USA shows that
there is a lot of state-to-state variation. States can and should
do more to expand Medicaid coverage for people leaving welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, Skolfield said it was ``too early to know for sure
if there is a cause-and-effect relationship'' between the steep
decline in welfare rolls and the increase in the number of
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say hundreds of thousands of children also lost
Medicaid when their families lost welfare benefits. But the decline
in children's insurance coverage has been offset, to some extent,
by the creation of federal and state health programs specifically
for children.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said most states imposed strict limits on the income
that a parent could earn and still qualify for Medicaid. In 32
states, he said, parents who work full-time at the minimum wage of
$5.15 an hour are considered to have too much income to qualify for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Louisiana, Virginia and Texas,'' Pollack said, ``parents
working at the minimum wage are disqualified from Medicaid if they
work more than 12, 17 and 18 hours a week, respectively.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Clinton administration ordered states to restore
Medicaid benefits to families who had been improperly deprived of
such coverage.

SPORTS COLUMN: TIGER WOODS APPROACHES HIGH TIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Watched some golf on Sunday. Really. Right after the
Spain-Slovenia soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   There on the tube was a most stunning impression, visual and
olfactory _ the lush swell of the Pacific Ocean, throbbing against
the cultivated lawns of a golf course called Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Smell-o-vision. This was a new one on me. You could inhale the
aroma of thick kelp and foamy saltwater surging alongside the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha, maybe you ought to play golf,'' said my wife, who wonders
what I will do with my spare time in the very distant future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' I said. ``I just want to walk along the ocean like we
did last summer on Big Sur.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who would dare dream about committing to golf after
watching Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   How could it possibly be good for the golf industry to let this
man perform in public?
</P>
<P>
   It was not hard to imagine, late Sunday night, the wracking
sound of men and women taking baseball swings with their golf clubs
against the nearest sugar maple or loblolly pine.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, some of the also-rans in the United States
Open would not have been blamed if they had hurled their entire
kits into the Pacific Ocean. What's the point? Why go on?
</P>
<P>
   If it was not clear before Sunday evening, it is obvious now.
Tiger Woods dominates sport _ not merely his sport, but sport in
general _ as completely as anybody we have seen in a long, long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has stolen this spring from everybody else _ Shaq,
Kobe and Reggie out in LA last night, Martin Brodeur performing
kick saves 'round midnight, Edgar and Pedro and Conchita and all
the other Martinezes, whoever it was who won the French tennis, the
three Triple Crown horses.
</P>
<P>
   He stole it with his composure and his compact power. If you
could tear yourself away from gazing at the sea, it was all Tiger,
all day, all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   You could imagine producers screaming: ``Stay with him! Stay
with him!'' at their camera operators, trying to capture every
precious shot, since there were not that many.
</P>
<P>
   The camera just adores him _ trim and young, as athletic as an
Olympic swimmer, as feral as a Tomba or a Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   The great golfers before him were not mistaken for athletes, not
the wiry Ben Hogan or the avuncular Arnold Palmer or the ursine
Jack Nicklaus, but this young man just bristles with quiet energy.
One could envision him as a whippet of a second baseman, with a bit
of pop in his bat, his throws not skulling anybody in the box
seats.
</P>
<P>
   When he twists his slender body, not much ripples inside the
mulberry shirt, but the ball bounces far ahead of drives by
fleshier men.
</P>
<P>
   As he walks down the fairway, he barely acknowledges the
gallery, his attention focused inward in what seems to be a
permanent state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no defense in golf, virtually no teamwork, he
is out there alone, on some new frontier of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to Tiger Woods in recent decades has been
Secretariat barreling through the 1973 Triple Crown, winning the
Belmont by 31 lengths, so far ahead that the other horses could
only surmise by his hoof prints that they were indeed in a race.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan? He swaggered and stuck out his tongue and took
over a game, but there were roustabouts who could knock him off his
spot occasionally, and sometimes he would just plain miss.
Frustrated golfer and baseball player that he is, Michael knows
nobody commands a sport the way Tiger Woods does.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, pitchers throw the odd perfect game, but they are one-day
wonders. Lawrence Taylor was the most dominant football player of
his time, but LT did not play offense _ a failure of imagination of
his coaches and not his own doing, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Armando Maradona could dish out one spectacular pass that
beat Brazil in a World Cup game, but only after this addled genius
had lain in the weeds for the other 89 minutes. Reggie Jackson hit
three homers in a World Series game, but he struck out a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky? There was a lot of Tiger Woods in him. Cool.
Excellent. Smart. Decent. But he had his Messiers and his Fuhrs and
his Coffeys and his Semenkos on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger has no opposition, only a field. Ali had Frazier.
Navratilova had Evert. DiMaggio had Williams and Musial. McGwire
has Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger has only himself and his caddie and his touch and his
inner light, but that is quite enough. Even the pungent Pacific
swirls in for a closer look. &QL;

BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER STEPPING MORE SMARTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There is a new smartness in the step of Britain's
Conservative leader, William Hague, putting him in closer reach of
front-running Prime Minister Tony Blair and in distant sight of the
previously unimaginable destination of 10 Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   With the likely date of the next national election less than a
year off, Hague is succeeding in dominating the political headlines
for the first time in the three years since he took over the
depleted and dispirited Tory party, once Europe's mightiest
election machine.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has not shaken the common conviction that Labor will
win the vote that is expected for next May, he has managed to throw
the long-unassailable government on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   A series of mistakes and miscalculations by the Blair
administration has given Hague an opportunity he has aggressively
seized to score points in areas where Tories have not shown well in
the past _ like city government, health care, law and order,
immigration and old-age pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's attempts to defend his record by calling Hague an
opportunist and pointing out past Conservative failures are proving
unconvincing. With Labor entering its fourth year of power, the
public now assigns it responsibility for social service shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Although Labor politicians still believe the party's re-election
chances are secure, they are unsettled at seeing the Conservatives
setting the current political agenda. Within the Conservative
Party, Hague's performance has stilled earlier talk of his being
removed after the next election and replaced by Michael Portillo,
the former defense secretary who had been the favorite of many
Tories longing for a bruiser at the head of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Hague has shored up his standing in the party by combining his
hardline stance against Britain's adopting the euro as its currency
with a new focus on combating an enemy he identifies as a ``liberal
elite.'' This element, he says, coddles ``bogus'' asylum seekers,
allows a ``flood'' of illegal immigrants into the country and is
soft on crime, school discipline and sex education for youth, and
not supportive enough of families.
</P>
<P>
   Deftly turning the tables on Labor, he criticized government
efforts to hold the line on pension increases as ``miserly'' and
said pensioners were the ``unwanted, unwelcome and uncool guests at
New Labor's banquet.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hague rises in people's estimations, however, even his
friends and supporters express concern that the steps he has taken
to turn himself into a more forceful leader of Her Majesty's
Opposition _ pushing hot-button populist issues in a way that can
leave him looking more like a rabble-rouser than a statesman _
might make him a less credible candidate for prime minister.
Building a protest movement is one thing, the reasoning goes;
leading a government is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that people say those things, although obviously
they're wrong,'' Hague said in an on-the-run interview while
campaigning last Thursday in a by-election contest in Tottenham in
North London. ``Actually it's been an advantage over the past three
years to be consistently underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I said to the party after the last election that we
would go through several stages in the recovery of our party. First
of all, people would say, `There's no way you Tories can recover.
You lost so heavily, you're finished forever. There's no way you
can ever get back.' Then they would say, `OK, you're recovering but
you know you won't be able to recover quickly enough.' Then they'll
say, `OK so you're recovering more quickly than you expected, but
you know you won't be able to keep it up.' And then I said, we'll
go onto the next stage, which is when they will say, `We always
knew the Tories were going to recover and be back in.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he concluded, ``we're not far off now from that fourth
point, and we're still very happy to continue to be
underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hague in the ascendancy, the weekly Prime Minister's
Question Time exchange of barked insults between Blair and him has
become blood sport. Hague opened last week's verbal punch-up by
quoting embarrassing criticisms of Blair in a leaked memo by the
prime minister's own public attitude-sounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again T.B. is pandering, lacking conviction, unable to
hold to a position for more than a few weeks and lacking the guts
to be able to tough it out,'' was one quote that Hague gleefully
read out to the Commons as Tory backbenchers lustily cheered him
on.
</P>
<P>
   Blair wagged his finger at Hague and warned that he could
retaliate with some focus-group comments about him, and when the
Conservative leader kept on, the prime minister made good on his
pledge to whoops of delight from the Labor side of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they say,'' Blair bellowed. ``Boring, false, he
irritates me greatly, pathetic drip, nonentity, no substance, no
personality, complete waste of time, no policies, a very
unimpressive team, particularly William Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   Hague's arrival as a credible Conservative leader follows a
sequence of failed ``relaunches,'' fresh starts and new
initiatives. Though at 39, he is eight years Blair's junior, he is
prematurely bald, crisp in his Oxford Union debating style and
comes on as something of a young fogey to many Britons, who know of
his reputation for having read parliamentary reports, memorized
speeches by Winston Churchill and learned the names and districts
of all Tory members of Parliament, all when he was just 15.
</P>
<P>
   Hague famously burst upon the scene a year later when, as a
mop-haired student, he took the podium at the annual Conservative
Party conference and fired up the faithful with a call to arms in
defense of Tory principles. Photographs from the time show Margaret
Thatcher looking on enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of an updated image once he was the leader, Hague put
on jeans and a baseball cap, slid down amusement park water
sluices, went to ethnic culture festivals, took outdoor adventure
vacations with his new wife, Ffion, traveled the country in a
studiously informal ``Listening to Britain'' campaign, and began to
call his philosophy ``kitchen sink Conservatism'' before abandoning
it this year for the slogan ``The Common Sense Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hague even cleared his office walls of pictures of his one-time
heroine Thatcher to stop colleagues from mooning over the party's
triumphal past and make them focus on the possibilities of a future
under him. Only now does it seem certain there will be one.

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLEN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit'' gang has plenty to crow about with its
first feature-length animated film, ``Chicken Run,'' a clever,
inventive movie that puts poultry on the cinematic map. The Aardman
stop-motion animators have fashioned a film that works on several
levels _ adventure, comedy and a nifty homage to World War II POW
movies like ``The Great Escape'' and ``Stalag 17.'' Here we finally
have a summer family movie that isn't bird-brained, but instead
smart fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' bears more than a passing resemblance to the
``Babe'' movies both in its story _ animals living under the shadow
of the farmer's ax _ and its dark, foreboding visual design. Of
course, Aardman's Oscar-winning work has always worn its sardonic
sensibilities and subtle, off-center British humor as a badge of
honor. ``Chicken Run'' simply takes those tastes and runs with
them, rather like a chicken with its head cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's action is set at the dreary Tweedy's Egg Farm, a
``fowl'' place of shabby, cramped barracks surrounded by fences
with barbed wire. Here, the English inmates _ the veddy proper
chickens _ must lay eggs regularly or face the chopping block. The
proprietor, Mrs. Tweedy (voiced with pinched perfection by Miranda
Richardson), is constantly looking for ways to boost her profits,
while her husband, the henpecked Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth),
monitors the chickens' activities.
</P>
<P>
   The birds, understandably, aren't very happy, but being
chickens, they're mostly resigned to their lot. Not so Ginger
(Julia Sawalha), an enterprising hen that longs for a better life
not only for herself, but the entire flock. Ginger devises new ways
to bust out of camp; but all her scheming usually goes no farther
than landing her in solitary confinement (a trash dumpster, where
she bounces a rubber ball, a nod to ``The Great Escape'').
</P>
<P>
   Enter Rocky (Mel Gibson), a brash American rooster who somehow
flies into camp one day. This ``lone free ranger'' has escaped from
his employer, a traveling circus. He and Ginger make a deal: She'll
hide him if he'll teach the chickens how to fly. Time is of the
essence, too, since Mrs. Tweedy has just purchased a contraption
that will turn the birds into chicken pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run,'' in its own way, is every bit as marvelous to
look at as Disney's computer-animated ``Dinosaur,'' and it boasts a
much sharper and imaginative story. Directors Nick Park (the man
behind ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit's'' delightful man-and-dog duo) and
Aardman co-founder Peter Lord take stop-motion animation to new
heights, while never forgetting (and having fun with the fact) that
its creations are lumps of clay. This leads to some great visuals
during those scenes when the chickens try to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also ably helped by his vocal cast. Gibson's manic
personality makes him a perfect fit for the cocky rooster, and
Sawalha, best-known for her work on the BBC sensation ``Absolutely
Fabulous,'' gives Ginger a tough-hearted tenderness that is quite
touching. Another ``Ab Fab'' alum, Jane Horrocks, provides
memorable voicing to Babs, a rotund chicken that's continuously
knitting, and Lynn Ferguson comically brings to life the Scottish
chicken Mac, the coop's counterpart to ``Star Trek's'' Scotty.
</P>
<P>
   That these are but a few of the film's noteworthy characters
illustrates just how well Park and Lord have brought their birds to
life and made them distinctive creatures. The movie, like the
chickens themselves, seems at times to be a prisoner of its static
setting. But when the filmmakers break free, like during an
inspired scene that has Rocky and Ginger going on a roller coaster
ride through Mrs. Tweedy's pie-making machine, their efforts more
than match the sophisticated whimsy of the ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit''
shorts. This is a wonderful film. &QL;

 &HT;    Healtheon/WebMD restructures major deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Healtheon/WebMD has reshaped its agreement to buy
Medical Manager and its CareInsite subsidiary, boosting the price
and relinquishing some control.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the acquired companies will become co-chief
executive of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the deal is endorsed by shareholders and regulators,
the Atlanta-based, post-merger company will be called WebMD _ the
name under which it was launched just two years ago before
beginning a spectacular series of deals including a merger with
California-based Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Shortening the name underscores the millions spent on touting
the WebMD brand, said Jeffrey T. Arnold, now chief executive of
Healtheon/WebMD. ``It also shows that we will be one company.''
</P>
<P>
   Boosting its bid in the fear that the deal would be scotched by
shareholders, Healtheon/WebMD, which aims to put health care
transactions on the Internet, will exchange 2.5 shares for each
share of Medical Manager. When the acquisition was announced in
February, Healtheon/WebMD was set to swap 1.65 shares, in an
agreement then valued at more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Healtheon/WebMD stock has collapsed since then, falling from
$68 to less than $17 a share at the close of trading Friday. News
of the revised deal nudged Healtheon/WebMD down still more.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Monday's closing price of $14.56 a share, shareholders
of Medical Manager will be receiving stock worth less than $2
billion _ even with the sweetened rate of exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also concerned about the merged company's
operations, anxiety that should be soothed by creating a shared CEO
slot in which Arnold would have equal billing with Martin Wygod,
who is now chairman of Medical Manager and CareInsite. ``That was
my idea,'' said Arnold. ``There has been uncertainty about whether
the deal was going to happen. Investors wanted to make sure that
Marty had an active role in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, 30, is slightly less than half Wygod's age.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement should break with most power-sharing
precedents, he said. ``Co-CEOs typically don't work. But we think,
with the age difference and our complementary skills _ we know it's
going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman W. Michael Long, who will remain chairman of the merged
company, said the executives have divvied up their roles based on
their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold is accomplished at marketing and deal-making, while Wygod
has a career's worth of experience and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm a generalist, so I got to be chairman,'' Long
said. ``But the right team, the strongest management, will
determine winners and losers as much as capital and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the deal from federal regulators could come by
mid-September, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, top executives are searching for places in
which the companies overlap, expecting to find tens of millions of
dollars that can be cut post-merger. Corporate and marketing
headquarters will remain in Atlanta, with technology work centered
in Santa Clara, Calif., Long said.
</P>
<P>
   However, smaller satellite offices may be closed and other jobs
cut.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people work for Healtheon/WebMD, and about 3,000
work for Medical Manager and CareInSite, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD has yet to be profitable, but that will change
by the end of next year, Long said. ``We believe we will beat the
most aggresssive estimates that are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD has sought to provide ``end-to-end'' solutions
that will use the Net to connect patients, providers and those that
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase of Medical Manager and its subsidiary would eliminate a
key rival for market share.

COMMENTARY: KNIGHT IS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some things are true even though Phil Knight, the chairman of
Nike, believes them.
</P>
<P>
   Knight recently made news for suddenly withdrawing a
contemplated $30 million gift to the University of Oregon after the
university balked at joining a coalition _ the Fair Labor
Association (FLA) _ that was formed by human rights groups,
colleges, the U.S. government and companies such as Nike to
alleviate global sweatshop conditions. Oregon opted to join an
alternative group being pushed on college campuses, the Worker
Rights Consortium (WRC), which also plans to combat sweatshops, but
refuses to cooperate with any companies, such as Nike.
</P>
<P>
   The natural assumption is that Knight is wrong. The truth is,
Nike has a shameful past when it comes to tolerating sweatshops.
But on the question of how best to remedy those conditions in the
future _ which Nike has now agreed to do _ Knight is dead right and
Oregon wrong: The best way to create global governance _ over
issues from sweatshops to the environment _ when there is no global
government is to build coalitions, in which enlightened companies,
consumers and social activists work together to forge their own
rules and enforcement mechanisms. That's what the FLA represents
and it's what the WRC doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard plenty this year about the downsides of
globalization. The question is what to do about it. The more
radical protesters, such as the WRC, want to trash multinationals
and get the World Trade Organization to set rules for workers and
the environment, not just for trade. And what practical effect have
the protesters had so far? Zero.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? Well, it comes down to this: Do you want a make a
point or do you want to make a difference? The FLA was formed to
make a difference. The WRC was formed to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   The FLA was forged four years ago, and it now includes the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the National Council of
Churches, the International Labor Rights Fund, 135 universities and
major apparel companies such as Liz Claiborne, Levi Strauss, Nike,
Reebok and Adidas. After long talks, this diverse group agreed on a
nine-point code for any apparel factory anywhere in the world _
including rules against forced labor and child labor, as well as
freedom of association, minimum wages, maximum working hours,
lighting, bathrooms and safety. They also agreed on a system of
independent monitoring, surprise inspections and follow-ups, which
is now being tested in five developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Companies whose factories comply will be able to sew an ``FLA''
label into their clothing, and the 135 universities have agreed
that their logos will go only on FLA-made products. Global brands
can't afford any longer to be associated with sweatshops, and the
FLA creates a credible system for empowering consumers to punish
dirty companies and reward improving ones.
</P>
<P>
   The WRC, by contrast, is backed by protectionist U.S. unions,
such as Unite, that don't want any system that would give a stamp
of approval to any production outside the United States. That's one
reason the WRC won't work with companies. But that means the WRC
has no way of consistently monitoring factories or following up
remedies, and it is only focused on clothing sold on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   It's good that there's a WRC out there noisily protesting
sweatshops and embarrassing companies. But the WRC is not a
substitute for the FLA, which has a comprehensive strategy for
upgrading the whole apparel industry. It's a pity that some
cowardly college presidents _ intimidated by a few vocal and often
uninformed students _ have quit the FLA in favor of the WRC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to improve people's lives in the absence of a
global government, you need to align the economic interests of the
better global companies with the social interests of the least
advantaged people,'' said Sam Brown, the 1960s antiwar activist,
former U.S. ambassador and now director of the FLA. ``We need to
make these companies our allies, not our opponents. We won't change
the world overnight. But it is foolish to dismiss the FLA because
it does not go far enough or fast enough. The issue is how to get
from here to there, and the FLA has a real strategy for harnessing
U.S. consumer power to change the lives and working conditions of
real people.''

 &HT;    Now good time to scrutinize investments
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Midyear is always a good time to take stock _ no pun
intended _ of the economy and the markets, which is what the
business press is doing right now.
</P>
<P>
   In its midyear investment outlook, Business Week (June 26)
offers articles that are cautious but positive, declaring that a
``soft landing'' _ slower economic growth but no recession _ is
likely, and there are still plenty of investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now's a good time to return to basics,'' says the magazine.
``If you've been socking money solely into large-capitalization
tech stocks, start with a short course on the benefits of asset
allocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (July 3) says the Internet mania that gripped the market
late last year and early this year has ``finally, decisively,
burned itself out.'' But the industry is headed for ``a brutal
shakeout.'' A Merrill Lynch analyst says 75 percent of the publicly
traded Internet companies will not be around in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But far from being a requiem for the new economy... the market
has begun to separate the companies with staying power from those
that do little but burn through their backers' cash,'' Fortune
says.
</P>
<P>
   Business 2.0 (July 11), a ``new economy'' magazine, says the
spring stock market slide ``has already claimed the weakest victims
among Internet businesses.'' Reality, and austerity, have finally
set in on the stock market. But the magazine's advice to investors
is: ``Don't panic,'' and survival strategies are available.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans know of Richard Branson, if at all, because of
his Virgin Atlantic airline. But that's just one of the many
enterprises that bear the Virgin logo, Forbes (July 3) says in a
cover profile of this 49-year-old British businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin empire started with a record company and now
encompasses over 150 separate enterprises,'' says Forbes. ``The
Virgin name may be found on cola, rail cars, storefronts selling
mobile phones and, of course, the Internet.'' His next target? What
about Britain's national lottery?
</P>
<P>
   Barron's (June 19) says Wall Street is looking for
second-quarter corporate profits to expand by 20 percent, and
companies that fall short of expectations will suffer the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Success (July/August) offers still another look at Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in a cover story that doesn't offer
anything new but is a good summary of the Fed's current interest
rate strategy.

COPING WITH CANCELED FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midafternoon on Friday, May 26, was brilliant and sunny at La
Guardia Airport. Passengers were moving briskly in anticipation of
a holiday weekend. But a cloud was visible on the electronic
horizon: the schedule boards showed that United had canceled Flight
1719, due to depart at 7:30 p.m. for Dulles Airport near
Washington.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., the airline had posted ``delayed'' next to the
listing for the preceding trip to Dulles, the 6:30 p.m. United
Express Flight 7685. ``Flow control into La Guardia due to wind,''
Yvette Lazu, a United ticket agent, told this reporter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As hours passed, tangles compounded. The equipment for the 6:30
flight was changed, with a drop in passenger capacity from 50 to
29. Standby Dulles passengers were told there would be nothing for
them until Saturday morning. A queue of angry, quarrelsome,
occasionally weeping passengers began to struggle for ways to get
out before the holiday evaporated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be weather?'' a woman in line said. ``Look at that
beautiful day!'' She waved at the lowering sun, so blinding that
passengers shunned seats facing the windows. Others nodded,
distrusting the agent, even though weather was in fact to blame for
the cancellation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Down in the windowless Port Authority offices at La Guardia,
where the tower's instructions crackle on the radio, Anthony Layne
and Larry McAleer, the managers on duty, made telephone calls and
reported that Federal Aviation Administration controllers in
Westbury, N.Y., faced with strong winds to the west, were spacing
arrivals and departures more widely, bringing delays of 30 to 45
minutes across the board, a situation that continued until almost 9
p.m. Bad weather elsewhere brought other cancellations among La
Guardia's 1,100 regular daily arrivals or departures on seven
scheduled airlines on May 26, a day the airport was handling 19
percent more passengers than on a regular Friday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The classic flight-cancellation mis en scene at La Guardia, and
some incidents observed by reporters the same afternoon at Atlanta
Hartsfield and O'Hare in Chicago, were clear examples of
passengers' suspicions of airline motives and airline employees'
reluctance to speak of unwelcome realities. The observations also
indicate some ways passengers can reduce the difficulties caused by
cancellations. They're worth knowing about, because the trend of
cancellations is upward.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines do not guarantee their schedules. They try to adhere to
published schedules because it is less trouble than rebooking
frustrated passengers. But weather, air traffic, mechanical
difficulties, rules governing crew hours and hundreds of other
causes, including human error, can upset schedules. The government
exercises only a few regulations over passenger service _ penalties
for overbooking notable among them _ and there are no federal
requirements on how passengers on canceled flights are to be
treated.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of flights canceled is not high: from May 1,
1999, to April 30, 2000, cancellations by the 10 major airlines at
29 big U.S. airports ranged from 1.8 percent (November) to 5.7
percent (January, a percentage spike in a bad weather period). But
as flight totals increase, the percentages represent bigger
numbers. Last month 8,590 flights were canceled out of 307,116
scheduled. A year ago it was 6,487 out of 299,132.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When they cancel, the airlines say, they prefer to inconvenience
as few passengers as possible. A big plane intended for a lightly
booked flight may be transferred to replace a sidelined plane that
was to have carried a heavy load, and the lightly booked flight is
then canceled. This is not the easiest thing to do, airline
officials say, because the scheduled crew cannot always handle the
new equipment. But elimination of an undersold flight may be one
reason travelers believe cancellations are profit-driven, and
airlines can contribute to this perception. In Chicago on May 26,
when Trans World Airlines canceled Flight 207, due to leave O'Hare
at 5:44 p.m. for St. Louis, the attendant at the gate told a
reporter that it had been canceled because it was underbooked. A
spokeswoman for TWA in St. Louis, Julia Bishop-Cross, said later
that the flight had actually been full, that weather had caused the
cancellation, and that all the passengers were rebooked later that
evening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With traffic growing heavier, the airlines have adopted another
strategy: cancel rather than let delays backlog. If possible, they
cancel early, notify passengers at home and rebook them for the
next day rather than deal with ``rolling delays'' that may create
long waits at the airport.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   May 18, during the week before the Memorial Day holiday, was an
evening of major thunderstorms in New York, and incoming flights
were diverted and delayed, and outbound flights canceled wholesale.
A number of Port Authority officials said that cancellations
enabled the lines to rebook their passengers to Friday flights and
get the situation back to normal quickly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Spampanato, deputy general manager of Kennedy Airport, was
on duty, and he said the airlines' national headquarters, looking
at a Thursday night of foul weather, elected damage control. ``As
bad as it was on Thursday, the fastest way was to cancel flights
and recoup on Friday,'' he said. ``You have to position your
aircraft. It's a corporate decision the lines make looking at
everything from their headquarters. With a tie-up in New York, it
affects the globe.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To wit: on June 15 bad weather produced three- to six-hour
delays and 200 cancellations at La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   On the holiday weekend, United's difficulties with its short
flights to Dulles on Friday considerably upset Tony Horan, a New
York lawyer, and his wife, Susan Trotter. The couple bought a
country place in Virginia in January, and after a try with US
Airways, which Trotter said did not seem reliable enough, she
booked United tickets to Dulles for every other weekend through the
summer, paying $129 a person for each round trip. They keep a car
parked at Dulles, in Chantilly, Va. The previous weekend they got
in about 1 a.m., because of a United cancellation. This time they
had everything necessary to board the 6:30 flight, but when it was
shifted to a 29-passenger Jetstream, because Trotter refuses to fly
on smaller planes, they looked for alternatives. ``You stand in
line for a long time,'' she said, ``and you find that someone with
more mileage gets the seats.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The couple left the line of passengers trying to get rebooking,
and sat with a cell phone in the gate area. The 7:30 p.m. had long
been a dead issue, and they were looking for something out of
Newark. Because their car was at Dulles, a flight to Reagan Airport
would not serve. Finally they arranged a one-way car rental from La
Guardia to Dulles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rethinking July 4,'' Horan said. On the drive to Dulles
they called United and asked for a refund of the tickets they did
not use. Eventually, the line gave it to them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Linda Price of Charleston, W.Va., who works for AT&AMP;T, was on her
way home after running a training session for her employer in New
York. She finished early and arrived at the airport at 3 p.m. for
the 6:30 p.m. flight to Dulles, where she was to connect to a
flight to Charleston. As the delays mounted, she asked the gate
agent if she was going to make the second flight, and he told her
not to worry. When the flight finally took off at 8:34 p.m., she
was on board. But, said Gary Lonieski, United's manager of special
services at La Guardia, the flight did not arrive until 9:59, and
Price's connecting flight, 7603, had taken off at 9:50.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Layne of the Port Authority said that the sort of cascading
delays created by the winds in the west reported by the FAA's New
York Terminal Radar Control Facility in Westbury put airline
employees in a wringer. ``They are exceedingly slow to acknowledge
there are delays,'' Layne said. ``They push back from the gate on
time, but they know they will be held up getting out.'' That night,
takeoff delays reached an hour to an hour and a half before the
winds died at 8:50 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, the two United agents dealing with the
problems of those with tickets for the delayed, downsized flight
finally cleared the line-up. One passenger had taken 20 minutes,
during which she shouted at the agents: ``Who is going to pay for
the $500 hotel room I will not be occupying?'' After the flight
left, when the agent was asked what arrangements had been made for
that passenger, he said he did not remember. ``Not a great day,''
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, passengers on the canceled 7:30 flight were directed
to Gate 12C, where a United agent, Wally Cruz, was stationed to
rebook them. No one showed up. Cruz was asked if the flight was
empty, and he said no, 96 of the 112 seats had been booked, but
probably the passengers had learned earlier and taken other steps.
Some were probably rebooked on the 11:30 a.m. Saturday flight, he
said, because the 9:30 a.m. had also been canceled. This was a
result of a crew shortage, said Lazu, the ticket agent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the airlines do not phrase it that way, a good
expedient for travelers is to resume the old habit of reconfirming.
Nine out of 10 of the major domestic airlines have telephone
numbers for automated systems on which flight numbers can be
punched in and status information obtained; the same information is
available on the lines' Web sites. The 10th airline, Southwest, has
a phone that is answered by employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With cancellations increasing, travelers with immutable
deadlines _ weddings, graduations, speeches _ should probably
consider building an extra day into their schedules. People who use
travel agents can obtain telephone numbers that are staffed 24
hours, so rebookings can be made more easily than by standing in
line.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A day of watching the arrival and departure boards makes one
thing apparent: if there are incoming delays, there will be
outbound delays. When American Airlines Flight 354 inbound from
Chicago and Las Vegas was canceled on Friday evening, it was not
hard to see why Flight 303 scheduled to go to Chicago and San
Francisco at 6:30 a.m. Saturday was already canceled. It is doubly
worth checking the counter if such a possibility exists.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And looming cancellations are yet another reason to travel
light: those who carry everything with them are in a better
position to take a flight to an alternative airport.
</P>

U.S. TO EASE SOME ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration on Monday dropped many economic
sanctions against North Korea that were put in place a half century
ago after the country's communist forces invaded the South.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced in September that the United States
would ease the sanctions as a part of a strategy to coax the
Stalinist regime out of its largely self-imposed isolation. Last
week, after the summit meeting between the South Korean president,
Kim Dae-jung, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, the Clinton
administration said it would hurry to implement the change.
</P>
<P>
   The near complete collapse of North Korea's economy in recent
years has led to food shortages, starvation and widespread
stagnation. The end of sanctions by the United States could help
ease some of that economic desperation. North Korea will now be
allowed to export raw materials and goods to the United states and
open shipping routes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, also said
Monday that the administration had ceased referring to North Korea
and other countries as ``rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not changing behavior or policy,'' Boucher said. ``It's
finding a better description, a different description.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in an interview
Monday on National Public Radio that the State Department would now
calling nations like Korea, Somalia and Afghanistan ``states of
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the State Department had stopped calling North
Korea a rogue state several months ago. The announcement that the
State Department had formally dropped that designation may be a
step toward closer relations with the isolated nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the change in terminology will have no immediate practical
effect. North Korea is still classified as a terrorist nation, and
U.S. companies will still be prohibited from exporting
technologically advanced products that could be used for military
purposes. The United States, under law, must continue to oppose
World Bank and International Monetary Fund aid to the country,
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   After the summit meeting last week, administration officials
said that if the North further cut its nuclear arms program and
made other concessions, it could possibly be removed from the list
of terrorist nations, opening up the possibility of further ties.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement was another sign that the Clinton
administration wants warmer relations with North Korea. But prior
agreements between North and South Korea have never been
implemented. And if last week's agreements to allow divided
families to reunite and to work toward peace on the peninsula fall
apart, the United States could quickly pull back from its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still has 37,000 troops based in South Korea,
along the border with the North. And North Korea's missile program
has been used as the administration's primary justification for
implementing a strategic missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of North Korea's missile program lead the Clinton
administration to announce last year that it would drop some
sanctions. In exchange for that promise, North Korea agreed to
cease testing its long range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday will allow U.S. companies to invest in
agricultural and mining operations. And, according to the
announcement, U.S. companies will be allowed to export many goods
to the country without a license. U.S. residents and companies had
needed a Treasury Department license to do any business with North
Korea, including making humanitarian donations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to leave on Tuesday for a trip to China
and to South Korea, as she seeks to build on the momentum of
Monday's announcement and last week's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more concrete agreements from the summit meeting last
week would allow families split by the North-South division to
visit each other and even relocate. But it is unclear how far and
how fast the two countries will move toward national reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The summit seemed to indicate that Kim Jong Il is seeking to
hold on to power by opening his country up enough to win more aid
from South Korea, Japan and even the United States. But
reunification may not be in the personal interest of Kim Jong Il or
in the interest of South Korea, which would have to give billions
to create a market economy in North Korea or risk mass immigration
from the North to the South.

SENATE DEMOCRATS TO INTRODUCE PLAN FOR MEDICARE DRUG BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Del., R.I., Fla., N.D., Mont., Nev.)  (With WELFARE-HEALTH-CARE) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, the
panel responsible for Medicare legislation, plan to introduce a
bill on Tuesday to establish prescription drug benefits for the
elderly, even as senior Senate Republicans appear to be floundering
in efforts to develop a proposal of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' initiative, orchestrated by Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida, comes just a day before the House Ways and Means Committee
is to start voting on legislation to authorize outpatient drug
benefits under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he hoped his proposal would be ``the basis for a
bipartisan compromise,'' and he added, ``The chances are at least
50-50 that something will happen on this issue this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already set aside $40 billion over five years for
drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill is supported by five of the nine Democrats on the
20-member Finance Committee _ Graham, Max Baucus of Montana,
Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Charles
S. Robb of Virginia _ and by one Republican, Sen. Lincoln Chafee of
Rhode Island, who is not on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Graham said, drug insurance premiums for
most Medicare beneficiaries would be $35 to $40 a month, the same
as under a bill introduced last week by House Republicans. However,
people with high incomes would pay higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Under Graham's bill, the beneficiary would have to pay the first
$250 a year in prescription drug expenses. The government would
share costs beyond that amount, paying a larger proportion as a
person's drug expenses increased.
</P>
<P>
   The government would pay 50 percent of drug expenses between
$250 and $3,500, and the beneficiary would pay the rest. The
government would pay 75 percent of costs from $3,500 to $4,000 a
year, and it would pay all costs over $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is significantly different from the proposal offered by
House Republicans, which has a gap in coverage: Medicare would pay
half of drug costs from $250 to $2,100, but the patient would then
be solely responsible for several thousand dollars of drug costs,
and the insurer would not step in again until the beneficiary had
incurred $6,000 of costs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Graham's bill, the protection against very high drug
costs, known as catastrophic coverage, would begin in 2003, along
with basic drug benefits. By contrast, under President Clinton's
plan, basic drug benefits would begin in 2003, with catastrophic
coverage to follow three years later.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Finance Committee, Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., began meeting with committee members last week to seek
common ground, but members of both parties said the sessions had
been unproductive. Roth and other Senate Republican leaders have
not publicly offered any detailed proposals for Medicare drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under Graham's bill, the government would charge higher premiums
to individuals with incomes of more than $75,000 a year and
families with incomes exceeding $150,000 a year. The government
subsidy would be gradually reduced as incomes rose. The maximum
premium, 50 percent above the basic premium, would be charged to
people with annual incomes exceeding $100,000 for an individual or
$200,000 for a couple.

FULANI QUITS BUCHANAN CAMPAIGN, CITING VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the oddest couples in American politics have divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Lenora Fulani, whose political views hew as far to the left as
Pat Buchanan's do to the right, resigned as co-chairman of his
presidential campaign, accusing him of destroying their political
partnership by pressing his strong social conservative positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shaped your actual campaign _ both inside and outside the
party _ to appeal to a narrow constituency in ways that
increasingly excluded me, my adherents inside the party and the
base to which I relate,'' she said in a letter of resignation
delivered on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I must and do object to your efforts to transform
the party into a party of and for only social conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Her resignation came as little surprise to party officials, many
of whom raised an eyebrow, more likely two, when she joined his
campaign in November, even though it brought apparent benefits to
both.
</P>
<P>
   After years of operating on the political fringe as
standard-bearer and two-time presidential candidate of the
now-defunct New Alliance party, Fulani gained a foothold in the
nation's strongest alternative to Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, who left the Republican party last year to seek
the Reform party's presidential nomination, the alliance allowed
him to show that he could broaden the party's base, albeit from
unlikely sources _ blacks, Hispanics, gays, even Communists. Fulani
is long-known as a supporter of Marxist-Leninist politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their collaboration underscored certain shared views,
including opposition to big government and special interests.
</P>
<P>
   But in her letter, Fulani outlined events that convinced her
Buchanan was not only interested in gaining the Reform nomination
but also projecting broad views on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani also attacked Buchanan for not supporting Jack Gargan,
who was ousted as party chairman, during a meeting four months ago
in Nashville. Gargan was replaced by Pat Choate, Ross Perot's
running mate in 1996 who helped pave the way for Buchanan to join
the party. Choate stepped down last month for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of response to Fulani that the Buchanan campaign
released on Monday, Buchanan said he did not disagree with Fulani's
observations, defending his actions by saying, ``I believe
political leaders must defend the moral order rooted in the Old and
New Testament and Natural Law that is under relentless assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders predicted that Fulani's departure from the
Buchanan camp would have virtually no effect on the party or the
November elections, in which the party needs 5 percent of the
popular vote to qualify for federal matching funds in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might be upset, but not that many,'' said Gerald
R. Moan, the new national chairman, who dismissed Fulani's
complaints as much ado about very little. ``Buchanan doesn't
polarize the party any more than she has.''

 &HT;    Cute little cars flock to maker's Ga. hometown
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARTOW, Ga _ The little old cars are uncomfortable,
underpowered, and a bit uncertain when it comes time to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they're the stars of just about any car show where
they can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: the Bantams are simply irresistibly cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car is so silly that you have to love it,'' said Larry
Spindler, founder of the American Austin/Bantam Club. ``They're
just great little cars.''
</P>
<P>
   An expected 150 members of the club are gathering this week in
Bartow, the Middle Georgia town that is the birthplace of Roy S.
Evans, the supersaleman who bought the Bantam factory in Butler,
Pa., in 1937. Three years later, the company won the competition to
build the Army vehicle that became known as the Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the 100th anniversary of Evans' birth.
</P>
<P>
   The club presented the town _ whose population of about 300 is
roughly the same as when Evans was a boy _ with three large road
signs celebrating Evans' role in pioneering the Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Wednesday, there will be public events, including a
swap meet at the Bartow Community Center today and a tour to nearby
Louisville Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeeps and their commercial predecessors, the Bantams, were
not among the great success stories of American automotive history.
The factory did not have the capacity to build the number of Jeeps
the Army wanted, and the Bantams were too small for the public's
taste.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans' company did build vehicles that made history, and
before that, it turned out some pretty snappy little numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For those who collect the cars and come to the annual club
meets, the value is in the fun factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Bantam was the neatest little car I ever saw,''
said Verlie Shroyer, of West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a Bantam two years ago, spiffed it up, and now enjoys
all the attention it draws at the car shows. ``It draws more people
than the $100,000 Packards I park it next to, and it makes the
other owners jealous,'' Shroyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler Woodroof, of Franklin, Tenn., owns nine antique
automobiles, but his yellow 1938 bantam Roadster is his ``fun
car.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes it to local car shows or out for spins on most
weekends, he said, and in the two years he has owned it, he has put
a total of seven gallons of gas in.
</P>
<P>
   The Bantam was ``the world's first economy'' car, said Lee
Bortmas, of Butler, Pa. But light weight, small interiors and high
mileage were not what attracted buyers in those days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were durable, he said, but because not that many were made,
they're rare now.
</P>
<P>
   Bortmas drives one of the rarest of the Evans-made vehicles, a
converted Bantam Jeep that was never driven outside the company
factory. It was turned into a utility vehicle and used to shuttle
parts around the factory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Miller of Fort Pierce, Fla., has restored four Bantams,
though he has been blind for about 40 years. He owned a Bantam in
his youth, when he still had his sight, he said, and he thought
``it was such a cute little car.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he knows the cars inside and out, he said, he lets his
hands take over the examination and repair work. ``There's just
something about saving a car that would have been destroyed that
just appeals to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the club members, nostalgia overrides their
appreciation for automotive engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lloyd, of Barrie, Ontario, said his father used a Bantam
delivery vehicle for his grocery business during World War II, when
gas rationing made a regular panel truck impractical to operate.
Also, that little truck was the first vehicle Lloyd ever drove.

COMMENTARY: ANSWERS `R' US 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Due to the extraordinary degree of interest in the current
presidential campaign, we are going to answer a few of the burning
questions that have been raised about the Gore/Bush proposals for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   No really. Feel free. Ask us anything.
</P>
<P>
   So, do you think it was OK for them to eat the rats on
``Survivor''?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is well known that only cute species feel pain. Besides,
animal rights rules do not apply to anything that crawls into
people's kitchens and scurries around the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``Survivor'' rats are not an issue in this political
campaign. Except perhaps metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't get all that worried about Social Security. It's
not going to run out of money soon, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is not due to become insolvent until Al Gore and
George Bush are around 90. We have pending crises with earlier due
dates, but both men seem particularly attached to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Gore and Bush seem like the same person to you?
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about trust funds and ``retirement savings
plus,'' Al Gore is basically a Democrat who wants to spend more
money on domestic programs. George Bush can organize his schedule
so he will never be seen with another rich white person until
November, but he's still a Republican who wants to cut taxes and
spend more money on defense. Plus one has funny ears and says ``I
don't appreciate'' for ``I don't like,'' and the other has a bald
spot and talks as if he were dictating a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way you can work Tiger Woods into this? I think
people would pay a lot more attention to the presidential race if
Tiger Woods were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is not a part of the presidential campaign. But he
was on the Ryder Cup team that George W. Bush inspired with a
reading of Col. William Travis' ``victory or death'' letter from
the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Has Al Gore ever helped us win the Ryder Cup?
</P>
<P>
   No, but he does occasionally phone Shaquille O'Neal to wish him
luck before a big game. Now would you like to hear about Social
Security?
</P>
<P>
   No, explain the Bush ``Star Wars'' program. That has more of a
summer-movie feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   Today we are talking retirement. You may have read, for
instance, that Bush wants to let people invest part of their Social
Security money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Can you give me some details?
</P>
<P>
   Of course. That's why we're having this little talk. The details
are that citizens will be allowed to take an as-yet-undetermined
chunk of their Social Security money to invest, thereby earning a
much larger return unless the market happens to crash at an
inconvenient time. The program will create an as-yet-unestimated
hole in the regular Social Security program, which will apparently
have to be made up by yet-to-be-announced reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that polls show there are more young people who
believe in UFO's than believe they'll ever get Social Security
benefits?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, please. Young people don't believe they'll ever be old
enough to collect Social Security. It's like when Mick Jagger said
he couldn't imagine singing ``Satisfaction'' when he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Gore was young, did he ever think he'd be old enough to
collect Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore always was and always will be 55, which will start to
become a real advantage once he's 70. His Social Security plan
involves using most of the surplus to pay down the national debt.
Then as the debt gets smaller we'd take the money we save on
interest payments and squirrel it away to help pay for Social
Security and Medicare benefits when the baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the baby boomers should just have to work forever. It'd
serve them right.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the baby-boom generation, I'm getting really
tired of the rest of you people throwing darts at us just because
we got to stay in college until we were 32. Life wasn't a bed of
roses back in the '60s. We were always trapped between boring young
men who kept talking about what they would do to end the war as
sophomore class president, and fraternity guys who'd laugh when
somebody threw up on your shoes. It is no small burden to realize
that we've got one of each running for president.

 &HT;    Florida schools celebrate passing marks
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ The 350 children at Spencer Bibbs Elementary
School had never heard Principal Linda Scott shout so loud or jump
so high. They had never seen her dance down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the happiest I've ever seen Ms. Scott,'' said
11-year-old Kevin Mitchell, a Bibbs fifth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Scott got the spring in her step Monday. That's when the only
two public schools in Florida classified as ``failing''
institutions received passing marks from the state Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel smart,'' Kevin said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his ``A Plus'' education reform program, a
cornerstone of his 1998 campaign, Gov. Jeb Bush declared that any
public school whose students failed a state standardized test two
years in a row would receive an ``F'' grade.
</P>
<P>
   The program produced two failing schools in a statewide public
system of 2,500 institutions. Both were elementary schools _ Bibbs
and A.A. Dixon _ in Pensacola, a Navy town near the sugar-white
beaches of the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Students at failing schools are eligible for tax-subsidized
vouchers that can be used for private school tuition. Florida
started the nation's first statewide voucher program. Legislators
in Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina, among other places, have
discussed vouchers as a tool to improve public schools.
</P>
<P>
   During the past school year, 52 Escambia County students
accepted vouchers as part of the only such statewide program in the
country. Prompted by the potential market for voucher students, new
private schools opened in Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   A state court judge in March ruled tax-supported vouchers
violate the Florida Constitution by draining money from public
schools. The state has appealed, putting the legal future of the
voucher program in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, students at Bibbs and Dixon _ which serve
the poorest sections of the city _ have labored under the failing
label. Scott said visitors expect to see children swinging from the
rafters and graffiti scrawled on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Walking home, Bibbs fifth-grader Brittany Brandon said people
she'd pass on the street would tease her for going to an ``F''
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it would make me feel bad. But they didn't really
know what was going on,'' a happier Brittany said Monday, after a
celebration in the school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teacher told us we're not dumb,'' said second-grader Donna
Johnson, an 8-year-old at Bibbs. ``And anyway, `F' stands for
flying high.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott has spent as much time propping up self-esteem as she has
improving reading, writing and arithmetic. From memory,
second-graders repeat for classroom visitors the poem ``The Man Who
Thinks He Can,'' which concludes: ``Life's battles don't always
go/To the strongest or fastest man;/But sooner or later the man who
wins/Is the man who thinks he can!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of them,'' Scott said in her school's joyous
cafeteria Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Dixon, there was similar reaction. Students
cheered when officials announced that the school no longer was
branded with an ``F.'' As at Bibbs, kids snapped up chocolate chip
and sugar cookies brought by state Education Commissioner Tom
Gallagher. More than nine of every 10 kids at both schools qualify
for free or reduced-price lunches because of low family income. All
of them are entitled to free breakfast at Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Principal Judith Ladner said she wanted to temper her
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be too excited, and I'll tell you why,'' she
said Monday in her office. ``I don't want to give any credence to
the A Plus plan. We don't feel the A Plus plan was appropriate.
What we did takes time. There is not a quick fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at both formerly failing schools said they began
addressing academic weaknesses years before Bush took office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a political play, and our kids have been right in
the middle of it,'' Ladner said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20 schools that still could receive ``F'' grades for
the first time because of low writing scores. Their final grades
depend on math and reading scores, which haven't been released. If
those schools _ which the state education commissioner declined to
identify _ don't improve next year, their students could become
eligible for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to prove that every child can learn,'' Bush
said. ``The minute we create standards and an accountability system
where there's a different consequence between mediocrity and
improvement, good things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's taking credit for the success, makes Dixon first-grade
teacher Fonda Robertson bristle. During the winter, Robertson
removed her 5-year-old son Daniel from a so-called A school in the
next county because he wasn't learning his letters. The
kindergartner now reads fluently and enjoys books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get the respect we should have gotten before,''
Robertson said. ``This didn't just happen this year. Politics is
dirty and it's just a power game. And we won.''

BIG 737 ORDER EXPECTED FROM SOUTHWEST AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. is in final negotiations with Southwest
Airlines for what would be one of the biggest orders ever for its
next generation 737.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources confirmed that the nation's largest low-fare
carrier is close to ordering 64 or more of the next generation
737-700s.
</P>
<P>
   The order, expected to be announced soon, would be worth more
than $3 billion at list prices. The 737-700 has a list price from
$43.5 million to $51.5 million, depending on the configuration and
options requested by the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Because Southwest is one of Boeing's biggest and best customers,
it is likely getting a significant discount on the jets, industry
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has an all-737 fleet and was the launch customer for
the 737-700, the first of the next generation models. It entered
service with Southwest in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor Southwest would comment on the pending order.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be the biggest that Southwest has ever placed with
Boeing, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As launch customer for the 737-700, Southwest ordered 63 of the
jets in November 1993. The airline's next biggest order was for 59
of the same model jets in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing largest order ever for the next generation jets came from
American Airlines for 75 737-800s in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Delta ordered 70 of the 737-800s in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing builds four models of the next generation 737 at its
factory in Renton, Wash. They can fly higher, further and have much
greater fuel efficiency than the older ``classic'' 737s. The new
models are the 737-600, 737-700, 737-800 and 737-900. The first
737-900, the longest 737 ever, will roll out of the Renton factory
this summer for delivery to launch customer Alaska Airlines next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has recently landed several other big orders for its next
generation 737s. Last year, International Lease Finance Corp.
ordered 50 of the jets, and followed that with an order for 50 more
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus A320 family is the only competitor to the 737.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in this size category that Boeing has the most
competition,'' said analyst Peter Jacobs of Ragen MacKenzie.
``Essentially, Boeing splits the market with Airbus.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Southwest has stuck with Boeing, as have Delta and
American.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines can save on operating expenses by staying with one
manufacturer, rather than mixing their fleets with Boeing and
Airbus jets.
</P>
<P>
   And no customer has been as loyal to Boeing as Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 737s in the Southwest fleet are the older series
jets.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has ordered 142 of the next generation 737-700s, and
taken delivery of 65.
</P>
<P>
   A Southwest spokeswoman said Monday the carrier will be
operating 342 Boeing 737s by the end of the year. It has taken
delivery of 11 of 21 737-700s scheduled to be delivered this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-700 can carry from 126 to 149 passengers, depending on
the configuration. The Southwest 737-700s have 137 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest is the nation's seventh largest carrier and is
steadily expanding the number of flights on existing routes while
adding additional cities. It currently flies to 56 U.S. cities in
29 states. It began flying to Albany, N.Y., its newest city, in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The airline announced Monday that it will begin flying to
Buffalo, New York, the third New York city added to Southwest's
system in 15 months as it expends in the northeastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News first reported that Southwest would
place its largest order ever with Boeing for the 737-700. Southwest
is based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, quoting two unnamed people familiar with the
deal, said Southwest would order ```significantly'' more than 50 of
the jets within a couple of weeks. Industry sources independently
confirmed the forthcoming order to the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Airbus has tried unsuccessfully to break Boeing's
737 monopoly with Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has no chance with Southwest,'' said Richard Aboulafia,
senior aviation analyst at the Teal Group.
</P>
<P>
   He added that continued strong sales for the next generation 737
shows that it is more than holding its own against the popular A320
family of jets, which include the A319 and A321.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years, the A320 family has enjoyed strong
sales, and several once loyal Boeing customers have bought the
Airbus jets rather than the next generation 737.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the competing planes are selling about the same.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Boeing has 127 firm orders for all models of
its next generation 737.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus had 127 firm orders for its A319, A320 and A321 as of the
end of may.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Seddik Belyamani, Boeing's vice
president of sales and marketing, told the Post-intelligencer that
the next generation 737 has not lost an order competition this year
where it has gone up against the A320 family.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said the Airbus narrowbody jets, which use
fly-by-wire technology, are more advanced than the next generation
737.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia doesn't agree, though he acknowledged the A320 is a
``very good airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some thinking that Boeing is eventually going to have
to develop something all new, or should have,'' he said. ``I don't
buy into that at all. Part of me thinks it's an Airbus creation to
help sell the A320.''

BEYOND IRELAND TO A WIDER YET OFTEN BLEAK WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN LAVERY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A stone's throw from Davy Byrne's pub, where
fans of James Joyce celebrated ``Ulysses'' on Friday night, St.
Anne's Church was packed to the organ pipes with more than 700
people waiting to hear Irish authors read from their work at the
Dublin Writers' Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Before stepping to the microphone, the writer Colum McCann asked
one of the festival organizers if he could read a letter by Joyce.
It was a fair question: on June 16, or Bloomsday, this city
delights in celebrating Joyce, its most famous prodigal son. But
Pat Boran, who helped found the festival four years ago, made it
quite clear that Leopold Bloom was not welcome at this particular
party, warning with some choice Irish obscenities, ``Don't you
dare.''
</P>
<P>
   Boran is not alone among Irish writers who want to keep their
distance from what has become the Disney World atmosphere of
Bloomsday, with literary tourists re-enacting scenes in Victorian
era bowler hats and frilly blouses. So the festival managed to give
Joyce a quick nod, then nimbly step out from under his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gilligan, the festival director, said: ``There are other
great contemporary writers out there. We don't have to wait for
them to die to celebrate them.'' To that end, the festival featured
about 40 contemporary novelists and poets from Ireland as well as a
handful from Denmark, England, Germany and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day event opened with Doris Lessing, who engaged in a
lively conversation with the audience of 300 that upstaged her
reading of her new novel. Less mainstream material proved popular
as well, including a reading by children's authors. A session of
material written in Gaelic drew a full house.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the spotlight shifted somewhat from the
Writers' Festival, which began on Thursday and ended on Sunday, to
the International Impac Dublin Literary Award. In its fifth year,
the award is gaining recognition for its $120,000 prize money, the
world's largest prize for a single work of fiction. By comparison,
Britain's prestigious Booker Prize offers around $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of these awards should be more substantial,'' said
James B. Irwin Sr., founder of the American management consultancy
IMPAC, which set up the award with an endowment of $1.5 million.
Thanks to his grandfather, who emigrated from Ireland to the Bronx,
Irwin holds dual citizenship and chose to locate Impac's European
headquarters in Dublin more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company ceded administration of the award to the Dublin
public libraries. Libraries around the world nominate works of
fiction, which are then narrowed to a short list and deliberated by
a panel of judges.
</P>
<P>
   During the buzz of Bloomsday activity, Impac mostly kept to
itself. Its glittery award ceremony was run with no reference to
the Dublin Writers' Festival. Guests at the black tie award
ceremony were greeted by a corps of bagpipe players, followed by
actors on stilts coated in gold and silver body paint.
</P>
<P>
   Nicola Barker, the British writer, won for her 1998 novel ``Wide
Open.'' John Hume, the Nobel Peace Prize winner for his efforts to
broker a solution in Northern Ireland, presented the literary award
at the Irish Museum of Modern Art here. Toni Morrison and Philip
Roth had been on the short list for the prize. Barker read from
``Wide Open'' at the festival's closing event. McCann had flown in
from New York because his 1998 novel, ``The Other Side of
Brightness,'' was on the short list for the Impac prize. Last
year's winner, Andrew Miller, read from an unpublished manuscript
entitled ``Oxygen'' and answered audience questions with Colm
Toibin, one of Ireland's most accomplished contemporary novelists.
</P>
<P>
   Hume's presence at the ceremony and Toibin's seat on the judging
panel reaffirmed that the award is more than just an international
literary event that happens to take place in Dublin; it is a
festival that celebrates Irish writing, allowing the nation's
authors to stand up to the legacy of Joyce as well as another
figure dominating Ireland's cultural landscape, Frank McCourt.
McCourt's work has in some ways made it harder for younger Irish
writers to work with the country's best-known literary themes, from
rural poverty to alcoholism to family strife.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland is experiencing both peace and economic prosperity for
the first time in modern history, which means a transition for its
literature after centuries of suffering and struggle. Still, a
handful of Irish playwrights _ including Sebastian Barry and Martin
McDonagh, both Broadway favorites _ continue to explore the harsh
conditions of decades gone by.
</P>
<P>
   The up-and-coming generation of Irish writers were born during
the 1960s, left the country during the '80s and have since
returned. To some, the Irish novel has become an international
novel, McCann said. His book ``The Other Side of Brightness,'' for
instance, explores the history of the New York City subway from the
point of view of what he calls international mongrels: manual
laborers digging the tunnels and homeless people living beneath the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   His forthcoming work opens in a devastating Russian winter
during World War II, as the Red Army retreats towards Moscow. Anne
Enright, who also read on Friday night, recently signed an American
publishing deal for her novel ``What Are You Like?,'' the tale of a
young Irish woman's life as an immigrant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland is like Cuba, said Toibin, 45. The first thing you want
to do on a small island is escape it. To see the world is indeed a
type of intellectual exile. McCann says he now lives in New York
City because of curiosity, not because he cannot find a job in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   It is also becoming apparent that Irish writers today are
generally not drinkers. The writers' pub, the deadly pint and
chaser of their forebears, have been supplanted by homelife and
parenthood. The embrace of such a lifestyle may pose a threat to
what the Dublin poet Paul Durcan, calls ``that will to die,'' which
in the popular imagination still remains essential to the Irish
creative mind.

RIDING A COMPUTER-GENERATED WAVE STRAIGHT TO THE BOX OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This was budgeted earlier as STORM-MOVIE-REVIEW) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _ Like a pilot at his controls, Stefen
Fangmeier sat at the video console in a darkened meeting room at
Industrial Light and Magic, a pioneer in the business of creating
special effects for movies. Arrayed behind him on four rows of
ratty couches and metal chairs were a dozen or so computer
animators and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes appeared one after another on the room's oversize
monitors, some just a few seconds long, others perhaps 30 seconds:
huge ships lumbering through heavy seas, impossible waves washing
across colossal decks, flashes of lightning, roaring torrents of
wind and mist. Watching the same scenes on a satellite video hookup
at the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, the director Wolfgang
Petersen and the cinematographer John Seale saw the parade of
visual-effects images slide soundlessly past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shot, I don't know,'' Petersen said. ``It's a lot of
flashing lightning in a very short time. It's too much. Maybe you
can tone it down or take that second flash out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fangmeier is the visual effects supervisor on Petersen's new
film, ``The Perfect Storm,'' which is to open on June 30. It is the
largest and most ambitious computer-effects project Fangmeier has
undertaken at Industrial Light and Magic, part of George Lucas'
moviemaking empire. With its complex fluid dynamics and
computer-intensive water effects, the film is even more demanding
than ``Jurassic Park,'' with its digital dinosaurs, or ``Twister,''
with its virtual cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated special effects have been at the center of
moviemaking for more than two decades now, especially in the kind
of thunderous blockbusters that tend to dominate the summer. Even
so, this is turning out to be a particularly ambitious and perhaps
pivotal summer for them. Never have so many big summer movies been
so centered on such effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley Scott has said that one of the chief reasons he decided
to direct ``Gladiator'' was that the latest generation of
sophisticated effects made it possible to recreate second-century
Rome in towering and vivid detail. Disney's ``Dinosaur,'' with its
groundbreaking combination of realistic, computer-generated
creatures and live-action backgrounds, is a showcase for
sophisticated effects.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Emmerich's Revolutionary War drama, ``The Patriot,'' can
spread itself across a broad canvas, with flotillas of masted ships
and spectacular armies of thousands, by relying on technology that
can transform a few hundred redcoats into a horizon-choking
multitude. Sony's Digital Human Project, an attempt to push and
dissolve the boundaries of computer animation, was what made it
possible for the director Paul Verhoeven to attempt, in the
forthcoming ``Hollow Man,'' to bring an invisible man to the screen
in a way, beg your pardon, that has never been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using computer effects just for the sake of using them is not
very interesting,'' said Emmerich. ``But where they are very useful
is in helping you to make things very big, or to do things like
make your skies match in shots that were filmed on different days.
We could not have done `The Patriot' the way we did it without the
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of filmmakers, it seems, have gone beyond big
stunts and bigger explosions and have awakened to the newfound
ability of computer-effects specialists to transport audiences to
dazzling places, be it some vanished historical epoch or the
swelling crest of a 100-foot wave.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the meeting room Fangmeier ran the ``Perfect Storm''
scene again, stopping and starting, the digital boat jerking back
and forth in the roiling seas until the image was frozen at last on
the second flash of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean this one?'' Fangmeier asked. Seale, sitting next to
Petersen in Burbank, leaned forward and studied the screen. ``Yes,
yes,'' he said, ``the one where it looks like it has legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Petersen and Seale said, was that the shot did not
look real: it was too bright, too vivid. It would break the
audience's concentration, pull them out of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fangmeier studied the shot. There were no voices of objection
from the technicians and animators in the room behind him. Finally
he nodded. ``Yes, we can take that out if you like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the viewing session Petersen said: ``The computer effects
in `Perfect Storm' were the most important thing in the telling of
this story. Otherwise we never could have done it. We could never
have shown what it was like to be in 100-foot seas, not in a way
that would satisfy audiences in the year 2000. Who can go out and
shoot in 100-foot waves? We all would have been killed. And that
good old device of using water tanks and miniatures? No way.
Audiences just will not buy it in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The enormous success, creative and financial, of ``Titanic'' in
1997 has been the prime generator for this boom in realistic
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Those dozens of people falling off the back of the upended ocean
liner _ some real actors on wires, some digital creations, crashing
and tumbling together in the same shot _ brought a vividness to
visual effects that filmmakers have been expanding and improving
upon ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is, it allows you to create more spectacular
images and more spectacular combinations of things,'' said Andrew
Millstein, who heads Disney's Secret Lab, the studio's in-house
computer animation and effects unit where ``Dinosaur'' was born.
``I think there are some filmmakers, more and more of them, who
fully understand the power of the tools. Our job, in a way, is to
create a new way to view reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of creating the water effects for ``The Perfect
Storm'' began with John Anderson of Industrial Light and Magic, an
expert in fluid dynamics, using new software that effectively
builds a virtual ocean, many miles wide, inside the computer.
Computer-generated ships were later added to the seas and given
various weights and physical characteristics. As the animators
worked with the new software and tried to make the results look
realistic, they quickly realized that water behaved very
differently at different points on the wave and under different
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They created and named more than a dozen different kinds of
water, from crest foam (the white churn at the top of a wave) to
chopper wash (the pebble-in-a-pond circles created by a helicopter
hovering above the water).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these behave very differently,'' said Habib
Zargarpour, assistant visual effects supervisor on the film. ``You
have waves that turn into foaming, blobby chunks, then into sea
foam, then into mist. To me that's the most difficult thing to come
up with, the look of a splash.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the live-action sequences were shot in an enormous water
tank on the Warner Brothers lot. The actors (George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg and others) were atop a re-creation of the Andrea Gail,
the doomed vessel featured in the best-selling book, built on the
true story on which the film is based.
</P>
<P>
   The boat sat on gimbals that could toss, turn and upend it while
several cameras filmed the tumult from fingerlike cranes around the
periphery. Thousands of gallons of water could be spilled from
overhead tanks while wind machines raged and the actors were
blasted across the deck.
</P>
<P>
   A computer in the gimbals, meanwhile, recorded every inch of the
ship's movement and relayed it to the computers at Industrial Light
and Magic. Visual effects technicians there could attempt to match
the real ship's movement to the roster of waves they had in their
virtual ocean. Then they could tweak the effect even more. Does the
wave not look terrifying enough at 60 feet? OK, make it 75.
</P>
<P>
   Then the visual effects shots _ there are about 336 in the film
_ were shown to the director and cinematographer at the daily
satellite conferences known as ``the transmission,'' at which
everyone discussed whether a shot seemed to be working.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his comments Wolfgang will often say things like, oh, this
looks too computer-generated, or it looks like a model, or it
doesn't somehow look real,'' Fangmeier said. ``So we go back and we
fix it. It's my job to figure out how to change it to make it look
real.''
</P>
<P>
   For Petersen, the world of filmmaking has changed so much since
he shot some of the water scenes in his 1981 submarine adventure,
``Das Boot,'' in a water tank with miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress they have made in generating totally believable
environments and people, it's all so vastly improved,'' he said.
``I have no idea how they do it. It's a mystery to me. In this film
some of the shots are of actors on the set, and some are of
computer-generated actors on a computer-generated ship. Sometimes I
look at a shot, and I have to ask them, is this something we shot,
or is this you?''
</P>
<P>
   All of which has spurred him creatively, Petersen said, forcing
him to enlarge his ambitions and rethink his vision for this film
and for films he hopes to make in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feed the computer, it's basically limitless what you
can do nowadays,'' Petersen said. ``You can create worlds. You can
do whatever you want.''

 &HT;    Branch Davidian trial brings heightened sense of security
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Attorney Cheryl Reyna was keenly aware when
government attorneys set up shop in her Waco office building a few
weeks ago. But she really started paying attention when a big
yellow Ryder rental truck pulled up in front of the building Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna and other attorneys in her first-floor law office have
watched in amazement, and sometimes amusement, as government
agents, attorneys and prospective witnesses have scurried in and
out of the office building in recent weeks in preparation for the
Branch Davidian wrongful-death civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government has rented an office on the second floor of the
downtown building for use during the trial, which could last a
month or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of little guys here with earplugs talking
to their wristwatches,'' Reyna said. ``We have said that we are not
going to panic just because these people jump out of their cars and
look over their shoulders. But we said that when we see a yellow
Ryder truck in the parking lot, we are going to get the hell out of
here, and today there was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some irony in the government renting a yellow Ryder
truck, but they were moving all of the documents that they have had
here over to the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck was similar to one used by Timothy McVeigh in the
Oklahoma City bombing on the second anniversary of the April 19,
1993, fire in which David Koresh and 75 of his followers died at
Mount Carmel near Waco, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck caught the attention of quite a few people who were on
their way to lunch downtown, especially since it was surrounded by
a group of uniformed police officers, including some from the
Federal Protective Service.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, despite the arrest of a man for impersonating a
police officer at the federal building around noon, the presence of
six or seven televison satellite trucks and a worse-than-normal
downtown parking problem, the start of the Branch Davidian lawsuit
against the government kicked off rather routinely.
</P>
<P>
   Waco police arrested and handcuffed a man after he presented a
badge while trying to enter the federal building. The man, who
would not identify himself or cooperate with authorities, was
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   While some businesses downtown might have put on some additional
security for the trial, Margaret Mills, executive director of
Downtown Waco Inc., said the trial, the accompanying media circus
and others who might flock to Waco pose no extraordinary problems
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we are certainly sensitive in the downtown area
to the need for special attention to the trial and to those
attending the trial, but we have not had any serious concerns
expressed to us by any of the downtown business owners,'' Mills
said. ``I know that the Waco Police Department has been working on
it diligently and we have been anticipating this for some time. But
frankly, this has been a quieter day than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Gerald Rangel of the Federal Protective Service hopes it
stays that way. Rangel and six of his officers are in Waco to
assist the U.S. Marshal's Service and local agencies with security
around the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Protective Service is the law enforcement division
of the General Services Administration, which basically serves as
landlord over government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we support any high-profile trial, such as today, it
is basically at the request of the U.S. Marshal's Service,'' Rangel
said. ``When they feel they need additional support, our role is to
support the Marshal's Service, but also to maintain the integrity
of the facility. We are basically here as the perimeter force.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Protective Service officers were on hand at the Timothy
McVeigh trial in Denver, at the World Trade Center bombing trial in
New York and at the Branch Davidian and Mexican Mafia criminal
trials in San Antonio in 1994, Rangel said.

COURT UPHOLDS LAW ON PRISON INJUNCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis., Pa., Ind. ) (See also SCOTUS-TRADE, SCOTUS-PRAYER) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a recent law
that suspends certain federal court orders governing conditions in
state and local prisons does not amount to an unconstitutional
interference by Congress into the business of the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision upheld a provision of the Prison Litigation
Reform Act under which judges must either rule on the continuing
validity of an ongoing prison injunction within 90 days _ when its
validity is challenged by the state or anyone else _ or find the
injunction automatically suspended until they do rule.
</P>
<P>
   The challenged provision was one part of a far-reaching law,
passed in 1995, by which Congress sought to curb lawsuits by
prisoners and to cut back on the power of federal courts to keep
state and local prisons under long-term federal supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The law set tough new standards for issuing injunctions
governing ``conditions of confinement'' and authorized any
interested party to go to court and challenge an existing
injunction as not meeting those standards. In order to make sure
that judges would pay prompt attention to such challenges, Congress
included an ``automatic stay'' provision by which the injunction
would be lifted until the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Chicago, ruling on a challenge
brought by inmates in an Indiana prison who opposed the state's
effort to invoke the new law, declared the automatic stay provision
unconstitutional. A legislative determination that a specific court
order had to be set aside violated the separation of powers, the
appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In overturning that ruling Monday, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's
majority opinion rejected the appeals court's characterization of
what the provision accomplished. The automatic stay did not
interfere with a court's final judgment, O'Connor said, because an
ongoing injunction, unlike a decision in an ordinary case,
``remains subject to alteration due to changes in the underlying
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The new standards contained in the Prison Litigation Reform Act
were such a change, she said, requiring an order governing prison
conditions to be ``narrowly drawn,'' to go ``no further than
necessary,'' and to be ``the least intrusive means necessary'' to
correct the violation. Congress specified that the law should apply
retroactively to make any ongoing prison injunction subject to
``immediate termination'' if it cannot meet those standards.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Miller vs. French, No. 99-224, put the Clinton
administration in an uncomfortable position. Although President
Clinton had signed the law, administration lawyers could not avoid
the fact that it raised troubling constitutional questions. In
defending the automatic stay provision before the Supreme Court,
the administration proposed a new reading of the provision. The
automatic stay was not quite what it appeared to be, the solicitor
general's office argued; rather, it did not strip federal judges of
their traditional authority to maintain the status quo in pending
litigation. Judges themselves could grant a stay of the stay, the
government said, and therefore avoid the separation of powers
problem.
</P>
<P>
   While the state of Indiana, which also appealed the ruling by
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was nominally on the same
side as the administration, the two briefs diverged dramatically.
The state, asking the court to uphold the law as written, said the
administration's statutory interpretation flew in the face of
Congress' clear intent to make the stay automatic.
</P>
<P>
   In her majority opinion Monday, O'Connor agreed with the state
and rejected the administration's view that the law could be read
to leave federal judges with any flexibility. ``Any attempt to
enjoin the stay is irreconcilable with the plain language of the
statute,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the nine justices agreed with the statutory
interpretation. In addition to the five in the majority _ Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony
M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, along with O'Connor _ Justices
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that the law could
not be read to permit any flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   But there the two groups of justices parted company. In a
dissenting opinion, Souter and Ginsburg said that while the law did
not raise a separation of powers problem, the deadline it imposed
for judicial action was so short as to raise a question of whether
the law violated the constitutional right to due process. They said
the case should be sent back to the lower courts with instructions
to consider the due process implications.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion also noted that the law ``may implicate due
process concerns'' but said that this issue was not part of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The only two members of the court to accept the administration's
interpretation of the statute were Justices Stephen G. Breyer and
John Paul Stevens, who said there was support in the statute for a
more flexible interpretation that would avoid serious
constitutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   With eight cases now remaining until the justices conclude their
term, there were also these other developments Monday.
 &UR;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; HMO Case
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court summarily vacated and sent back to
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania a case in which the state court
allowed a medical negligence case to proceed against a health
maintenance organization for refusing to authorize a member's
admission to the nearest hospital, which was not a participant in
the medical plan.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the case, United States Healthcare Systems vs.
Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co., No. 98-1836, is whether a suit
of this type can be heard in state court or whether, as the HMO is
arguing, it is pre-empted by a federal law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the
federal law, known as Erisa, does not provide a basis for suing an
HMO for giving doctors a financial incentive to ration health care.
But last week's decision left open a number of questions about the
pre-emptive effect of Erisa in cases involving not medical
treatment as such but benefits eligibility and the general
administration of a health plan. By its action Monday, the court
indicated that it wants these issues to be further developed in the
lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy Judgment
</P>
<P>
   The justices agreed to decide whether, when free speech
interests are at stake, the Constitution requires a prompt judicial
determination of a challenge to a state or local licensing law. The
case is an appeal by the owner of an adult bookstore in Waukesha,
Wis., which refused to renew the store's operating license in a
proceeding that lasted for many months.
</P>
<P>
   While the Supreme Court has required ``prompt judicial review''
in similar cases, it is unclear whether that means simply prompt
access to court, or a prompt decision, or at least a provision to
preserve the status quo during a lengthy process. The case, City
News and Novelty vs. City of Waukesha, No. 99-1680, is an appeal
from the Wisconsin Court of Appeals.

BUSH BENEFITS HANDSOMELY FROM VISIT TO SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush used part of a western
campaign swing on Monday to discuss what modern technology could do
for public education. But there was also a lesson in what that
technology _ or at least its wealthy purveyors _ could do for Bush
and fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner on Monday night held at the home of John T.
Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, Bush collected what
campaign officials estimated to be more than $3.5 million from
Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs. Much of it was ``soft money'' _
largely unregulated donations _ and all of it was to be divided
between the Republican party in California and the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't relish these big fund-raising events,'' Bush said
beforehand, as his campaign plane flew west from Austin, Texas. But
he was set to grin and bear several of them during a campaign week
expected to be among his most lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's schedule included a dinner in Los Angeles on Tuesday,
expected to raise another $2 million for the state and national
parties, and a gathering in Houston on Wednesday night expected to
raise at least $4 million for the Republican National Committee,
according to Bush's aides. Factoring in a few smaller events, the
week's haul would likely exceed $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's other purposes as he traveled Monday to Vancouver,
Wash., and then on to Palo Alto was to promote a few new education
proposals that he said were intended to help make sure that
technology brought into public school classrooms was truly helping
students learn. He was also spending time in two states he would
like to make more competitive in the general election than
political analysts had predicted he could.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an elementary school in Vancouver at midday, Bush
said the Clinton administration's efforts to wire classrooms to the
Internet _ it is spending about $3 billion annually on the project
_ had given local school districts too little flexibility in their
use of these federal funds, creating a system ``hidebound by
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for loosening those regulations and for spending
another $80 million a year in federal funds so that the Department
of Education could study the best ways of using technology in
classrooms and set up a clearinghouse to make the information
available to states and local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal ought not to be how many classrooms are wired,'' Bush
said. ``The goal is how are we effectively teaching children. My
whole presidency will challenge process and focus on results.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore,
said that in addition to the $3 billion, there was roughly another
$500 million now in the federal budget over which states and local
districts had ample discretion and could be used to provide teacher
training, software purchases and other activities to take advantage
of schools' connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very successful,'' Hattaway said. He added that
Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has set a
goal for his administration to assure that every student in America
was computer-literate by the eighth grade.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two art institutions with visions of expansion but
strikingly different economic positions _ the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia _
have reached an agreement to share their collections, organize
joint exhibitions and help each other develop a worldwide network
of museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim, with museums in New York and three European
cities, has long had an interest in sharing the Hermitage's
world-class collection of old master, Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist works, antiquities and decorative arts. The
Hermitage, with severe budgetary problems, has envied the
Guggenheim's financial resources and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, whose vision
has been severely hampered by the lack of funds, described the
collaboration as ``One plus one makes three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two brands and can cooperate in different kinds of
activities in different parts of the world,'' he said in a
telephone interview Monday from St. Petersburg. ``This is not just
about fund-raising and development. It's about creating the model
for museums of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Piotrovsky nor Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim,
would discuss what kinds of financial commitments were part of the
agreement, if any. But if they accomplish most of what they say
they intend to, this would probably be the most extensive
collaboration between two world-class museums.
</P>
<P>
   The largest cooperative agreement reached recently by art
institutions was between the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and
the Tate Gallery in London, which have formed a partnership to
create an Internet business for art, culture and design. The
Hermitage has also collaborated in a limited way with the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, the Guggenheim is to become a partner in the
$100 million development of the east wing of the
400,000-square-foot former General Staff Building, built in the
19th century on Palace Square, facing the Winter Palace of the
Hermitage. The Russian government, which owns the building, has
agreed to transfer it to the Hermitage. For two years the museum
has been accepting proposals from developers for turning the
building and its surrounding courtyards into a cultural compound.
</P>
<P>
   Krens said he had appointed a group of three architects whom he
declined to name to put together a proposal to use 400 of the
building's 610 rooms for cultural purposes, including art and
technology galleries and film-viewing rooms. The rest of the site
would be used for shops and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The project would house galleries for major portions of the
Hermitage's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist
paintings, along with its collections of sculpture, costumes, arms
and armor, jewelry and decorative arts. It would also include
postwar modern and contemporary art, multimedia installations and
photography from the Guggenheim's collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim said it was ready to help in the planning and
design of its gallery spaces as well as with exhibition programming
that would focus on modern and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Hermitage would have a presence at a proposed
additional Guggenheim museum in Manhattan. A suite of galleries
devoted to works from the Hermitage would become part of the plan
for a new Guggenheim museum to be designed by the Los Angeles
architect Frank O. Gehry for three piers at Wall Street on the East
River. The plan is one of several by various sponsors for the
city-owned site, with a selection expected sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration is also to include exchanges between the
Hermitage and the Guggenheim's existing museums: its Fifth Avenue
headquarters designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and its sister museums
in Bilbao, Spain; Venice; and Berlin. The agreement will also open
the way for the Guggenheim to assist the Hermitage on various
international projects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its two million square feet of exhibition space
in St. Petersburg, the Hermitage will open a suite of eight rooms
later this year in London at Somerset House, a late 18th-century
mansion, where it plans to mount rotating exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage also plans to transform a home for the elderly in
Amsterdam into a satellite museum in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to be issued Tuesday, the two museums say they
also plan to collaborate on developing and building other museums
around the world. After the success of the Guggenheim Bilbao in the
Basque region, which opened in 1997 and has had a million visitors
a year, it has been approached by various cities with requests to
study possible new museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've both been approached by many, many, many cities around
the world,'' said Krens. ``By joining together and approaching
these projects as a joint venture, we can mobilize quality and
content.''
</P>
<P>
   The two institutions may well be a good fit. The Hermitage
collections stop at the beginning of the 20th century. The
Guggenheim's range from the late 19th century to the present, with
strong representation of postwar and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim has a history of organizing exhibitions of
Russian art, including ``The Great Utopia: The Russian and Soviet
Avant-Garde, 1915-1932,'' in 1992, and ``Amazons of the
Avant-Garde: Aleksandra Exter, Natalya Gonscharova, Liubov Popova,
Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova,'' which
opened at the Guggenheim in Berlin last year, then traveled to the
Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice and is currently on view in
Bilbao. It is to open at the Guggenheim in Manhattan in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been involved with Russia for 12 years,'' said Krens.
``And have built trust and confidence over the years.''

HARCOURT GENERAL EXPLORES WAYS TO BOOST STOCK PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harcourt General Inc., the company that got its start
showing silent movies in Boston and now sells knowledge over the
Internet, Monday began what could be its closing chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring the New York investment bank of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the
publishing company said it considers itself undervalued on Wall
Street and wants ``to explore a range of strategic alternatives to
enhance shareholder value, including the possible sale of the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded by bidding Harcourt General shares up
$12.7812 to a 52-week closing high of $54.8125, a 30 percent gain
that pushed the family-run company's total market to more than $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that illustrates the point,'' Harcourt spokesman Peter
Farwell said. ``The press release did quite a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point the sale of the entire company is a likely
outcome,'' Farwell said, adding that the company had examined a
variety of other options.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General's holdings include textbook publishers, medical
journals, online advisory services for doctors, and a list of
fabled works of literature _ a package analysts said might be
attractive to Bertelsmann AG, Pearson PLC, or Reed Elsevier, the
European publishing giants that in recent years have taken over
many of the best-known US names in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Managed by the Smith family since its founding as a movie
theater chain in 1922, the company posted $184 million in earnings
last year on $2.14 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But, like hundreds of other companies Wall Street views as
low-tech tortoises, Harcourt General has attracted little investor
interest recently. Not even a decade of acquisitions, the sale of
its theaters, and the 1999 spinoff of a controlling interest in
Neiman Marcus Group could change that.
</P>
<P>
   As the Newton company's 75-year-old chairman, Richard A. Smith,
put it in the announcement: ``Harcourt General's value in the
public market does not presently reflect the quality of its
businesses, record results, and bright prospects of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General was silent about how proceeds distributed if a
sale occurs, but the Smith family holds 28 percent of the shares
and would be big winners.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, who took over the company from his father,
Philip, in 1961, handed control over last year to his son, Robert,
and son-in-law, Brian Knez _ who share the titles of president and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts saw the move to sell Harcourt General as a sign of
the new chief officers' frustration with investor fickleness toward
established, low-technology, ``value'' companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management may have been getting frustrated that the
market wasn't giving the company the measure of appreciation they
felt it deserved, so they decided to speed things up,'' Peter P.
Appert, a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown analyst, said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, saw the move as an acceptance of a trend that
in recent years put US book publishers, such as Random House and
Simon &AMP; Schuster, in the hands of European conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media companies have all really moved away,'' said Darice
Grippo, a vice president with John Hancock Advisors, ``and the
education-related companies in the United States are all more and
more Internet-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the education world these days vs. the corporate strategy
of building global communications businesses,'' Robert E. Baensch,
director of the Center for Publishing at New York University, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths, while aggressive in building Harcourt General's
holdings _ the company paid $854 million in 1997 for National
Educational Corp. and has invested heavily in Internet technology _
didn't get into publishing until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the company, then still known as General Cinema
Corp., invested proceeds from the 1989 sale of its Pepsi-Cola
bottling interests in Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the New York-based
publisher whose author list includes Antoine Saint-Exupery, T.S.
Eliot, Sinclair Lewis, and Gunter Grass.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Seagram empire rose over three generations, rising on liquor
and blood and toil from the harsh plains of western Canada to the
skyscrapers of New York and the lush boulevards of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Seagram expected to announce an agreement to sell
itself to Vivendi, an upstart French media company hardly known
outside Europe, the story of one of the world's largest
family-controlled companies is about to come to an end. For the
Bronfmans, the Canadian clan that rode from the Prohibition era
into dazzling wealth and power, this is a bittersweet day.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Edgar Bronfman Jr., third-generation heir to the
Seagram throne, has tried to transform Seagram from a stodgy liquor
company into a media powerhouse. Along the way, he sold Seagram's
stake in Du Pont, bought the Universal movie studio, and made
Seagram the world's biggest music company.
</P>
<P>
   But Bronfman could never outrun his detractors, who jeered him
as an intellectual lightweight whose judgment was clouded by the
star-studded atmosphere of Hollywood and the record business. And
it was never clear whether Bronfman had the full support of his
uncle Charles, the co-chairman of Seagram along with Edgar Sr.,
Bronfman's father.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, soon after Seagram's stock rallied to what was then
an all-time high, Charles Bronfman sold more than $400 million of
Seagram shares. Charles attributed the sale to estate planning, but
it was hardly a sign of confidence in Seagram's long-term future.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors are equally skeptical of Bronfman's abilities.
Since he took over Seagram in June 1994, the company's shares have
roughly doubled. Over the same period, Time Warner shares have
quadrupled, and the S&AMP;P Entertainment industry index, which
measures the performance of several big media stocks, has more than
tripled. Seagram was lagging even further behind until this month,
when its shares ran up on rumors of the Vivendi deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, he's done a pretty lousy job as CEO,'' said one
institutional investor whose company owns several hundred thousand
Seagram shares. Over the period that Bronfman has run Seagram,
``News Corp., Viacom, Disney, they've all done better,'' said the
investor, who said he could not be quoted by name because his
company is currently trading Seagram shares.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Seagram has been outpaced by other media
companies, its shares have actually outperformed Du Pont since
Seagram sold its 328 million share stake in the chemical company in
spring 1995. Since then, Du Pont shares have risen barely 50
percent, less than half Seagram's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all his efforts to preserve the family fortune,
Bronfman seemed to be slipping behind as the rest of the media
industry consolidated. September's combination of CBS and Viacom,
followed by January's titanic takeover of Time Warner by America
Online, created a new scale for media companies that Seagram could
not match. Seagram has no major United States broadcast television
network, no first-rank cable network, no cable systems. Its movie
studio has struggled for years, despite occasional hits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the music business is in the midst of a fundamental
change driven by the Internet, which has caused music piracy to
explode. In the long run, it is not clear whether the Internet will
help Seagram and other established music companies by cutting their
distribution costs or hurt them by increasing piracy. And until
that question is answered, music, which is Seagram's strongest
asset, will remain hobbled.
</P>
<P>
   So with Seagram's stock price stagnating and nagging questions
about Bronfman's abilities, the company turned to Vivendi and the
welcoming arms of Jean-Marie Messier. Like Bronfman, Messier hopes
to recast his company for a new century, turning it from a utility
and water company into a communications and media giant. Messier
sees a perfect fit between Seagram's music business and Vivendi's
cell phones, a marriage of content and distribution that some
analysts agree could give the new company the heft to compete with
Viacom and the combined AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman may have simply been too far ahead of his time. With
spending on media and entertainment increasing worldwide, his
effort to remake Seagram could well be vindicated in years to come,
said Mario Gabelli, whose funds own three million Seagram shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertical integration is a necessity,'' said Gabelli. ``It's a
terrific deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have agreed, so far. Over the last week, as word of
the deal seeped out, Seagram stock has risen from $50.625 to $64, a
28 percent gain. For the Bronfmans, who own more than 106 million
shares of Seagram stock, the run-up has increased their wealth by
$1.4 billion and taken some of the sting out of Seagram's
underperformance over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of the Bronfman family stake in Seagram tops
$6.7 billion. The Bronfman stock is held in a complex web of
trusts; so unraveling how many shares are held by each individual
family member is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the merits of the merger _ and it will take years
before investors find out how strong the proposed new company
really is _ it is certain that Bronfman will no longer be in the
driver's seat. Messier will run the new company, with Bronfman as
vice chairman with his actual duties still to be defined.
</P>
<P>
   That is a condition Bronfman's grandfather, the legendary Samuel
Bronfman, would never have accepted, said David Paperny, director
of a documentary on the Bronfman family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam went to great lengths to make sure the company would
remain in family hands,'' Paperny said. ``This included kicking
several of his brothers out of the family business so it would be
cleanly passed down to his own two sons, Edgar and Charles. Sam
would definitely regret seeing the family lose control.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marrus, dean of the University of Toronto graduate
school and author of a biography of Samuel Bronfman, said ``Sam,''
as he was known before his death in 1971, ``was someone for whom
family mattered hugely.'' Samuel Bronfman would have been
especially torn by the news that Vivendi plans to sell Seagram's
liquor division after the merger, Marrus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that for Sam, whiskey is not something he made in
order to make money,'' Marrus said. ``He really cared about
whiskey, by which I mean he was to blended whiskey what Isaac Stern
is to the violin. He really cared.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he hoped to keep his company independent, Samuel Bronfman
made at least one miscalculation. At a family gathering in the
1960s, ``Sam jabbed his finger at Edgar Jr.,'' Paperny recalled,
``and said: `You're the one. You're the one to lead my company into
the future.'''

 &HT;    Both sides score pretrial wins in Waco wrongful death trial
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Both sides won pretrial victories Monday, and U.S.
District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco made quick work of
picking an advisory jury for the wrongful-death lawsuit filed by
surviving Branch Davidians against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Opening statements in the case are scheduled for 9 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, chosen in less than two hours, is made up of four
women and three men. At least two jurors are from Waco and all live
in the 13-county Western District of Texas. Their jobs range from a
physical education teacher at an elementary school to an aircraft
electrician. Their job now is to issue a nonbinding verdict that
Smith will weigh in reaching his own decision on whether the
government helped cause the death of 81 Branch Davidians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Smith chose the jury from a pool of 60 candidates. During
questioning, he asked if anyone had ever lost a child and if any of
them had ever been in a dispute with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the plaintiffs' legal team literally gave each other
a thumbs-up after the jury was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the jury will be fair,'' said Houston attorney Mike
Caddell, lead plaintiffs attorney. ``The voir dire was fair. The
judge conducted things in an appropriate manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark and Houston attorney
James Brannon are also representing plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith through word and deed got his point across to attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has made it clear that he wants ... (the trial) to
go quickly,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford, co-counsel for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Both the government and the plaintiffs squared off early Monday
over the admittance of key evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The government kept the autopsy photographs of Davidians from
being admitted into evidence and limited the discussion of Ruby
Ridge, the shootout in Idaho involving many of the same FBI
personnel at Mount Carmel that resulted in the deaths of three
people, including the wife and son of Randy Weaver. Discussion of
Ruby Ridge will be restricted to its influence in the decision by
some Davidians not to leave Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, however, said he will ask Smith today to bar mention
of Ruby Ridge entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to revisit it,'' Bradford said. ``It's irrelevant
to this case. What is at issue is what happened here, not what
happened at Ruby Ridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, who was assisted by his wife, attorney Cynthia Chapman,
won permission to admit preliminary drafts of the FBI's plan to
force the Davidians out of Mount Carmel. A tear-gas assault on
April 19, 1993, ended in a fire of disputed origin that led to the
deaths of David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys argued the FBI's plans should be excluded
under the discretionary function exception, which protects
government officials from being sued for their elective decisions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Caddell successfully argued that the FBI's preliminary
plans showed that initially using tanks to tear down Mount Carmel
had been discarded by the time the final plan was written. The
final plan called for dismantling the building only if the
Davidians had not surrendered after 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big,'' Caddell said later. ``If you look at these
previous plans, they show a steady progression toward less and less
aggression. The (final) plan to insert tear gas only authorized the
penetration of the building by the booms on the tanks. For anyone
to say they had the authority to drive tanks into the building, I
think the jury is going to decide pretty quickly that wasn't in the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil trial will deal with four issues: whether agents with
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms used excessive force in
the Feb. 28, 1993, raid on Mount Carmel; whether using tanks to
drive through the compound deviated from the plan approved by U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno; whether FBI agents helped cause the
fires; and whether the government was negligent by withholding
firefighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith last week removed what could have been the most
contentious issue of the lawsuit _ whether government agents shot
at Davidians during the final hours of the siege. He said the issue
would not be addressed because a court-appointed expert was unable
to attend the trial due to illness. The issue will be decided
later, probably by summary judgment.
</P>
<P>
   One final pretrial matter will likely be settled today before
the opening statements. The plaintiffs want to admit videotaped
testimony from FBI negotiators at Mount Carmel as well as a March
7, 1993, memorandum from negotiator Peter Smerick to Jeffrey Jamar,
the lead FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Smerick) stated, `If we physically attack the compound and
children are killed, even if they are killed by Branch Davidians,
we in the FBI will be placed in a difficult position,''' Caddell
told Smith. ``... It goes directly to the issue of was this a
foreseeable outcome of the decisions made by Mr. Jamar and Mr.
Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rogers headed the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team at Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Government co-counsel Marie Hagen accused the plaintiffs of
``trying to get in through the back door what they can't get in
through the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Second-guessing shouldn't be brought into this case on whether
the tactical guys took a different approach,'' Hagen said.

MARKET PLACE: VIVENDI-SEAGRAM MERGER MEANS CHANGES IN GLOBAL
SPIRITS INDUSTRY

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brands like Chivas Regal, Martell cognac and Captain Morgan rum
will be on the block if Vivendi, Canal Plus and Seagram do in fact
agree to merge. But which distilled-spirits company is likely to
wind up as their new owner?
</P>
<P>
   Many industry experts say Allied Domecq would be the probable
winner. Allied is the second-largest company in the highly
fragmented world of spirits, behind Diageo of Britain, which, after
it was formed by the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in
1998, became the industry leader with about 9 percent of the global
market. The next handful of companies have shares less than half
that size, with even smaller stakes held by others.
</P>
<P>
   The Seagram brands are expected to bring more than $7 billion,
roughly equal to Allied Domecq's sales last year. The sale of the
brands has been proposed by Vivendi management to rid the new deal
of $6.6 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   For Allied, which now owns brands like Beefeater gin and
Ballantine's Scotch, taking on the new brands would not be
impossible, particularly if the deal mixes stock and debt. That, at
least is what a group of Salomon Smith Barney analysts wrote in a
note to investors last week. Doing so might strengthen the
management pool for the two companies, they added. ``Seagram's U.S.
management is very strong,'' they wrote, ``and Allied's management
in Europe is by far superior.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts estimated that the Seagram brands were worth about
10.5 times their earnings before taxes, which are expected to total
$723 million when the fiscal year ends this month. That works out
to $7.6 billion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company led by Warren
Buffett, bought more than 33 million Allied shares this spring, or
3 percent of the company _ an investment that caused a flurry at
Allied, sending its share price up briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo could also buy the brands, and would not run into
significant antitrust hurdles except in the United States and
Canada. Such issues, experts say, could be sidestepped by disposing
of whiskey, gin and Scotch brands now sold in those markets.
</P>
<P>
   A third possibility is for the Bronfman family to hold on to the
division. With about 23 percent of Seagram shares in the family's
hands, the sale of the company would leave them with $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the current Seagram CEO, Edgar Bronfman, has been driven
by the media business in recent years, this strategy has arguably
failed, and the older family members of Seagram's management might
well wish to retrench to the original spirits activity,'' the
Salomon Smith Barney analysts wrote in their note to investors.
``Certainly these older family members see more value in drink than
Edgar appears to see.''
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the family said such a move was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Also for sale is about 30 percent of Vivendi's water business,
run by its Generale des Eaux division. ``The opportunity for water,
globally, is pretty strong,'' noted Michael Bellas, chief executive
of Beverage Marketing, a database and consulting company in New
York. Last March, Vivendi paid a hefty $6.2 billion for U.S.
Filter, a California supplier of industrial water-purification
equipment that also has a small consumer bottled-water unit. At the
time of that deal, Vivendi was the biggest player in the
fast-growing $300 billion water treatment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The spirits business has helped support other Seagram divisions
for years, several industry experts said Monday. In the recent
past, brands that did not perform well were scrapped so the company
could focus almost exclusively on high-priced, ``superpremium''
products, and the appeal of these brands to young adults has
improved in the last year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a little bit of a resurgence'' in drinks sold in
bars and restaurants, Bellas said. ``They were up about 1 percent,
after being down all through the 1980s and 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   If the brands are sold to one of Seagram's competitors, that
could shake up the long-slumbering spirits industry, one of the
more fragmented industries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the soft-drink industry _ in which Coca-Cola holds a
commanding 51 percent worldwide share and Pepsi has 21 percent,
according to Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter _ the spirits
business has not had any kind of transforming consolidation of
brands or distributors. Many predicted a wave of consolidation
after the formation of Diageo, but for various reasons no such
trend emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, companies like Seagram and Allied Domecq control much
of their distribution. In the United States, regulations forbid
companies that own liquor brands to own their distributors as well.
Along with the brands it owns outright, Seagram controls worldwide
distribution rights for Absolut vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that are expected to take a look at the Seagram
brands include Bacardi-Martini, the privately held owner of Bacardi
rum, Dewar's Scotch and Martini &AMP; Rossi vermouth. While Bacardi has
made acquisitions in the recent past, buying Bombay gin from Diageo
after the merger with Grand Met, the company took a sphinx-like
stand Monday when asked if it was interested in the Seagram
properties. ``We are always looking for opportunities to enhance
our portfolio,'' a company spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Additional contenders could include Brown-Forman, the American
maker of Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort, as well as Pernod
Ricard SA, the French owner of the Ricard pastis brand. Pernod
Ricard tried to sell its Orangina soft-drink brand to Coca-Cola in
1997 to concentrate on spirits. But the deal was rejected last year
by French regulators, who said it would give Coca-Cola too much of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Pernod, which is only a $3.5 billion company, nor
Brown-Forman, with sales of about $2 billion, could swing the
Seagram acquisition on its own. But like so many other industries,
from computers to grocery stores, the spirits business has started
to see strength in scale _ the bigger the better.

JERSEY GIRL MAKES IT BIG AT LEAST ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It's 8 a.m., and Diane Ruggiero is seated in a
super-trendy patio restaurant in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard.
Despite the early hour, most of the handful of diners are wearing
dark glasses, dressed in black and keeping their cell phones handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are these people?'' whispered Ruggiero, a 29-year-old
writer who just flew in from New Jersey. ``When I checked in I
said: `Give me a break! These people wouldn't last 15 minutes in
New Jersey. I mean, I don't know these people.''
</P>
<P>
   She will quite soon.
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggling as a writer and working as a waitress
and bartender in and around the working- and middle-class North
Jersey towns North Arlington and East Rutherford, Ruggiero
(ROUGE-ear-oh) has been plucked from obscurity to write and help
produce a new autobiographical television comedy series, ``That's
Life,'' on CBS. The show, about a 30-something New Jersey waitress
who turns her life and her family's life upside down when she
decides to return to college, will make its debut in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Ruggiero, who is candid, funny and
self-deprecating, is temporarily moving from her big $600-a-month
apartment in North Arlington (``If I had the same apartment in
Manhattan I'd have to, like, hire call girls to work for me so I
could afford it'') to Los Angeles. Visibly reluctant to move here,
Ruggiero acknowledged that her career and life were changing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   A film script she wrote, ``Pretty the Beast,'' is to be produced
by Nora Ephron. Her new television series, in which she is also a
supervising producer, is starting production. Ruggiero has ideas
for several other projects that are based, more or less, on growing
up in a large, tightly knit Italian family.
</P>
<P>
   In the series, for example, the family keeps photos of the pope
and Frank Sinatra in their home. ``I grew up thinking that Frank
Sinatra was actually a younger version of the pope,'' she said.
``When I made my communion we were talking about the pope and I
said, `My father has all his records,' and the nun was, like,
`What?' I actually grew up thinking that the pope sang `Summer
Wind.''' In a quasi-serious moment, Ruggerio said that moving to
Los Angeles, at least at the moment, filled her with dread. ``I'm
an Italian girl from northern New Jersey,'' she said. ``The sun is
kind of overbearing here. And the people! I was at the hotel bar
last night and I saw like five girls who wore little dresses and
had 10-foot-long legs. I don't like being the fattest person in
this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiero, who is not fat, has tried to write movies, plays and
stories since she was a child. She grew up in Old Bridge, N.J.,
where her father, Joseph, was a maintenance worker on the New
Jersey Turnpike for 30 years. (In the series, Paul Sorvino plays
the father of the young woman and works as a toll collector.) Her
mother, Carol, is British. ``When her relatives come over we have
peppers and eggs and tea and biscuits,'' Ruggiero said. ``My
mother's kind of a white-bread Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Ruggiero kept writing and
worked as a waitress and bartender. She took courses for about 10
years at several colleges, mostly at Montclair State University.
(In the series, the college is called Montville.) Ruggiero said she
would drop courses to earn money to pay for unexpected car
insurance bills or a root canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point I was waitressing 80 hours a week and taking only
photography and astronomy,'' Ruggiero said. She also worked as an
Easter Bunny in a mall, made fruit baskets and was an assistant to
a publicity agent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She still hangs out in East Rutherford with friends at a
restaurant where she once worked called Park and Orchard. While she
was a waitress there, a patron, Mark St. Germain, who lived nearby,
would come by with his young daughter. He asked Ruggerio what she
really wanted to do. ``I told him I was a writer, and he said that
he was a writer,'' she said. St. Germain, who has written some Off
Broadway plays (``Moby Dick,'' ``Jack's Holiday'') as well as
scripts for ``The Cosby Show,'' asked Ruggerio if he could read
some of her work.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiero gave him 10 pages of her comedy screenplay ``Pretty the
Beast,'' about a suicidal writer who can't kill herself because she
has writer's block and can't write the note. St. Germain told her
she had talent and put her on a weekly writing regimen to complete
the screenplay. After she finished it, he gave the screenplay to
his agents at International Creative Management. Soon enough
Ruggiero had an agent there as well as a mentor in St. Germain.
(St. Germain is now writing some scripts for ``That's Life.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ephron, who optioned the screenplay, said, ``From the first page
it was absolutely clear that Diane was an extremely funny writer
with an absolutely clear voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiero was selected to write ``That's Life'' in an unusual
way. A CBS executive, Ghen Maynard, had proposed a series that
would be a twist on the premise of the hit show ``Felicity'':
instead of a young woman attending college an older woman would
decide to return to school.
</P>
<P>
   Talent agents sent more than 100 scripts to CBS, which was
seeking a writer for the show. Ruggiero's film script stirred the
attention of CBS; she said she would write the pilot if she could
turn the heroine into an Italian-American waitress from New Jersey
who decided to go to college _ just like herself. The script for
the pilot was welcomed by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Addison, a producer of the show and a former CBS executive
who helped select Ruggiero from among more than 100 writers, said:
``This was dialogue we hadn't quite heard before. We didn't feel
like it was retreaded from other television shows. It was written
out of life's experiences, wonderfully irreverent.''
</P>
<P>
   The show stars Heather Paige Kent, a stand-up comedian and
actress born in the Bronx, as Lydia, a surrogate for Ruggiero.
Ellen Burstyn and Sorvino play her parents; Debi Mazar plays a
smart-mouth hairstylist friend, and Peter Firth is an arrogant and
sad professor. The characters are more or less based on real people
or composites.
</P>
<P>
   The series is to be broadcast on Saturdays from 8 to 9 p.m., the
time slot held for five years by ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,''
which drew a strong, predominantly female audience.
</P>
<P>
   Like the clan in the show, Ruggiero's family was not so much
against her attending college as puzzled by her not wanting to
settle down, marry and have children. But for all the similarities,
she said, she had her antennae out for stereotypes that would be
demeaning to Italian-Americans or her home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one big problem with a house we were using,'' she said.
``It was a bit unkempt out front. And I said, `You know, these
people take care of their houses.' My father is like Edward
Scissorhands with the shrubbery. He has great pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this show to be a joke where people have names
like Luigi and Cheech and it's all stereotypical and cheesy. I
mean, I grew up in this area that's thick with Italian culture and
I love it. And the same with New Jersey. In this hotel I was
talking to this woman from Germany and she began making fun of New
Jersey. And I said: `You're from Germany! How do you make fun of
New Jersey?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Have you ever been to New Jersey? You don't know
anything. Thomas Edison's from New Jersey. How bad could it be?'''

COURT WON'T HEAR CASE ON EVOLUTION DISCLAIMER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LETITIA STEIN 
c 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday refused to consider a
case from a school board in Louisiana that wanted students to hear
a disclaimer before studying evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Three justices dissented the court's decision to let stand a
ruling that declared unconstitutional a disclaimer informing
students that lessons on evolution are ``not intended to influence
or dissuade the Biblical version of Creation or any other
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal to hear the case sets no national precedent
on the practice of teaching evolution in schools. Still, the denial
means the ruling of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is
legally binding in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, states within
the appellate court's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In their rulings, the lower courts found that the disclaimer's
stated purpose _ to encourage students to think critically about
the origin of life _ was a sham, and it had the effect of
protecting a particular religious viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But without the disclaimer, the Louisiana school board argued,
students are being subjected to an ``orthodoxy of opinion,'' a
claim the 5th Circuit considered legitimate, while other aspects of
the disclaimer failed constitutional tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who do not adhere to the view of evolution as the origin
of man are somehow second-class citizens in the school community,''
school board attorney Barry Ashe said after the court refused to
hear the case. ``Their view is not even acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court was just one vote shy of taking up the case.
Four of nine Supreme Court justices must choose to hear an appeal
in order for the high court to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   The court offered no explanation for its decision to pass on the
case. But Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissent, joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas, criticizing
the court for not considering the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by in silence while a deeply divided Fifth Circuit
bars a school district from even suggesting to students that other
theories besides evolution _ including, but not limited to, the
Biblical theory of creation _ are worthy of their consideration,''
Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education passed a
resolution requiring a disclaimer to be read at the beginning of
any lesson on evolution in elementary and high school classes. The
disclaimer stated that ``it is the basic right and privilege of
each student to form his/her opinion or maintain beliefs taught by
parents on this very important matter of the origin of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Students were urged to ``exercise critical thinking'' and
``closely examine each alternative'' in forming an opinion on the
origin of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   In response, three parents of students in the school system
challenged the school board resolution in court. The parents argued
the resolution, which offers Biblical creationism as the only named
alternative to evolution, violated a constitutional separation
between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The parents won their case in a federal district court and in
the 5th Circuit, as both courts struck down the disclaimer on the
grounds that it abridged a First Amendment clause prohibiting
government involvement in religion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dissent of the three justices, the majority of the
court has rejected attempts to allow religion in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ In another case, the Supreme Court also declined to hear
Houston, Texas, vs. Kolb, John E. et al.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Houston petitioned the Supreme Court to review a
dispute between the city and a group of developers in Harris
County. John E. Kolb and others filed suit in 1994 to challenge a
city ordinance that would have required them to dedicate a
right-of-way for the Grand Parkway before they could plat their
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a jury awarded the developers more than $2 million in
damages. That amount that now exceeds $3 million with interest,
according to attorney W. Allyn Hoaglund.

REJECTED VOTING RULES AND CHARGES AGAINST HOFFA ALLY SET BACK
TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, has suffered two recent
little-noticed setbacks that are likely to make it harder to
achieve his goal of ending federal supervision of the union.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, a federal judge, using extraordinarily harsh
language, rejected the rules that the union and the Justice
Department have developed to run next year's Teamsters election.
</P>
<P>
   In the other setback, a federal oversight board filed charges
this month that could lead to the expulsion of Lawrence Brennan, a
mentor to Hoffa who played a major role in his ascent to the
union's presidency, as the head of the Teamsters in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The two developments come at a time when Hoffa has vowed to
improve the image of a union that was long known for corruption.
And they come as Hoffa, who took the union's helm 16 months ago,
has made a concerted effort to persuade the Justice Department to
end its intensive and invasive decade-long supervision of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bit of a pipe dream that federal supervision will
end any time soon, but these developments will certainly make it
harder,'' said Michael Belzer, a trucking industry expert at the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Judge David N. Edelstein of Federal District Court
in Manhattan issued a decision denouncing the rules that the union
and government had proposed for next year's Teamsters' election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The submissions are a farrago of ill advice and misguided,
inept, controversial and confused argots,'' he wrote. ``Their
program has the potential of bringing grief, strife, controversy
and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   But union and government officials professed some bewilderment
at the decision of Edelstein, who oversees the federal supervision
of the union, because he never spelled out what specifically he
objected to.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially more damaging to Hoffa were charges that the
oversight board, the Independent Review Board, brought against
Brennan. The board charged him with masterminding a scheme in which
the executive board of a local in Detroit doubled the board
members' traditional Christmas bonus. Then the board members
contributed the additional bonus to Brennan's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight board maintained that the doubled bonus was a
pretext to siphon about $30,000 in members' dues money to finance
Brennan's re-election. The board charged Brennan with embezzlement
and violation of his fiduciary duties.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hoffa was elected Teamsters president in December 1998,
he was Brennan's administrative assistant. Brennan is president of
Teamsters Local 337 in Detroit and of Teamsters Joint Council 43,
which oversees all of Michigan's locals.
</P>
<P>
   When federal officials ruled a decade ago that Hoffa could not
run for the union's presidency in 1991 because he had not worked as
a teamster, Brennan helped Hoffa meet that qualification by hiring
him as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight board has forwarded its charges to the Teamsters
executive board to investigate. Union officials said Hoffa has
recused himself because he knows Brennan and the five other
Michigan Teamster officials charged. They can face fines,
suspension or even expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Brennan said he was innocent. His defenders say
the charges were based on the testimony of just one official, while
several other Teamster officials have testified to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a test for Hoffa,'' said Ken Paff,
national coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a faction
that has repeatedly clashed with Hoffa. ``His mentor, his
benefactor, the man who created a position for him to become
eligible for president, has been charged with embezzling a lot of
money. Hoffa says he's going to establish ethics in the Teamsters.
We're going to see if he has the will to follow through here.''
</P>
<P>
   The oversight board did not bring charges against Carlow Scalf,
a former Brennan assistant who is one of Hoffa's top aides. In its
written charges, the oversight board assailed Scalf's testimony as
misleading and faulted his role in moving all the Christmas bonus
money to Brennan's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is Carlow participated fully in the investigation and
was not named as a defendant,'' said Bret Caldwell, a Teamsters
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the election rules, Edelstein said the union should
institute and rely on rules simlar to those used in the 1991, 1996
and 1998 elections. Federal monitors ordered a rerun election in
1998 after finding that aides to Ron Carey, who narrowly beat Hoffa
in 1996, had siphoned union money into the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Teamster officials said they had based their proposed
election rules largely on those of past years.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Haddad, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York, said, ``The government and the Teamsters are working together
to attempt to meet the court's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Szymanski, the Teamsters general counsel, wrote to
the Justice Department Monday, saying that the union was moving
ahead with its plans to conduct the election and hoped the ruling
would not delay the election. He said the union would consult with
the department about what steps were appropriate in light of
Edelstein's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Leedham, an Oregon Teamsters leader who plans to run against
Hoffa next year, said the judge must have found the proposed rules
objectionable because they allow for little input from forces other
than those supporting Hoffa.

NORTH KOREAN SOUVENIRS ARE NOW BIG SELLERS IN SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Suddenly, South Koreans are enthralled with
all things North Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two nations vowed to pursue peace and reconciliation
last week, sales clerks at the vast Kyobo bookstore in central
Seoul have been working overtime to meet an explosive demand here
for books about North Korea and communism.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, department stores and fashion outlets have
been selling out of sunglasses and drab worker's uniforms similar
to those that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, wore at the talks
in Pyongyang with the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   And at a nearby Samsung consumer electronics store, the
company's first color television assembled in North Korea went on
sale Monday to rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls show that a majority of South
Koreans surveyed have a good impression of North Korea and its
leader after the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Social commentators here are calling South Korea's new
fascination with its estranged northern neighbor a chronic case of
``Kim Jong Il fever.'' But whatever the diagnosis, the summit
meeting last week has forced South Koreans to reassess the
decades-old Cold War view of North Korea as a mortal enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, we were taught that North Koreans were all
communists and therefore very bad and dangerous people,'' Cho Jae
Hyung, 17, said as he flipped through titles like ``Will Spring
Come to Pyongyang?'' ``A Very Special Leader: Kim Jong Il'' and
``Che Guevara'' at the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I saw Kim Jong Il on television, and he seemed like a very
modern, practical and intelligent man,'' Cho said. ``Now, I'm not
sure what to believe about North Korea, but I know that what I was
told in the past is not exactly the truth.``
</P>
<P>
   For many South Koreans, especially older people who lived
through the Korean War, overcoming a half century of deeply
ingrained fear and animosity toward North Korea will not come easy.
Many South Koreans were stunned and confused by the abrupt thawing
of relations between the two countries, which agreed to cease
aggression on the Korean peninsula and forge economic and other
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Especially puzzling for many South Koreans is Kim, the North
Korean leader who they were long told was a reclusive, bellicose
dictator. But for many, he came across on television as a warm,
gracious and charismatic host during the Pyongyang talks. Many
South Koreans remain uncertain whether to embrace North Korea as a
long-lost brother or reject it as a charlatan preying on their
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Overhearing a reporter's request to a shopping mall vendor for
``Kim Jong Il'' sunglasses, which have a half tint, Han Choon Ja, a
63-year-old homemaker, became enraged. ``Why would you want to wear
the same glasses as that evil man?'' she said. ``He was only
putting on a show for the television cameras. We still can't trust
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hwang Chang Seok, the sunglasses vendor, told the woman that
South Koreans who imitate Kim's choice of eye wear were helping to
reduce the fear and tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week ago, people considered Kim Jong Il a monster, and now
they think his glasses are really cool,'' Hwang said. ``It might
sound funny, but I think that's real progress toward
reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, opposition party leaders have expressed concern that the
``euphoric unification fever'' that is gripping the nation is
leading to unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most undesirable effect of the inter-Korean summit is that
the nation is now seized by a euphoria as if the threat of a war
has disappeared and unification is already achieved, while there
exist no real changes,'' said Lee Hoi Chang, head of the
conservative Grand National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that given the euphoria, South Koreans might start to
question the need for the 37,000 American troops that have been
stationed in the South since the end of the Korean War in 1953. And
indeed such questioning has already started in the aftermath of the
summit agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that most South Koreans have a favorable opinion
of Kim Jong Il. In a survey conducted by the Chosun-Ilbo, a
conservative daily, and Gallup Korea, 88 percent of those polled
said they had a good impression of the North Korean leader.
</P>
<P>
   A separate survey conducted by the Korean Broadcasting Institute
last week showed that Kim had a 50.2 percent popularity rating for
his political trustworthiness, compared with a 15.1 percent rating
just before the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At Kyobo books, the manager, Cho Jae Hyung, said that after the
summit meeting books on North Korea and communism were in such high
demand that the store had to reorder many titles and set up a
special section to display them.
</P>
<P>
   He said people of all ages had expressed interest in the books,
which before the summit talks were not very popular but are now
among the store's top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are very optimistic about the changes that are
occurring in Korea, but they are also a little scared like I am,''
said Lee Kicheol, a graduate student, who was browsing the North
Korea section. ``For many of us, this is the first time that we've
honestly thought of North Korea as a friend, and we want to read as
much as possible about this place and this man.''
</P>
<P>
   A sales clerk for Samsung, Kang Kyung Hyung, said the store was
flooded with customers inquiring about the company's first
television made in North Korea. ``Customers mainly wanted to know
if there was a difference in quality between models made in the
North or here in the South,'' Kang said. ``Some people were afraid
to buy it, but others were very enthusiastic about purchasing
something from the North.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said they were buying a piece of history, while
others said they were trying to show their support for North
Koreans, who are less fortunate than us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A sign posted above the 20-inch television, which sells for a
little less than $200, read, ``In honor of the successful
South-North summit meeting, we are pleased to announce the sales of
color televisions made in North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsung said the North Korean televisions were indistinguishable
from models made in South Korea, except for a label on the back
that indicates that the device was made in the Daedongkang plant in
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Cho Sung In, a Samsung spokeswoman, said that as part of a
``corporate goodwill'' program to increase economic ties with North
Korea, Samsung ships the television parts to North Korea, where it
pays a government-owned factory to assemble the sets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Samsung, which makes no money on the deal, has received
2,000 North Korean televisions, which were tested in the South to
insure quality.
</P>
<P>
   The company is considering investing $1 billion in a fully
integrated consumer electronics plant in North Korea to take
advantage of the country's highly skilled, low-cost labor force.

THE SHEIK OF CHIC AND SO PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To give an idea just how perfect Valentino, the Roman
designer, is, two people, both Americans who don't wish their names
to be used, tell a similar story involving a hair dryer. Evidently,
when Valentino and his business partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, were
moored off Capri last summer in Valentino's 152-foot yacht, T.M.
Blue One, there was a lot of coifing going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them would jump in the water for a swim, come back out,
and suddenly you'd hear a blow-dryer going, `Bzzzzzzz,''' said one
of the observers, who was on a boat nearby. ``In Capri, you're
either wet from the water or from the heat. It's impossible to look
your best all the time. But all day long, you'd hear the sound of a
blow-dryer coming from their boat. `Bzzzzzzz.' Ten times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect'' was also the word Barry Diller, the media mogul and
a guest at the party Giammetti gave last Wednesday night at the
Four Seasons, used to describe what it's like to be in one of
Valentino's homes (Capri, Gstaad, London, Rome, New York, Paris) or
on his yacht, where everything _ from the Turkish towels to the
delicious food to the mix of guests and even the uniforms of the
staff _ is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects a remarkable level of discipline,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect was certainly the impression Valentino hoped to give
when he received me one morning last week in his Fifth Avenue
apartment, whose decorator style, by Peter Marino _ French
commodes, oil paintings, object upon object, all surrounded by
yards of brown silk gingham on the walls _ might be summed up as
Continental fancy-casual. Not a hair was out of place as Valentino
entered the room, settled into a chair and turned on the warmth
like a rotisserie lamp.
</P>
<P>
   As Giammetti said to me afterward: ``We can be having a fight _
and our fights are not fights, they are dramas, with broken things.
But suddenly you arrive, and he's'' _ Giammetti lowered a hand in
front of his face _ ``a mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Giammetti, who was 21 when he met Valentino Garavani, then 28,
in 1960, conceded that such immaculate composure was a useful
quality in the fashion business, where image is everything. ``But
sometimes,'' he said, ``I imagine people would also like to scream
and say what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Valentino's 40th year in fashion, and his achievement in
a pantheon of glamorous self-made designers who came along in the
go-go years of fashion, when the truly swell did set the pace, was
acknowledged here last week in the usual ways.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Katherine Betts, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar,
gave him a dinner. Carolina Herrera, who wore his clothes in the
1970s before she wore her own designs, followed on Wednesday with a
cocktail party at her Manhattan town house. Everybody was there:
Dominick Dunne; Judy Peabody; Pat Buckley; Henry and Louise
Grunwald; Annette de la Renta; Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity
Fair; Patrick McCarthy, the editor of Women's Wear Daily; and C.Z.
Guest, who vividly recalled giving Valentino a pair of her riding
chaps after he had raved about how chic they were.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave
him its Lifetime Achievement Award and, of course, there was the
dinner at the Four Seasons, where Valentino, his right arm in a red
sling from a fall at his house in France, moved from cheek to
powdered cheek. He seemed tanner than he had that morning, when
amid the oil paintings and decorator checks, he described his ideal
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' he said with a smile, ``you have to wake up
and look at yourself in the mirror and say, `I'm not really so
bad.' I realize more and more that when you start your day in a
good mood, things go a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, reflecting on what seemed even to him to be a very
blossomy Barbara Cartland sentiment, and went on: ``You know, I
don't like to go out so much anymore. I love to see friends. I love
to have little dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   This seemed surprising coming from a man with homes in five
countries who lives lavishly and despite a reputation in the
industry for working hard and maintaining one of the best couture
ateliers in Europe, appears to be constantly playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No! Totally the opposite,'' Valentino exclaimed. ``In
Rome, nobody invites me anymore because I always regret. Regret,
regret, regret!'' (Valentino tends to speak in triplicate.)
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``No, I love to stay with my dogs. I live a very,
very cozy life. I have this home in France, and I love to go to see
the garden, to walk and to think. I'm a very sensitive person, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while rescuing a dog at this house in May that Valentino
dislocated his shoulder. He was walking down a muddy slope when one
of his pugs came under attack by a swan, and he fell as he went to
the dog's aid. Nerve damage in the arm still gives him trouble, and
he has been seeing a specialist here.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Valentino is one of the last embodiments of jet-set
glamour. His designs _ the precisely tailored suits and coats, the
pin-tucked blouses and entrance-making columns _ have always struck
women as pretty and men as sexy, and rarely more than in the
high-spending 1980s, when Women's Wear Daily labeled Valentino
``the Sheik of Chic'' (though the paper's editor at the time, John
Fairchild, could needle him, too).
</P>
<P>
   One can't help wondering who among Val's gals left the deepest
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want some names?'' he asked. He clasped his hands together
and said, ``I have to say, not because she made me famous in the
United States, but for me Jackie Kennedy was one of the icons.'' He
looked thoughtful. ``You look like her.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if Valentino had had too much sun.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added the qualifier, ``around the eyes,'' and then
returned to his recollections in a purring voice: ``Jackie did a
wonderful thing for my career. So did Babe Paley and Jayne
Wrightsman. So many, many, many ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the awards party given by the Council of Fashion Designers of
America, Carolina Herrera was asked if after all these years of
knowing Valentino, she could really say she knew him at all. ``Ah,
that's a tricky question,'' she said with a smile. ``He's very
clever. I think he only lets people know what he wants them to
know. He's always the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say he is predictable. In fact, he told a story
that says a great deal about what lies beneath the smooth corona of
hair and the Caraceni suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, arriving at the airport in Rome, I saw outside the
most terrible dog,'' he said. ``All dirty, not able to walk. I said
to my people, `Let's take the dog home in the car.'''
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who also has three pugs and two French poodles,
named the dog Stella. ``She's now the queen of the house,'' he
said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you have to like a man who loves animals.

PEACE DIVIDEND FOR PRIVATIZED U.S. URANIUM FUEL COMPANY MAY BE
SHUTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Ever since Richard Nixon proposed it in 1968,
policy makers have talked about having the federal government quit
the business of enriching uranium for nuclear power plants. It took
decades, but the Clinton administration finally pulled it off two
years ago, with Vice President Al Gore claiming it as a victory for
reinventing government.
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, have came at the worst possible time.
</P>
<P>
   The government never ran the enterprise particularly well, but
since privatization, the company has done much worse.
</P>
<P>
   The price of shares in the U.S. Enrichment Corp., as the new
company is known, closed Monday at $4.6875, down from $17.50 soon
after the initial public offering in July 1998. Orders are down,
costs per unit are up, and the price of USEC's only product is
declining.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue is coming to a head. The corporation's board is
meeting here on Wednesday to discuss closing one of its two
sprawling plants _ in Portsmouth, Ohio, or Paducah, Ky. _ in an
effort to prevent the company from sliding into bankruptcy. On
Monday, the company released a copy of its formal notification to
the Treasury that its bonds had reached junk rating, which, under
the legislation that created it, allows it to close a plant.
</P>
<P>
   There is intense jockeying by each plant to be the survivor, but
outsiders believe the survivor could soon close, too, dragging down
with it the other parts in the fuel production chain from uranium
mining, already at a low ebb, to the fabrication of nuclear fuel.
Outside experts say that to maintain its market share, USEC has
been signing contracts lately for less than its cost of production.
As a government operation, that is costly; as a private enterprise
it is a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Even U.S. Enrichment's former parent, the Energy Department,
acknowledges some apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not convinced they are driving themselves into
bankruptcy,'' said T.J. Glauthier, the deputy energy secretary,
``but the management challenge is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several members of Congress are talking about
reversing the whole process by re-nationalizing the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a precedent for this,'' said Rep. Ted
Strickland, D-Ohio, whose district includes the Portsmouth plant.
But prospects for the company are so poor that various parties are
raising the specter that the United States could become dependent
on imports to fuel the nuclear reactors that provide 20 percent of
the nation's electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is enough support to bail out the company or
repurchase it remains to be seen, but the law under which the
government sold the factories calls for maintaining a ``viable''
domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
   Uranium enrichment is an arcane business that consists of
laboriously sorting through two different types of uranium to raise
the proportion of the more valuable kind, U-235, from the 0.7
percent that exists in nature to the 5 percent or so needed for
power reactors, or to the highly concentrated state used in
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The market price of a unit of enrichment has fallen in recent
years from more than $100 to about $80 now. The United States,
using technology developed in World War II to make bombs, is the
highest-cost producer. By contrast, the Russians, using newer
technology, can make money selling such enrichment units at $30 or
above, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is for U.S. Enrichment to buy a share in a
European producer, Urenco, which is now owned by the governments of
Britain, Germany and the Netherlands; the stakes held by the
Germans and the Dutch are on the market, and Urenco has newer
technology, which uses centrifuges.
</P>
<P>
   The central problem facing USEC is that the international
industry is set up to supply enough uranium enrichment for all the
reactors that were planned 30 years ago, though many were never
built. At the same time, the need for weapons-grade uranium has
been reversed: Work done years ago to make bomb fuel is now used
for reactor fuel, reducing the need for the factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got an industry that's very well set up for the
1970s,'' said William Timbers Jr., the president and chief
executive of U.S. Enrichment. ``It has to restructure.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is just what he insists it is prepared to do. The
company, he said in an interview, has the ``ability to take some
tough, difficult decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary, but world demand for nuclear fuel is around 36
million units a year, while the supply is 42 million units. And
since uranium has limited uses, price declines do not stimulate
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inelastic market,'' said Richard Miller, a consultant
for the union that represents most workers at the two plants. No
matter how far the price falls, he said, ``we're not going to put
it on our cereal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller and others say that USEC itself has brought on some
of its own problems. Under the terms of its privatization, it was
supposed to keep the two plants open until 2004. But it is allowed
to close one earlier if its bonds drop below investment grade; some
critics say the company engineered just that, through a stock
buyback that created a less favorable debt-to-equity ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems were clearly inherited. In 1993, Gore and Boris
Yeltsin, then president of Russia, struck a deal for the Russians
to take high-enriched uranium from bombs and dilute it for use in
American power reactors.
</P>
<P>
   That deal has had its ups and downs, in part, critics say,
because U.S. Enrichment, which inherited the deal when it was
privatized, is not eager to see Russian uranium displace so much of
its own production. Company officials deny this, but in any case,
the Russian deal represents about 90 million enrichment units over
20 years, or enough to meet about half the domestic demand. So
while beating swords into plowshares may make sense as a national
policy, it is tough on the companies that make plowshares. Some
people think the Russian deal was USEC's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does this industry and these workers have to pay the whole
cost of peace?,'' asked Daniel Minter, president of the union local
at Portsmouth, which, after recent layoffs, represents just under
1,000 workers. ``You couldn't have picked anything more difficult
to privatize. The Pentagon would have been easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year U.S. Enrichment's managers asked the Energy Department
for $200 million to help them over their troubles, but failed to
convince officials there that the Russian deal had caused any
unexpected difficulties. Paying the company's executives salaries
commensurate with those of private industry is also a sore point.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company began its life with a huge stock of its
raw material, unenriched uranium hexafluoride, a kind of dowry from
the government, and has been selling it, to pay dividends and other
costs. Partly as a result, the price of a pound of uranium is down
sharply, forcing some mines to shut down. The nation's sole company
for converting uranium ore into uranium hexafluoride, the form that
USEC uses, says it is near a shutdown, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of this privatization,'' said Thomas Neff, a senior
scientist at the Center for International Studies at MIT who first
conceived the Russian uranium deal, ``is that the government set
something out there, with various goodies, that did a lot of
collateral damage. The government subsidized an entity that's
destroying everything else.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five weeks after bidding farewell to Cardinal John
O'Connor, New York's rich and powerful returned to St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Monday to see his successor, Edward Michael Egan,
installed as New York's ninth archbishop, in a ceremony reflecting
many of the elements that will inevitably shaped his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's consecration, which began with a vespers service attended
by 2,700 Roman Catholics on Sunday evening, culminated in Monday's
far more elaborate Mass for 4,000, with eight American cardinals,
18 archbishops, nearly 100 bishops and 900 priests in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand were Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, and
her rival for the Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio, Gov. George Pataki,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former Mayors David Dinkins and Ed Koch,
and Justice Anthony Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, coming five weeks to the hour after O'Connor's
funeral, seemed to complete a transition that began with the
cardinal's protracted struggle with brain cancer. The new
archbishop began to put his personal stamp on his service in New
York on Monday, with his personal selection of Mozart's and
Beethoven's most majestic works to guide the Mass of his
consecration, with readings offered in Spanish and English in
acknowledgment of the archdiocese's ever-more multicultural face,
and with a his homily stressing his role as a teacher of faith and
values.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant was, inevitably, stirring. More than 1,000 priests
and bishops wore white for the occasion, making the lengthy
procession from the Catholic Center on First Avenue to St.
Patrick's seemed almost like a white banner unfurled between the
administrative and spiritual hearts of the New York archdiocese,
shepherd to some 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx and
Staten Island, and in seven counties north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, the priests in attendance had hair the color of
the white robes, a sign of how swiftly the clergy in New York is
aging. The average age of priests in the archdiocese is over 60,
and of 851 diocesan priests in New York, nearly 250 are retired or
otherwise inactive. Egan's success in recruiting young men for the
priesthood while he was bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., is believed to
have played a role in the pope's decision to name him to head the
church in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop himself wore a gold, green and red stole over his
off-white surplice, covered with a pectoral cross from a young man
who became a priest under Egan's guidance and then died soon after
of leukemia. The archbishop's appearance at the back doors of St.
Patrick's shortly after 2 p.m. brought not so much a round, as wave
upon wave, of applause as he strode smiling down the center aisle,
with the applause cresting when he reached the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of the enormous task ahead, not just in
recruiting but in reorganizing an archdiocese that has undergone
vast demographic changes in recent decades, the new archbishop
seemed more daunted than delighted through much of his consecration
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His homily, which likened the Basilica of Saints John and Paul
in Rome to the church in New York, did not wander off into comic
asides, and the new archbishop smiled little. One noteworthy
exception came as Renee Fleming sang Mozart's Exsultate Jubilate,
when the archbishop closed his eyes and swayed for a moment, as if
transported by the soprano's strong, clear voice.
</P>
<P>
   Egan noted that the basilica dates from the fourth century, and
was built on top of the house in which the saints lived. The saints
had refused to offer sacrifices to pagan gods, and were executed by
the emperor Julian in 361. The archbishop said he loved the
basilica because ``it sums up for me what parishes and dioceses are
all about. We are communities that are built on uncompromising
acceptance of all that the Lord has revealed. This is our
foundation. Our strength is grounded in our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishop also made a plea for social justice, and against
discrimination, abortion and euthanasia, drawing spontaneous and
sustained applause. ``May we allow the sick and disabled to be
neglected?'' he asked. ``May we stand idly by while the being
within the mother is killed, even though no one has ever been able
to prove that it is other than a human being with an inalienable
right to life? May we look the other way when the elderly are put
to death because someone questions the quality of their life?''
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop, a canon lawyer and classical pianist, made
his mark in Bridgeport by rescuing the diocese from desperate
financial straits, in part by successful fund-raising among the
wealthy and corporate donors. Egan eagerly pumped the hands of VIPs
in the front rows, but also dashed straight out the back doors of
the Cathedral, as the chorus of Beethoven's Ninth, played from the
Cathedral over loudspeakers, filled Fifth Avenue. There, he went
straight up to the police barricades, holding high his crozier, and
began shaking the hands of well-wishers with his free hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the street,'' an aide prompted the archbishop. There,
hundreds had stood throughout the service, straining through the
honking horns and passing buses to hear the service through
loudspeakers on the cathedral's facade. Many were tourists or
passers-by who stopped when they recognized what was happening.
Others said they made it a point to be as near as possible to their
new church leader, even if it meant standing behind a police
barricade.
</P>
<P>
   Egan swung around, looked up and waved to the onlookers across
the street. That brought a round of cheering and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's beautiful, even though I'm not inside,'' said
Felicita Santiago, 63, of Queens. ``I'm not inside, but I feel like
I'm a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Whittier, of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was
telling herself as she left the cathedral, ``This is so exciting.
This is so exciting.'' Asked why, she said, ``It's so exciting
because we have a new archbishop to replace Cardinal O'Connor, who
we loved so much.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She said she was impressed by the diversity of the service,
which alternated English and Spanish readings and offered texts in
both languages. The Mass also featured a prayer in Portuguese,
Creole, Vietnamese, Russian and other languages.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, said that Egan's
message and his Spanish came across well. ``I told him his Spanish
was pretty good,'' Ferrer said, adding that he enjoyed the homily
even though it focused more on Rome than on the Bronx. ``He made, I
thought, a very interesting connection between Rome and New York,
and his message was about the foundation of our faith. I thought it
was very appropriate and very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer sat in the third row of pews, beside three of his likely
opponents in next year's Democratic primary for mayor _ the public
advocate, Mark Green; the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi, and
Speaker Peter Vallone of City Council. Vallone said that he
attended Mass every day and that he explained the Mass to his
political rivals, Hevesi and Green. ``They were very, very
respectful,'' he said. ``When I go to a synagogue, they do the same
for me.''

AD COLUMN: PUBLICIS PLANS ACQUISITION OF SAATCHI &AMP; SAATCHI 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publicis SA, which last month lost out to the WPP Group in an
effort to buy Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., plans to buy Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi,
the British agency company descended from the empire of the
acquisitive Saatchi brothers, for at least $1.5 billion in stock,
advertising executives close to the deal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi unexpectedly disclosed Monday that its
executives had been approached to begin discussions that could
result in an offer for the agency, the world's 11th largest in
terms of billings and revenue. Though the terms of the proposed
deal were not disclosed and the potential acquirer was not
identified, shares of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi climbed 27 percent in
London, giving the agency company a market value of more than $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising executives close to the deal said that Publicis
would acquire Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi for $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in
stock. The deal would significantly increase the Publicis presence
in the United States, the world's largest advertising market.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis _
which has a worldwide ranking of eighth in billings and ninth in
revenue _ scheduled a news conference in Paris for Tuesday morning
on a topic he declined to discuss. Levy is expected to lead the
merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would be further evidence of the growing appeal
of independent agency companies as the consolidation of the
advertising industry that began six years ago continues at a
break-neck pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increasing globalization of brand marketing is
accelerating due to the Web,'' said Leland Westerfield, an analyst
with PaineWebber in New York. ``Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi could probably
operate favorably on its own, but agencies need to grow on a global
basis to serve key clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The pending acquisition of Y &AMP; R, based in New York, by WPP,
based in London, would create the world's biggest agency company in
both categories. A hook-up with Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi as a kind of
consolation prize for Publicis would create the fifth-largest
agency company in billings and revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``WPP and Y &AMP; R took the gloves off in terms of the size of the
deals,'' said Michael Russell Jr., an analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter in New York. ``Now we're talking about bigger names.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, this would have been hard to accept,'' he
added, referring to a combination of Publicis with Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi. ``Now it's `Of course.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at both agency companies declined to discuss the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can say is that we received an approach that may or may
not result in a merger offer,'' said Richard Walters at Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi in London, adding: ``I can't say any more. Watch this
space.''
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart at Publicis, Seth Goldschlager, said he would
not comment on ``market speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there is no similar inhibition among industry
analysts and deal makers, who relished discussing what might become
of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the ones that had to go,'' said Abbott Jones,
managing director at AdMedia Partners in New York, which
specializes in transactions involving agencies and media companies.
``There aren't that many left.''
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and Publicis are among six independent agency
companies that have been consistently identified by analysts as
ready to buy or be bought: the others are the Cordiant
Communications Group, Grey Advertising, Havas Advertising and True
North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mega-agencies are in a wonderful position to handle the
business of megaclients,'' said Alan Gottesman, who follows
advertising for West End Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though Publicis has already acquired several American agencies,
including Fallon, Hal Riney &AMP; Partners, the Evans Group and
Frankel, owning Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi will offer additional
opportunities to work with blue-chip marketers like General Mills,
Hewlett-Packard and Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would require the blessings of giant clients of Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Toyota, which make up more than
a third of the agency company's billings, by Jones' estimate. There
could be some difficulties on that front because agencies now owned
by Publicis work for competitors of those companies like L'Oreal,
General Motors and Renault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major clients dictate the marriage partner,'' Jones said.
``Look to the clients and you have the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will move forward, he added, if the merged agency
company ``can handle P &AMP; G and Toyota without getting in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi was founded by Maurice Saatchi and his
brother, Charles, and won widespread recognition for its ads that
helped bring Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party to power
in Britain. The agency grew rapidly during the 1980s with a spate
of deals.
</P>
<P>
   The debt from those deals, poorly received plans to expand
beyond advertising and the global recession all combined to deeply
wound Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi during the early and mid 1990s. That
enabled two American agency companies, the Interpublic Group of
Companies and the Omnicom Group, to race ahead by making
acquisitions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interpublic and Omnicom have had 10 years of practice in
getting it right,'' Gottesman at West End Communications said.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi's recovery from its missteps was hampered by a
bitter dispute that emerged between the Saatchi brothers and the
agency company's board, which led to their departure at the end of
1994. As they formed their own agency, M&AMP;C Saatchi, Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi was renamed Cordiant PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Cordiant was ``de-merged'' to form two
separate agency companies, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and Bates Worldwide,
later renamed the Cordiant Communications Group. Cordiant
Communications shares also climbed Monday in London, rising 12.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi disclosure ``identifies the value of
Cordiant'' to investors, said Andy Boland, investor relations
director at Cordiant Communications in London, as the number of
independent agency companies of their size keeps dwindling. Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi and Cordiant Communications each own 50 percent of Zenith
Media, a worldwide media services and research agency.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi has recently been selling interests in units
outside its core agency like Siegel &AMP; Gale, a corporate identity
consulting company now known as Siegelgale.com; and Cliff Freeman &AMP;
Partners, a creatively focused shop in New York. The trade
publication PR Week reported last month that the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
public relations agency, Rowland Worldwide, would be sold to
Edelman Public Relations Worldwide in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 percent increase Monday in the price of shares of Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi marked the largest single gain since it began trading
separately from Cordiant in December 1997. In trading Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange, the American depository shares for Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi climbed $7.6875, or 30.3 percent, to $33.0625.

 &HT;    High court rules on student-led prayers
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that
student-initiated prayers before crowds at public school football
games is unconstitutional and went so far as to write the majority
decision in a way that could bar such prayers from graduations,
school assemblies or any other public school-sponsored event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a far-reaching decision,'' said Will Harrell,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Texas.
``It effectively puts an end to student-initiated prayer at any
school-sponsored event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision that the pregame prayers
violate the separation of church and state is a result of a dispute
between two Santa Fe, Texas, families that wanted the prayers
banned and the Santa Fe Independent School District, which claimed
it was a free speech issue. The Santa Fe families _ one Mormon, the
other Roman Catholic _ were represented by the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous opinion,'' said Kelly Shackelford of the
Christian-sponsored Liberty Legal Institute and co-counsel for the
Santa Fe school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is now beginning to censor the religious speech of
private citizens _ for the first time in U.S. history,'' he said.
``This is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote:
``School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible
because it sends the ancillary message to members of the audience
who are nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of
the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents
that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delivery of such a message over the school's public
address system by a speaker representing the student body, under
the supervision of school faculty and pursuant to a school policy
that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer is not
properly characterized as private speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined by Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy,
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Beyer in the
court's most definitive ruling on school prayers since public
school prayers were declared unconstitutional in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the first Supreme Court ruling involving school
prayer since 1992 when justices declared faculty-organized and
clergy-led prayers were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court took up the Santa Fe case after the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled against public
prayers at football games. That court also said graduation prayers
could continue if they did not mention a specific diety.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declined to take up the graduation-ceremony
dispute. However, the majority's opinion was so tightly written
that its tentacles put school district's on notice that public
student prayers at school events that favor one religion seem to
imply school-supported favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe decision was blasted by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist who wrote the minority opinion. He was joined by Clarence
Thomas and Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the
court's opinion,'' Rehnquist said. ``It bristles with hostility to
all things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, who argued in favor of the
school prayers during the Supreme Court hearing in March, said he
agreed with Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed in the court's decision,'' Cornyn said. ``I
agree with the dissenting justices that the court's opinion
`distorts existing precedent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the probable Republican presidential
nominee, joined the attorney generals of nine other states who
wrote the Supreme Court, urging justices to allow the prayers and
not prohibit a student's right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in
voluntary, student-led prayer,'' Bush said Monday after the court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 Texas school districts, including Leander, adopted
resolutions last year expressing disapproval of a ban against
student-initiated, student-led prayers over the public address
systems at football games.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Ward, the Santa Fe student who challenged the appeals
court ruling on free speech grounds, and her attorney, Kelly
Coghlan, could not be reached for comment. Ward's father is pastor
of a local Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe school district was supported by religious right
leaders who condemned the Supreme Court's decision. Also coming out
against the court was the Council on American-Islamic relations,
which said the increase in juvenile violence, sexual promiscuity
and drug use at schools shows ``there is clearly a need for more
student-sponsored spiritual guidance, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   But Debbie Mason, a mother and spokeswoman for the two families,
whose names were sealed by the court, said she ``was so happy my
whole body was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who calls herself ``an American Baptist,'' and a handful
of other Santa Fe families that supported the lawsuit were
unpopular among their neighbors. The two families asked to remain
anonymous because they feared ostracization from their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In May, three Santa Fe high school students were arrested for
threatening to hang a 13-year-old Jewish boy, who was an
eighth-grader in the Santa Fe middle school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we were worried about,'' Mason said of showing
preferential treatment of one faith over another. ``The way the
(Santa Fe) school board was going, they were pitting student
against student.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country was founded on the right to pray or not to pray.
If you want to a Baptist or an atheist, no one has the right to
stand up ... and tell the kids to bow their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Santa Fe's seven-member school board said Monday the
predominantly Baptist district does not foster a climate of
religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Santa Fe school board member Robin
Clayton warned that the mostly Baptist district cannot control what
students or others say on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spontaneous things happen, don't they?'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin B. Cominsky, regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League which supported the court decision, said schools should use
the ruling to foster religious understanding. ``This is a teaching
opportunity to say `This is the law of the land and while some of
us don't agree it is something that protects everyone's religion,'
'' he added. ``The wall against church and state is a sturdy wall
and must be sturdy to protect everyone's freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect prayers to stop at the Legislature, city
council meetings, or even school board meetings. The new ruling has
no effect on government entities and in the Bible belt it is
unlikely they will re-evaluate their procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Lt. Gov. Rick Perry is presiding over the Senate
you can expect there to be prayer at the start of each day when the
Legislature is in session,'' said Eric Bearse, the spokesman for
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a Texas Poll showed that eight out of 10 surveyed
residents support public school student prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Mason said she doesn't even expect the Supreme Court ruling to
close the chapter on Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one part of it has ended, but I don't think the school
board is going to bow to the Supreme Court,'' Mason said. ``I
expect them to come out and say, ``We only listen to God.' ''

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seagram Co., the spirits and entertainment company that includes
legendary names like Absolut Vodka, Chivas Regal, Universal Studios
and Polgram Records, will announce on Tuesday that it has agreed to
be acquired for about $34 billion in stock by Vivendi SA, a French
water utility that is transforming itself into a telecommunications
and entertainment giant.
</P>
<P>
   The sale amounts to one of the largest media deals ever and ends
the Bronfman family's control over Seagram, which Samuel Bronfman
took over in 1928. It has remained one of the nation's most
powerful liquor companies even as Edgar Bronfman Jr., a grandson of
Samuel Bronfman, began remaking the company into a media player in
1995, by first acquiring MCA, parent of Universal Pictures, which
produced American icons like ``E.T.'' and ``The Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's six major film studios, Universal also owns
a television production company, theme parks and a music business.
Just last year, Bronfman expanded Seagram's holdings by buying
Polygram, making Seagram the nation's largest record company in
terms of sales. That purchase reflected Bronfman's conviction that
music was a growth business.
</P>
<P>
   In the new company, which will be called Vivendi-Universal and
be based in Paris, Bronfman will become vice-chairman, with the
music and Internet businesses reporting to him. Vivendi executives
do not see the liquor business as part of the company's future and
plans to sell all of it, or at least a stake in it.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi hopes to leverage Seagram's library of films and music
by distributing it over its mobile telephone network in France, as
well as through its ambitious pan-European Internet portal, called
Vizzavi, and pay-television company, Canal Plus, of which it owns
49 percent and which it now plans to buy outright.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a bet by both Vivendi and Seagram that by combining
popular content with a powerful distribution system, especially the
next generation of wireless Internet services in Europe, it can
create a company worth more combined than by working separately.
</P>
<P>
   However, there were some skeptics on Monday who felt that
Vivendi was unlikely to cull great benefits in merging. One analyst
who requested anonymity said that while Canal Plus was getting use
of the Universal Pictures film library to fill its programming
needs and Vivendi believed it could download music digitally via
cell phones, ``Maybe you are accelerating that synergy, but I think
it is a small niche,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a major payoff is at least several years away.
</P>
<P>
   The deal needs approval from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi's purchase would mean that two major film studios are
now under foreign ownership. Sony bought Columbia Pictures
Industries in 1989. Matsushita Electrical Industrial acquired MCA
in 1990, owning it for five years, but sold it to Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a series of aggressive media mergers
that have seen the entertainment world consolidate into a handful
of major entities. The first wave, which began in the 1980s,
included mergers of movie and television production with companies
that could distribute their programs on hardware or cable or TV _
Sony and Columbia, Time and Warner, Viacom and Paramount, and then
CBS, and Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC. Seagram's purchase
of MCA was unusual because Seagram was not a media company, though
it believed it brought international marketing expertise to MCA.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave of deals has included AOL's pending purchase of
Time-Warner, in which technology companies have begun seeking to
own ``content'' providers such as major film companies.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi's deal fits more directly in that category. Somewhat
like Seagram under the control of Edgar Bronfman, Vivendi has
developed under the leadership of Jean-Marie Messier, the French
company's chairman, into a holding company of sorts with a
hodgepodge of old-and new-economy businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While Vivendi very much remains a water distribution, waste
management and construction company _ more than half of its $40
billion in revenue come from those divisions _ Messier has been
steadily building an impressive stable of telecommunication and
entertainment properties.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi now owns a 24.5 percent stake in the satellite
television business, British Sky Broadcasting PLC, which is
controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. It owns 59 percent of
Cegetel, which operates SFR, the second largest wireless telephone
network in France. Messier, also acquired Havas, the publishing and
advertising company, and last year increased Vivendi's stake in
Canal Plus by 15 percent, to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Messier's most important deal to date was a move in
February to create an Internet portal with Vodafone Airtouch PLC,
the world's largest wireless telephone operator. That deal sealed
the fate of Vodafone's record $183 billion hostile bid for
Mannesmann and gave Messier an important ally in expanding his
wireless operations, which so far remain mostly in France.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the merger of Seagram and Vivendi would create a
company with a combined revenue of $65 billion, though the sale of
the liquor business and Vivendi's water business, which includes
U.S. Filter, would reduce that holding and trim the company into a
purer media business.

NEW HCC POLICY TO HELP UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS DRAWS COMPLAINTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston Community College trustees thought they were
doing a good deed last month when they agreed to lower tuition for
undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Now the policy has created a backlash from international
students with educational visas attending HCC.
</P>
<P>
   International students, who must continue to pay higher
out-of-district tuition, say they are being punished for obeying
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crazy thing,'' said Harry Sudarma, a Baptist
minister from Indonesia who counsels Indonesian students at HCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students come to me and say they are better off being
illegal,'' said Sudarma. ``As a pastor, I have to tell them not to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehbi Rezai, 20, a student from Europe, added, ``I'm all for
everybody having an opportunity to get an education, but it should
cost the same for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   HCC administrators say there is a difference between
undocumented immigrants who have lived in Houston for years and
international students who come here temporarily to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (undocumented immigrants) are students whose parents
brought them here, sometimes with no choice,'' said Chancellor Ruth
Burgos-Sasscer of the HCC System. ``They are kids who are going to
be here in Houston, so if we don't educate them, we're going to end
up supporting them one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that children in the United
States must be allowed access to education through 12th grade,
regardless of their legal status. But there is no guarantee that
undocumented immigrants can receive a college education.
</P>
<P>
   HCC previously charged undocumented immigrants the same tuition
as out-of-district residents and international students _ about
$1,500 per term instead of $500. Under the new policy, undocumented
immigrants will be allowed to pay the lower fee.
</P>
<P>
   The board will also consider a clarification to the policy at
its Thursday meeting. The HCC administration recommends in-district
tuition be limited to students who have attended a Houston high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Some international students were angry when learning of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike undocumented immigrants, international students typically
come to Houston to attend a college. Most arrive as adults carrying
legal student visas.
</P>
<P>
   HCC has more than 2,000 international students enrolled, third
highest total of any two-year college system in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of immigration rules, students must follow terms of
their visas or face being forced to return home.
</P>
<P>
   For example, students must take and receive credit for at least
12 credit hours per term. If they fail to meet that provision,
visas become invalid and students must return to their home country
to apply for a new student visa.
</P>
<P>
   HCC administrators tell dozens of students that they have no
choice but to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to go back to my country, and the trip cost me
$2,000,'' said Francisco Rojas, a Colombian student at HCC. ``I
would rather just lose my legal status.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming illegal would not help students like Rojas if the HCC
board votes to limit reduced tuition to students who have gone to
local high schools.
</P>
<P>
   But it likely will not stop them from complaining about what
they see as an injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm paying three times as much tuition,'' Rojas said. ``It's
not fair.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in a city that is used to being looked down
on, there has been something particularly galling about the way the
French have long regarded Hollywood. That makes it all the more
provocative that the latest foreign company to buy a major movie
studio has been Vivendi SA, a French media giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French always have been the most irate about American
domination of the movies, so to think that now it will be the
French who are financing these American movies, well, you'd have to
say that's ironic,'' said Peter Bart, editor of Variety.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, though, that it has been a long time since the
days when Hollywood was run by a small clique of American moguls.
The movie studios were all acquired by larger conglomerates and, in
the last decade, the business of making films has become an
increasingly global one. Sony owns Columbia. For a time, Credit
Lyonnais controlled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   So the news that Universal Studios, one of the earliest movie
pioneers, which began making silent shorts before World War I, was
being purchased by a French company has been greeted here with
something less than shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find it ironic at all that a French company has bought
Universal,'' said Tom Pollock, who had been a top executive at
Universal under three owners. ``Canal Plus has built an incredible
empire in Europe on the strength of American movies and
television.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay-television company, Canal Plus, is 49 percent owned by
Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock and others said that the French business officials they
had encountered displayed none of the anti-Hollywood sentiments
espoused by some French critics, filmmakers and government
officials. ``Maybe leftist intellectuals in Paris are decrying
American films, but the French people are eating them up,'' said
one independent producer. ``They can't make our movies, so they'll
buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most here expect that Pierre Lescure, the chairman of Canal
Plus, will not move his offices to Universal City but remain in
Paris. Universal Studios will become one of the corporate divisions
under his control. Instead, as in the case of almost all of the
other purchases of Hollywood studios by foreign companies, it is
anticipated that some established Hollywood insider will be chosen
to run the studio under Lescure. Among the names mentioned was
Terry Semel, a former top Warner Brothers executive. Officials at
Universal said Monday that it was not yet a foregone conclusion
that the current president, Ron Meyer, would be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and 1980s, when Universal Pictures was owned
by MCA, a former talent agency, and run by Lew Wasserman, it was
among the most lucrative and powerful studios in Hollywood. Much of
its strength was based on the talent of Steven Spielberg, a young
filmmaker the studio had discovered and nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, MCA was purchased by a Japanese conglomerate, the
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. The Japanese company, in turn,
sold Universal in 1995 to Seagram, whose chairman, Edgar Bronfman
Jr., has displayed much more interest in expanding the company's
music empire than in the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran Universal when it was an American-owned public company,
I ran it for five years when it was owned by the Japanese and I ran
it for under a year under Edgar Bronfman,'' Pollock said. ``During
the Japanese era, they never made one decision as to what movie got
made or didn't get made. They let management in place run the
company. I have no idea whether the French will be the same way or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The betting money is that they will.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unfortunate aspects of Canal Plus buying
Universal may be that the French company, which has been
particularly active in financing American independent films to help
feed its television channels, may shift its attention away from
small, quality films toward the big, star-studded blockbusters that
make up a traditional studio slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sony bought Columbia Pictures, there was all kinds of
talk in the American media about, oh, we're selling our culture to
foreigners,'' said Bart, the editor of Variety. ``The interesting
thing is that, this time, there's none of that. That's because
times have changed. Most people aren't aware of it, but there's
been so much in the way of European money flowing into Hollywood in
recent years to help finance American movies and it's beginning to
affect the kinds of movies that are being made and the way they're
cast. They're putting people into movies who are known in Europe.''

 &HT;    Officials seek armed guards for treatment facility
 &HT;    By Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla _ Armed guards, light poles with criss-crossing
cables, observation towers and more razor wire were recommended
Monday as ways to prevent another escape from Florida's first
center for sexually violent predators in western Martin County.
</P>
<P>
   Top prison officials and the director of the Martin Treatment
Center, which is run by a private Pennsylvania company, criticized
the lack of security at the center, where a sex offender escaped
June 5 when a helicopter lowered inside the razor-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush requested the reports after sex offender Steven
Whitsett jumped aboard a helicopter flown by his longtime friend,
Clifford Burkhart. The copter crashed about 100 yards from the
center and the two were captured after a 25-hour manhunt about 4
1/2 miles from the center.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after his escape, Whitsett told officials at the
Martin County Jail that he had planned the escape for two months.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to land the helicopter on the treatment
center's basketball court near the building, according to the
report by Robert Briody, executive director of the center operated
by Liberty Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Briody criticized the design of the building _ a former minimum
security jail _ for contributing to the problems of housing the
sexual predators indefinitely under the Jimmy Ryce law.
</P>
<P>
   He also chastised the state for failing to complete security
improvements requested more than a year ago, such as installing
metal detectors, cameras, perimeter fence detection devices, fire
doors, lighting and paving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limitations imposed by the Martin Treatment Center
physical plant promotes considerable idleness in a milieu where few
privileges can be suspended and a small outdoor recreation area
must be liberally used,'' riody wrote in his report detailing
Whitsett's escape.
</P>
<P>
   One treatment center employee was in the recreation yard with
about 40 sex offenders when Whitsett scaled a fence and jumped
aboard the hovering helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsett, he reported, was viewed by the staff as ``manipulative
and willing to challenge policy,'' but never engaged staff in angry
exchanges or opposed their authority.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment staff reported Whitsett was ``resistant, closed
and controlling'' and ``never took full responsibility for his
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He regularly attended group therapy sessions, but his
participation was seldom genuine as he was resistant to treatment,
Briody reported.
</P>
<P>
   Briody also recommended hiring more staff to man the center,
which lacks adequate space for treatment rooms, offices and housing
units. The 105 sex offenders are housed about 14 to a room.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Crews, a top Department of Corrections
security administrator, also criticized security at the center in
the wake of Whitsett's escape.
</P>
<P>
   He also recommended guards outside the building be armed, cable
systems above the outdoor recreation field, barbed wire on the
building roof and improved lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Both men agreed the Liberty staff needs enhanced training and
that improved communication is vital among officials at Liberty,
the state prison system and the Department of Children and
Families, which oversees Liberty's $9 million contract to operate
the sex offender center.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled
at playing wise and imperious authority figures _ newspaper
publishers, queens, grande dames and a madam _ and who achieved
perhaps her greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss
in the television series ``The Sopranos,'' died on Sunday at her
home in Stratford, Conn., one day short of her 72nd birthday. She
also had a home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Katie Sparer Bowe said that no specific cause of
death was given, but for several years the actress had been
suffering from cancer and chronic pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
   A wide diversity of playwrights _ among them Chekhov, Shaw and
Shakespeare as well as Jean Genet, Paul Osborn and A.R. Gurney _
was within Marchand's range. She once described her physical
presence as ``a strange combination of being very imposing and
down-to-earth,'' an accurate assessment of the seemingly
contradictory image she projected.
</P>
<P>
   That description could be applied to the overburdened wife she
played in the 1980 Broadway revival of Osborn's ``Morning's at
Seven,'' her patrician publisher on the long-running ``Lou Grant''
television series and her portrayal of Livia Soprano, the monster
mother of them all, a woman bred into the Mafia who without a blink
of hesitation sets up her son, Tony, to be assassinated because he
has moved her to a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Except for her indomitability, Livia was in direct contrast to
all the ``tasteful ladies'' Marchand played in her busy career. At
70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new
popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic
character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of
Caligula's mother in ``I Claudius,'' a woman also named Livia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her career, Marchand gave her roles an unexpected
edge. Even when her characters were at their most officious, they
retained a measure of charm, and her more affectionate characters
could also be sardonic. She was an expert at both light and more
serious comedy, moving effortlessly from the outrageous antics in
the movie spoof, ``The Naked Gun,'' to Lady Bracknell in ``The
Importance of Being Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   In plays like ``Morning's at Seven,'' she warmed an audience's
collective heart, but she never wore her own heart on her sleeve,
avoiding the cul de sac of sentimentality. Instead she was wily in
performance, turning in an instant from comedy to poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Often she acted on stage with her husband, Paul Sparer _ in
everything from ``A Phoenix Too Frequent'' by Christopher Fry to
Edward Albee's ``Delicate Balance'' to Gurney's ``Love Letters.''
Sparer also had his own rewarding career in plays that included
Elie Wiesel's ``Zalmen, or the Madness of God'' and ``The Burnt
Flowerbed'' by Ugo Betti. Individually and to- gether they were
ultimate theatrical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Sparer died in November. In addition to her daughter Katie, an
actress who lives in Stratford, Marchand is survived by a son,
David of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Rachel Sparer Bersier, an
opera singer of New York City; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Marchand was the reverse of so many of her
strong-willed characters, a woman with a natural sense of
insecurity, someone who felt uneasy in social situations. ``I'm
always very uncomfortable with people.''she once explained in an
interview in The New York Times. ``It's something that I get upset
with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And
when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe.
There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't
use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can
experience and share when I'm on a stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Her roles, she said, were more a question of chance than choice.
But whatever she was called on to do, even if it meant being as
malevolent as Livia Soprano, she did it with enthusiasm. As always,
she was captivated by her profession. Looking back on her career,
she said, ``Acting was something I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand was born in Buffalo, N.Y., on June 19, 1928.
After studying theater at Carnegie Institute of Technology in
Pittsburgh, she made her first professional appearance on stage in
1946 in ``The Late George Apley'' in Ogunquit, Maine. It was while
acting in Shakespeare and Shaw at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge,
Mass., that she met _ and then married _ Sparer. When they moved to
New York, she appeared on live television, playing Jo in a
dramatization of ``Little Women,'' and then playing the female lead
opposite Rod Steiger in the original television version of Paddy
Chayefsky's ``Marty.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, she made her Broadway debut in ``Miss Isobel,'' and two
years later won an Obie award for her role as Madame Irma in the
Off Broadway premiere of Genet's ``The Balcony.'' For several years
she played leading Shakespearean roles with the American
Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. As an original member of
the APA theater company (formally the Association of Producting
Artists), she was Lady Sneerwell in ``The School for Scandal,''
Arkadina in ``The Seagull,'' Dona Ana in ``Man and Superman'' and
other classic characters.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing her devotion to repertory theater, she joined the
theater at Lincoln Center to act in plays by Schiller (Queen
Elizabeth in ``Mary Stuart''), Gorky and Sean O'Casey (``The Plough
and the Stars'' with Jack MacGowran).
</P>
<P>
   Marchand worked with equal ease on Broadway, Off Broadway and in
regional theater, as well as in movies and on television. In the
1980s she played the title role in Christopher Durang's ``Sister
Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' Bessie Berger in Clifford
Odets' ``Awake and Sing'' at Circle in the Square, Klytemnestra in
Ezra Pound's ``Elektra'' and the august mother in ``The Cocktail
Hour'' by Gurney.
</P>
<P>
   In the following decade, she moved on to Jon Robin Baitz's ``End
of the Day'' at Playwrights Horizons, and, in 1993, acted in a
double header of Peter Shaffer plays, ``Black Comedy'' and ``White
Liars'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. That same year she also
played the wicked stepmother in a revival of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Cinderella'' at the New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Her movie appearances included ``The Hospital,'' two films with
the team of Merchant Ivory, ``The Bostonians'' and ``Jefferson in
Paris,'' and the remake of ``Sabrina,'' in which she played
Harrison Ford's mother. When she played Mrs. Pynchon, the publisher
of The Los Angeles Tribune on ``Lou Grant,'' the role became a
keystone of her career; she won four Emmy awards for the role. Some
years later on television's ``Spearfield's Daughter,'' she switched
cities and became the publisher of The New York Courier.

</P>
<P>
   When Marchand played Livia Soprano on ``The Sopranos,''
television viewers wondered how her son, Tony, played by James
Gandolfini, and his wife (Edie Falco) could put up with her malice
and her prejudices. The answer, of course, was that there was
nothing much they could do against this self-dramatizing force of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show's first season, Tony was about to smother
his mother with a pillow, but a stroke got there first and she was
left gasping for breath in a hospital bed. David Chase, the creator
of the Home Box Office series, said Monday that he had always
planned to bring Livia back for a second year. He added that he was
impressed by Marchand's courage as she continued to perform despite
her illness.
</P>
<P>
   When that season ended, Marchand said she was looking forward to
the second round: ``Who knows what lurks in the mind of Livia?''
Viewers soon found out: more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   During the last show of the second season, there was a sudden
twist in the narrative. Tony gave his mother airline tickets so
that she and his aunt could fly to Arizona. Before she could get on
the plane, Livia was stopped by men from airport security. The
tickets were stolen property. Frantically, she telephoned her son.
</P>
<P>
   Because filming on the third season of ``Sopranos'' is not
scheduled to begin until Aug. 1, that scene represents Marchand's
final performance: about to be arrested and furious at Tony for
putting her in that predicament. Chase would not discuss
forthcoming events in the series, but if the actress had lived,
undoubtedly the mother and son battle would have continued and
Livia Soprano would have had the last word.

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seagram Co., the spirits and entertainment company that includes
legendary names like Absolut Vodka, Chivas Regal, Universal Studios
and Polygram Records, will announce on Tuesday that it has agreed
to be acquired for about $34 billion in stock by Vivendi SA, a
French water utility that is transforming itself into a
telecommunications and entertainment giant.
</P>
<P>
   The sale amounts to one of the largest media deals ever and ends
the Bronfman family's control over Seagram, which Samuel Bronfman
took over in 1928. It has remained one of the nation's most
powerful liquor companies even as Edgar Bronfman Jr., a grandson of
Samuel Bronfman, began remaking the company into a media player in
1995, by first acquiring MCA, parent of Universal Pictures, which
produced American icons like ``E.T.'' and ``The Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's six major film studios, Universal also owns
a television production company, theme parks and a music business.
Just last year, Bronfman expanded Seagram's holdings by buying
Polygram, making Seagram the nation's largest record company in
terms of sales. That purchase reflected Bronfman's conviction that
music was a growth business.
</P>
<P>
   In the new company, which will be called Vivendi-Universal and
be based in Paris, Bronfman will become vice-chairman, with the
music and Internet businesses reporting to him. Vivendi executives
do not see the liquor business as part of the company's future and
plans to sell all of it, or at least a stake in it.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi hopes to leverage Seagram's library of films and music
by distributing it over its mobile telephone network in France, as
well as through its ambitious pan-European Internet portal, called
Vizzavi, and pay-television company, Canal Plus, of which it owns
49 percent and which it now plans to buy outright.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a bet by both Vivendi and Seagram that by combining
popular content with a powerful distribution system, especially the
next generation of wireless Internet services in Europe, it can
create a company worth more combined than by working separately.
</P>
<P>
   However, there were some skeptics on Monday who felt that
Vivendi was unlikely to cull great benefits in merging. One analyst
who requested anonymity said that while Canal Plus was getting use
of the Universal Pictures film library to fill its programming
needs and Vivendi believed it could download music digitally via
cell phones, ``Maybe you are accelerating that synergy, but I think
it is a small niche,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a major payoff is at least several years away.
</P>
<P>
   The deal needs approval from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi's purchase would mean that two major film studios are
now under foreign ownership. Sony bought Columbia Pictures
Industries in 1989. Matsushita Electrical Industrial acquired MCA
in 1990, owning it for five years, but sold it to Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a series of aggressive media mergers
that have seen the entertainment world consolidate into a handful
of major entities. The first wave, which began in the 1980s,
included mergers of movie and television production with companies
that could distribute their programs on hardware or cable or TV _
Sony and Columbia, Time and Warner, Viacom and Paramount, and then
CBS, and Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC. Seagram's purchase
of MCA was unusual because Seagram was not a media company, though
it believed it brought international marketing expertise to MCA.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave of deals has included AOL's pending purchase of
Time-Warner, in which technology companies have begun seeking to
own ``content'' providers such as major film companies.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi's deal fits more directly in that category. Somewhat
like Seagram under the control of Edgar Bronfman, Vivendi has
developed under the leadership of Jean-Marie Messier, the French
company's chairman, into a holding company of sorts with a
hodgepodge of old-and new-economy businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While Vivendi very much remains a water distribution, waste
management and construction company _ more than half of its $40
billion in revenue come from those divisions _ Messier has been
steadily building an impressive stable of telecommunication and
entertainment properties.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi now owns a 24.5 percent stake in the satellite
television business, British Sky Broadcasting PLC, which is
controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. It owns 59 percent of
Cegetel, which operates SFR, the second largest wireless telephone
network in France. Messier, also acquired Havas, the publishing and
advertising company, and last year increased Vivendi's stake in
Canal Plus by 15 percent, to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Messier's most important deal to date was a move in
February to create an Internet portal with Vodafone Airtouch PLC,
the world's largest wireless telephone operator. That deal sealed
the fate of Vodafone's record $183 billion hostile bid for
Mannesmann and gave Messier an important ally in expanding his
wireless operations, which so far remain mostly in France.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the merger of Seagram and Vivendi would create a
company with a combined revenue of $65 billion, though the sale of
the liquor business and Vivendi's water business, which includes
U.S. Filter, would reduce that holding and trim the company into a
purer media business.

LAWYERS SAY NEXTEL EMPLOYEES PLAN 302 DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the broadest recent attacks on employment practices in
the telecommunications industry, more than 300 current and former
employees of Nextel Communications Inc., a fast-growing wireless
communications carrier, intend to file complaints of racial and
sexual discrimination at the company, the employees' lawyers said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that they intend to file 25 complaints on
Tuesday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against
Nextel on behalf of workers in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, New
Jersey, Ohio and Tennessee. Later this week, the lawyers said they
intend to file 25 additional complaints representing employees in
states including Alabama, California, Florida and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said they intend to file 50 additional complaints
each week until all 302 complaints have been submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel, based in Reston, Va., is one of the fastest-growing
wireless communications providers in the nation. Financed largely
by Motorola Inc. and Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone
pioneer, Nextel now serves more than 5.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   As they file the complaints with the employment commission, the
workers' lawyers said they intend to ask the commission's
permission to file lawsuits against the company in federal court
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lawyers, who
say they have worked with the Nextel workers for nine months, said
they intended to seek class-action status for the lawsuit and said
they intended to seek millions of dollars in damages. The lawyers
also said they intended to ask that Nextel, which has a market
value of $51 billion, be required to make a multibillion dollar
commitment to sensitivity training and diversity in hiring and
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we have not received any official complaints,
and when we do receive any such official complaint, we will
certainly investigate and respond appropriately,'' said Randall
Harris, Nextel's senior vice president for human resources,
speaking in a telephone interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the 25 complaints to be filed Tuesday were provided to
The New York Times on Monday by the workers' law firm, Leeds
Morelli &AMP; Brown, based in New York City. The law firm also provided
a list of 302 current and former Nextel employees that the firm
said intend to file complaints. Jeffrey Brown, a partner at the
firm, said Monday that he was willing to provide copies of the
complaints to Nextel on request before the complaints were filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nextel is one of the largest telecommunications companies in
the world and they are trying to promote an image of diversity when
the facts are that within the corridors of Nextel, minority
employees are harassed and mistreated solely on the basis of their
race,'' Brown said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that his firm contacted Nextel in March. In April, he
provided the company with details of some workers' complaints and
also met with Nextel lawyers in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very slow,'' Brown said. ``In my opinion they did
not take this seriously, nor do they believe they have a problem on
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 complaints to be filed Tuesday, 24 claim racial
discrimination and six claim sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the employees prepared to file complaints are black.
According to the complaints, they were routinely treated unfairly
and many said they were passed over for pay raises or promotions,
sometimes in favor of less-experienced or less-capable white
workers. Some minority workers said they were made to do more than
other employees of similar experience.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the complaints, the workers said they were made to
feel uncomfortable by derogatory comments made by supervisors or
fellow workers. In his complaint, one black worker said that when
he arrived for a job in Atlanta, he received harassing calls from
other Nextel employees in which he was repeatedly addressed with a
racial epithet. The same employee said that he was punished
professionally for not responding positively to the sexual
overtures of a white female supervisor, and also overheard comments
that implied that his employment was sufficient to fill a racial
quota.
</P>
<P>
   In his complaint, an employee in Colorado said that a white
``team leader'' suggested that he call himself ``darkey'' when his
office had a ``theme day.'' A Hispanic worker in Colorado said he
was called ``gang banger'' and ``thug,'' in addition to other
epithets. A black salesman in Tennessee said that his manager said,
``Blacks and women have no business in the workplace,'' and denied
a request for a transfer to a more affluent area because ``they
don't like black people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Filing with the employment commission is a necessary first step
in most workplace racial and sexual harassment proceedings. The
commission rarely takes cases to court itself. Last year, it
received 77,444 complaints and filed 465 suits against employers.
But after filing a complaint, a worker can petition the commission
for permission to sue independently.

   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.

apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by a far

FEDERAL LAW ON HATE CRIMES IS SCHEDULED FOR VOTE IN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators of both parties condemned crimes based on
race, gender or sexual orientation as a dishonor to the nation
Monday in an emotional prelude to a vote scheduled for Tuesday on
creating a federal hate crimes statute.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., confident of passing the
legislation, called offenses like the killings of James Byrd Jr.
and Matthew Shepard ``modern-day lynchings that can easily
terrorize whole communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the bill's chief sponsor, called it the necessary next
step in civil rights legislation, representing ``a continuum of
this nation attempting to define what this nation ought to be, that
is a nation that is going to be free from discrimination, hatred
and bigotry.'' The bill would allow the federal government to
prosecute crimes motivated by race, gender and sexual orientation
that are now outside its reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, the bill's leading Republican
backer, pointedly addressed conservative Christians. He said they
had told him they feared that any legislation favorable to gays
threatened the American family. To answer that, he quoted from
Scripture the story of the woman who had committed adultery, when
Jesus said, ``He that is without sin among you, let him cast the
first stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said, ``Adultery is a far greater threat to the American
family than homosexuality,'' and if an adulterer could be forgiven
by Jesus, ``it is time to say to the gay community, `We don't agree
with you on everything, but I can help you on many things.'''
</P>
<P>
   The only opposition to the Kennedy-Smith bill came from Sen.
Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Judiciary Committee. He said
no one had shown that federal intervention was necessary and that
the Supreme Court's recent decisions on federalism foreshadowed a
ruling that Congress had no business making federal crimes of what
were basically state offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he believed that ``hate-related violence is to be
abhorred.'' He added, ``Nobody can deny that hate crimes are
occurring. I want to get rid of them as much as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he might eventually be persuaded that a new federal
crime law was needed. But he said all the Senate should do was to
demand a report on the effectiveness of existing law enforcement
efforts on hate crimes and to provide grants to states to help them
with such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy-Smith bill would also provide grants to states to
help pay for prosecutions. But its major provision would be to
create a federal offense of crimes involving bodily injury based on
race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation
or disability. Kennedy stressed that the federal government would
act only if states approved, or if they failed to pursue a case.
</P>
<P>
   Existing federal law deals only with crimes based on race,
religion and national origin, and only in cases where the victims
had been seeking to exercise a federally protected right. Those
include school enrollment, jury service, traveling in interstate
commerce and using a place of public accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Senate adopts the measure, a direct vote on it in
the House is no more than a remote possibility, because of
Republican opposition. But strong White House support could force
House leaders to accept it in the wrap-up legislation needed to end
the session and let lawmakers go home to campaign for election.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was a gay 21-year-old student who was beaten to death in
Laramie, Wyo., in October 1998. Earlier that year, Byrd, a
49-year-old black man, was dragged to his death in Japser, Texas.
The killers in both cases were convicted, but proponents of the
Kennedy-Smith proposal said the bill would have made it easier to
prosecute them and avoided financial burdens on local law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that a new law was needed, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
cited not only the Shepard and Byrd killings, but also a series of
attacks on gay men in Michigan. In those cases, he said, the
prosecutions would have been stronger if the federal government had
been involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one united voice,'' Levin said, ``we must not only condemn
these acts of violence that terrorize Americans every day, we must
act against them. America's agenda will remain unfinished so long
as incidents like these occur regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said the present law was ``way too
narrow'' and hate crimes were the equivalent of terrorism against a
group or community.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said that for that reason,
``crimes motivated by hate are especially harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., said the Hatch argument was all
too familiar. ``It's not a federal issue,'' he said, was the attack
made on legislation to protect the rights of blacks, women and the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch complained that supporters of the legislation were just
``making political points here on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was also supported by three more Democrats, Sens. Jack
Reed of Rhode Island, John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Harry Reid of
Nevada, the Democratic whip, who said, ``People should not be
killed because they are different.''

OFFICERS' TALES OF NEW YORK ARE IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it Cop Lit.
</P>
<P>
   The annals of police writers include novelists like Joseph
Wambaugh, whistle-blowers like Frank Serpico and the unheralded
officers who contribute tales to true crime anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch the definition a bit, and you can add the consultants to
reality-laden police shows like ``NYPD Blue.'' There is even a
policeman with a nationally syndicated weekly radio segment.
</P>
<P>
   Now number among the writing ranks Lucas Miller, a New York City
police detective and former narcotics undercover officer. In a sign
of the times, he writes a column for an Internet publication, Slate
magazine (www.slate.com).
</P>
<P>
   In sometimes wry and sometimes elegaic tones, Miller has
chronicled station house reaction to the acquittal of police
officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo and to the seizing of
Elian Gonzalez. He has given an account of a strangely peaceful
night on patrol in Times Square during last New Year's Eve. He has
written, self-deprecatingly, about an off-duty encounter with
marijuana, about accidentally spraying Mace in the eyes of two
fellow detectives and about finding his car towed while on a date.
</P>
<P>
   His column, which recently acquired the rubric ``Flatfoot,'' has
appeared an average of once a month since the beginning of the
year. Though Slate does not release figures for the number of hits
per article, editors say ``Flatfoot'' is one of the more popular
features.
</P>
<P>
   The column is yet another example of the allure of New York
police stories, a mystique primed by television shows from
``Kojak'' to ``Law and Order'' and countless movies and books.
These days, the genre is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the force, Edward W. Conlon, writes about an
officer's life under the pseudonym Marcus Laffey for The New
Yorker. A somewhat less topical, more lyrical version of Miller,
Conlon is working on a hotly auctioned book about his experiences,
to be published by Riverhead Books.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year veteran of the force, Richard Rosenthal, is coming out
in August with ``Rookie Cop: Deep Undercover in the Jewish Defense
League,'' a memoir of his penetration of the radical group in the
early 1970s. Rosenthal, who retired from the New York department,
is now chief of police in Wellfleet, Mass., on Cape Cod, where he
hired Miller as a part-time officer in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are far more officers out there who have wonderful
stories, who just don't have the facility to put them on paper,''
said Rosenthal, who has written two other police insider books and
a novel. ``We see a section of society that very few people get to
see,'' and can deliver a ``vicarious thrill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police are not the only municipal workers with itchy
keyboard fingers. Dennis Smith won acclaim for ``Report From Engine
Co. 82,'' an account of his days as a firefighter in the South
Bronx. First published in 1972, the book was reissued by Warner
Books last year.
</P>
<P>
   For those who ponder the genre, it is the muse of New York City
itself that generates the most fascination among readers. New York
resides firmly in the American consciousness, whether as Sin City,
Fun City and now, after a major drop in crime, Safe City. Who can
resist it?
</P>
<P>
   Like no other place, this cauldron of race, class, evil, money
and spectacle inspires peace officers to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a richness in New York, such a diversity of
people, of experiences,'' said Eli Silverman, a professor of police
studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``The ordinary
experiences far outweigh what one's imagination can conceive. Each
story is more and more incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal agrees. ``You wonder why New York City cops can write
about the stuff?'' he asked. ``It's because we see the stuff.
People hacked into pieces, babies thrown into ovens, the most
bizarre human interactions you can imagine are relatively
commonplace to a police officer working in a high-crime precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Such taxpayer-financed life experience by city workers can prove
lucrative. Conlon received a reported advance of $995,000 for his
book.
</P>
<P>
   While Cop Lit is nothing new in New York, these are interesting
times for writerly members of the department, and Miller
acknowledges he is courting the possibility of official discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The department has come under sharp criticism in the past
several years for cases like the Diallo shooting, in which white
police officers killed an unarmed black man. Other such cases
include the torture of Abner Louima in a station house and the
fatal shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond by plainclothes officers.
These much-publicized incidents have formed a wedge between many
New Yorkers and the department and made rank-and-file officers and
commanders more sensitive to publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the department a place where attention-getters flourish.
Its previous commissioner, William Bratton, loved the limelight and
found himself forced out of a job by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
High-profile members, like the now-retired detective, Bo Dietl,
whose 1988 autobiography was called ``One Tough Cop,'' are not
always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Miller's current boss, Commissioner Howard
Safir, has shopped his own book about life in law enforcement.
Bratton, who wrote his own book with Peter Knobler called
``Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic,''
joined the now-faltering crime Web site APBnews.com as a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Miller said he had raised no eyebrows in the
department with his Slate columns. He said he received the standard
approval needed for an officer to work off duty and did not clear
his columns beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my commanders and supervisors I've talked to about my
writing have been solicitous about my opinions, my writing,'' he
said. But then, he concedes, few officers probably read Slate. One
of his close colleagues did not know about the column.
</P>
<P>
   Conlon, 36, who declined to be interviewed for this article,
early on chose to write under a pseudonym mainly to avoid alerting
his fellow officers that he was writing about them and thus change
the flow of his stories, said his editor, Christopher Knutsen.
Avoiding official repercussions may have been a reason, too,
Knutsen allows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, the line is tough to straddle. He says he is no
apologist or spokesman for his employer but he does not want to be
considered a critic of a force he says he loves. He says he wants
to enlighten readers, but ``obviously I'm under constraints as to
what I can write about.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he would never jeopardize an investigation, invade the
privacy of fellow officers or release sensitive information. Nor,
he says, will he air the department's dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's balancing act is seen in his Diallo piece, posted on
Feb. 26. He wrote of the sadness his fellow officers felt at the
way the system failed Diallo, their relief at the acquittal, their
identification with the officers who used their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every cop in my office today was aware that it is going to
take a long time, a lot of sweat, and probably some blood to deal
with what they have done,'' he wrote to finish the column.
</P>
<P>
   In his marijuana piece, he wrote about a home delivery of the
drug to his girlfriend's roommate while he was in the house. Some
officers favor strict enforcement of anti-drug laws when it comes
to marijuana, he said. Others are embarrassed about cracking down
on marijuana users.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are those, like myself, who see the virtue of
enforcing quality of life laws but can't help but feel bad putting
a guy in handcuffs for smoking pot,'' Detective Miller wrote. He
would not be making any arrests on that off-duty evening. ``But nor
could I sit idle while Roommate toked up,'' he said, ending the
article this way: ``I found myself hitting the redial button on
their phone pad, trying to get the number of the delivery
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 33, was born on the Upper West Side and grew up in SoHo,
where he lives now. His father taught English at Brooklyn College
and his mother is a painter. He majored in English at Wesleyan
University after being rejected from a creative writing program at
the university but was kicked out in his senior year for academic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was sworn in in 1990, rose quickly while working
undercover in narcotics and made detective in 1996. He is on the
staff of the commander of the narcotics division for the Manhattan
South command.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Slate's attention after sending an e-mail comment on
a columnist's harsh remark about the Diallo case. After an exchange
of messages, he was invited to contribute a so-called Slate diary,
in which people write about daily experiences. A Slate editor, Jodi
Kantor, suggested the column after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's humane and intelligent and funny and clearly doing his
job for the best of the best of reasons,'' Kantor said.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller sometimes seems to float between two worlds _ one
of words, the other of police work _ his heart lies firmly in his
day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to believe people are reading my stuff because I'm a
decent writer, not because it says I'm a cop,'' he said.
``Hopefully, it's both.''
</P>
<P>
   But writing, for now, cannot replace policing, he said, adding,
``It's my first and only real love as a profession.''

YOUNG ARMS AIDING ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was under the direction of former Anaheim
Angels scouting director Bob Fontaine that the club drafted
pitchers Jarrod Washburn, Brian Cooper and Seth Etherton. But it is
the current regime that is having its season saved by the three
young starters.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries to Ken Hill, Tim Belcher, Kent Bottenfield, Jason
Dickson and Kent Mercker, the Angels have had no choice but to dip
into their farm system for help, and they found it.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn was called up first, on May 10, and is 2-1 with a 3.92
ERA in seven starts. Cooper came next, on May 23, and is 2-2 with a
3.18 ERA in five starts. And finally Etherton, called up on May 26,
is 2-1 with a 5.20 ERA in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they are 6-4 with a 4.02 ERA in 17 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have been sensational,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``You look at the contribution they've made, in the tough
situation we're in, and it's one of the big reasons we're as close
to the top as we are. The kids have been very, very solid the last
two, three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher has returned to the rotation, and Bottenfield's expected
return Saturday will fill out the rotation to five. Hill and
Dickson are both working toward returning in the next couple of
weeks, and that's when Scioscia and his staff will have some
decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia recently joked about going to a seven-man rotation, but
obviously that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard for a long time about having too many starters for
one position being a good problem to have,'' Scioscia said. ``But
it's not easy to tell a guy who's doing his job, `I can only pick
five and this is who we're going with.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility would be for Dickson to go to the bullpen when
he is ready. But Scioscia will not do that with Hill, meaning at
least one of the three will go. Of course, that is barring more
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton, Cooper and Washburn all realize their situation but
say it doesn't affect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about anything like that,'' Etherton said. ``I
have no control over that. All I can do is get outs and help our
team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Bottenfield will throw a simulated game today, and
if all goes well he'll start Saturday against the Twins. He threw
80 pitches during a bullpen workout last Saturday. ... Tim Salmon
is hitting .339 in June to raise his season average to .290.
However, he's hitting just .200 (11 for 55) with runners in scoring
position for the season. ... Mo Vaughn and Troy Glaus are the only
Angels to play in all 68 games. They also are the only 20-homer duo
on the same team in the American League.

   (NYT22) PADUCAH, Ky. -- June 19, 2000 -- NUKE-ENRICHMENT -- Ever
since Richard Nixon proposed it in 1968, policy makers have talked
about having the federal government quit the business of enriching
uranium for nuclear power plants. It took decades but the Clinton
administraiton finally pulled it off two years ago, with Vice
President Al Gore claiming it as a victory for reinventing
government. But it may have come at the worst possible time.

Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled at
playing wise and imperious authority figures _ newspaper
publishers, queens and mesdames _ and who achieved perhaps her
greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss in the
television series ``The Sopranos,'' died on Sunday at her home in

expansion but strikingly different economic positions, the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Foundation, which includes the Guggenheim Museum,

SCI-ELEPHANTS-REPEL -- Dr. Ferrel Loki Osborn loves elephants. But
he also loves the villagers of the Zambezi River Valley in northern
Zimbabwe, whose fields of corn, cotton, and banana crops have long
tempted elephants looking for a convenient midnight snack. Isborn
has devised a multi-pronged array of repellants, some of which
rural farmers can concoct themselves, all using capsaicin, the
chemical that puts the heat in hot peppers. Elephants in Zimbabwe
climb over an electric fence to get at crops. (Courtesy of Ferrel

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which abruptly
canceled a Coco Chanel retrospective last month, has decided on a
replacement for its grand, annual exhibition: the White House
fashions of Jacqueline Kennedy. The show, along with its opening
night gala to benefit the Met's Costume Institute, has been pushed
back from December to spring 2001, and so for the first time in 51
years the splashy fund-raiser sometimes known as ``the party of the
year'' will take place not during the winter social season, but
amid the spring one, on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Met backed out of a Chanel show last month after Karl
Lagerfeld, the label's designer, and Met officials disagreed over
how expansive Lagerfeld's role as curator would be. It had been
Lagerfeld's ambition to show the work of artists like Jenny Holzer
alongside the legendary suits and cocktail dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years'' is unlikely to
spark any similarly unconventional bursts of inspiration among
those who assemble it. Fashion insiders said they thought the
choice was a crowd-pleasing, humdrum one.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will focus on what Kennedy referred to as her
state clothes, including the fawn coat and pillbox hat she wore for
President John F. Kennedy's inauguration on Jan. 20, 1961; the
Givenchy coat and dress she wore on an official visit to
Versailles, France; and outfits for a visit to India and Pakistan.
The 80 pieces will come from the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum
in Boston. The curator, Hamish Bowles, who is Vogue's European
editor at large, has been spending his recent days there.
</P>
<P>
   The Library has 65 to 70 outfits. Nearly all will be in the
exhibition, said Bowles, a collector and connoisseur of vintage
couture. He will cull the additional items from the archive's
stable of Kennedy's accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, director of communications at the Met, said it
was not the sudden change of program that caused the show to be
rescheduled. Nor is it the need to replace Chanel's promised $1.5
million in underwriting for the show and gala. ``Money is not the
issue,'' Holzer said. ``It's when we could do it in terms of
getting out a catalog concurrent with the show.'' The show will be
held not in the underground Costume Institute but upstairs in the
museum's Cantor Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   When rumors of a Kennedy show began a few weeks ago, a
representative from Courreges, a favorite label of Kennedy, called
the Met to discuss possible sponsorship. So far, the call has not
been answered, the representative said. Holzer said, ``The Met's
first priority was cementing an agreement for the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Met named the fashion historian Harold Koda as
the head of its Costume Institute, replacing Richard Martin, who
died last year. Koda is unable to work on the Kennedy show right
away, however, because he is assembling an exhibition of Giorgio
Armani's work for the Guggenheim Museum in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   A show devoted to Kennedy's White House style had been discussed
at the Met for some time. ``This is something the museum had been
hoping to do for a good number of years,'' Holzer said. ``It is not
a light bulb that went off two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar show had been planned by the Corcoran Gallery in
Washington but was scotched, a representative of the Corcoran said,
when the Kennedy family said that it would prefer such an
exhibition to take place at the Met, an institution with which
Kennedy enjoyed strong ties. Her daughter, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, will be honorary chairwoman of the gala.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the fashion world were disappointed at the Met's
decision to honor a style on which few who have ever picked up a
copy of Vogue need further schooling. ``Clearly it sounds like a
big commercial thing,'' said Lisa Eisner, the stylist and vintage
collector. ``Don't Elvis and Marilyn sell as much as Jackie?'' she
asked. ``Why don't they just do all three?''
</P>
<P>
   Marin Hopper, the fashion director of Elle magazine, said, ``It
will be interesting to see what will be brought to a theme and
style that's been very played out over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valerie Steele, curator of the Museum at the Fashion
Institute of Technology said she had few issues with a show
highlighting Kennedy's look. ``I don't have a problem with the
concept,'' she explained. ``Maybe it's not the most scholarly show
in the world, but her fashion was covered in headlines. In fashion,
we tend to focus on the influence of designers. But trendsetters
have just as much impact on history.''

REPUBLICAN PLATFORM SESSION FOCUSES ON THE MODERATE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Aiming directly at the voters in the center,
Republicans turned their first official platform meeting Monday
into a showcase for the party's ideas on education, Medicare and
Social Security. Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, the platform
committee chairman, said panel would produce a ``very fresh, very
visionary'' platform that would seal its reputation as the
reform-oriented party of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But away from the harmony on stage, the party's ideological
fault lines on abortion were apparent. Anti-abortion advocates had
a news conference outside the meeting hall in which they called on
party leaders to live up to their promises and retain the party's
strong anti-abortion plank; several of the activists said they were
confident the party would do so. The anti-abortion activists also
urged Gov. George W. Bush, the expected nominee, to name a
running-mate who opposes abortion. ``If Governor Bush selects a
pro-choice running mate, it will be a very serious strategic
mistake,'' said Peggy Lehner, president of Dayton Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and the chairman of the Republican National Committee,
Jim Nicholson, reiterated to reporters that they did not expect the
platform's language on abortion to change, in accord with Bush's
wishes. The platform calls for an end to legalized abortion and the
appointment of judges who respect ``the sanctity of innocent human
life.'' Republicans who support abortion rights are struggling,
once again, to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, citing Bush's deep popularity in the party and his
ability to unify Republicans, said that he did not expect a fight
over abortion on the floor of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, one of the major themes of the day was the need
for change and fresh ideas. Thompson said he expected extensive
revisions to the platform to deal with rapidly changing issues from
e-commerce to bio-tech to women's health and to reflect the focus
of the Bush campaign on issues like education.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thompson said he did not expect the party to call
for the abolition of the Department of Education, one of several
federal agencies that the 1996 Republican platform, a deeply
conservative document, wanted to dismantle. He also said he
expected the platform to ``change somewhat'' on immigration,
another area where the party staked out conserverative terrain four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting, in a state that generally plays a pivotal role
in presidential elections, was a careful selection of panel
discussions that highlighted parents and principals, health care
experts and pension analysts, and a collection of citizens from
Dayton itself. Republican officials heard from a Milwaukee mother,
Pilar Gomez, who talked of her ``empowering'' experiences with that
city's ``Parental Choice Program,'' that enabled her to use
publicly-funded vouchers to send her children to private school.
``Quality education,'' she said, ``that should be a right, not a
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also heard from officials in Arizona, Florida, Ohio
and Pennsylvania, and their efforts to inject more flexibility and
accountability into public schools. ``Our party rejects the notion
that the Creator placed talent in children based on their skin
color or their wealth,'' said Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's
superintendent of public instruction. The Republican leaders also
highlighted complaints about the burden of cumbersome federal
regulations on local educators trying to find what works.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also focused on the need to ``reform'' Social
Security and Medicare. Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, a co-chairman
of the platform committee, argued that Medicare was in profound
need of modernization, in part because of the inadequacy of its
benefit package, which lacks prescription drug coverage. But he
argued that adding that benefit must be part of ``overall reform of
the system,'' and the creation of a new health care marketplace to
allow private plans to compete with traditional Medicare for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people attended Monday's event, in Sinclair Community
College in downtown Dayton, and several of the most attentive were
from various ideological and interest groups. Donald Devine, of the
American Conservative Union, said he was monitoring the proceedings
as part of the group's ``committee for a conservative platform.''
From his conversations with the Bush campaign and others, he said
he believed the Republican platform would be conservative and
``pretty close'' to his group's desires.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Republicans for Choice and the Republican
Pro-Choice Coalition were also on hand, although Republican leaders
had declared that abortion would not be the subject of any public
hearings leading up to the convention. In a conciliatory gesture,
an aide to Thompson said Monday night that at the next platform
forum, Friday in Billings, Mont., one local representative from
each side of the abortion issue would be scheduled to speak.

WOODS AVOIDANCE OF COLONIAL A MATTER OF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger doesn't hate us. I'm convinced of that.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't avoid Fort Worth because he thinks we're all a bunch
of rednecks who eat too much red meat, burn crosses on folks' front
lawns and attend weekly Klan meetings.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that a few of those folks are a bit perturbed at all
the attention we've been paying to Tiger's incredible weekend at
the U.S. Open and have phoned to voice their opinions, mostly in
one-syllable, four-letter words.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the John Rockers of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They can lump it.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger stays out of Fort Worth for one reason and one reason
only, though you're not likely to ever hear him admit it.
</P>
<P>
   It's the golf course, dummy.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there was a time a few years ago when Woods became at
least mildly irritated with the folks out at Colonial. First, they
announced that he'd accepted an invitation to participate before he
was ready to make it official.
</P>
<P>
   You could hardly blame anyone for getting a little excited and
prematurely pulling the trigger on that little piece of news,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the infamous pre-Colonial practice round in 1997
with Fuzzy Zoeller after Fuzzy, always trying to be funny, made
those insensitive remarks about ham hocks and collard greens ``or
whatever you people eat'' weeks earlier at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger didn't like someone out at Colonial turning their little
makeup dance into a media circus either and the round never
actually came off.
</P>
<P>
   But those are mere minor irritants, probably long forgotten,
compared with Tiger's real problem with Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not the kind of course that brings out the best in his
game.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds a little strange right now, considering how he just
brought the vaunted U.S. Open to its knees, begging for mercy in
the fog and mist of Pebble Beach in what might well have been the
greatest individual performance in sports history, but that's it in
a nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is intelligent about the golf courses he chooses to play
and the golf course doesn't suit him,'' says Fort Worth's Clark
Dennis, who knows the Colonial layout as well as any professional
golfer today. ``He can play and dominate anywhere, but it's not the
kind of course he can overpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can come to Colonial and win, but it's harder for him to
play that course as opposed to, say, the Nelson, where he can just
bomb it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, currently playing on the Buy.com Tour (formerly the Nike
Tour), where he finished 12th Sunday in the Buy.com Cleveland Open,
isn't knocking Colonial and certainly means no insult to Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was as amazed by Woods' magnificent performance at the
Open as any of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is God-given, but he's also worked hard,'' Dennis
pointed out. ``He's been in the weight room \Rwhere he bench
presses 300 pounds\S. He was already good, but he knew he wanted to
win a U.S. Open and he changed his game. I imagine he makes a lot
of sacrifices in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as focused on that par putt on 16 as he was on any shot
in the tournament and he was standing there with a 15-shot lead. It
didn't matter what he was winning by. He is just totally focused on
what he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is, by far, the most dominant athlete in his sport in the
world. Sure, he could walk into Colonial on any given weekend and
lead wire-to-wire. But he's not as likely to lap the field there as
he is at any number of other courses in the country and he has
other reasons to forget Fort Worth as well.
</P>
<P>
   First, he plays a limited schedule anyway. He's only going to
play 15-18 tournaments a year. Four of those are the majors and
another couple are world championships. For the other dozen or so,
naturally he's going to be picky.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that little matter of a guaranteed million dollars
to show up and play in a tournament in Germany the same week as
Colonial. You think maybe he'd ignore a million bucks laying on the
ground like you and I might walk past a penny?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the so-called sponsorship conflict. He
represents American Express. The Colonial is sponsored by
MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the two together isn't likely to cause some sort of
nuclear reaction, bringing about the end of life as we know it, but
it serves as a semi-rational excuse. Who knows, maybe American
Express simply asked him not to play at Colonial while MasterCard
is the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's an inconsistently applied alibi. After all, the fact
that Woods also represents Buick hasn't kept him from playing in
tournaments sponsored by other automobile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   What we keep coming back to then is that staid old lady we call
Colonial, with her narrow tree-lined fairways and premier
shot-maker's layout. She can be a fickle, difficult date, sweet as
a fresh fried pie one day, capricious as the howling south wind on
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why else he wouldn't play here,'' Dennis says. ``
Maybe now that he's retooled his game and he's got that 2-iron shot
he can `punch' out there 250, and he's hitting his wedges great,
he'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time the dominant player of his era
returned to romance Colonial after a long absence. Jack Nicklaus
went six years between appearances here between 1975 and 1982, when
he returned and won the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Nicklaus was the Tiger of his day,'' Dennis said. ``He
stayed away for the same reason: For a while there, the course just
didn't suit his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is on our side. Tiger is only 24. One day he'll wake up
after sweet dreams of a lovely old course, lined with huge stately
oaks and with a wonderful tradition of great champions built around
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's course.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when he has conquered all there is to conquer, and
Colonial is still out there, beckoning like a Siren on the shore,
the allure will become too much, and he'll return, if only to meet
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He ``will'' come back. They always do.

RANGERS RELIEVERS CARRY TAG OF UNRELIABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates will walk
deliberately to the mound tonight and remove left-handed starter
Kenny Rogers from the game against the Minnesota Twins. Assuming,
of course, Rogers does not provide the Rangers with their second
complete game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Oates will motion toward his bullpen and summon a left- or
right-hander, depending on the score, the inning, the hitter and
the available alternatives on the bench for Twins manager Tom
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   What transpires next at The Ballpark in Arlington is anyone's
guess, which is one of the Rangers' problems in their swoon to the
bottom of the American League West, with 10 losses in 11 games to
fall 71/2 games behind first-place Oakland. Oates has no idea what
will happen when he calls for relief.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the bullpen being a reliable source of strength
remain a distant memory from 1999. The bullpen might preserve a
victory, but it's just as likely they'll get hit hard, as they did
in an 11-10 loss to Baltimore last week. Right-handers Jeff
Zimmerman and Tim Crabtree, left-hander Mike Venafro and closer
John Wetteland surrendered five runs on seven hits and blew a
four-run, eighth-inning lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Crabtree said. ``We're either all pitching well
or we're all in a funk. I've never seen anything like it. Usually,
there's at least somebody Johnny can go to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have already lost seven games when they've entered
the seventh inning with a lead, compared with nine such losses all
last season. The Rangers have also not fared well in games tied
after the sixth (1-4), seventh (2-5) and eighth (2-5) innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say this: Your championship teams tend to have very
solid 'pens,'' Wetteland said. ``As a whole this year, I don't
think we've done the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's earned-run average during the Rangers' 31
victories is 4.00. That figure swells to 7.45 in their 36 losses.
The bullpen's ERA during the team's 13 one-run victories _ not
including the 17-16 victory May 5 against Oakland _ is 4.03. It
skyrockets to 8.38 in their 15 one-run losses. The ERA is also a
tidy 3.18 during six two-run victories and 7.71 in their two
two-run losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were winning all those games \Rin May\S, our bullpen
was lights out,'' Oates said. ``That's how you win low-scoring,
one-run ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Rangers won the West a year ago. They were 24-16
in one-run games last year with a bullpen that went 30-16 with a
4.33 ERA and converted 47 of 66 save opportunities. The Rangers are
13-15 this season in one-run games with a bullpen that is 8-11 with
a 5.62 ERA and 16-for-28 in save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bullpen's struggles, general manager Doug Melvin is
not planning immediate changes. ``They're a talented enough group
of people,'' Melvin said. ``They just need to get it going and
pitch better.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses the idea of calling up right-hander Ryan Glynn or
left-hander Doug Davis from Triple-A Oklahoma to pitch out of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to bring up Ryan Glynn and have him sit around in
the bullpen for six weeks like Matt Perisho did,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation bears some responsibility for the bullpen's
struggles, too, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the starters don't take you deep enough into the game and
you have to use more than two pitchers out of the bullpen, somebody
is going to be off,'' Melvin said. ``You can't bring in four
relievers out of the bullpen and expect every one to pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate responsibility, though, lies with the bullpen to
turn its performance around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't give up the lead and expect our guys to come
back and score more runs,'' Crabtree said. ``When our bullpen is
going well, W's are put on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is hurt. Nobody is not feeling well. We've all got the
same stuff we had in May.''
</P>
<P>
   June continues to test their resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have many options,'' Oates said. ``We just need to
get one or two of them hot, and we'll be fine.''

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT AGREES TO REVIEW MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court stepped forcefully into the
Microsoft antitrust case Monday, dismissing a government argument
that it lacked jurisdiction and setting a fast-paced schedule for
reviewing Microsoft's request that the judges block a lower-court
order restricting its conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft applauded the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit, saying, ``Obviously, we are
pleased that the appeals court unanimously sided with Microsoft and
rejected the government's position.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will probably prove to be a Pyrrhic victory. The last
paragraph of the two-page order says that if the trial judge asks
the Supreme Court to take the case directly, ``this briefing
schedule will be automatically suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   That request could come as soon as Tuesday, and as a result the
government also proclaimed victory. ``We are very pleased with the
court's ruling that it would stay further proceedings if the
district court certifies the case for direct appeal to the Supreme
Court,'' said Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general are trying
to send the case directly to the Supreme Court under a little-used
law known as the Expediting Act. It allows the direct appeal of
significant federal antitrust cases. Microsoft Corp. wants its
appeal heard in the Court of Appeals, which has sided with the
company in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly last week, before the judge could send the case
to the Supreme Court, Microsoft tried to outmaneuver the government
by asking the Court of Appeals to consider its request to stay the
judge's order. And the Court of Appeals showed that it was eager to
take the case by declaring that the entire court, not a three-judge
panel, would hear the stay request and larger appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction, the government argued in a brief that the Court of
Appeals does not have jurisdiction, on several grounds _ arguments
that the court dismissed Monday. The court set a schedule under
which Microsoft and the government will have only until July 6 to
file briefs on Microsoft's request to stay the court-ordered
remedy, unless the schedule is suspended.
</P>
<P>
   But the court order Monday also indicated another victory for
the government in the legal skirmishes that the two sides have
fought since U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his
order on June 7 breaking Microsoft in two and forcing the company
to abide by a long list of restrictions while the breakup is
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had argued, in a Court of Appeals brief last week,
that the Expediting Act does not apply to the states' lawsuit since
it applies only to federal cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department countered that since the suits were
tried together, and since only single rulings and remedies were
entered for the two suits, the appeals of both should be carried
together to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the appeals court indicated it agreed with the
government. The court's order says it will suspend consideration of
the appeal of the states' case, too, as soon as Jackson issues the
certification to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Microsoft filed with Jackson a brief setting out the
company's arguments against a direct appeal. High on the list of
objections was the argument about the states' case, even though
hours earlier the appeals court had indicated it did not accept
that argument.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also hit on the one argument that is most likely
to concern the Supreme Court justices, the need to read several
thousand pages of trial record in a direct appeal. Usually, the
Court of Appeals winnows that trial record for Supreme Court review
so the justices may only have to read summaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft promised that ``the sheer number of factual and
legal issues raised by Microsoft's appeals, as well as a range of
important procedural issues,'' make it ``completely unsuitable for
summary disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft noted that addressing all of the issues to be raised
in the appeal ``would require review of the 13,466-page trial
transcript and the 2,695 trial exhibits that compose the record in
these cases, a time-consuming exercise the Supreme Court would not
likely be anxious to undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also tried to argue that the case was not important
enough to warrant direct review, even though in a previous brief
Microsoft said the remedy imposed on the company ``could have a
significant adverse impact on the nation's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Microsoft quoted the text of the Expediting Act, which
said cases of ``general public importance'' to the ``administration
of justice'' are eligible for direct review. The company took that
language about the administration of justice literally and said
Microsoft's appeal would not impair the government's ``ongoing
enforcement responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the Court of Appeals statement last week that the case
was ``of exceptional importance,'' Microsoft said that view ``makes
it more important, not less, that the case proceed through
intermediate appellate review.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department may choose to file a reply to Microsoft's
brief on Tuesday. But it is also possible that Jackson will simply
issue the certification order on Tuesday. He has made it clear for
more than two months that he is eager to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court does not have to take the appeal, in which
case it would be sent back to the Court of Appeals. No one knows
whether the Supreme Court will decide quickly, since it is near the
end of the court's term _ or wait until its next term, which begins
in October.

CLINTON HINTS GOP FOILS JUDICIAL DIVERSITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
and GREG MCDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ President Clinton criticized Texas' two Republican
U.S. senators for delaying consideration of his El Paso nominee to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Moreno, a Harvard-educated El Paso lawyer with no
experience on the bench, was nominated by Clinton in September to
the New Orleans court.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, however, Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm
questioned Moreno's qualifications in a letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Moreno's confirmation process has stalled, and
Clinton, citing other examples involving his minority judicial
nominees, said Moreno's situation represents ``a distinctive
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for him to be denied, not because he is political but
because he is not political enough in the right way, is wrong,''
Clinton told about 40 attendees at a reception benefiting the
Southwest Voter Registration Education Project in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in Houston for a pair of fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who also visited Austin on Monday, was the featured
guest for two events at the downtown Four Seasons Hotel, including
the Southwest Voter reception and a lunch benefiting the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, attended by state Rep. Rick Noriega,
D-Houston; city Controller Sylvia Garcia; and City Council members
Carroll Robinson, Chris Bell and John Castillo, among others,
Clinton discussed Moreno and also his support of new hate crimes
legislation introduced Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the predominantly Hispanic crowd at the Southwest Voter
reception, each of whom paid a minimum of $500 to attend, to make
themselves heard on the Moreno nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in the other party who see the courts as an
instrument of partisan politics,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Moreno, Clinton cited Ricardo Morado, nominated
for the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas, and
Kathleen McCree-Lewis of Detroit, who would be the first black
woman to serve on the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals if confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Morado's nomination has been put on hold and
McCree-Lewis can't get a confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want them on the court, but they don't want the
people you're trying to register to vote to know they don't want
them on the court,'' Clinton said. ``The answer is to blur
everything ... and hope nobody will know what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moreno's case, the letter from Gramm and Hutchison noted that
the Texas Judicial Advisory Group, a nonpartisan group of Texas
attorneys that met in March, had voted 10-5 against the nomination.
Five other members of the advisory group said they could offer no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fair to summarize the views of those recommending
against confirmation that Mr. Moreno simply had not achieved the
level of experience necessary to be fully engaged and effective on
a court one notch below the United States Supreme Court,'' the
letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, 43, was nominated to replace Judge Will Garwood of
Austin, who left active status in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At a lunch with about 100 contributors to the DSCC, Clinton
rubbed shoulders with former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier and his wife,
Elyse; former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; lawyer David
Berg; and Bill White, one-time Texas Democratic Party chairman and
former deputy secretary of energy in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees paid a minimum of $1,000 each. The money raised at the
event is used to help elect Democrats to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch, Clinton noted the ethnic diversity represented in
the room, notably a strong contingent of South Asians, and called
it an example of Houston's growth and strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing of all, which is why I like looking
around at this crowd, is that we find a way to live together with
all of our differences, that we find a way not just to tolerate
them but to celebrate them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a handful of Muslims in traditional, loose-fitting
garments, Clinton said, ``We think they look very nice in their
garb, and they are probably more comfortable than we are in the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Clinton attended a fund-raiser at the home of his old
friend Roy Spence, an advertising executive and Democratic
activist.
</P>
<P>
   The president commented on the posh setting in the hills near
Austin, and suggested it was symbolic of the economic prosperity
during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Exhibit A for if you want to live like a Republican, you
should vote Democratic.'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Spence praised Clinton's tenure, saying, ``It's gone by too
fast. We are grateful for the contributions to this country. ... We
love you and we love what you have done for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The western swing band Asleep at the Wheel provided
entertainment at the gathering, and the 70 or so guests included
former Gov. Ann Richards, former Land Commissioner Garry Mauro,
former U.S. Rep. J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle, and U.S. Sen. Chuck Robb,
D-Va., son-in-law of the late President Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Robb, who is in a tight re-election campaign, will be one of the
beneficiaries of the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, Clinton attended a $10,000-per-couple event
hosted by Dell Computer executive Tom Meridith, whose home
overlooks the Colorado River in Austin. Among the guests were
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.; and Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of the event was creation of a committee within
the Democratic Party to focus on issues involving the emerging
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Lyle Lovett entertained at that event.

REGRETFULLY, CLINTON CONCEDES LAZIO IS NO GINGRICH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the space of a few days last week, in speeches and
television advertisements, Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed Rep.
Rick Lazio as a friend to the gun lobby, a foe of abortion rights,
and hostile to women, children and families, by virtue of some of
the votes he has cast in Congress. But there was one thing notably
missing from the first lady's broad and calculated barrage on her
new opponent in the race for the U.S. Senate: any mention of Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, was pushed to front
and center by the Clinton camp when Lazio entered the race a month
ago, as Clinton's senior advisers rushed to describe Lazio, a
Suffolk County Republican, as a ``foot soldier in the Gingrich
revolution.'' But Gingrich has now faded almost as quickly as he
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   That references to Gingrich have so suddenly vanished from the
Clinton campaign lexicon suggests an initial miscalculation by
Clinton and her advisers. Gingrich, it seems, is not the notorious
figure he was two years ago, even in New York, a realization
Clinton's aides said they reached quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps more significantly, it suggests the complications
Clinton faces in running against an opponent who, while not as
moderate as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is not quite the conservative
Clinton would like to face in this Democratic state. Even Clinton's
advisers now acknowledge that Lazio is no Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   When those advisers first sought to discredit Lazio by noting
his support for Gingrich's policies during his reign, the strategy
struck some Democrats and Republicans as curious. Gingrich had been
the Democrats' favorite Republican in the years after he was
identified with the shutdown of the federal government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 2000 round of congressional campaigns, with Gingrich
now back in private life, Democrats have largely concluded that
that line of attack does not have the potency it once had, which is
evident by the fact that his name has barely come up in any House
or Senate campaigns this year. Gingrich's successor _ that would be
J. Dennis Hastert, of course _ is neither as infamous nor as
polarizing as Gingrich once was, several Democrats acknowledged
wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fading,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of Gingrich's
role in the national campaign. ``It serves as an important
reference, but it's certainly fading.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scramble to adjust after Giuliani quit the New York race,
the initial belief in Clinton's camp was that the old Gingrich
script would work again, and that Gingrich remained an effective
target in a state that he often invoked as an example of Democratic
policies gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's senior advisers, Harold P. Ickes, attacked
Lazio in The New York Post for ``doing the work of Newt Gingrich''
_ a full day before Lazio had even announced his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in many ways, the mirror image of the Republican
strategy in the 1998 Senate race in New York, when, reprising an
old chestnut of a campaign tactic, they attacked Charles E.
Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat, as being ``too liberal'' for New
York. Schumer, of course, went on to defeat Alfonse D'Amato, the
three-term Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in doubt, go back to the old playbook,'' Hank Sheinkopf,
a Democratic consultant, said of Clinton's invocation of Gingrich.
``The problem is that the old playbook is not working. Gingrich is
old news. He's gone. He's off the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Gingrich is an unpopular figure in New York.
One out of two New Yorkers have an unfavorable opinion of him,
according to a New York Times/CBS News poll taken June 4 to June
10.
</P>
<P>
   But 36 percent were undecided or had no opinion at all,
suggesting that even Gingrich might be riding off into the
political sunset. Charles Cook, the editor of a Washington-based
political newsletter that tracks Congressional races, said that
while Gingrich was a ``metaphor for the excesses of '95 and '96,
that was four or five years ago. Republicans have been behaving on
most issues fairly carefully since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said they noted that their attempts to link
Lazio to Gingrich had led to eye rolling in the media as they tried
to make the case to reporters the weekend Lazio entered the race.
That anecdotal observation was subsequently confirmed in a poll by
Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's senior campaign strategist, Mike Murphy, said he noted
the change in strategy, though he was not surprised by it. ``It
backfired,'' Murphy said. ``And like so much of the Hillary Clinton
campaign, it could not pass the laugh test.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the political convenience of a Gingrich, Clinton has
been forced to pick and choose votes Lazio has cast over the last
seven years to emphasize the conservative edge of his ideological
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton noted that Lazio had opposed a Democratic
bill to protect consumers in dealing with health maintenance
organizations, had opposed a so-called hate crimes bill, and had
voted against a bill to provide federal financing for 100,000 new
teachers. ``By the time this race is over, there isn't going to be
anyone who doesn't know that Rick Lazio voted against the 100,000
teachers,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not been easy. When Clinton attacked Lazio for
opposing the registration of new guns and the licensing of gun
owners, Lazio countered by noting that he supports a ban on assault
weapons and voted for the Brady Bill, which imposes a waiting
period on handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton sought to present Lazio as an opponent of abortion
rights by noting his opposition to public financing for abortions
and support for a ban on the procedure that abortion foes describe
as partial-birth abortion, Lazio responded by noting his record of
opposing efforts to criminalize abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, is it any wonder that Democrats in New York
these days are speaking nostalgically about Gingrich as they
contemplate the race Clinton now faces? ``Gingrich was beautiful,''
said Sheinkopf, the Democratic consultant. ``He was larger than
life. He was extraordinarily vocal. He was a perfect foil for
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big loss for Democrats,'' he said.

MAYFIELD USES AN EARNHARDT TACTIC FOR BUMP-AND-RUN POCONO VICTORY  

</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ It was a classic Dale Earnhardt maneuver, the
kind that earned him the nickname Iron Head and, after 75 career
victories in the last two decades, the title of King of the Car
Fights. Stalk and harass. Drop to pass. Then bump and run.
</P>
<P>
   The difference Monday in the Pocono 500 was that the tactics
were turned on Iron Head by a young driver Earnhardt had long
treated as softhearted: Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-mile from the checkered flag, coming out of the
final turn, Mayfield dropped to the bottom of the track below
Earnhardt and kissed the bumper of Earnhardt's No. 3 car, which had
led for the previous 14 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Earnhardt's potential 76th victory was whiplashed as
Mayfield sneaked his No. 12 car inside for the third triumph of his
career, his second at the Pocono Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never tried to wreck him; I just wanted to rattle his
cage,'' said the 31-year-old Mayfield, who won the 500 here in
1998. ``I'm not sure I hit him. If there was contact, it wasn't
enough to turn him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt made it clear that there was indeed contact and that
he did not enjoy being on the receiving end of it. Beyond the
finish line, after his car wobbled enough to let Dale Jarrett and
Ricky Rudd pass for second and third place, Earnhardt pulled
alongside Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the most terse terms, the man also known as the Intimidator
said facetiously that Mayfield was No. 1. ``I got in a corner, got
rubbed a little and got beat,'' said Earnhardt, who was fourth.
``It was good racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's racing colleagues, however, were amused that the
young driver, whom Earnhardt bumped on the track during six years
together on the Nascar circuit and razzed often in the garage area,
had turned the tables. They gave Mayfield the thumbs-up as he made
his way to victory lane and chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Dale wouldn't have done that if he was behind him,''
Jarrett said with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who had positioned his No. 88 car in third place, had
the best view of the impending tussle. He was also ready to take
advantage of it. Jarrett noticed Mayfield gathering steam on the
second of the track's three turns at the same time Earnhardt was
losing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this might get interesting,'' said Jarrett, who is
third in the Winston Cup point standing behind Bobby Labonte and
Earnhardt. ``A lot of times when you get together and get the air
taken off the front of your car, like Jeremy did, a lot of times
that car will slide up, too. For that split second, I thought I
might have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett added: ``It means a lot to Jeremy. It shows he's a hard
racer. The best driver in this business, and he's been that for a
long time, is Dale Earnhardt. You go up against him and come out on
top. You've got to take advantage of those chances because more
times than not you're not going to come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield had to wait a day for his opportunity after persistent
rain and dense fog on Sunday postponed the race until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield had seven top-10 finishes in 15 races this season,
including a victory in the California 500. But he started in the
No. 22 position at 10 a.m. Monday under overcast skies with the
temperature at 65 degrees before a depleted crowd, as many people
had to get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   He led for three laps _ 23 to 26 _ but was not confident of a
top-10 finish after running 41st last week in Michigan. But
Mayfield was running a strong second in the last 20 laps and was
intent on stalking Earnhardt when the field came out of the fifth
yellow flag on Lap 187.
</P>
<P>
   He opted for only two new tires on the final pit stop and
decided to nurse them until the final lap. Mayfield said he noticed
Earnhardt sliding on the final two turns, and he also acknowledged
that the Intimidator had intimidated him in races past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also was smart enough to know not to try to get him
loose on Turn 1 or he'd come back and get me loose,'' Mayfield
said. ``A lot of people talk about Dale Earnhardt; he came the hard
way and drives that way. So did I.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the bump-and-run victory, Mayfield shrugged and said, ``You
got to do what you got to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the likelihood Earnhardt will remember that in a future race,
Mayfield showed a little hardheadedness. ``If he comes back to get
me,'' he said. ``then I'll go back and get him again.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE TIGER WOODS SHOW DOMINATES NBC  

</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods' face, biceps, torso, feet, clubs and Nike ball were
such riveting images on Sunday at the United States Open that it's
a wonder NBC showed any other golfer at work on the grass of Pebble
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Woods' 15-stroke victory was ``the greatest
performance in golf history,'' said Johnny Miller, NBC's lead
analyst, ``maybe the best in sports history.''
</P>
<P>
   Other golfers were present, but playing cameo roles so
tangential that NBC should have employed a corner box to display
Tiger's reactions when mortals named Ernie, Padraig and Miguel
rudely intruded on his historic Face Time.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't it seem unfair to see anyone but Tiger in a field packed
with golfers who, Miller said, ``drift out of the way and don't
play their normal game'' against Tiger?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with an 8-shot lead, you don't want to stop watching
him,'' Roger Maltbie, an NBC commentator, said on Sunday. Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC cut to a par putt by Nick Faldo, I wondered: Tiger
could be clog dancing on the eighth green. Kill this ridiculous
shot!
</P>
<P>
   NBC knew other golfers were out there, competing in a lesser
universe, incapable of lifting its ratings. But NBC had to show
them, probably by contract, yet with reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger was irresistible, stretching a 10-stroke third-round lead
into a 15-stroke rout. Once he teed off, 2 hours 10 minutes after
NBC's golf day began at 1:30 p.m. Eastern time, Tiger logged
astonishing attention.
</P>
<P>
   NBC cut to Woods 407 times, to see him tee off and putt, to
watch his reactions, to analyze him in replays, to see him breathe.
NBC followed him as he marched from green to tee, from tee to
fairway, from fairway to green. During his perambulations NBC
surely failed to show shots that were important to other golfers.
But on this day, they mattered not.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, NBC missed Woods' tap-in at the fourth hole _ he
was approaching the ball _ to cut to a wedge shot by Lee Westwood.
And Tiger's tap-in on the ninth hole was deemed less important than
a Bobby Clampett birdie try!
</P>
<P>
   NBC's priorities were nearly always correct. When Ernie Els,
Woods' partner, putted, he was usually placed in a two-shot with
Tiger to the side or in the background.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth hole, NBC lingered 90 seconds through a six-angle
set-up before Tiger putted for par. On the 17th, NBC stayed with
Woods nonstop (except for brief cuts to his mother and to his ball)
for 15 separate shots as he walked from the tee to the bunker where
his first shot lay.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th, NBC lingered on Tiger for 1 minute 15 seconds as he
did nothing but stroll beside the ocean and the local flora and
apply lip gloss as he awaited Els' second shot.
</P>
<P>
   During his four-hour round, Tiger's Face Time totaled 93 minutes
23 seconds. That's 39 percent of the slot between 3:40 p.m. and
7:40 p.m. Whatever NBC carried before Tiger's round started was a
prelude and shouldn't be counted in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Each time NBC found Woods, the camera stayed for an average of
13.7 seconds. The network found his mother four times, twice more
than it showed Notah Begay III.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods' runaway victory proved is that viewers will watch
even if they know that the outcome is obvious, like previously
taped figure-skating events that grab audiences despite
foreknowledge of the results.
</P>
<P>
   NBC would certainly not have got an 8.8 overnight Nielsen rating
on Sunday _ the highest such rating ever recorded for the United
States Open _ had Stewart Cink been soaring to an astonishing
15-stroke victory. The rating was 11 percent above last year's
final round, when Payne Stewart won by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC's rating is puny compared with CBS's 15.8 overnight for
the final round of Woods' 12-stroke victory at the Masters three
years ago. (In that round, Woods' Face Time totaled 80 minutes 46
seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   When Woods won last year's PGA Championship over Sergio Garcia
by two strokes, CBS garnered a 7.7 overnight rating, up 26 percent
from a year before.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only factor that could have jazzed up NBC's Sunday
rating was stiff competition through the 18th hole against a
marquee rival.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Tiger Woods show held up quite well during its
one-hour encroachment into prime-time, trouncing its competition.
Golf peaked from 7 to 7:30 p.m. with a 12.2 rating, beating its
closest rival, ``60 Minutes'' on CBS, which had an 8.1.
</P>
<P>
   NBC embraced the United States Open as if it were as dear a
property as the National Basketball Association. When the second
round was truncated on Friday, NBC ordered two hours of Saturday
morning coverage. And although NBC was to leave the air at 8 that
night, it stayed until 10:45, causing NBC to scuttle the prime-time
showings of ``Alice in Wonderland'' and ``The Others.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday's prime time, NBC posted a 7.5 overnight rating.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, in a tournament that lacked Woods atop the
leader board, CBS left the Byron Nelson Classic at 6:38 p.m. rather
than show the third hole of a sudden-death playoff won by Jesper
Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   The action was deemed a violation of CBS' PGA Tour contract, and
the network vowed never to repeat its heinous act. It can leave by
7 o'clock, just not before.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, if Woods were in a position to win, CBS would never
have pre-empted a second of golf, even if it meant delaying a film
about Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Now NBC bequeaths Woods to ABC for the British Open next month
from St. Andrews, a course Miller says is better suited to a Woods
victory than Pebble Beach. If he succeeds, Tiger would provide star
power well beyond that of Paul Lawrie, whose playoff victory last
year produced a 4.8 final-round rating. &QL;

<SLUG> BC-SKAKEL-HEARING-NYT </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>
HEARING BEGINS TUESDAY ON WHETHER SKAKEL WILL BE TRIED AS AN ADULT
OR JUVENILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Fla.)   By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Michael Skakel, charged with killing
15-year-old Martha Moxley in Greenwich in 1975, is to return to
state court Tuesday, where a judge will open an unusual hearing to
decide whether the 39-year-old defendant should be tried as a
juvenile or an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing could last a few hours or several weeks, depending
on how much evidence Judge Maureen Dennis of Superior Court decides
to allow state prosecutors and Skakel's lawyer to present. But
several lawyers following the case said they expected the
proceeding to take about four or five days, spread out over this
week and next.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts familiar with the case said they believed the
judge would order Skakel's trial moved from Juvenile Court to
Superior Court, where he would be tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that he will be transferred to an adult court,''
said William Dunlap, a professor of criminal law at Quinnipiac
College in Hamden, Conn. Noting Skakel's age, he added, ``Having
him tried as a juvenile seems like a farce.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, prosecutors will present several witnesses to
bolster their case against Skakel and will urge that the case be
moved to adult court. Defense lawyers will move to have the charges
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted in Superior Court, Skakel would face 25 years to
life in prison. In Juvenile Court, the sentence would be far
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, was charged by state
prosecutors as a juvenile because he was 15 when Moxley was found
bludgeoned to death under a tree in her family's yard a quarter
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe Moxley was killed with a 6-iron golf club,
pieces of which were found around her body. The club had come from
a set owned by the Skakel family, the authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether to move Skakel's case to an adult court,
Dennis must operate under the laws in place in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A juvenile charged with murder now is automatically tried as an
adult, but in 1975, when attempting rehabilitation was the
preferred method for dealing with violent youths, such a move was
rare. To try a child as an adult, a judge had to find ``reasonable
cause'' to take the youth out of the juvenile court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's looking at the law then,'' said one Connecticut juvenile
court lawyer, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. ``It's
a 1975 courtroom tomorrow, except that it's open to the press. It's
unheard of. We've never had a case where we've had to go back 25
years.``
</P>
<P>
   Despite the greater burden the 1975 laws place on the
prosecution, Dunlap said, Skakel is unlikely to retain his legal
status as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it was possible to try him as an adult in 1975,'' he
said, ``and since it is almost automatic that he would be tried as
an adult if the crime were committed today, I think he'll be moved
to Superior Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Benedict, the state's attorney prosecuting Skakel, is
likely to present an array of witnesses, including a former
Greenwich police chief and former students at a school for troubled
youths that Skakel attended in the early 1980s. Benedict did not
return calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Sherman, Skakel's lawyer, said he believed Benedict had
no physical evidence linking Skakel to Moxley's murder. But based
on the few clues they have in the case, prosecutors believe the
girl knew her killer. Skakel lived next door to Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of evidence they seem likely to bring out in the days
ahead is an eight-page autopsy report. The report, obtained from
Greenwich police records, found that the killer had battered
Moxley's head and neck with 13 powerful blows from a blunt object.
It details how several blows carved deep crescent-shaped wounds on
the upper part of her head; other wounds struck bone.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds detailed in the report _ by Dr. Elliot M. Gross, the
medical examiner who performed the autopsy _ suggest that Moxley
probably died from three blows that fractured the back of her skull
and penetrated her brain, said Dr. John H. Sinard, a Yale
pathologist who studied the report at the request of The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   While she lay prone but still alive, Moxley was also stabbed
completely through her neck, most likely with the golf club's
shaft, the autopsy found. The autopsy did not give investigators
any clues to the killer's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, Skakel's lawyer, said he would attack prosecution
witnesses in the hope of casting the the charges against his client
as too weak to warrant a Superior Court trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the first opportunity that we have to, No.
1, confront and, No. 2, cross-examine these witnesses,'' Sherman
said Monday. ``That is immeasurably important. Other than their
spoken words, there's no evidence to connect Michael Skakel with
that crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the hearing concludes, the judge will probably issue her
decision within a few weeks, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis is still considering a request by five newspapers,
including The Times, to grant public access to the case's court
documents, under seal since Skakel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, she decided to grant a motion filed by the same
newspapers to open the trial to the public.

U.S. AND CHINA WILL COOPERATE IN FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs 2nd graf to change `legal agreement' to `formal
agreement'; changes quote in last graf slightly; other minor
changes throughout.)  By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United States and China agreed Monday to step up
their cooperation against the production and smuggling of illegal
drugs, especially heroin and methamphetamine. The two drugs have
emerged as scourges in both countries and throughout much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, American and Chinese law-enforcement
agencies have sometimes cooperated to stop contraband drug
shipments. But on Monday the two governments signed their first
formal agreement to share information and evidence related to drug
smuggling. Officials from both sides predicted more wide-ranging
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced here by Barry R. McCaffrey, the
retired Army general who director of the White House drug-control
office. McCaffrey is visiting China with other anti-drug officials
as part of an eight-day tour and will also stop at Hong Kong, Hanoi
and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important moment,'' McCaffrey said after two days
of talks with Chinese officials. McCaffrey, the first top American
drug official to visit China, said such collaboration was vital to
combatting global heroin trafficking and the fast-rising abuse of
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Since China began opening its borders in the late 1970s, it has
become a major transit route for heroin produced in southeast Asia,
especially Myanmar, the former Burma. Chinese gangs ship some of
that heroin to the United States, although most heroin sold there
is from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, heroin addiction has risen in China,
especially in the southern province of Yunnan and in the western
region of Xinjiang, which receives heroin smuggled from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   According to charts provided by McCaffrey's office, factories in
southeastern China are important producers of methamphetamine,
which is sold throughout East Asia, and of ephedrine, the
ingredient in legal medicines that is also used to produce
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey listed several areas in which the United States hopes
to gain China's cooperation, including the sharing of intelligence
about drug operations, curbing money laundering, controlling
precursor chemicals, analyzing seized drugs to identify their
sources and fighting the smuggling of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States, which has since last year stationed a
Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Beijing, had also proposed
opening an FBI office here, but had not received an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Fengrui, director of drug enforcement at China's Public
Security Ministry, appeared with McCaffrey Monday and said he
believed Sino-American cooperation ``is going to enter a new
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 100 ago in the Opium Wars, China was victimized, and
we can never forget that pain,'' Yang said, recalling an era when
Britain and other colonial European powers forced a defeated China
to accept opium.

AT&AMP;T BUYS WIRELESS OPERATIONS IN HOUSTON, SAN DIEGO AND SAN
FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. agreed Monday to pay $3.3 billion in cash for
wireless telephone systems in Houston, San Diego and San Francisco
to expand its fast-growing wireless telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the transactions, the AT&AMP;T Wireless Group, the
company's mobile-phone arm, will add 1.3 million customers and
1,400 employees. AT&AMP;T will acquire operations in San Francisco from
Vodafone AirTouch PLC, in San Diego from the GTE Corp. and in
Houston from PrimeCo PCS, once a venture of Bell Atlantic and
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impetus behind the deal came from regulatory
requirements that Vodafone AirTouch, GTE and the Bell Atlantic
Corp. shed overlapping wireless properties as they create Verizon
Wireless. Bell Atlantic and GTE agreed to merge in 1998; last year
Bell Atlantic and Vodafone agreed to combine their wireless
operations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Believing, at least for the short term, that AT&AMP;T negotiated a
good deal on these properties, investors pushed up shares in both
AT&AMP;T and its wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in AT&AMP;T have been battered during the last three months,
sliding 36 percent as concern persists over declining revenue from
long-distance services. And shares of AT&AMP;T Wireless have not done
much better, remaining below their initial offering price of $29.50
in April.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T rose 5.62 cents, to $34, and AT&AMP;T Wireless added 3.75
cents, to $34.25.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T is also expected to trim the roaming fees it must pay
to other phone carriers with this expansion into the three
remaining large American cities in which it could not offer
AT&AMP;T-branded wireless services, it is not clear how much the move
will affect long-term investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it's important for AT&AMP;T to have nationwide
coverage but it's nothing groundbreaking,'' said Kenneth Schapiro,
president of Condor Capital in Martinsville, N.J., a $480 million
money management company which owns some AT&AMP;T shares. ``It's funny
how a $3.3 billion deal doesn't mean much these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the fast-consolidating U.S. wireless industry, AT&AMP;T is
trying to grow to compete with Verizon, which would be the
country's largest wireless company with 23 million customers, and
with SBC Communications and BellSouth, which are forming the
second-largest wireless carrier with about 16.2 million customers.
When AT&AMP;T completes the acquisitions in San Francisco, San Diego
and Houston, it is expected to have nearly 15 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using our IPO capital as a currency to extend our
footprint,'' John Zeglis, chairman of AT&AMP;T Wireless, said in a
telephone interview. AT&AMP;T Wireless raised a record $10.6 billion in
its April public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the deal is expected to cut into profits at AT&AMP;T
itself, which owns more than 80 percent of its wireless unit, by an
estimated 2 cents to 3 cents a share this year, according to AT&AMP;T.
As an additional part of the deal, AT&AMP;T expects to spend about $275
million over two years to adapt systems in Houston and San Diego to
its national standards.
</P>
<P>
   With the deals, AT&AMP;T will enlarge its capacity to sell its
wireless services in the nation's two largest states, to about 90
percent of Californians and 70 percent of Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the company has a lot more work to do to stop leakage
of roaming costs,'' said Bruce Roberts, a telecommunications
analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ``Wireless is a jewel for
AT&AMP;T but I still see dust gathering on that jewel.''

Players admit beating Woods beyond them
<TEXT>
<P>
   Open
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The gap, it seems, is getting wider as
opposed to narrower.
</P>
<P>
   Even the players, all of whom have egos and think they can beat
any other golfer in the world, are admitting this task is beyond
them.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who despite not winning a tournament in over a year
still is the most consistently great golfer after Tiger Woods, is
realistic enough to know that, at the moment, there's no chance of
anybody threatening Woods as the top player.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' incredible runaway in the U.S. Open proved that.
</P>
<P>
   But it also proved another aspect of the game that Duval
supports: The USGA is not out to embarrass players in its national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like best about this golf tournament is the fact
that if you're playing excellent golf, you can do what Tiger did,''
Duval said. ``And if you're not quite on, you do what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a 19-shot difference between first-place Woods and
tied-for-eighth Duval during the Open at Pebble Beach. Duval, who
has struggled with his putting all year, didn't make many putts on
the small Pebble greens. Woods, meanwhile, made a bushel-full of
putts. That wasn't the full difference in Woods' huge victory. But
it was the main catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part for Duval and everybody else. How do
they put some fear into Woods?
</P>
<P>
   One sure thing is that it won't come in the form of pressure.
Trying to put pressure on Tiger Woods is like trying to out-wager
Bill Gates in a card game. It's hard to do when they know you don't
have the power to do so. And when you have $100 million or
thereabouts in the bank, financial concerns aren't a concern at
all.
</P>
<P>
   What it boils down to is hunger and pride and talent _ all of
which Woods possesses in great abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone take over No. 1 in the world? No way,'' Fred
Couples said. ``He's just better than you are. And I'm all right
with that. I think Tiger is fundamentally perfect and that's not
going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing awfully well. Nothing's stopping him. Whoever
beats him is going to have to play their best.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict that Woods is simply better than everybody else
right now is not open to appeal. He is. To hear Tour players talk
about him as they do is proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about somebody who is hitting it 350 yards dead
straight,'' said Brandel Chamblee. ``There are a lot of guys who
can hit it that far. But they can't tell you what zip code it'll be
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is Tiger came along, and he's an extraordinary
athlete with a gifted mind. He's been molded since birth to be a
machine. He's been taught to win since birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, you've got all these people lengthening golf courses
to Tiger-proof them and they're really playing right into his
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, shorter, tighter courses are the ones Woods probably
would have more trouble with, if he ever had to play them.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it's time to marvel at a new master, who at 24
already has won more golf tournaments (20) than Ben Crenshaw,
Couples, Tom Kite, Tom Weiskopf, Nick Price, Curtis Strange or Greg
Norman, all of whom are twice as old as Woods, or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is that Woods already is a superstar. And
the only things standing between him and legendary status are time
and good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods is the man _ plain and simple,'' said Rocco
Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can win 10-15 tournaments a year. He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   The only story line at Pebble Beach other than Woods was the
strong showing by Europeans in the Open. A European player hasn't
won the U.S. championship since 1970, when Tony Jacklin was a
wire-to-wire victor. If not for Woods, this might have finally been
the year when Europeans broke through in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more like what they're used to, links golf,'' said
John Huston, who besides Woods was the only other American in the
top seven. ``Other than that, I'd just say there's a lot of really
good players over there.''
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world game now,'' said Nick Faldo, who finished in
seventh at 6-over 290. ``Plus, the course and the setup have helped
the international players. We're used to bumping it around in the
wind and scrambling. It wasn't target golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very linksy. I think that's the major factor. If you
hit the middle of the greens, you had a great shot. And that's the
key this week. You were just trying to finish in a sensible area.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lee Westwood added: ``It's certainly nice to see the leader
board crammed with Europeans. It shows we can play a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   True. They were good enough to see Woods' bumper at times.
</P>
<P>
   As Faldo said, there were really only two goals to keep track of
for Europeans _ or anybody else who was chasing Woods for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I made the top 15 and got exempt for next year's U.S.
Open,'' Faldo said. ``That was my only goal, along with finishing
less than 20 strokes behind Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   He just made it _ by two shots.
</P>

HAWAIIAN TEAM WINS NATIONAL SHOP BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This was not your ordinary bee. There were no
tricky spelling or geography questions. For this competition,
talented students had to endure grease, grime and muggy weather.
</P>
<P>
   But the pot for this national shop bee was a quarter of a
million dollars, to be divided among the top 10 teams.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington Monument towering behind them, an
international cast of high school seniors, clad in white jumpsuits
with red and black racing stripes, competed Monday in a contest to
be the fastest at fixing balky automobile engines.
</P>
<P>
   Two-member teams from every state, Puerto Rico, Argentina,
Australia and Canada battled the clock and ``bugged'' Mercury Grand
Marquis engines for the prizes and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Maui High School, in Kahului, Hawaii, which
restored its car to working condition in the shortest time, topped
the team from Oregon by one minute and seven seconds. The Hawaii
team of Steven Garrard, 17, and David Sharp, 17, both seniors at
Maui High, completed the repairs in just under 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to thank the guys because they were the ones in the
field doing the work,'' said Dennis Ishii, 51, the students'
instructor. ``We've been close a couple of times before, but this
is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishii and the two students finished in second place at last
year's competition. A team from Maui High won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really nervous this morning, but it went away once we
got started,'' said Garrard, whose team met for a couple of hours
each school day this year in preparation for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, which has been held annually since 1949, was
sponsored by the Ford Motor Co. and the American Automobile
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Before packed bleacher seats on the Mall here, the teams
repaired cars that had identical electrical and engine problems. A
judge supervised each team's efforts, and supplied replacement
parts as needed.
</P>
<P>
   When a team determined that the car was back in working order,
it slammed the hood shut, signaled a timer to stop the clock and
jumped into the driver's seat for a short road test.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, each team member took a 100-question written
examination. The multiple-choice examination tested the students'
ability to respond to ``typical repair shop situations,'' said
David Van Sickel of the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Van Sickel said, a contestant might be asked to
diagnose a car that is pulling toward the right when the brakes are
applied.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's competition, students from Minnesota finished
third, followed by teams from California and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy DeBoer, 18, a member of the second-place team from Vale
High School in Vale, Ore., was disappointed that his team came up
short. On the other hand, DeBoer said, ``it was definitely easier
than taking the SATs.''

U.S. DECLARES `ROGUE NATIONS' ARE NOW `STATES OF CONCERN' 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of directing sanctions and suspicion
toward defiant governments from North Korea to Iran, the Clinton
administration abruptly declared on Monday that ``rogue nations''
no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   There are, instead, ``states of concern.'' They are the very
same states as before _ no less dangerous or unpredictable _ but
possibly more easily swayed by gentler American terms, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright disclosed the change in
the official lexicon on Monday when she was asked about ``the rogue
state'' of North Korea and its ``rogue leader,'' Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we are now calling these states `states of
concern,''' Albright told a radio interviewer on the same day the
administration moved to ease trade restrictions against North
Korea, a former battlefield foe that is continuing to develop
weapons that may one day be capable of striking the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, the department's spokesman, said the shift
signaled a change in the administration's approach to an unofficial
gallery of nations _ from Libya to Cuba _ where internal reforms
might best be advanced by a more nuanced American vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see now is a certain evolution'' among the nations
formerly known as rogue, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places that were described that way have embarked upon a
more democratic internal life,'' he said. ``Others have been
willing to address some of the issues that are of primary concern
to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher praised such developments as the sweeping victory by
reformist candidates in Iran's parliamentary elections in February
and Libya's decision to turn over two suspects for trial in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatically, there were the overtures by Kim Jong Il _
first to halt missile testing and, then earlier this month, to
stage a summit with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae Jung _
that sent American officials reaching for the thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see a development that we think is in the U.S. interest,
we will respond,'' said Boucher, who went on to trip over his own
new terms. ``If we see states of concern that continue to be of
concern because they are not willing to deal with some of the
issues we are concerned about _ whew.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, the director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, said the administration limited its options
by referring to rogue nations. The term is often applied to the
seven countries listed by State Department as sponsoring terrorism:
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed willy-nilly to lead to a sanctions-dominated foreign
policy, when the evidence suggested that sanctions are rarely
effective,'' Dr. Haass said.

SENATE TO VOTE ON MEASURE TO STRENGTHEN HATE-CRIMES LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After almost three years of inaction, the Senate
began debate Monday on whether to expand federal laws against hate
crimes, an issue President Clinton uses to tweak congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our opportunity to say whether we are going to be
serious about (fighting) bigotry and hatred,'' said Sen. Ted
Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who won agreement from the
Senate's Republican leadership to allow a vote on the hate-crimes
measure.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the Senate's first recorded vote on whether hate
crimes should be punished under federal law. The vote, scheduled
for Tuesday,is expected to be close. Vice President Al Gore, who
presides over the Senate, has been alerted that he might be needed
to cast a tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, offered as an amendment to a defense spending
bill, would expand existing federal laws against hate crimes to
include violent crimes motivated by sexual orientation, gender or
disability. The proposal, sponsored by Kennedy, also would provide
financial help and federal expertise to state and local officials
investigating hate-crimes cases.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows federal prosecution of hate crimes under
limited circumstances. The crimes must be based on race, color,
religion or national origin, and prosecutors must show that the
victim was prevented by the crime from participating in some
federally protected activity, such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Congress should do more. Crimes motivated by race,
sexual orientation, gender or disability ``wound not only the
individual, but they also wound and scar a community,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking against Kennedy's proposal, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
called for studies to determine whether state and local laws
adequately protect various minority groups. ``It could very well be
that we need to federalize all this, but we need the facts,'' Hatch
said. ``We need to determine whether there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate began a week after the second anniversary of the
dragging death of James Byrd Jr., an East Texan whose racially
motivated slaying has been repeatedly cited by advocates of tougher
hate-crimes laws. Two of Byrd's killers have been sentenced to
death, and a third was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister Louvon Harris and nephew Darrell Verrett were in
Houston to greet President Clinton when he arrived Monday for a
speech and fund-raiser at a downtown hotel. It was Clinton's third
trip to Texas this year in which he called for help passing the
hate-crimes measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of the Senate has finally agreed to allow a
vote up or down on hate-crimes legislation,'' Clinton said in a
speech to the non-partisan Southwest Voter Registration Education
Project. ``We've got a chance now. We have to pass this
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president cited FBI statistics indicating that nearly 8,000
hate crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year for which
information was available. Clinton said that translated into a rate
of nearly one hateful criminal act for each hour of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different
and, I think, should be treated differently under the law,'' said
Clinton, who has been pushing for tougher hate-crimes laws since
November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is running as a Democrat for the White House, has
criticized Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican
presidential nominee, for his refusal to support a hate-crimes bill
under consideration by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Kennedy hate-crimes measure clears the Senate, its
chances of passing the House are dim. Republican House leaders
succeeded in killing a similar measure in committee last year.

TWO PACERS AT ARENA EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Indiana Pacers obviously didn't return to Los
Angeles so they could watch the Oscar De La Hoya/Shane Mosley fight
Saturday night, but since they were in the neighborhood. ...
</P>
<P>
   And since Game 6 of the NBA Finals wasn't until Monday, and
since Mark Jackson and Jalen Rose are big fight fans, well, why not
see Staples Center in a different light?
</P>
<P>
   And maybe draw a few parallels to their own situation?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being the enemy, Jackson and Rose were just faces in
the crowd who were treated to quite a show as Mosley won a split
decision over De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get the opportunity to go and see two guys go
toe-to-toe for 12 rounds,'' Rose said before Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called Staples Center ``a little bit more lively'' than
an NBA game but not as lively as when he saw Roy Jones Jr. fight at
Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two Pacers, admitted Muhammad Ali fans, enjoyed
watching Mosley take the WBC title away from the hometown De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he was a boy, Rose has admired what fighters do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will it takes,'' he said, ``You've got to have discipline
to train leading up to the fight. You've got to have focus. It
takes you away from your family; and then in the ring, you've got
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no teammate to pass to. Just you
against the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the reason Mosley won was he was the hungrier fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to come in with something to prove,'' Rose said.
``He had the emotion to fight just as hard in round 12 as he did in
round 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time loser: As Sam Perkins sat in a quiet Indiana locker
room before the game, he didn't feel better knowing he was the one
who knew what it felt like to be on the losing team in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 with Seattle and in 1991 with the Lakers, Perkins felt
the sting of defeat as Chicago won the titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second place, no one remembers,'' Perkins said. ``You get
money (for finishing second), but you get money all year. I told
them the only thing I can tell them: (If you lose) you want to get
there again. Keep going and going. If you believe in the team from
the start, you got all the bases covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said the four years between Finals appearances have
flown by, and he told his teammates not to take the moment for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the youth: Pacers coach Larry Bird might be gone after the
season, but he has opinions of Indiana's future.
</P>
<P>
   Several players, including Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson, are
free agents at season's end. Bird said Miller promised he would
play hard and Bird is satisfied he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them all come back,'' Bird said. ``We've got a
good nucleus of younger players. Austin (Croshere) and the other
young guys have stepped up. I think it'll make the team stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Croshere has averaged 9.1 points and 4.7 rebounds in the Finals.
His rebound average ranks second among not just his team but among
all Lakers, too. Only Dale Davis at 11.3 is averaging more.
</P>
<P>
   He's the Best: Guard Travis Best, limited to 10 minutes in Game
5 after suffering a sprained left shoulder in Game 4, finally got
into Monday's game with 9:19 left in the first half. Bird said how
much Best played would be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   In Best's six first-half minutes, he missed his two shots from
the field (one was blocked) and had two assists.

JACKSON'S SPOT IN HISTORY? NOT NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even as he closed within one victory of the
championship, Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson said he was too
focused on the present to think about his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   A victory Monday night meant Jackson's seventh title in nine
seasons. It also would make him the second coach ever to win
championships with two teams (Alex Hannum was the first).
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he would put himself in a class with legends
such as Red Auerbach, Jackson declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's not important,'' he said prior to Game 6. ``To look
at it when you're in the midst of something, you do what you have
to do. When you retire 10, 15 years down the road - God willing,
you're still alive - you think about those things at a later
date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reality is we haven't - maybe on the cusp - we haven't
crossed that threshold of winning another championship as a staff.
As a coach, I'll say the hard work is still ahead of us. We still
have something very difficult to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Still growing: At every stop along the way of a 67-win regular
season and these playoffs, Jackson has contended the Lakers
remained a work in progress. And no matter how these Finals turned
out, he said that would still be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of growing yet to do as a basketball club,
and that's going to take, in effect, more than just this year and
this championship run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missing: The Lakers were dismissive of a news report Monday that
executive vice president Jerry West would retire at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the annual `Jerry West is going to retire' rumor,'' said
Lakers spokesman John Black. ``And that's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   West was unavailable for comment and did not attend Monday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he did not attend a single game, home or away, in the
last two playoff series. West has described watching the games as
too stressful and said he prefers to avoid the media swarm.
</P>
<P>
   Dubious honor: As it turns out, the Lakers set an NBA record
with Friday's Game 5 loss at Indiana. The defeat was their sixth in
an elimination game - the most ever for a single postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' Jackson said sarcastically, offering two
thumbs up and a grin. ``It doesn't say a thing. It says something
about this team a little bit, but that's not the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered Monday night's game with a 3-6 record in
potential series clinchers, including an 0-5 mark on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing for free: When Kobe Bryant shot two free throws with
2:06 left in the first half Monday, it marked his first trip to the
foul line since Game 1 of this series - an amazing span of 112
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson offered more sarcasm when it was noted that Bryant -
never shy about driving to the hoop - took just two free throws in
the first five games of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't get fouled,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Pacers) are a team that probably sends teams to the
free-throw line fewer than any other team,'' he said. ``That's the
strength of their game, is that they want to go to the foul line,
and they'll get you in foul trouble and then try to draw the fouls,
and they try to keep you off the foul line.''

LAZIO COUNTERS CLINTON WITH HIS OWN ATTACK AD 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three days after Hillary Rodham Clinton began running
television advertisements critical of him, Rep. Rick A. Lazio shot
back Monday with his own pointed advertisement, even as he promised
to take the high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton, you can run the negative campaign about tearing
people down,'' Lazio says in a 30-second ad that will begin running
this week. ``I'm going to run a campaign about building New York
up.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the commercial, Lazio, the Republican
nominee for the Senate, delivers his own jab at the Democratic
nominee while smiling steadily into the camera. ``Why is she doing
this? Because it's a lot easier for Mrs. Clinton to attack me than
to name a single thing she has ever done for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from the last word, Lazio's advertisement set off another
round of brawling between the candidates, who even disputed the
extent to which Lazio's commercial would be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, said the campaign had spent
a substantial amount to broadcast the advertisement across the
state, but he refused to provide a dollar figure, calling it
confidential information. Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, said
a check of television station logs showed the commercial would be
run only once in some markets, including New York City. Wolfson
said this suggested that the commercial's release was more a ploy
for publicity than a significant advertising push.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only example of rancor between the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Lazio's campaign manager was beginning a news conference
in Manhattan to announce the commercial, Lazio's second new
advertisement in a week, Clinton's press office was e-mailing
reporters to attack it, accusing Lazio of initiating the negative
tone last month in his nomination acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of two news releases that Clinton put out Monday
criticizing Lazio. The other challenged Lazio's reputation for
independence in the House by noting a report in Roll Call, a
Capitol Hill newspaper, that quoted unidentified Republicans as
saying Lazio has asked the Republican leadership for ``a pass'' to
vote against Republican-sponsored legislation that might discredit
his moderate credentials. McLagan called the report untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's ad came in response to ads that Clinton began running
Friday assailing Lazio for his previous opposition to recently
approved state legislation that will stiffen penalties for hate
crimes and his opposition to a Democratic-sponsored measure in the
House known as the patients' bill of rights that would give people
broader powers to sue health maintenance organizations. Lazio
supported a Republican version that instead called for tax
deductions to help people pay their medical premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has called Clinton's commercials a distortion of his
record, and in his new one, he says that she was trying to fool
voters and that ``I voted for a patients' bill of rights and I
oppose hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, Lazio's campaign manager, addressed the attacks,
vowing to rebut every advertisement Lazio perceives as negative.
</P>

   ``We will meet her at the battlefield at every point,'' he said,
though he maintained that Lazio's ads would not turn negative.

   ``There is a way to do an ad where you educate voters without
attacking,'' Dal Col said. ``We will take the most efficient,
effective use of communication to get that message across so that
the voters can clearly see who Hillary Clinton is.''

   VATICAN: REVEALING SECRET
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said it would issue the full text of the so-called
Secret of Fatima, with a commentary, next Monday. The Vatican
disclosed in Fatima on May 13 that the secret predicted the 1981
assassination attempt on John Paul II. Many aficionados of the
Fatima secret expressed skepticism about the interpretation, so the
release of the text will be closely followed by conspiracy
theorists. The Vatican is expected to release a photocopy of the
original handwritten secret put to paper by Sister Lucia decades
after she said she witnessed the Virgin deliver the prophecy in
1917.

<P>
   DOVER, England _ British customs officers searching a
consignment of imported tomatoes aboard a Dutch truck in this
Channel port early Monday found the bodies of 58 Asian men and
women inside the dark, airless space.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the people in the truck _ presumed to be
poor migrants being smuggled into Britain _ had died. But
suffocation was suspected after it was discovered that the
refrigeration equipment had been switched off, the doors had been
locked from the outside and there was scant ventilation. With
temperatures reaching 91 degrees, Sunday was the hottest day in
Britain so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Two men survived and were taken to a Kent County hospital, and
the driver, identified only as a citizen of the Netherlands, was
arrested. The victims _ all adults and all but four of them men _
were described as ``Orientals'' until a more accurate national
identity could be established. The majority of Asians who try to
enter Britain surreptitiously are thought to be Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pugash, spokesman for the Kent police, said the two
survivors were expected to recover, though he added, ``It's hard to
say `non-life-threatening' when you consider the trauma they went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Their security, he said, was a top priority, and they were being
closely guarded. ``This kind of thing doesn't happen spontaneously
on this scale,'' he said. `` It takes a lot of planning and finance
and coordination, and if you were one of those responsible for it,
you wouldn't want to have any survivors around afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking in Portugal where he was
attending a European Union summit meeting, said the discovery of
the bodies demonstrated the importance of stamping out the ``evil
trade in people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency, The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Intelligence
Section says at least 20 criminal groups are actively involved in
bringing illegal immigrants into Britain and forcing them into farm
or servuce jobs at low wages. Small groups of bewildered,
frightened and sickly foreigners emerging from the backs of
vehicles have become a common sight at Dover and other Channel
ports.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the home secretary, Jack Straw, told the House of
Commons: ``This particular incident is now subject to a major
police investigation. The government is determined to continue to
crack down on the evil trade in such trafficking, whose
perpetrators have no regard for human life.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pugash said he had spoken to the police and customs officers who
first came upon the grisly sight. ``Nothing had prepared them for
what they found in that lorry,'' he said. ``They were absolutely
appalled, absolutely traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Knott, a Customs spokesman, said the truck, one of the
4,000 that pass through Dover's Eastern Docks terminal daily, had
been singled out just after midnight for inspection because it fit
a profile developed by officials to identify vehicles suspected of
transporting contraband. The Dutch-registered truck had just made
the four-and-a-half hour crossing from Zeebrugge on a freight-only
P &AMP; O Stena Line ship that left the Belgian port at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Knott declined to say what had aroused suspicions, but a
spokeswoman for the P &AMP; O shipping line said the driver paid cash
for the trip and the company to which the vehicle was registered,
Van Der Spek, was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Using a fork lift, the customs inspectors unloaded stacked
crates of tomatoes from the 58-foot truck that had in effect formed
a wall blocking what was behind. ``It is common for us to find
veneers, if you will, or false bulkheads like this put up to hide
things,'' Knott said.
</P>
<P>
   A single customs officer climbed into the exposed space, where
he made the discovery, Knott said. Emergency services were
summoned, and police took over the case. Two pathologists from the
Home Office arrived from London Monday morning to conduct autopsies
to determine how the victims had died.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, tomatoes still lay on the concrete loading
dock where customs officers, working in the dim amber light of the
unloading shed, had hurled them when they discovered the gruesome
human cargo. Forensic specialists dressed in white full-body suits
picked over the wilted vegetables and broken wood slats Monday
while the doctors worked inside a refrigeration hangar next door
that had been converted into an emergency morgue.
</P>
<P>
   A rolling flotilla of large ferries kept landing at the piers,
which lie at the base of Dover's famous white cliffs. Trucks rolled
down the gangplanks and then lumbered out the exits toward
northbound highways. In mid-afternoon, one of them was stopped,
and, as reporters watched, six young men were escorted out a back
door and marched into an interrogation office.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The surge in the number of people seeking asylum is a big
political issue in Britain, an insular nation that has always felt
the added security of having no overland borders with other
countries, aside from the frontier between Northern Ireland and
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   A record 75,000 people claimed asylum for the year that ended in
February, compared with just over 49,000 the year before. The war
in Kosovo, which prompted many Kosovar Albanians to seek refuge in
the West, accounted for only some of the rise. There were large
influxes of people from Eastern Europe, Central Asia and, as
Monday's episode seemed to illustrate, China.
</P>
<P>
   Although the requests of most asylum-seekers to Britain are
denied, two-thirds of those who are refused vanish in an effort to
stay here. The government says it intends to get tougher and is
introducing plans to imprison and deport larger numbers of new
arrivals. Immigration has been at the center of political debate in
recent weeks, with Conservative party leader William Hague making
inroads on Blair's popularity by using deliberately emotive
language to warn of the dangers of a ``flood of bogus asylum
seekers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blair's government and the Conservative opposition joined Monday
in denouncing the lucrative and exploitative business of smuggling
human beings into Britain. Both Labor and Tory politicians stressed
the need for closer examination of cargoes on the continental
European side of the Channel. ``I accept entirely that there is a
need greatly for other countries to improve the checking of
vehicles coming in here,'' said Straw.
</P>
<P>
   The British government introduced tougher new measures this
spring, including fining drivers $3,000 for each illegal foreign
stowaway found in their trucks. Some $1.8 million has been levied
thus far, and a spokesman for Blair said Monday that ``As a result
of that, there's been a 49 percent reduction in the number of
clandestine entrants discovered in vehicles in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   When Straw visited Dover in April to publicize the new
regulations, he arrived at a moment when eight illegal immigrants
were being flushed from the back of a Czech truck.
</P>
<P>
   The government may boast of the effectiveness of the fines, but
drivers and trucking companies claim that the government is
penalizing them for the failures of border control authorities.
Drivers say people clamber onto the trucks without their knowledge
while they are parked on side roads or in gas station or restaurant
parking lots while waiting to cross the Channel. One company
official told The Evening Standard, ``It's like a householder being
fined for reporting a burglary.''

GIULIANI WILL JOIN THE LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST HANDGUN MAKERS  

</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, following the lead of many of
the nation's other large cities, announced Monday that his
administration would file its own lawsuit against handgun
manufacturers, seeking tens of millions of dollars to compensate
New York City for injuries and other damage caused by illegal gun
use.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, to be filed Tuesday in Federal District Court in
Brooklyn, comes after more than a year of questions from Giuliani's
political rivals and gun control advocates about why New York City
has hesitated to use its influence to try to force safety-related
changes in the way handguns are designed and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Some Giuliani critics said the mayor's departure from the Senate
race last month might have been a factor in his decision to take on
the industry, suggesting that he is now more willing to risk
alienating prospective conservative donors around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael D. Hess, the corporation counsel in the Giuliani
administration, said Monday that politics had played no role. The
city had merely been studying some of the more than two dozen other
lawsuits, three of which have been thrown out of court, before
moving ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with the mayor running, not running,''
Hess said, instead citing the ``many, many unfortunately thousands
of injuries and deaths that occur throughout the country from the
illegal distribution of these guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The city will argue that as a result of deceptive industry
marketing, irresponsible supervision of gun sales and flaws in gun
design, city residents are being killed and injured, and the city
government has often had to pay medical bills and law enforcement
costs, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence G. Keane, general counsel for National Shooting Sports
Foundation, a gun manufacturing trade group, called the effort
pointless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's lawsuit will not save a single life or prevent a
single crime from occurring,'' he said. ``Short-term political
needs have prevailed over the exercise of sound legal judgment on
the part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration decided to include the nation's
largest handgun maker, Smith &AMP; Wesson of Springfield, Mass., among
the approximately 30 defendants, even though the company signed an
agreement four months ago with the federal government and more than
a dozen local governments to adopt some of the safety changes New
York City is now pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith &AMP; Wesson accord, heralded in March as a landmark in
the gun control effort, has already shown signs of faltering. Fewer
cities than expected agreed to drop lawsuits against the company,
and no other manufacturers have yet agreed to the conditions. Some
companies have indicated that they intend to wait until after the
presidential election, hopeful that George W. Bush, who is
considered gun-friendly, will win.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, while praising
Giuliani for pursuing the matter, said Monday that with Smith &AMP;
Wesson included in the lawsuit, other manufacturers might now be
even less willing to accept the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly does not create the appropriate incentive for
other manufacturers to step forward,'' said Spitzer, who took part
in the Smith &AMP; Wesson negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hess implied that the city was not entirely satisfied with the
Smith &AMP; Wesson settlement, which included an agreement to install
additional trigger locks on new handguns and to put a second,
hidden set of serial numbers on all its new guns to make it harder
for criminals to remove identification marks. But he added that the
city was prepared to work quickly to try to settle the suit with
that company or any other manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is a complete answer,'' Hess said of the
Smith &AMP; Wesson deal. ``All of the manufacturers are guilty of these
charges, and if Smith &AMP; Wesson or anybody else wants to come in and
try to settle the case early on by reforming their practices, we
are available to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The case would be pursued in the same Federal District Court
where a jury last year found nine gun makers liable for shootings
with illegally obtained handguns because their marketing practices
fostered gun trafficking. Three of the companies were ordered to
pay more than $520,000 in damages to the family of a Queens
teen-ager who was shot and severely wounded with an illegally
obtained handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, several Democrats on the City Council, while praising
the mayor for joining 31 other local governments _ including
Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and
Philadelphia _ that have filed suits, asked why it had taken New
York City so long. New Orleans filed the first lawsuit in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly would have lost a lot of Republican support around
the country if he had done this before,'' said Councilman Sheldon
S. Leffler of Queens, a Democrat who is chairman of the public
safety committee. ``That is no excuse. But it is better late than
never.''

   A CONVENTION ROLE FOR BRADLEY
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials say Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, his onetime rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, have worked out matters to the point that
Bradley can expect a prominent speaking role at the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles. Asked over the weekend if
Bradley would get a ``prime-time'' role, the convention manager,
Terry McAuliffe, a close Gore ally, told CNN, ``I think he will.''
McAuliffe also said President Clinton would have a prominent
speaking role at the convention, most likely on opening night. But
ultimately, McAuliffe said, ``this whole convention is about Al
Gore, his vision for the future, what he is going to do as
president.'' Convention planners also expect Hillary Rodham Clinton
to address the convention.

<P>
   CLINTON RAISES MONEY IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ventured onto Gov. George W. Bush's Texas turf
Monday for the third time this year to raise money for Democratic
candidates. Stopping in Houston and Austin, Clinton raised $1
million to help elect Democrats to the Senate and encourage
Hispanic voters to turn out on Election Day. Clinton argued that
there are sharp differences between the governor and Vice President
Al Gore, who he said had the better plan to keep the national
economy growing. The president also took Senate Republicans to task
for stalling confirmation of some of his judicial nominees. He
cited the Senate's failure to vote on Enrique Moreno, who was
nominated for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. ``From humble
beginnings in El Paso, he established, first of all, an utterly
brilliant academic career,'' Clinton said. ``I might add, more
brilliant than that of virtually everyone who'd be voting on his
confirmation.'' &QL;

   GORE SUGGESTS GAS PRICES ARE FIXED

<P>
   As gasoline prices in the Midwest escalate, so does the concern
of Vice President Al Gore, who, as part of the Clinton
administration, could be held politically accountable. He suggested
Monday that the big oil companies might be fixing prices. ``The big
oil companies' profits have gone up 500 percent in the first part
of this year, just the time when these prices are going sky high in
the Midwest,'' Gore said in an interview with ABC News. ``I think
that justifies a much broader investigation into possible
collusion, price gouging and antitrust violations.'' Later in the
day, he focused on the economy. At a fund-raising dinner in
Washington for the Democratic National Committee, Gore said the
nation's economic turnaround had been brought about by Clinton
policies. Fifty-five people paid $10,000 each to join him and Sen.
Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who had endorsed Gore's rival,
former Sen.Bill Bradley, in the primaries. Kerrey called Gore ``the
most qualified person in my lifetime'' to be running for

IBM CREATES 1-GB MINIATURE HARD DRIVE FOR POCKET PCS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plunging deeply into the world of pocket-sized personal
computing, IBM on Tuesday will introduce a version of its tiny
Microdrive hard drive with a storage capacity of 1 billion bytes of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive, which is the size of a book of matches, is a
milestone in the evolution of magnetic storage, IBM executives
said, because it surpasses the same 1-gigabyte barrier the
company's original refrigerator-sized 3380 hard drive surmounted in
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller size and accelerating density of magnetic storage
systems is one of the remarkable stories of Silicon Valley. Disk
storage is now increasing at a rate faster than the legendary
Moore's Law improvement rate of the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors
that can be squeezed onto a silicon chip doubles roughly every 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   When the first 340-megabyte Microdrive was introduced a year
ago, it had a storage density of 5.04 billion bits per square inch.
The current drive, which will ship commercially in September, has
increased that density to 15.2 billion bits per square inch. The
higher density means the tiny new drive is within 10 percent of the
most advanced IBM storage products now on the market, said John
Osterhout, the marketing director for IBM's storage business.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it expects about one-third of the market
for the new drives to be as storage devices for digital cameras. A
1-GB drive, which fits in the same storage slot as a flash memory
card, could hold up to 1,000 high-resolution photographs, a
thousand 200-page novels, or nearly 10 hours of high-quality
digital audio music, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that another third of the market will be as a
backup and data-transfer medium for notebook and desktop computers.
But in the future the company is most interested in an array of new
markets based on hand-held computing devices, like personal digital
assistants and advanced digital cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of IBM Monday rose $6.375, to $120.125 .
</P>
<P>
   To make its disk drives more attractive for the coming market in
wearable computers, IBM said it had increased the shock resistance
of the newest generation Microdrive, which will sell for $499, to
the ability to withstand a 1500-G shock. That is the equivalent to
a drop from a normal office desk onto a medium thickness carpet,
Osterhout said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has added tiny rubber bumpers to the corners of its newest
drives to add to their reliability.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has already built a version of a tiny personal
computer based around the Microdrive is Tiqit Computers, a Palo
Alto, Calif., company started by Vaughan Pratt, a Stanford computer
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes a palm-sized computer that it advertises as
the world's smallest system that can run operating systems such as
Windows 95, Windows NT and Linux. The tiny computer, which
currently has 486-class processor manufactured by Advanced Micro
Devices, is 5 cubic inches and weighs 3.3 ounces. The Tiqit
Matchbox PC is priced at $1,495.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police arrested a 17-year-old from Queens on
Monday in connection with the June 11 attacks on women in Central
Park, bringing the number of men arrested to 18.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, Dellon Evans, was charged with felony sexual abuse
and riot, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who was one of the suspects whose photographs, taken from
videos of the attack, were circulated in the media by the police,
turned himself in, said Lt. Dennis Cirillo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo did not have details on what Evans is accused of doing
in the chaos after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, during
which crowds of men doused women with water and sexually molested
them in the southeastern corner of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Four more women reported Monday that they had been sexually
abused, Cirillo said, making a total of 53 women who have now
reported that they were groped, stripped or otherwise abused.
Fourteen of the women were also victims of robberies or attempted
robberies, the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   Counting Evans, six of the 17 men whose photographs were
released have now been arrested, Cirillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have prompted widespread criticism of the police,
who were said by victims to have stood by while the men were
marauding.

Astros nearing the point of no return
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The overwhelming historical evidence suggests we really don't have
to wait until the All-Star break to accept what the Astros likely
will concede over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a turnaround of unprecedented proportions throughout the
franchise's 38-year existence, the Astros' chances to contend for
their fourth consecutive postseason berth are about as good as
Ernie Els' chances of overtaking Tiger Woods during the final round
of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, those Astros who spend a lot of time playing
golf during the offseason almost certainly will get an earlier
start this year. At 25-43, the Astros have the worst record among
the 30 major-league teams, and they are 14 games behind first-place
St. Louis in the National League Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are 94 games remaining in the Astros' season and
strange things have been known to happen in baseball, referred to
by some as the most unpredictable game of them all. But at this
point, it appears nothing short of a miracle can pull the Astros
out of the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who 2{ months into the season still haven't won more
than two games in a row, might soon have to write off the 2000
season with regard to contending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting tougher and tougher as every week goes by,''
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``I've always, in my
mind, had the All-Star break as a deadline to make that decision,
and we're only a few weeks away from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1964 Cardinals were 15 games out at the All-Star break and
not only came back to win their division but went to the World
Series. But we've got some challenges to overcome that don't show
any signs of getting any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Billy) Wagner situation is very much up in the air.
Without a reliable closer, no team is going to go very far. The
pitching has gotten better, but it's still been inconsistent.
(Scott) Elarton is coming off surgery with no real clues as to what
the rest of the season is going to hold for him; certainly nothing
to be encouraged about at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortstop situation has been a revolving door, and we're
incorporating more youth into the lineup every day. With all of the
challenges in front of us, it would take a monumental effort to get
back into the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' best record over their final 94 games of a 162-game
season is 60-34, established in 1986 and 1998. Even if they matched
that this season _ an unlikely possibility considering their
overall inconsistency _ they would still finish with only 85
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 162-game schedule was adopted in 1961, only four teams
have reached the playoffs (excluding strike-shortened seasons) with
85 or fewer victories. And even if the Astros did match their
finishes of 1986 and 1998, the Cardinals _ who are currently 10
games over .500 _ would have to play three games under .500 for the
rest of the season in order for the Astros to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be real tough,'' said Astros righthander Chris
Holt, who will start tonight's opener of a three-game series
against the Dodgers at Enron Field. ``We're embarrassed by our
record and by the way things have gone. We just can't catch a
break, and you kind of wonder if it's just one of those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give in. I know we're quite a few games
back. I don't know what's going to happen after the All-Star break,
where we're going to be, what the front office will do; we just
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty regarding the direction of the club probably
won't exist much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the organization, and I think
that's something we'll address over the next couple of weeks,''
Hunsicker said. ``We have to make some difficult decisions here,
but they're decisions that have to be made so that we know what
direction we're heading.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the club might be broken up if things don't
improve in a hurry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what that means yet,'' Hunsicker said. ``I think
we have to evaluate the personnel we have and what we feel the
capabilities are, not only for the rest of this year but the next
couple of years, and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it appears the decision already has been made. The
Astros' roster includes far more young players than in recent
years, and trying to win a championship with an abundance of
inexperienced players is a risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's game against the Giants, the Astros started Lance
Berkman, Julio Lugo, Mitch Meluskey and Chris Truby in the same
lineup. None of them has played a full year at the big-league
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization hasn't come out and said that we're going
with a youth movement, but every prospect we have is here,'' Astros
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``We're mixing them in here and
there. I'd like to see us go in one direction. I'd like to know
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, it should be crystal clear.

NEW YORK TIMES SIGNALS INTENT FOR 40-STORY TOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times is expected to sign an agreement
this week with state and city officials to build a 40-story
headquarters on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets,
according to executives involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, The Times would pay nearly $100 million for
the development rights to the site, the executives said. The city,
in turn, is expected to provide a series of tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tower would sit within the borders of the Times
Square redevelopment project and across Eighth Avenue from the Port
Authority Bus Terminal. It would be the third home for the
newspaper in the Times Square area in 100 years, and would allow
The Times to consolidate operations now scattered among six
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in discussions with the city and state,'' said Catherine
Mathis, a spokeswoman for The Times. ``But there are many things
that have not been finalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis would not comment on ``any monetary terms of any
potential arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, or memorandum of understanding, serves as an
outline for the project and sets the stage for what will probably
be months of lease negotiations over the final terms of a deal with
the state and the city. Talks on the project began last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, The Times selected Forest City Ratner Cos. as
a developer and partner for the project. Under their agreement, The
Times would take up to 900,000 square feet in the tower, out of a
total of 1.37 million square feet, while the developer would take
the rest of the space. There would be retail stores on the ground
level.
</P>
<P>
   The state would have to condemn the property and demolish about
eight low-rise buildings now on the site before construction could
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the newspaper's 87-year-old headquarters, on 43rd
Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, would be sold and
presumably razed for a new building, according to real estate
executives and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is in the process of winnowing a list of potential
architects to four from eight. Candidates included Sir Norman
Foster, the British architect, and Cesar Pelli, who designed the
tallest buildings in the world, Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia. To encourage diversity of architecture in the
area, state and city officials had asked the newspaper to exclude
Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill; Fox &AMP; Fowle and other architects who
had designed Times Square buildings in recent years. The Times
considered a number of European architects, including several who
have never worked on office projects. The four finalists are to
submit designs in competition for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The state's guidelines for the building require a symmetrical
mid-block tower set back from Eighth Avenue atop a large base of
six to eight floors, for the newspaper's newsroom, according to an
architect who has seen preliminary plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is resisting the state's demand that there be large
illuminated signs on the side of the building facing Eighth Avenue,
much as there are on buildings in Times Square, executives involved
in the discussions said. The state is also requiring that the
project embrace some kind of public amenity, like a subway
entrance.

RULING ENDS GAME INVOCATIONS IN TEXAS CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday struck down the Santa
Fe school board's policy of having a student deliver an
``invocation'' before high school football games, saying the
gridiron speech violates the constitutional separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 decision in the Texas case, the court said the Santa
Fe Independent School District's call for a student to
``solemnize'' the game is an unconstitutional effort by a state
agency to inject religious prayers into a government-sponsored
event.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's First Amendment protects each citizen's free
exercise of religion by prohibiting the government from endorsing
particular faiths, the court said. By providing the forum for
students to speak on religious themes, the school board has
impermissibly endorsed religion, the justices added.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' decision was the latest in a string of high court
rulings during the last 38 years that have struck down public
school efforts to conduct moments of prayer for students and to
have clergy members speak at graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush called the decision ``disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in
voluntary, student-led prayers,'' said the governor and likely
Republican presidential nominee this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential
nominee, agreed with the court's decision, said Gore spokesman Jano
Cabrera. ``He does support private (student) prayer in school as
long as participation is truly voluntary,'' Cabrera added.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cominsky, regional director of the Jewish Anti-defamation
League, which filed a brief in the case, said the court's ruling
upholds minority rights. ``It's really a victory for people of all
religions,'' Cominsky said. ``This decision reiterates that freedom
of religion is a constitutional right for both the majority and the
minority ...''
</P>
<P>
   Under Santa Fe's policy, which had been under court challenge
for five years, the student body elected a student to deliver a
``statement or invocation'' before football games.
</P>
<P>
   The selected student could draft their own message to
``solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and student
safety and to establish the appropriate environment for the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the policy as an unconstitutional state call
for prayer, the justices seized on the word invocation, calling it
``a term that primarily describes an appeal for divine
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also took particular exception to the provision, under
which student speakers were elected by their peers. Leaving the
selection of speaker to a majority vote increases the likelihood
that students who believe in minority religions will not be chosen
and that their religious views will be ignored during the
government-endorsed pregame speech, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Santa Fe's majoritarian election might ensure that most
of the students are represented, it does nothing to protect the
minority; indeed it likely serves to intensify their offense,''
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the court's majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington attorney Walter Weber, who represented Santa Fe, said
the court's ``very bad decision,'' will foment more litigation
involving public schools.
</P>
<P>
   School districts, in their court-ordered attempt to prevent
students from reciting prayers at campus events, may now find the
American Civil Liberties Union suing them for restricting the
pupils' constitutional right to speak freely, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts school districts in a very untenable situation,'' said
Weber, an attorney with the American Center for Law &AMP; Justice,
which supports prayer in public schools. ``No matter what they do
they're going to get sued, either by us or the ACLU.''
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Anthony Griffin, who challenged Santa Fe's policy
before the Supreme Court, hailed the decision as a victory for
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the court recognized today, religious belief and expression
is flourishing in our country precisely because America has avoided
the mistakes of other countries and resisted the temptation for the
government to endorse religion,'' said Griffin of Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe, marked
the Supreme Court's first major foray since 1992 into the thorny
First Amendment issue of governmental endorsement of religion at
public schools. In several decisions since 1962, the justices ruled
that the Constitution generally prohibits school district
involvement in sectarian activities, saying that such participation
alienates students of minority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing that trend Monday, the justices soundly rejected the
school district's argument that it was not involved in the pre-game
speeches, which students wrote themselves, and, therefore, did not
violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the board was in fact a major participant, the court
noted that the school, about 35 miles southeast of Houston, set the
rules for electing the speaker, provided megaphones for the
student's address, scheduled and hosted the game at which the
speech was given and had the school's name emblazoned all over the
field and on shirts of players, band members and cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   The court, alluding to the continuing national debate over
whether prayer belongs in schools, went to great lengths to say
that students may still worship voluntarily on school grounds. The
Constitution merely prohibits governmental agencies, including
school boards, from compelling students to worship or to listen
while others express their faith, the justices added.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens' opinion were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
assailed not only the court's decision striking down the policy but
the tone of the ruling, which he said ``bristles with hostility to
all things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said public expressions of religion are rich in U.S.
history, such as President Washington's proclamation of a day of
``public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging
with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of almighty God.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the court's narrow reading of the Constitution could
impinge on the rights of student leaders to speak freely.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rehnquist's dissent were Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Mormon and Catholic students and their parents sued the Santa Fe
board in 1995 to stop the pregame practice as unconstitutional. All
federal courts that have considered the case have refused to
divulge the names of the families, referring to them as Doe and
citing what the judges called the parties' well-founded fear of
harassment from community members who objected to their challenge
to the policy.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 20:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You know things have changed in the decorous game of golf when
spectators paint their faces in orange and black and hoot and
holler as if they were watching the New York Jets. Of course there
is always excitement in the gallery when Tiger Woods is playing,
but Sunday at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach was something special,
mainly because Woods was something special. Crushing 350-yard
drives, lofting wonderful recoveries from the rough, putting with
supreme confidence, Woods won the U.S. Open with a 12-under-par 272
and a 15-stroke margin over his nearest competitor. This was the
lowest score in relation to par in Open history, and the largest
margin of victory in any of golf's four ``majors'' in the history
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Woods' third victory in a major _ only the British
Open title has eluded him _ and one has to think back to his first
big victory, the 1997 Masters, to find a comparable blowout. Woods,
then a 21-year-old rookie, virtually shrank Augusta National into a
pitch-and-putt course on his way to an 18-under-par 270, a Masters
record. But this victory may have been even more impressive,
because Pebble Beach did not play easily. The average per-round
score was a shade over 75, the highest for any Open since Oakmont
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' transcendent performance recalled Bobby Jones'
observation after he had watched a young Jack Nicklaus dominate
Augusta National in 1965. ``He plays a game with which I am not
familiar,'' Jones said. Woods' competitors are now saying the same
thing about him, freely admitting that on his best days, he is
untouchable. Fortunately for them, and probably for the game of
golf as well, there are some days when Woods is merely mortal. But
they seem to be dwindling.

EDITORIAL: A SAFER RETIREMENT PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 20:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has learned from his boss. With
Clintonesque strokes he has put together a retirement plan that
extracts the best part of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal, leaving
the governor to defend the unpopular parts, such as the likely need
to cut promised Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposes to create private savings accounts by diverting
part of the Social Security payroll tax. Gore is expected to
announce Tuesday that he would help families set up individual
retirement accounts without touching Social Security money. But his
plan, unlike Bush's, would raise national saving, help low- and
moderate-income families more than high-income families and pose no
threat to basic Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan would work like 401(k) savings plans except that
the government, not employers, would provide the matching funds. A
married couple making $30,000 could contribute up to $1,000 a year
and receive an extra $3,000 in tax credits _ a 3-for-1 match. The
tax credit would be refundable so that even a family with no income
tax liability would receive the full $3,000. The federal grant
phases out so that a couple making $100,000 would receive only a
$1,000 credit if it made a $3,000 deposit, a 1-for-3 match. The
account would not be taxed until withdrawals during retirement,
though families could withdraw money earlier for catastrophic
medical expenses or college tuition or to buy a first home. Early
withdrawals are designed to persuade low-income families to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Gore of hypocritically proposing a concept _
investing personal retirement money in stocks _ that he labeled
``risky'' when proposed by Bush. The criticism is misplaced.
Investing basic retirement money in stocks can be imprudent. But
investing additional money in stocks and bonds once the family's
basic Social Security retirement benefit is preserved poses nowhere
near the same type of risk.
</P>
<P>
   The tax code already includes deductions for 401(k) and other
types of retirement accounts. In general, wealthy families
participate more frequently than others. Gore's proposal, because
it relies on refundable credits rather than deductions and provides
a larger match for the savings of low-income families, would be
steeply progressive.
</P>
<P>
   Progressivity is key to promoting savings. The economics
profession is divided on whether 401(k) and other tax-subsidized
accounts actually raise savings, the lifeblood of investment and
growth, or merely shift existing savings out of ordinary savings
accounts into tax-favored accounts. But even William Gale of the
Brookings Institution, whose research raises doubts whether
existing tax breaks raise savings, predicts that Gore's plan will
work. It is focused on low-income families that save very little
now and will almost certainly have to save more to put money into
Gore's program.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush's plan, Gore's would help families build wealth that
they could leave for their heirs. But unlike Bush's plan, Gore
would boost private wealth without putting any basic Social
Security retirement benefits at risk.

SOTHEBY'S BOARD MEETING SET FOR AUGUST, LEADERSHIP PLAN STILL
RANKLES INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Baron Capital Group, a New York mutual fund that
is Sotheby's largest outside shareholder, filed a notice with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday saying that it still
believes that electing the son of the former chairman and some of
his friends to the board presents a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   A. Alfred Taubman, the real estate developer who is Sotheby's
largest shareholder, resigned in February amid allegations of
price-fixing at the company. Taubman, who retains voting control of
the company and its board through stock ownership, wanted his son
Robert to take his place on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Baron, chairman and chief executive of Baron Capital,
first voiced his objections in April just before the company's
annual meeting. It was postponed as Baron pushed Sotheby's board to
distance itself from its former chairman. Monday, however,
Sotheby's announced that the meeting had been rescheduled to Aug. 3
at its York Avenue headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's plans to expand its board to 14 members from 10 at the
annual meeting. Taubman's ownership of 63 percent of the Class B
shares gives him the power to elect 10 directors, while Baron's
ownership of 55 percent of the Class A stock carries enough votes
to elect the other four.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's said Monday that, on behalf of the Class A
shareholders, it had nominated four people: George Blumenthal,
chairman and founder of NTL Inc., a provider of business and
residential telecommunications services in Europe; Steven Dodge,
chairman, president and chief executive of the American Tower
Corp., an owner and operator of broadcast and communications towers
throughout the United States; Henry Jarecki, chairman of the
Falconwood Corp., an investment banking company; and Brian Posner,
co-founder and managing partner of Hygrove Partners, an investment
management company.
</P>
<P>
   Baron filed a notice Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in which he said that he ``remains dissatisfied with the
independence of certain Class B directors.'' Besides Robert
Taubman, the board of Class B directors also includes Jeffrey Miro,
one of Taubman's lawyers, and Max Fisher, a business associate who
is one of Taubman's closest friends.  &QL;

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CLEARS MERGER OF PFIZER, WARNER-LAMBERT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clearing the way for a merger that would make Pfizer
Inc. the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, the Federal Trade
Commission approved its combination with the Warner-Lambert Co.
Monday on condition that the companies shed businesses in four
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission's order preserves competition for several very
important drugs that treat diseases suffered by millions of
Americans annually,'' said Richard Parker, director of the FTC's
Bureau of Competition.
</P>
<P>
   The $90.2 billion deal, which was announced in early February,
attracted consumer as well as government opposition, but it was
widely assumed that the companies would eventually propose
modifications that would meet the government's objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for Pfizer,'' said William Steere
Jr., chairman of the New York-based drug giant, after the
commission's 5-0 vote. ``Combining the two fastest-growing
companies in the industry creates a global leader in the discovery
of health and consumer products.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to well-known household products, including
Listerine, Ben-Gay, Sudafed, Benadryl, Schick, Cortizone and
Visine, the deal brings together Warner-Lambert's Lipitor, a
cholesterol drug, and Pfizer's Viagra, a treament for impotence.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not to be final, however, until after a period for
public comment on the proposed consent agreement expires July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, a watchdog group, complained that the remedies
accepted by the commission do little for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not a shred of evidence that the public is
getting a price break out of the economies of scale,'' said Dr.
Sidney Wolfe, a physician who directs the organization's health
group. ``This sounds great if you're a stockholder but not if
you're a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pfizer, which had sales of $16.2 billion last year,
closed Monday at $46.9875, down $1.9063. Warner-Lambert, which is
based in Morris Plains, N.J., and had $12.9 billion in sales, fell
$1.25, to $129.75.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Warner-Lambert is to end its arrangement
with Forest Laboratories to co-promote the antidepressant Celexa;
Pfizer will sell its head-lice treatment business to the Bayer
Corp.; Warner-Lambert's assets related to the Alzheimer's drug
Cognex are to be sold to the First Horizon Pharmaceutical Corp.;
and Pfizer will transfer its business under development for
treating solid-tumor cancers to OSI Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer is to exchange 2.75 shares of its common stock for each
share of Warner-Lambert in a transaction that would be tax free.
Pfizer, which said it did not expect the sales to significantly
diminish its performance, put expected savings from the merger at a
minimum $1.6 billion by 2002.

summit dispelled some of the personal chilliness between South
Korea's Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il. It made less of
an impression on the deep-frozen hostility that still divides the

Hafez Assad's 30-year dictatorship is honored for giving Syria
stability after years of political chaos. But it was stability of a
kind that most countries would gladly be without. Syrians, once in
the vanguard of Arab intellectual life, deserve better. Does Bashar
Assad, the heir-apparent-son-of-dictator, belong to the twilight of
the old era, or does he usher in a more enlightened one? Can he
perhaps be helped to move from one to the other? &QL;

   So Tony Blair is mortal after all. In the past few months
Britain's prime minister has suffered the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune: His party was defeated in local elections and
humiliated in the London mayoral election. Even now he still feels
driven to dress his policies up in grand-sounding, ``deeply
personal'' and embarrassingly half-baked political philosophy: the
``third way'' (yawn) and all that. For the first time since Blair
entered 10 Downing Street, it is imaginable that Labour could
actually lose the next election. &QL;

recorder was eventually trounced by the Matsushita camp's clunkier
but more versatile VHS machine. Certainly, Japan's two
consumer-electronics giants have been girding up over the past few
months to do battle again. This time, they are butting heads over
which of their digital video disc (DVD) recorder designs will
replace the aging video-cassette recorder (VCR) that they fought
over a decade and a half ago. &QL;

   EDMONTON, ALBERTA _ Since the great Klondike gold rush of a
century ago, this rugged corner of Canada has seen plenty of booms
and busts. The next big boom looks likely to come from the ``black
gold'' that lies under the region's forests: oil sands. Optimists
now think the region's huge reserves of this mucky material could
meet half of Canada's oil needs by 2010, up from just a quarter
five years ago. &QL;

   PARIS _ A visit to Christian Dior's glittering boutique on the
Avenue Montaigne is a powerful lesson in how to sell luxury.
Exquisite handbags hang like modern art in classic, silvered rooms.
The floors have been imported from a castle in Scotland. In such a
surreal atmosphere, paying $1,000 for a Dior handbag seems, well,
rather a snip. But would it on the Internet? The question that many
luxury-goods companies now face is whether they can peddle their
illusions online, where shoppers go for low prices and convenience,
not mystique. &QL;

and Mastercard, which together account for around 75 percent of the

sickly and unpromising. Now it has a rather different air.
Following the second of two big mergers, the industry is stronger,
more solid _ and distinctly more Spanish. On June 12 the board of
Mexico's biggest bank, Bancomer, decided to reject a purchase offer
from the country's second-largest, Banamex, and accept one from
Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), ending weeks of
uncertainty in a battle of bids unprecedented in Mexico. &QL;

   TOKYO _ It looks for all the world like a rerun of the video
wars of the 1980s, when Sony's clever little Betamax cassette
recorder was eventually trounced by the Matsushita camp's clunkier
but more versatile VHS machine. Certainly, Japan's two
consumer-electronics giants have been girding up over the past few
months to do battle again. This time, they are butting heads over
which of their digital video disc (DVD) recorder designs will
replace the aging video-cassette recorder (VCR) that they fought
over a decade and a half ago. &QL;

   EDMONTON, ALBERTA _ Since the great Klondike gold rush of a
century ago, this rugged corner of Canada has seen plenty of booms
and busts. The next big boom looks likely to come from the ``black
gold'' that lies under the region's forests: oil sands. Optimists
now think the region's huge reserves of this mucky material could
meet half of Canada's oil needs by 2010, up from just a quarter
five years ago. &QL;

   PARIS _ A visit to Christian Dior's glittering boutique on the
Avenue Montaigne is a powerful lesson in how to sell luxury.
Exquisite handbags hang like modern art in classic, silvered rooms.
The floors have been imported from a castle in Scotland. In such a
surreal atmosphere, paying $1,000 for a Dior handbag seems, well,
rather a snip. But would it on the Internet? The question that many
luxury-goods companies now face is whether they can peddle their
illusions online, where shoppers go for low prices and convenience,
not mystique. &QL;

Following the second of two big mergers, the industry is stronger,

Mexico's biggest bank, Bancomer, decided to reject a purchase offer

Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), ending weeks of
uncertainty in a battle of bids unprecedented in Mexico. &QL;

YANKEES GAIN SECOND-BIGGEST MARGIN OF VICTORY EVER, 22-1, AT
FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul O'Neill peeked around a corner in the visitor's
clubhouse to make eye contact with Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees'
pitching coach, and with an impish smile, O'Neill drew back his
left arm and pretended to throw _ an instant audition, just in case
the team's need for pitching had become so desperate that
Stottlemyre would consider using a 37-year-old outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre laughed, easily. He has learned the worst of streaks
can turn quickly, ``and all it takes is a couple of well-pitched
games,'' he said. ``That's all it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a performance like the ones Ramiro Mendoza and
the Yankee batters gave at Fenway Park Monday night in beating the
Red Sox, 22-1, the largest margin of victory by New York over
Boston in their century-old rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza pitched seven innings, improving his record to 6-3, and
all it took were a few well-timed hits, a few runs to relax the
hitters as they feasted for 19 hits, mostly off Boston's middle
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada and Derek Jeter slugged home runs in the fourth and
fifth innings, respectively, before the Yankees had their largest
single-inning outburst of the season: nine runs in the eighth
inning, eight of them unearned because of Red Sox errors.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, Felix Jose and Scott Brosius also hit home runs
for the Yankees (35-29), who belted five and regained first place
in the American League East, a half-game ahead of the Red Sox
(35-30), who have been struggling almost as much as the Yankees in
the last month.
</P>
<P>
   One day after being deflated by a nine-run first inning and
crushed at home by the Chicago White Sox, 17-4, the Yankees
rebounded with a nine-run eighth and a seven-run ninth. In Yankee
history, Monday night's 21-run victory margin is topped only by a
25-3 pasting of the Philadelphia Athletics on May 24, 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, who
is pushing his executives to make a significant player move, did
not attend Monday night's game. But he is expected to see at least
a couple of games in this four-game series, which resumes Tuesday
night with baseball's best pitcher, Pedro Martinez, facing the
Yankees for the third time in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Before they started steadily filing out of the stadium as Yankee
runners kept filing across the plate, many of the Fenway Park
patrons were steadily razzing the Yankees' second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch whenever he attempted throws Monday night. Knoblauch did
not make any errors, but he tossed the ball tentatively, and with
the Yankees leading by 6-0 after six innings, he was replaced by
Clay Bellinger, who promptly belted a bases-loaded single in his
first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Yankee veterans marveled after the 1999 season how
the team controlled its intensity; the Yankees could look horrible
against the Detroit Tigers, and when challenged by good teams, they
always played better.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' margin of talent is not as significant as it
was last year: the starting pitching has been erratic, the defense
poor, some regulars have been slumping and all this has been
supported only sporadically by a thin bench.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox visited Yankee Stadium over the weekend, a
first-place challenger, and the Yankees did not respond. They were
obliterated. What the Yankees may have learned is that they are not
good enough to float through the regular season and expect good
things to happen. A playoff spot is not a sure thing; the Yankees
could be watching other teams compete to succeed them in October.
</P>
<P>
   They looked moribund in the early innings Monday night, against
Boston's Brian Rose. After the Yankees failed to get a runner on
base in the first inning or the second, Spencer smashed the first
pitch of the third inning to the center field wall, and when it
ricocheted away from the Boston outfielders, Spencer stood at third
with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricky Ledee popped feebly to third, Brosius fouled out to
the catcher and Knoblauch reached to hit a soft lineout to
shortstop. Three chances to score a runner from third, and nothing
to show for it, as Red Sox fans roared. The morale of the Yankees
appeared to be at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza gave the offense time, however. Nomar Garciaparra
slammed a double to lead off the second inning, and Mendoza retired
the next three hitters, and all three hitters in the third inning,
keeping the game scoreless. But the Yankees needed some runs,
needed to get a lead, needed reason to feel better about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter opened the fourth by bouncing a line drive over the
right-field wall _ Jeter would have had a triple if it had stayed
in play _ and then O'Neill flied out to left and Bernie Williams
struck out. They were about to blow another scoring chance. But
Tino Martinez rolled a single through the middle, Jeter scored and
the Yankee dugout was alive, its inhabitants standing and clapping.
They were even louder when Posada destroyed Rose's next pitch,
sending it far over center-field wall. Posada crossed home plate,
and when he returned to the dugout, Jeter was there, smiling, a
fist raised.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the Yankees found something to exploit in what Rose
does, for the hitting coach Chris Chambliss stepped to the front of
the dugout several times to say something to hitters, and the
Yankees kept hammering away at the Red Sox right-hander. Brosius
singled to right in the fifth, and two batters later, Jeter rippled
the net above the Green Monster with a home run, his sixth homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 6-0, in the sixth. The Red Sox threatened in
the bottom half of that inning, but Wilton Veras made a
base-running mistake for the first out; he was caught off second
base on a ground ball back to Mendoza. When Garciaparra hit a liner
at Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop caught the ball moving toward the
bag and swiped a tag on the runner Jeff Frye for a double play to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza allowed six hits and no walks in seven innings,
frustrating the Red Sox again. He made two crucial appearances
against Boston in the playoffs last year, and last week, he threw
five and two-thirds innings solid innings in relief of Roger
Clemens, and the Yankees survived Pedro Martinez and went on to
beat the Red Sox, 2-1. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MORE MONEY FOR DEBT RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 20:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year the United States and other industrialized countries
pledged to provide $27 billion to reduce the foreign debt of 36 of
the world's poorest nations, if those countries adopt sound
economic policies and use the savings for health, education and
other basic needs. Debt relief has bipartisan supporters, including
humanitarian aid groups and religious conservatives. Washington
pledged to pay only 4 percent of the wealthy nations' total, or
$920 million over four years, with most of the money up front. But
Tuesday in both the House and Senate, votes are scheduled that are
likely to slash Washington's contribution to debt relief. This
imperils the whole project, as several other nations will meet
their commitments only if Washington does.
</P>
<P>
   Debt relief is crucial because poor countries use up to 60
percent of their government budgets to service debt on loans taken
out decades ago that will never be repaid. The burden helps condemn
these nations, which are mostly in Africa, to a cycle of poverty.
In 1996 the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund began a
limited program of debt relief that helped only four nations, but
the program is expanding. Wealthy nations have agreed to forgive
their debtors and chip in to cancel debt owed to regional banks
like the African Development Bank. The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, led by Jesse Helms, authorized $600 million in debt
relief for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is likely to approve far less. Alabama's Sonny
Callahan, a Republican, has recommended that his House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations approve only $69
million. The Senate, meanwhile, will vote on a foreign operations
package that includes only $75 million for debt relief. These votes
would leave the United States looking foolish at the next meeting
of industrialized nations in July, where Washington could find
scant support for its initiatives. More important, countries that
have sweated to meet all the criteria for debt relief are waiting.
Bolivia will lose $35 million this year because of the delay. Some
in Congress are counting on a last-minute deal at the end of the
fiscal year to restore the money. This is a gamble the world's
poorest nations cannot afford. Congress should restore the
administration's full request. If it does not, Clinton should veto
the foreign operations bill, which is likely to contain other
objectionable provisions worthy of a veto.

EDITORIAL: SOUND RULING ON SCHOOL PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court performs a valuable if sometimes
under-appreciated public service when it rises above politics and
popular opinion to prevent harmful erosion of the First Amendment's
wall between church and state. Monday the court admirably fulfilled
that mission in refusing to permit organized student-led prayers
before public high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-to-3 ruling, the court's most important school prayer
decision in almost a decade, came in a closely watched case from
Texas. It arose when a Mormon family and a Catholic family brought
a lawsuit objecting to the Christian prayers offered by chaplains
at school events. Trying to get around the constitutional bar on
officially organized prayers, the district shifted it policies to
have a student selected by a schoolwide election deliver a pregame
``message or invocation'' of his or her own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority, this resort to a student surrogate could not
hide the school's role in organizing the religious worship. Nor
could it overcome the intrinsic risk of coercion in holding prayer
exercises in elementary and secondary schools _ whether during
regular class hours or at after-school events. ``The `degree of
school involvement' makes it clear that the pregame prayers bear
`the imprint of the state and thus put school-age children who
objected in an untenable position,''' wrote Justice John Paul
Stevens, quoting language the court used eight years ago in its
ruling outlawing clergy-led prayer at graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who filed a brief supporting the pregame
prayers, expressed disappointment Monday with the decision. So did
three members of the court _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas _ whose dissent
described the majority opinion as bristling ``with hostility to all
things religious in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist should know better than to confuse the
majority's attempt to protect against state establishment of
religion with opposition to religion generally. The court, as
Justice Stevens wrote, ``recognizes the important role that public
worship plays in many communities.'' The new ruling merely upholds
the principle that ``religious activity in public schools, as
elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment.''

<P>
   The end of an era, it is said. And good riddance to it, if true.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad's 30-year dictatorship is honored for giving Syria
stability after years of political chaos. But it was stability of a
kind that most countries would gladly be without: an equilibrium
enforced by a coercive regime with the help of a dozen intelligence
agencies, which deprived people of free speech and led the economy
into a statist dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians, once in the van of Arab intellectual life, deserve
better.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bashar Assad, the son-of-dictator-about-to-be-president,
belong to the evanescent twilight of the old era, or does he usher
in a more enlightened one? Can he perhaps be helped to move from
one to the other?
</P>
<P>
   He seems decent enough: modest, intelligent, reform-minded. In
his brief apprenticeship, cut short by his father's death, before
taking his place in the Arab world's bizarre system of republican
dynasties, he set about modernizing Syria's antique economy,
introducing innovations such as mobile telephones and access to the
Internet, which had previously been considered too dangerous to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his open-mindedness extends to politics is still
unclear. But there is at least a chance that Syria's new president,
like Morocco's new king, will, after a respectful pause, try to
drag his country free from a father's leaden legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for Bashar Assad to have made his opinions known
on foreign policy. His exposure to western ways, during his
training in Britain as an ophthalmologist, may make him an easier
man for outsiders to deal with than was his unbending father.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis will be mistaken, however, if they believe that the
son, any more than the father, will yield on the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israelis, whose public comments
have been less respectful of the dead Assad than most outsiders'
carefully phrased official epitaphs, seem divided on the timing of
their next approach.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis believe that the new Syrian regime must show
itself to have a fair-to-good chance of survival before there can
be any renewal of peace-seeking. And this, they wager, could take
months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   An indefinite postponement is less worrying to Ehud Barak than
it would have been in his first months as Israel's prime minister,
when peace with Syria was his foreign-policy priority. But the
Syrian exchanges came to a rough halt and, with Israel's soldiers
safely out of Lebanon, the need is now less pressing.
</P>
<P>
   It was always known that it would be a struggle to get a Syrian
deal approved by a referendum in Israel, but now, with an
increasingly uncertain majority, Barak faces a struggle in
parliament too. This inhibits all peacemaking, including Barak's
ploy of playing the Syrians against the Palestinians and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, waiting for Syria to settle down will suit many
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way of looking at things. If Bashar Assad is
truly a reformer, bent on making his country a freer, more
forward-looking place, he needs help.
</P>
<P>
   A deal in which he completed his father's quest to win back the
Golan Heights would help remarkably. The agreement collapsed
because the Syrians insisted on getting the whole region back and
the Israelis insisted on retaining control of the Sea of Galilee's
shoreline. Both sides were stubborn, and emotional too.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever an issue called for some creative formulaic
solution, probably with an international ingredient, to save Syrian
honor while calming Israel's fears about its water, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Assad may well have been hoping for something along
those lines when he and U.S. President Bill Clinton had their
disastrous meeting in Geneva in March. After that meeting, it is
more difficult to get things right, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bashar Assad has been crowned president (sorry, for that
should read: once the Syrian parliament has approved Assad's
nomination, and the Syrian people have accepted or rejected him,
and the results have been made known by the end of July), the
Syrian-Israeli peace track could be replayed _ but with a more
imaginative ending.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, who were put off by the unsmiling countenance of
Assad senior, should be able to expect a warmer face from the son.
And the Syrians, who will be on the lookout for signs of Bashar's
weakness, will have to be assured that the entire Golan Heights
will, at least in stages, become theirs once more.
</P>
<P>
   What has Barak to gain from embarking on a new formula-seeking
initiative? As Bashar Assad himself observed, in a rare interview
with a Saudi-owned newspaper shortly before his father died,
Israel's prime minister is in a weak position at home to make any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole region, Israel included, stands to gain if
Syria can move out of the darkness that has eclipsed it for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has inherited the presidency but may not be able to
keep it. His legitimacy is, at best, dubious. A second son, plucked
from his chosen career when his playboy elder brother was killed in
1994, he is inadequately groomed for the job, his support network
not yet in place. He belongs to a minority sect, resented by the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The corrupt old guard could oust him. But if it turns out that
he has indeed set his face in the direction of reform _ the
evidence as yet is slight _ outsiders have a strong interest in
encouraging him.
</P>
<P>
   Success could mean not only an Israeli-Syrian peace, but the
re-emergence of a Syria that was stable, and not because of fear. &QL;

<P>
   They met, they chatted, they may meet again soon. This week's
summit dispelled some of the personal chilliness between South
Korea's Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il. It made less of
an impression on the deep-frozen hostility that still divides the
two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years spent formally at war, they will have to make up
the rules of re-engagement as they go along, and cautiously. But
for South Koreans _ North Koreans are not at liberty to say _ the
summit has rekindled hope that divided families will be reunited
and that someday, somehow, preferably step-by-step and peacefully,
Korea will be too.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of being leaned on by bigger neighbors, and
decades of being carved up between them, North and South Korea now
have a chance to regain some control over their joint destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that these days the outsiders that matter, America,
Japan, China and Russia, all agree that the Cold War between the
two has lingered dangerously long into the post-Cold-War era.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a measure of peace and predictability on the Korean
peninsula would remove one of the chief threats to East Asia's
stability. Yet even if the ice between North and South Korea really
does start to shift, there could still be some dangerous moments
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the problems the two will face even if
they are sincerely bent on reconciliation. They understand little
of each other's ways.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is a developed, open-market, open-minded success. By
contrast, North Korea's Stalinist tendencies, combined with the
wacky juche (self-reliance) dogma of its leaders, have stranded it
on the wrong side of history. It is an impoverished, feudal place,
unable to feed its people, surviving off the charity of China and
handouts from America, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea long ago lost the battle of ideas with South Korea.
Yet, as the North has tottered closer to collapse, South Korea's
leaders have prudently set aside demands for early reunification,
offering instead to help repair North Korea's shattered economy.
This, they hope, will make eventual union a more manageable
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Kim won his welcome in Pyongyang this week with
offers of investment and promises of big infrastructure projects.
North Korea can use all this sort of help it can get, and South
Korea is the only country offering it.
</P>
<P>
   So will North Korea grasp the South's helping hand? Despite this
week's smiles for the cameras, the northern Kim's intentions are
still unknown. He talks the language of reunification, but his
overriding aim is to keep himself and his cronies in power.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulty is that survival by means of good old-fashioned
repression is getting harder in a world where even the remaining
Marxists find they cannot insulate themselves from some of the
dictates of the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, on a surprise visit to China, he hinted that he
was toying with Chinese-style economic reforms at home.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea desperately needs a shakeup. Yet even a little
reform and opening up to affluent and democratic South Korea could
just as easily spell the end of the North's discredited regime.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea needs to proceed cautiously too. North Korea may not
want to run the risks of real reconciliation. It may simply want to
extract what economic concessions it can _ like the 200,000 tons of
fertilizer South Korea promised just before the summit _ and then
resume hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   If so, there would be little point in South Korea building roads
and bridges in the North only to see them used to ferry more tanks
and troops to their dangerously over-armed border.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be ruled out. North Korea is by now adept at
provoking crises and then demanding a payoff for defusing them
again.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them are in fact fully defused, certainly not the big one
relating to the North's nuclear ambitions, still less the newer one
caused by its testing of a long-range rocket over Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And even if North Korea is preparing to take a gamble on reform,
periodic upsets in relations _ whether calculated or miscalculated
in Pyongyang _ are probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   All the more so if, in the effort to keep North Korea talking,
South Korea lets tensions emerge with its two chief allies, America
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, North Korea has played these three off against each
other. By closing ranks in the past two years, they have helped
push North Korea to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet South Korea's capital, Seoul, is already in range of the
thousands of short-range rockets just over the border, so its Kim
is less worried where North Korea's new, longer-range missiles
might fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has the other Kim's attention, he would rather talk
about trade and family contacts, not the nuclear and missile
worries of his allies. But giving cash to North Korea without
making clear the consequences of its going too far will only
encourage more brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia, after years of shrugging their shoulders and
mostly leaving the crises between the Koreas for America to manage
alone, are now also keen to get in on the diplomatic act. They
could be of help.
</P>
<P>
   If North Korea really is ready to open up a bit to the South,
even the perversely self-reliant Kim will at times need China to
hold his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Keen not to be outdone, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has
invited himself to Pyongyang next month. Both have lately been
encouraging North Korea out of its bunker. But both also have their
differences with America, most recently over its plans for limited
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   They will now be tempted to use the opening between the Koreas
to pursue their rivalry with America for influence in the region.
That would be folly. Even without Chinese or Russian cover, North
Korea needs little encouragement to misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, its missile test two years ago is what prompted America
to pursue the missile defenses that so offend China and Russia. Yet
if he thinks they are keen to tweak America's nose, the northern
Kim may miscalculate he can get away with a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Mishandled, there is still plenty of danger on the Korean
peninsula to damage everyone's security. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   So Tony Blair is mortal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months Britain's prime minister has suffered a
series of reverses. His party was defeated in the local elections
and humiliated in the London mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   An innocuous if incompetent speech by Blair to the Women's
Institute was heckled and slow-handclapped. The Tories under
William Hague have found their voice and closed to within three
points in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Blair entered 10 Downing Street, it is
imaginable that Labour could actually lose the next election.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects Blair commands sympathy. His overall record is
creditable _ particularly on the economy. He showed courage over
Northern Ireland and Kosovo. Some of his domestic reforms,
especially his efforts to raise standards in schools, are
important.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a certain justice in the difficulties New Labour
has encountered. The party based its appeal on wildly overblown
political rhetoric. Its problems are rooted in a growing public
realization of the gap between all that talk and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Blairite hyperbole has taken a variety of forms. During the 1997
election, New Labour lamented 18 ``wasted'' years of Tory
government and bewailed ``savage cuts'' in public services.
</P>
<P>
   In power, Blair has continued to indulge his taste for
evangelical, transformational exuberance _ promising to
``modernize'' all he sees, to make Britain the envy of the world
and a ``model country for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also made some specific rash promises _ to end waiting
lists in the National Health Service and eradicate child poverty,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Labour's electoral pitch was always contradictory. Blair managed
simultaneously to denounce the legacy of the Tories, and to assure
the electorate that he would preserve its most important features:
low taxes, light regulation, privatization.
</P>
<P>
   In government the chasm between all the talk of revolutionary
change and the reality of moderate continuity has begun to dawn on
people and wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   New Labour has been genuinely radical in reforming the
constitution. But the party's key promise was that it would revive
Britain's public services _ health and education, especially. Blair
argued that voting for Labour was a matter of ``saving'' the NHS.
</P>
<P>
   New Labour pressed home the idea that spending on the health
service had been cut under the Tories, and that money had been
wasted by the creation of an internal NHS market.
</P>
<P>
   All this was thoroughly disingenuous. Health spending under the
Tories had consistently risen in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   In power New Labour said it was dismantling the internal market;
in fact it has preserved, and arguably extended, its crucial
feature _ the split between purchasers and providers of health
services.
</P>
<P>
   For all his avowed radicalism, Blair's record on public services
is essentially one of pragmatic, well-intentioned conservatism.
While he is in thrall to ``modernization,'' he seems to have no
interest in reforming the fundamental structures of key state-run
institutions like the NHS or the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Truly radical ideas _ like expanding the role of the private
sector in the provision of health, or introducing education
vouchers _ remain firmly off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's approach is to try to make existing institutions work
better by increasing public spending and taxation, and by
tightening central control in the name of spreading ``best
practice.'' This is a perfectly respectable way of trying to deal
with issues like health and education, though one that is likely in
the end to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate difficulty for Blair is that he appeared to be
promising so much more than a program of cautious, tax-raising
pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Even now he still feels driven to dress his policies up in
grand-sounding, ``deeply personal'' and embarrassingly half-baked
political philosophy: the ``third way'' (yawn) and all that.
</P>
<P>
   If British voters are beginning to tire of this blather, he
should not be surprised: they have done well to put up with it this
long. &QL;

<P>
   Few things, you might think, are as enduring as a national stock
exchange. From pillared entrance to pulsating floor, they display
an institutional solidity that can surely defy forces for change.
</P>
<P>
   And yet most of the world's bourses are now in turmoil, as they
scrabble to be seen making alliances or mergers, to fend off
electronic competitors, or simply to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York, the biggest of the lot, is worried; while London,
the biggest in Europe, seems to lurch from one misstep to another.
</P>
<P>
   Two outside forces have come together to create all this
turmoil. The first is electronic. The growing power of the computer
and the spread of the Internet have made share-dealing easier and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been increased pressure on intermediaries,
whether stockbrokers or exchanges, to cut their costs. Another has
been the arrival of competition for organized stock exchanges in
the shape of entirely new electronic markets.
</P>
<P>
   The second force is a growing desire on the part of investors,
companies and investment banks to move beyond national borders for
trading shares and raising capital _ and to do it more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   This is expressed most strongly in Europe, where the arrival of
the euro has made the notion of running separate national stock
exchanges seem increasingly pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger goal is global: to move towards a 24-hour market
for blue-chip shares in the world's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   The established exchanges are keen to work towards this, not
least because, if they do not, those upstart electronic newcomers
might get there first.
</P>
<P>
   Why has such a global marketplace not been created before?
Shares in, say, IBM or Microsoft are widely held by foreign
investors. Commodities and foreign exchange are traded around the
globe, so why not equities?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies partly in conservatism on the part of investors
and issuers, partly in national regulation and accounting
standards, and partly in downright protectionism on the part of
exchanges. All this is changing, albeit more slowly than it should.
</P>
<P>
   For all today's talk about globalization, most investors have
remained surprisingly parochial. Some fret about taking on foreign
exposure or currency risk. Others simply feel more comfortable
dealing in companies they know.
</P>
<P>
   But both investors and companies are learning the benefits of
spreading their risks across borders. It is already possible to
discern the makings of at least two global networks of exchanges
that are emerging in response.
</P>
<P>
   One, led by the New York Stock Exchange, would encompass
Euronext, the proposed merger of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels
bourses, and Tokyo; the other would be built around iX, the
putative London/Frankfurt merger and its associated joint venture
with New York's big rival, Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   A new electronic network may emerge. And it is equally possible
that, with all exchanges talking to all others almost all the time,
they might all get together, with the outcome being a single global
equity market.
</P>
<P>
   Previous experience, admittedly, suggests that more alliances or
mergers between stock exchanges are planned than carried to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The vested interests that own and control the bourses are hard
to satisfy; regulation of markets that operate across borders is
inevitably awkward, since it has long been jealously guarded at
national level; old-fashioned protectionism impels many governments
to preserve ``their'' stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is now irresistible pressure on the world's bourses to
find some way of going global. This raises issues of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   One is how such a market should be regulated. There is unlikely
to be a world Securities and Exchange Commission any time soon:
regulation will remain largely at national level. But national
regulators should be doing more together on such matters as common
listing requirements and international accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   This week's announcement of moves to enforce common accounting
standards across Europe is to be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   If such rules can be brought into greater harmony, fears of
damaging regulatory ``arbitrage'' _ with some investors or
companies seeking to take advantage of locations that have laxer
regulation _ may prove groundless. The evidence is anyway that most
participants prefer to deal on well-regulated markets.
</P>
<P>
   Another legitimate concern is whether a global market will make
it easier to achieve one stated aim of nationally regulated
exchanges: the best prices and execution for all investors.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that all investors, even small ones, will
ultimately benefit from the greater liquidity and lower costs that
a global market should bring.
</P>
<P>
   This will be especially true if clearing and settlement systems,
which account for a big chunk of share-dealing costs and are
especially burdensome for trades across borders, can be merged and
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   A longer-term question is whether to worry about the risk of a
single global stock market exercising monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Because trading always gravitates to whichever market has the
biggest share of liquidity, stock markets have a tendency to be
natural monopolies. They also have some of the characteristics of
public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in stock markets, as in utilities, competition is often the
best way of forcing down costs and ensuring good service.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the rivalry between the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq has benefited both the American economy and the exchanges
themselves, so it would be better for the world to look for two
global equity markets rather than one.
</P>
<P>
   But, as national exchanges have found, even a monopoly is
vulnerable to attack by new rivals. So for now it would be better
if regulators, investors and stock exchanges worried less about the
impact of consolidation than about how to foster it. &QL;

<P>
   DAMASCUS _ When an Arab ruler dies, shutters are supposed to go
down and alcohol to disappear. Not so in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The day after President Hafez Assad's death, locals took
advantage of their day off to pour into the city's most famous
ice-cream parlor, Bekdash, for a scoop and a natter. In the big
hotels, waiters kept offering their patrons extra mugs of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a pro-Syrian mob smashed up a shop in neighboring
Lebanon for daring to serve falafel at such an emotional moment,
Damascene sandwich merchants were doing a roaring trade.
</P>
<P>
   There was mourning, of course, of an improbably exaggerated
sort. The official news agency described the dead president as ``a
giant immune castle'' who had ``wrestled hurricanes,'' a ``planet
that shone in the sky of Syria and the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few religious mystics demonstrated their despondency by
sticking swords through their more superfluous folds of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   As Assad's funeral procession passed, several women in the huge
crowd collapsed in fits of noisy anguish, while the more
rambunctious youths tried to rush the police cordon to touch the
coffin of the fallen leader.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little of the sort of personal, heartfelt grief
that overwhelmed many Jordanians at the death of King Hussein last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was more like that of a football match. Young men
in black headbands piled into cars and drove about town, honking
their horns, shouting slogans and waving flags and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Brass bands marched around the streets, churning out
semi-mournful, semi-martial music for appreciative crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The international response was equally halfhearted. Plenty of
Arab rulers made the trip, as did Iran's president Mohammad
Khatami. But Jacques Chirac, the president of France, was the only
western head of state to put in an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state, showed up, but
only after declaring that Syria must pursue democratic reforms and
a peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout, both western and Arab, was noticeably lower than at
the funerals of both King Hussein and King Hassan of Morocco _ a
good thing, perhaps, since Damascus has so few five-star hotel
rooms that the government had to kick out the existing guests to
put up their distinguished visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians seemed torn between their agony at the former ruler's
death and their elation at the new one's accession. A few muddled
up the names of father and son in their chants. Everyone agreed
firmly, however, that the bereaved young man would make a wonderful
leader. Why? Because he is his father's son. No other reason is
required.
</P>
<P>
   As one passerby put it, perfectly encapsulating Syrian politics,
``The decision has been made. We are just the people. We wait for
events to happen.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ More than trees and houses have gone up in smoke at
Los Alamos in the seven weeks since a forestry-service fire ran out
of control and immolated a large tract of the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent casualty is, at a minimum, the reputation of
America's most famous nuclear weapons laboratory for guarding its
secrets, and at worst, a chink in the country's defenses against
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer hard drives, carrying details of American and
Russian nuclear weapons, as well as simpler devices that might be
put together by less sophisticated engineers, are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The drives, each the size of a pack of cards, are part of the
emergency kit kept at Los Alamos National Laboratory and at
Lawrence Livermore, its sister laboratory in California, and other
institutions within America's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   They are intended to help the Nuclear Emergency Security Team
(NEST) defuse atomic bombs set by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was discovered on May 7 when two laboratory officials
retrieved one of three NEST kits from the security vault in which
they are kept just before fire overran Los Alamos and forced the
laboratory to close. The drives had last been seen at an inventory
check a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The team did not report their discovery to the laboratory's
security department until May 31, a week after Los Alamos had
reopened for business after the fire, even though regulations
require that security breaches are reported within eight hours. The
bad news was then passed the next day to the Department of Energy,
which runs the nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The loss _ and the delay in reporting it _ has infuriated the
Republicans. Los Alamos and the Energy Department were already
under scrutiny for the behavior of Wen Ho Lee, a physicist at the
laboratory who was indicted in December last year for allegedly
transferring classified weapons data on to insecure computers and
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also moan that Bill Richardson, the secretary of
energy, has frustrated their efforts to tighten security by
appointing his own departmental security staff to the top jobs in
the eight-month old National Nuclear Security Administration, which
was supposed to have independent oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The new scandal has not helped Richardson. The baying
Republicans are unimpressed by the bipartisan inquiry that he has
set up into the fate of the drives.
</P>
<P>
   One habitual critic, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, claims to know
of ``physical evidence to suggest theft,'' but has not elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which is investigating, has not ruled out espionage,
but there has been as much opportunity for carelessness as
criminality. About 86 people had access to the vault, and 26 of
them were cleared to visit it alone. No log was kept of what went
in or out.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drives were kept in locked bags, the keys were
attached to them, and spare sets hung on the wall of the vault.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13 the director of Los Alamos suspended the head of the
weapons division and five managers, while the FBI is planning to
give lie-detector tests to everyone who had access to the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy has a hard time competing with human muddle in the face
of new technology. Britain's spies have run into trouble over
laptop computers left in trains and pubs. John Deutch, a former
head of the CIA, was caught keeping secret documents on his home
computer that he used for surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos's lost hard drives may yet turn up at the bottom of
someone's briefcase. Meanwhile, the ghost of Richard Feynman, a Los
Alamos physicist and prankster who used to trick his colleagues on
the original atomic bomb project by cracking safes containing their
classified documents, must be chuckling somewhere. &QL;

THE CURIOUSLY UNDERPOWERED GORE CAMPAIGN

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ At the center of Al Gore's presidential campaign is
a hole _ and it isn't the candidate's personality. The vice
president, the policy wonk's policy wonk, is weak just where he
should be strong: in defining what policies a future Gore
administration would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Fuerth, his national security adviser, says Gore's greatest
asset is his ability to spot changes before they appear on the
horizon, master the details, think out the policy implications and
then create the sort of environment in which policies can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in this: Gore saw the significance of the
Internet and global warming long before most. But that makes it all
the stranger that the vice president is showing so few signs of
this skill in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the debate has proceeded as follows.
George W. Bush lays out one policy proposal after another:
education (he wants more competition between different types of
school); Social Security (he wants workers to put a share of their
payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts); nuclear weapons
(he proposes deep, unilateral cuts by America, and says it should
build a big nuclear defense shield unilaterally if need be).
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reaction? He barely tries to offer competing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he brushes Bush's proposals away with the same mantra,
``a risky education scheme'', ``a risky retirement scheme,'' ``a
risky...'' _ you get the idea. He then proceeds to talk about the
success of the American economy over the past eight years. It is an
appeal that combines the defense of unreformed entitlement programs
with an exaggerated fear of change.
</P>
<P>
   In one way this is understandable, even sensible. The most
powerful argument in support of Gore's presidential bid is that the
economy is in great shape (which is true), that the administration
is largely responsible for this (debatable), and that to change
horses in midstream would endanger American prosperity (well, worth
a try).
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing Bush's ideas ``risky'' underlines Gore's reputation as a
safe pair of hands. It does not necessarily mean Gore is devoid of
ideas. (Indeed one reason why Bush has had to come up with all his
ideas is to counteract the idea that he is the shallower figure.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore could defend his campaign in two other ways.
First, he could say that if he is being too timid, that is merely a
reflection of the inevitable difficulty of running as a sitting
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Any such unfortunate wants to claim credit for the achievements
of the current administration while simultaneously showing his
future government would not be a clone of the existing one.
Striking the right balance is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more substantially, he could argue that he is right
on individual issues _ that privatizing Social Security and
encouraging school choice are both bad ideas; and that you should
be especially cautious about policy departures when the economy is
doing well.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if you accept this latter argument, that is still
not the end of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, one by one, the attacks on Bush's policies strike home,
the cumulative effect of this negative approach is disappointing
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   First, note that the difference between Gore and Bush on policy
matters is built into their campaigns. Bush has created the post of
policy coordinator for Joshua Bolten, a former director at Goldman
Sachs, and given him real influence.
</P>
<P>
   Bolten has created a sort of think-tank in Austin, with a staff
of about 20 busy young people dreaming up new ideas and borrowing
from other people (including Democrats).
</P>
<P>
   Gore has formidable figures to call on if he wanted to, notably
Larry Summers, the Treasury secretary, and Richard Holbrooke,
America's U.N. ambassador. He also has a policy coordinator: Elaine
Kamarck, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government who worked
with Gore on his project to ``reinvent government.'' But she has no
formal group around her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, campaign tacticians dominate Gore's operation. Their
skill lies in slicing the American electorate up like salami and
tailoring the candidate's appeal to a series of individual interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's tactics-driven campaign seems to have originally derived
from a miscalculation. He underestimated Bush, thinking that no
serious intellectual competition was likely from that quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the summer wears on, the supremacy of campaign
tactics over policy development is undermining Fuerth's argument
that Gore can see beyond the immediate horizon and producing the
opposite impression: that the vice president is pandering to
entrenched interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, both he and Bush proposed similar ideas for
``digitizing government'' (they want to apply new information
technology to the backrooms of government departments).
</P>
<P>
   This idea was first put forward by the Progressive Policy
Institute, a think-tank close to Gore. Yet it was Bush who adopted
the most dramatic part of the proposal _ to appoint an information
czar to force government bureaucracies to change.
</P>
<P>
   Gore balked at this _ apparently for fear of public-sector
unions. His opposition to school choice may also be influenced by
the strength of the teachers' unions in the Democratic Party. They
are against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   By stroking such groups while concentrating relentlessly on the
past eight years of boom, Gore seems to be saying that the election
is an occasion for the nation to express its grateful thanks to the
administration, rather than a opportunity for America to address
the sort of future concerns that, Fuerth claims, Gore is so good at
framing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late to change. In June of 1988, Vice President
George Bush was ten points behind in the polls _ a gap that widened
to 17 points by the time of the Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But convention acceptance speeches are the occasions on which
candidates can define themselves as they want: the older Bush took
his chance to distance himself from his predecessor (as a ``kinder,
gentler Republican'') and went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can do the same thing. For Fuerth is right. Gore is good at
seeing around corners. But he needs to show that.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving all the running to Bush, he is increasing the burden
on his convention speech, and the chances that the next thing
around the corner will be his own defeat. &QL;

<P>
   CALGARY _ Canadians have long lived in fear of their country
being torn apart by the secession of French-speaking Quebec. But
today a bigger challenge to their tranquillity _ or complacency _
may come from Alberta, in the western prairies.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta's politicians are promoting a robust, American-style
agenda of less government, more individualism and more private
profit. And they are being successful enough to make opponents fear
that caring, consensual Canada might become a clone of its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   With only 2.9 million people, Alberta is home to fewer than one
Canadian in ten. But it is booming: officials expect its economy to
grow by 5 percent this year, the fastest rate of any Canadian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a flood of new migrants, the unemployment rate of 4.7
percent is the country's second-lowest. New industries are pouring
in and others are expanding: projects worth C$58 billion ($39
billion) are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new investment is going to Calgary. Long the home of
Canada's oil and gas business, the city has become a magnet for
high-tech companies and corporate head offices.
</P>
<P>
   It has displaced Montreal and Vancouver to become Canada's
biggest business and financial center after Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks fly on the steel girders of the new factories going up on
all sides, as huge earth-movers lay out new highways. New office
towers rise against the backdrop of the distant Rocky Mountains,
while on the city's northern edge, housing developments march
towards the foothills.
</P>
<P>
   All due to the ``Alberta advantage,'' says the province's
government, pointing to the lowest taxes in Canada, balanced
budgets (in fact, a record C$2.7 billion surplus last year) and a
skilled work force.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Alberta's legislature took two radical steps to
consolidate its advantage. Not only did it approve a bill allowing
limited private-sector participation in health care, but it passed
a law making Alberta the first province with a single provincial
income-tax rate, of 10.5 percent in its case _ Canada's answer to
the flat-tax idea of many Republicans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics see Alberta's success as owing much to a strong
national economy, and especially to a surging oil price. Even so,
it is not surprising that Alberta's politicians should be touting
their model to the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, is that over the past few years the
Albertan agenda, rather than that of Quebec, has come to dominate
Canada's national political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous sign of the province's growing political
influence will come on June 24, when the Canadian Alliance, a new
national right-wing party, will hold a convention to chose its
first leader. The convention, appropriately enough, is to be held
in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is a bold effort to reshape Canada's right by
merging Reform, a federal neo-conservative party of Albertan
origin, with sections of the Progressive Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three main candidates to lead the new party are from
Alberta: Preston Manning, who founded Reform in 1987, and Stockwell
Day, a former finance minister in the province. Neither man would
be out of place among America's Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Alberta has long been the most ``American'' of Canada's
provinces. It has been shaped by two influxes from south of the
border: first of ranchers and farmers, and then in the 1950s of
oilmen from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They have helped to imbue Alberta with conservative social
attitudes, Christian fundamentalism and anti-government political
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Alberta's dislike of big government also owes much to the
fact that for years it has paid for more than its fair share of it,
being the largest net contributor to the federal government's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albertans know who the enemy is, and it's Ottawa,'' says Tom
Flanagan, a political scientist at the University of Calgary (and a
supporter of Day's).
</P>
<P>
   In the past, other Canadians dismissed Albertans as ``redneck
cowboys.'' No longer.
</P>
<P>
   At the last national election, in 1997, Reform displaced the
more centrist Progressive Conservatives as Canada's main
opposition, winning 80 seats. Another Calgarian, Ralph Klein,
though a Conservative, as premier of Alberta since 1993 was the
first to put Reform's ideas into practice, slashing spending on
health and education and privatizing many government services.
</P>
<P>
   He has been copied by Ontario's Conservative premier, Mike
Harris, among whose advisers is Tom Long, the third candidate to
lead the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Liberal government has also espoused fiscal
responsibility, helped by several years of steady economic growth.
But many Canadians oppose any assault on their welfare state, and
especially their national health service (known as Medicare).
</P>
<P>
   In May, Klein's government alarmed such people when it pushed
through a new law allowing regional health authorities to contract
out routine operations, such as hip replacements, to private
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that this will cut costs and waiting
lists. Its critics disagree, seeing the law as the start of a move
towards an American-style, two-tier health service in which the
rich get faster, better, service at a price.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that American health-management companies may invoke
the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to force their way
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, opponents of the new law staged nightly protests in
Edmonton, Alberta's capital. Just ``fear-mongering'' by a bunch of
``left-wing nuts,'' said Klein. But the health issue may serve to
limit the Alliance's national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the opinion polls, defending Medicare is Canadians'
top concern. Even a majority of Albertans oppose the new law. Both
Manning and Day favor expanding private health care.
</P>
<P>
   And all the Alliance's would-be leaders favor an Albertan-style
single-rate federal income tax (of 17 percent). They claim that it
would boost growth and prosperity, giving everyone a tax cut. But
as with private health care, the rich would benefit most.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies find favor with many United States Republicans.
But Canadians like to think they have a stronger sense of social
equity. Or has that changed? &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty years after the credit card was invented in
Manhattan, its popularity knows no bounds. But the structure of the
industry supplying credit and other charge cards faces
unprecedented scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the trial began of an antitrust lawsuit launched by
America's Department of Justice (DOJ) against Visa and MasterCard,
which together account for around 75 percent of the country's $1.3
trillion credit-card market.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's antitrust watchdog also said it is probing
``Visa and credit cards in general.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, another trial will start, of a class-action suit by
many of America's retailers, seeking damages of $8.1 billion from
Visa and MasterCard for antitrust violations in the debit-card
business.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the card industry is uncompetitive may seem
bizarre to most consumers, particularly in America, where,
typically, a couple of card-solicitations arrive in the mail every
day. Almost anybody can get a card _ bankrupts, infants, even pets.
</P>
<P>
   If lack of opportunity for consumers were the alleged antitrust
violation, the charges would surely be thrown out more quickly than
you can say ``American Express.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is slightly more to the accusations than that. The DOJ
is unhappy for two main reasons. One is that it believes that Visa
and MasterCard are not really competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American Express (Amex), a single company, and Discover,
owned solely by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Visa and MasterCard are
each owned mutually, by associations of thousands of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   These two associations operate under what is known as
``duality''; member banks are allowed to issue both Visa- and
MasterCard-branded plastic. According to the DoJ, this duality
means that the two leading brands are, in effect, one business.
</P>
<P>
   And second, the DOJ thinks that, although there is competition
between banks using their brands, the dominant market position of
MasterCard and Visa has enabled them to stifle competition from
rivals such as Amex and Discover, notably through exclusivity rules
forbidding banks from issuing rival cards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the DOJ launched its lawsuit in October 1998, the
Visa-MasterCard duality has started to unravel. In February 1999,
Citigroup, the world's biggest card-issuer, resigned from the board
of Visa; it is shifting all its business to MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the suit was started, John Reed, until recently
the joint-boss of Citi, admitted to Joel Klein, assistant
attorney-general, that it had been a mistake for banks to become
overlapping owners of both brands. He urged Klein, to no avail, to
give the industry more time to sort out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan has since gone with MasterCard, while BankOne's
FirstUSA and Bank of America have thrown in their lot with Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the scene of the crime in this way might seem evidence
of guilt. Not necessarily. Some big banks have long wanted to
downplay the MasterCard and Visa connection, and increasingly their
cards emphasize their own brand.
</P>
<P>
   Some might even quietly welcome the antitrust action. They argue
that they have been subsidizing these two brands at the expense of
their own. The benefit has gone mainly to small banks, which have
been able to compete in the card business only because they carry
the MasterCard or Visa logos.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, one of the main arguments that the two brands offer
in their defense is that the DOJ's lawsuit could result in many of
these small banks leaving the industry, reducing competition.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that Visa and MasterCard do not compete vigorously
will be hard to prove. Internal documents suggesting this will be
submitted by the DOJ. They will be met with what is known in
antitrust circles as the ``demented middle-manager defense.''
</P>
<P>
   True, their advertisements do not criticize each other, though
they sometimes badmouth rivals such as Amex. On the other hand the
presence of competitors such as Amex means that the two cannot
afford to be an entirely cozy duopoly. Moreover, it is not clear
that the DOJ's action will increase competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The system of duality was actually introduced back in 1975 at
the behest of the DOJ, which then feared that Visa was becoming
dominant. As it unravels, the immediate impact has been to
strengthen Visa's position further. It had anyway increased its
market share, from 43 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 1999
(against MasterCard's 28 percent). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the current market structure inhibits
innovation has worked well for the DOJ in its case against
Microsoft. So it is no surprise to hear it used again in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence suggests that innovation in the provision of
financial products to consumers has been more advanced in America
than in the rest of the world. It has been ahead in offering cards
to lower-quality borrowers, in varying interest rates and terms and
conditions, and in offering rewards and affinity programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions have been ``smart'' cards, which have had
more success elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The development of wireless products, such as Palm Pilots or
mobile phones that can download money from an ATM and digitally
transfer it to a retailer, is more advanced in Europe than America,
but that is probably because the wireless infrastructure is more
advanced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Visa or MasterCard seem to be less innovative than rivals
such as Amex. They were quicker to introduce affinity programs,
such as MasterCard's pioneering tie-up with AT&AMP;T (no annual fee)
and its air-miles arrangement with American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   True, Amex has been first with its ``Blue'' smart card _ though
this is primarily a marketing coup, as the rest of the economy is
not yet smart enough to let it do much more than any other charge
card does.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ will also struggle to prove that merchants are paying
higher fees because of the dominance of Visa and MasterCard. Amex
has typically charged merchants more (though Discover has usually
been cheaper).
</P>
<P>
   Yet it will not be surprising if the DOJ succeeds in its attack
on the rules banning MasterCard and Visa's bank partners from using
other cards, if only because they look so dodgy.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictive agreements are not always unacceptable: nobody
objects to Coca-Cola banning Pepsi from its soda fountains. And
banks can always choose to quit MasterCard and Visa if they want to
offer Amex cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic benefits claimed for the rules do not seem
large: if there were fewer small banks offering credit cards, would
they be missed?
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the case against MasterCard and Visa looks weak. But, in
contrast to the Microsoft suit, the result is unlikely to make much
difference, at least to consumers. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ It looks for all the world like a rerun of the video
wars of the 1980s, when Sony's clever little Betamax cassette
recorder was eventually trounced by the Matsushita camp's clunkier
but more versatile VHS machine.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Japan's two consumer-electronics giants have been
girding up over the past few months to do battle again.
</P>
<P>
   And, appropriately enough, they are butting heads over which of
their digital video disc (DVD) recorder designs will replace the
aging video-cassette recorder (VCR) that they fought over a decade
and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference today is that Sony and Matsushita may have left
it too late for either to gain any real advantage in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed by wrangles with film studios and digital broadcasters
over how to prevent pirates from making pristine master copies of
their intellectual property, the two rival DVD recorders may turn
out to be obsolete even before going into mass production.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Japanese manufacturers at last agreed on the
royalties to be paid to organizations that represent the
broadcasters and film producers. A 1 percent surcharge, with an
upper limit of Yen1,000 ($9.50), is to be added to the wholesale
price of all DVD recorders and blank discs, so that copyright
holders can be compensated for the copying done by legitimate
users.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hollywood studios have accepted a copy-protection
scheme that allows them to decide whether their copyrighted
material can be copied freely, copied just once, or not copied at
all.
</P>
<P>
   With the royalty and copy-protection issues resolved, Japanese
manufacturers at last feel confident enough to start cranking up
production of DVD recorders and discs for the huge American market.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Matsushita has the upper hand. It had delayed
launching its DVD recorder until the copy-protection scheme that it
developed with Toshiba, IBM and Intel was accepted universally.
</P>
<P>
   The new Matsushita machine goes on sale in Japan on June 30, at
a list price of Yen250,000 ($2,375). The industry expects to ship
150,000 units by the end of the year, with a third of those going
to America.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping the gun, two of Sony's allies, Pioneer and Sharp, have
already launched video recorders based on variants of a rival
technology known in Japan as DVD-RW. But because their video
recorders use a copy-protection scheme that has not been accepted
abroad, they will have to develop wholly new models for export.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pioneer is pushing hard, Sony and other members of the
DVD-RW family are expected to miss this year's pre-Christmas rush
for DVD recorders in America.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, however, the advantage could swing back to the Sony
camp, thanks to a gamble taken on how digital video recorders will
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD-RAM design adopted by Toshiba and Hitachi, as well as
Matsushita, functions as a replacement for both the VCR and the
recordable CD drive that is increasingly used in personal
computers. The advantage is that material recorded from a
television or video camera on a DVD-RAM disc can be edited on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, useful though that sounds, the DVD-RAM is not particularly
user-friendly, according to Masami Fujino, an industry watcher in
the Tokyo office of Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, a stockbroker. The
recording disc has to be stored in a special cartridge, making it
impossible to replay it on an ordinary DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 12 million DVD players in use around the
world, with a further 14 million expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the DVD-RW, developed originally by Sony in Japan
and Philips in the Netherlands, is a stand-alone product designed
solely to work as a replacement for the VCR. Besides being easy to
operate, its discs can be played back on existing DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   A DVD-RW machine can also record up to six hours' worth of
material, compared with its rival's more limited four hours.
</P>
<P>
   During the video wars of the 1980s, it was the longer recording
time of Matsushita's VHS that finally put paid to Sony's Betamax
design. But any success that the Sony/Philips offering might enjoy
is likely to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, a new recording technology will be in production that
uses a blue-green laser instead of the red one found in today's CD
players and DVD machines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its much higher frequency, the blue-green laser will
cram three or four times more video on to a standard DVD disc _
enough, should it be needed, to record up to 24 hours of video at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody pondering what wondrous new gizmo should replace their
VCR had better wait. The latest episode of the video wars has
barely begun. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Why is the oil price shooting past $30 a barrel yet
again?
</P>
<P>
   When, three months ago, prices last soared so high, the
explanation was clear: demand outstripped supply by some 2 million
barrels a day. Big consuming countries such as the United States
then bullied the OPEC cartel into agreeing to boost output by about
1.5 million barrels a day at its meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   As that oil came on to the market, prices fell sharply. Yet, in
recent days, they have shot up once again.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers are due to meet again on June 21 in Vienna.
Predictably, big oil importers are pushing for another large output
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Priddle, head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a
quasi-official group representing rich countries, this week said
that ``$31 Brent is not a signal of an adequately supplied
market.'' This time around, though, the cartel seems unlikely to
increase output by much.
</P>
<P>
   One telling portent was the collapse of its ``price band''
scheme last week. After the March meeting, OPEC ministers revealed
an ambitious new scheme to keep oil inside a target band of $22-28
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of a basket of seven OPEC crudes stayed above $28
for 20 trading days, they explained, the cartel would raise its
production by a modest 500,000 barrels a day ``automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits and traders placed their bets, confident that the cartel
would not risk the blow to credibility that would come from
breaking its promise. Surprise: the criterion was met a few days
ago, but the cartel has yet to increase output one jot.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to think that the cartel will resist pressure to
raise output is that its members believe the American economy is
showing signs of starting to cool. They do not want to repeat their
mistake on the eve of Asia's economic crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then, OPEC expanded output, sending prices steadily down to
below $10 a barrel, and nearly bankrupting many producers.
</P>
<P>
   The best reason to think that OPEC will agree to raise output by
only a modest amount, if at all, is the answer to the question
raised by the IEA's latest analysis of the oil market: ``Why $30
oil?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Priddle's views on supply, his own agency's boffins do
not argue that high prices are chiefly the result of a lack of oil.
In fact, they seem to suggest the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand for oil in the second quarter will average about
74.4 million barrels a day, the agency reckons, but global supply
last month, thanks to a huge rise in Iraq's output, was running at
about 76.9 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, crude oil stocks in rich countries are rising fast.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is an accident of timing that has caused
shortages in the American gasoline sector, the world's single
biggest guzzler of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of gas were already low in March, and they have yet to
recover. Demand is still soaring, fuelled by the economic boom and
the arrival of warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   Awkwardly, the government has chosen this moment to order firms
to start selling cleaner types of gasoline in a number of cities.
Teething troubles at refineries producing the cleaner fuel have
interrupted supply and made the market tighter.
</P>
<P>
   All this explains why Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's secretary-general,
insists that, even at their current levels, ``prices are not overly
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Most cartel members agree with this assertion, but _ as at the
previous OPEC meeting in March _ not Saudi Arabia. The cartel's
heavyweight is one of the few members with lots of spare capacity,
is anxious not to offend the United States, and has hinted that it
wants an increase of a million barrels a day or more.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Saudis get such a huge increase? Probably not as easily
as they did in March. But with this rancorous cartel, nothing is
ever wholly predictable. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ A visit to Christian Dior's glittering boutique on the
Avenue Montaigne is a powerful lesson in how to sell luxury.
Exquisite handbags hang like modern art in classic, silvered rooms.
The floors have been imported from a castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant assistants talk lovingly about the hand-stitching and
les petites mains that still work above the shop. Ask them nicely
and they will show you a hidden, brocaded room where duchesses and
pop stars come to try on the latest catwalk creations from Dior's
fashion designer, John Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   In such a surreal atmosphere, paying $1,000 for a Dior handbag
seems, well, rather a snip. But would it on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   The question that many luxury-goods companies now face is
whether they can peddle their illusions online, where shoppers go
for low prices and convenience, not mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Next week LVMH, the luxury-goods conglomerate that runs the
House of Dior, will announce the launch of www.eluxury.com, a Web
site selling luxury goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
   The site will feature 60 brands _ 2,500 items in all,
distributed from a warehouse in Memphis, Tenn. _ including
LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton, Celine, Kors, Givenchy and TAG Heuer,
plus other big labels such as Bulgari, Ferragamo and La Perla. It
will have editorial and videos of catwalk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other luxury-goods Web sites, most have been
unable to persuade labels to supply them with anything better than
limited, out-of-date ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is fear of discounting. As luxury e-tailers have cut
their prices to survive, the labels, fearing that cheap prices mean
a cheap image, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Though LVMH competes directly with the likes of Bulgari, it has
a big advantage. It controls DFS, a global chain of 154 physical
stores, where its own brands sell happily side by side with their
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Ullman, managing director of LVMH, says that, because DFS
has existing relationships with these other labels, it has been
relatively easy to persuade them to set up shop in cyberspace. He
says too that he has learned caution from the failure of boo.com,
in which Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman, had a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new site's launch is next week, marketing will not
begin until the autumn. Yet, however cautious the site launch, the
Internet will never create the same illusion of prestige as a
physical store or a live catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that selling luxury on the Internet will simply
destroy the image that companies such as LVMH have invested so much
to create. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mere weeks ago, Mexico's banking system looked
sickly and unpromising. Now it has a rather different air.
Following the second of two big mergers, the industry is stronger,
more solid _ and distinctly more Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12 the board of the country's biggest bank, Bancomer,
decided to reject a purchase offer from the country's
second-biggest, Banamex, and accept one from Spain's Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), ending weeks of uncertainty in a battle
of bids unprecedented in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, on which Bancomer's shareholders will vote on
June 29, the Spanish bank's local subsidiary, BBV-Probursa, will
merge with Bancomer. Though BBVA's $2.5 billion offer will give it
only 32.2 percent of Bancomer's shares, it will run the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Gonzalez Naranjo, a vice-president at the CNBV, the
banking regulator, thinks the deal is ``very good news.'' A
Banamex-Bancomer merger would have given him and his colleagues
headaches, since the combined bank would have had some 40 percent
of Mexican deposits and nearly 70 percent each of both mortgages
and consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had warned that such a superbank could be a
systemic risk all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The BBVA merger, on the other hand, will leave two of Mexico's
three biggest banks under Spanish control (last month BSCH, another
Spanish bank with a Mexican subsidiary, bought Serfin, Mexico's
number-three bank, which had gone into receivership last year).
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the nationalism that might once have blocked
such deals. A good thing too: the extra capital brought in by BSCH
and BBVA will clean up their new banks' balance sheets, which have
looked poorly since the economic crisis of 1994-95 sent many of
their borrowers into default.
</P>
<P>
   Banamex does not have access to bags of foreign capital, which
is one reason why Bancomer turned its offer down. Even so, after
selling some assets this year, it is expected, like the other two,
to meet new capital-adequacy rules set by the CNBV _ two years
before the new rules come into full force.
</P>
<P>
   All this, combined with the acquisition of Banpais by Banorte in
1997, has led to a more consolidated, not to say rejuvenated,
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economic crisis, banks have lent little, partly
because of a lack of capital, and partly because they have been
reluctant to lend to risky borrowers under a legal system that
makes it hard to collect debts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks two badly needed laws, a bankruptcy law and a
loan-guarantee law, were passed after months stuck in Congress.
They are untested and the judicial system is still slow and
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws should boost efforts to persuade banks to restart
lending _ though not until after the closely fought presidential
election in July has passed, the markets have calmed, and interest
rates have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish acquisitions, combined with the presence of
America's Citibank, mean that around half the banking system will
now be under foreign control, putting Mexico on a par with such
countries as Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign expertise may be good for all the banks. But not all
such investments go smoothly. Citibank is currently in a row with
the government over a $2.5 billion promissory note, acquired when
it bought Confia, another casualty of the economic crisis, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To save interest charges, the government wants to prepay the
note, but Citibank, which wants to keep the asset on its books,
says this goes against the spirit, if not the letter, of their
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish invaders will need to be sure they have read the
fine print in their contracts. &QL;

   EDMONTON, ALBERTA _ Since the great Klondike gold rush of a
century ago, this rugged corner of Canada has seen plenty of booms
and busts.
</P>
<P>
   The next big boom looks likely to come from the ``black gold''
that lies under the region's forests: oil sands.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Pond, a British explorer, ran into the local Cree
tribe in 1778, he found them caulking their canoes with the bitumen
that is common in these parts. Three decades ago, firms began
commercial exploitation of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to advances in technology and declining costs of
production, optimists now think the region's huge reserves of this
mucky material could meet half of Canada's oil needs by 2010, up
from just a quarter five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of such a bonanza might explain the upbeat mood in
Calgary, Alberta's second city and arguably its real oil capital.
The World Petroleum Congress (WPC) met there this week, and many of
the thousands of participants came to find out about the oil sands
of northern Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is trapped in a viscous tar that is found under forests
the size of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   There is reckoned to be 300 billion barrels' worth of oil here,
greater than Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves; if brought to
market, it could fetch trillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there's the snag: extracting the oil from the tar-like
bitumen (tar sands is what old lags call oil sands) is not as easy
as sticking a pipe into the Saudi desert. It takes over a ton of
bitumen to make one useful barrel of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet firms have invested some $33 billion in the area to turn oil
sands into oil. Why? One reason is that oilmen see Canada, for all
its fissiparous tendencies, as much less risky than the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   It is also close to the giant American market. What is more,
says Wayne Kubasker of Exxon Mobil, ``The oil sands are there.
There is no risk in finding them. Finding and development costs are
much less than for conventional oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Production costs of $17 a barrel have fallen to less than $13 a
barrel over the past decade. The government helps with lavish tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Syncrude, whose main partners include Exxon Mobil, Gulf and
Occidental, mines two-thirds of the sands extracted today and plans
to do so for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All this is encouraging, but the local optimism is probably a
bit excessive. After all, a barrel of Middle Eastern oil costs less
than $5 to extract. And little over a year ago, oil fetched less
than $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Until the cost of extracting oil from the sands drops by a lot
more, Saudi Arabia's supremacy in the petroleum world is probably
not under serious threat from Alberta. &QL;

AT&AMP;T BUYING CELL ONE; MA BELL ENTERING BAY AREA MARKET 
 &HT;     BY CARRIE KIRBY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Nearly 1 million Bay Area users of Cellular One mobile phone
service will become AT&AMP;T Wireless customers, possibly later this
year, when AT&AMP;T completes its acquisition of that system.
<P>
   In announcing the deal Monday, AT&AMP;T Wireless promised to make
the transition seamles, but did not promise to leave the service
completely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cellular One clearly has their own regional and statewide
plans _ we'll be taking a look at them to see if we will continue
them or modify them at all,'' said AT&AMP;T Wireless President and
Chief Executive Officer Mohan Gyani.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One customers will have access to all AT&AMP;T Wireless
products, including the company's Digital One Rate plan, which
allows users to make calls from anywhere in the United States for a
flat monthly fee. Cellular One doesn't offer such a plan in the Bay
Area, although competitors such as GTE Wireless do.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having access to new services, Cellular One users will
notice AT&AMP;T's name on their bills within six months of the
acquisition, AT&AMP;T officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One's current network uses TDMA, the same technology
that AT&AMP;T employs in its nationwide network, so there won't be any
technical changes. Therefore, there is little chance of technical
glitches during the change, Gyani said.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications analyst Steven Marasci agreed that major
glitches are unlikely, but added that such large-scale switchovers
are a relatively new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell if there are going to be problems with
the transition,'' Marasci said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless already owns 53 percent of the Cellular One system
in the Bay Area through a joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch. In
December, Vodafone joined with Bell Atlantic and GTE to offer
nationwide mobile phone services as Verizon Wireless. As a
condition of that deal's approval, the Justice Department wants
Verizon's owners to sell off systems that would overlap with their
new service.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Bay Area system _ part of a $3.3 billion deal
that includes networks in San Diego and Houston _ became available
to AT&AMP;T Wireless as a result of the Verizon deal.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases include the physical networks and subscriber
lists. As a result of the deals, about 1,400 employees will
transfer to AT&AMP;T Wireless, including nearly 800 workers in South
San Francisco at the Vodafone/AT&AMP;T joint venture's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Large wireless companies are racing to add cities to their
nationwide networks in order to affordably offer flat-rate roaming
plans such as AT&AMP;T's One Rate. The acquisitions will save AT&AMP;T a
lot of money by eliminating the need to pay another carrier to pick
up its customers' calls when they ``roam'' into the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   These charges vary, but analysts estimate that AT&AMP;T could have
been paying anywhere from 20 cents to 35 cents a minute to the
Vodafone/AT&AMP;T joint venture every time one of its customers made a
call from the Bay Area. When the sale goes through, those charges
will be eliminated because AT&AMP;T will own the network it was once
renting. The company said it hopes the three purchases will cut its
roaming costs by 8 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications analyst Drake Johnstone of Davenport and Co.
in Richmond, Va., said that with those savings, AT&AMP;T got a good
deal on the three systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AT&AMP;T has a customer paying $100 a month for 1,000 minutes,
and they're using primarily AT&AMP;T networks, that's a profitable
customer,'' Johnstone said. ``But if the customer is making most
calls from San Francisco, and AT&AMP;T is paying another carrier 20 to
30 cents a minute, AT&AMP;T is losing money in that customer.''
</P>
<P>
   After the acquisition, AT&AMP;T Wireless will serve all of
California's major cities, covering 90 percent of the state, and
the 15 largest wireless markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless, which became a tracking stock separate from
AT&AMP;T's main stock several weeks ago, closed at $28.75 Monday, up
$1.13, while AT&AMP;T closed at $33.88, up 44 cents.

GRANNY GOOSE CASHES IN CHIPS  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Granny Goose Foods, the Oakland maker of potato chips that
struggled in recent years to remain solvent, has finally thrown in
the towel.
<P>
   ``They are out of business,'' Geoff Berman, vice president of
Development Specialists Inc., the firm hired to sell off Granny
Goose's assets, said Monday. ``They ran up against a wall with
their creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, he estimated that the company owes as much as $37
million.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Oakland, which extended $2.2 million in loans to
Granny Goose five years ago, will likely be reimbursed in full,
Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the loan was secured by the company's sprawling
headquarters, located near the Coliseum, which is now being offered
for $6.5 million and already has received nibbles from potential
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the market wasn't there,'' said Greg
Garrett, manager of the One-Stop Capital Shop, which handles
Oakland's lending to businesses. ``The competition killed them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to stay alive, Granny Goose said in April
that it was moving production to Utah _ a switch that took Oakland
officials by surprise. The company had been part of Oakland's
economic landscape for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not enough to placate creditors. In essence, they
told the company's owner, Oakland entrepreneur Keith Kim, that the
well had run dry.
</P>
<P>
   He in turn was forced to choose between bankruptcy and a sale of
Granny Goose's assets. Kim had purchased Granny Goose from G.F.
Industries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company owes about $16 million to Coast
Business Credit and an additional $4.5 million to Burlingame's
Doyle &AMP; Boissere Fund I.
</P>
<P>
   Once such so-called secured creditors and agricultural suppliers
are paid, Berman estimated that about $10 million will still be
owed to unsecured creditors, including equity holders.
</P>
<P>
   They will be lucky to see any money,'' Berman said. ``If you're
Mr. Kim, you've probably lost whatever you put into the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The Granny Goose brand will not disappear from store shelves,
however. It was purchased in May by Oregon's Snack Alliance. The
company's Padrino's tortilla line was sold to Grande Foods of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has since moved to South Korea, where he reportedly has
refashioned himself as an Internet mogul.
</P>
<P>
   No one was answering the phones yesterday at the Oakland factory
that once employed as many as 400 people.

ONCE THE DARLING OF INVESTORS, BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER WEB  COMPANIES
NOW STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE  
 BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Here are three stock prices that illustrate how drastically the
fortunes of consumer-oriented e-commerce companies have shifted
lately: $14, $74.38, $3.75.
<P>
   The first was the price that the shares of E-Loan, the Dublin
mortgage lender and a leading Internet consumer finance site, sold
for when the company went public a year ago. The second was the
stock's high price, reached just a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   And that last sorry figure was the price at which E-Loan sold
for in a private placement two months ago after a sickening slide.
</P>
<P>
   The riches-to-rags saga of E-Loan _ an innovative, well-regarded
company with no profits and an uncertain outlook _ offers a vivid
lesson, or, if you will, a morality tale about the way investors
have flip-flopped in their view of the e-commerce world. It also
illustrates the tough choices managers must make when the market
turns against them.
</P>
<P>
   From indiscriminately throwing money at any entrepreneur with a
half-baked idea and a Web server, investors have become obsessed
lately with the pace at which Internet companies use up cash _
their ``burn rate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wall Street analysts and venture capitalists
on Palo Alto's Sand Hill Road want to know just when Internet
companies are going to start making money and punish any outfit
that doesn't have a convincing ``path to profitability.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of business-to-consumer Internet companies went
from extremely red-hot to extremely has-been in a matter of
minutes,'' said Jonathan Fayman, an analyst with the San Francisco
online investment bank WR Hambrecht.
</P>
<P>
   That shift in sentiment put e-commerce companies against the
wall. Suddenly, it is nearly impossible to raise money through a
public stock sale. For companies that need financing, choices are
grim: Cut spending, go crawling back to venture capitalists or sell
securities privately on unfavorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the choice faced earlier this year by E-Loan, founded
in 1996 by local mortgage brokers Chris Larsen and Janina
Pawlowski. Burning up cash and facing a hostile market, the company
agreed to sell roughly a 25 percent stake to five investors,
including online brokerage kingpin Charles Schwab Corp., for $3.75
a share, raising $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That was 8 percent below where E-Loan's shares traded on the
open market before the deal was announced and less than a third of
the company's initial public offering price in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say what a horrible thing it was for E-Loan, but they
really didn't have a choice,'' said Fayman. ``It was the price of
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, E-Loan's boyish-looking and upbeat chief executive, has
been selling his company nonstop to investors and customers since
1996. In a recent interview, even the bitter pill of a stock
offering at a distressed price became just another opportunity to
pitch his company.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with the financing deal, Larsen pointed out,
Schwab agreed to set up a co-branded mortgage lending page on its
Web site, giving E-Loan access to millions of brokerage customers.
A partnership with one of the investing world's top companies ``was
a dream scenario,'' he crowed.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan's chief financial officer, Frank Siskowski, was more
candid. The company had always said it would need another round of
financing after the IPO. But ``selling a good size piece of our
ownership at that price was painful,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Larsen put aside his salesman's smile. ``Building
a company is a very hard thing,'' he said. ``You become a realist.
That's the deal. We'll take the steps that need to be taken.``
</P>
<P>
   The newfound hostility of the stock market means that a shakeout
among online consumer lenders has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of E-Loan's competitors, San Francisco Internet
mortgage lender iOwn, has been forced to put off an initial public
offering indefinitely. Its auditors said the delay raises
substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue. IOwn
officials said they are looking at alternatives to a public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that billions of dollars of credit will be
extended over the Internet. But traditional banks, credit card
companies and home lenders that use a variety of channels to reach
customers may have deeper pockets and more staying power on the
Internet. Analysts say it's not clear that an Internet-only
strategy will work in the lending business.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in the mortgage business. Profit margins
in the home-loan business are razor thin and lenders must handle
large volumes to cover their fixed costs. What's more, home lending
is very sensitive to interest rates. When rates go up, as they have
been for the last year, demand for credit falls off.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet mortgage companies, such as North Carolina's
Lending Tree, don't make loans themselves but connect consumers to
third-party lenders. E-Loan is following the riskier path of
building a full-fledged mortgage-lending operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even E-Loan skeptics say the company has created an attractive
product for consumers. E-Loan's origination fees generally beat
traditional competitors and it offers a streamlined approval
process to borrowers with good credit records.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts question whether that's enough. ``This is a
very tough business economically,'' said Vincent Daniel of CIBC
World Markets. ``The question remains whether E-Loan can originate
these loans under their current model at a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, E-Loan took in $22.1 million in revenue, more than
three times what it collected in 1998. At the same time, the
company posted a net loss of $39.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter ended March 31, E-Loan's revenue fell 7.7 percent
from the December quarter, producing a net loss of $11.4 million.
The falloff in revenue was due to a sharp drop in the market for
mortgage refinancings as interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   To diversify its business, E-Loan bought an online car-loan
company from Bank of America last year. But analysts say the
company is still highly vulnerable to rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Larsen said he expects E-Loan to begin making
money in a couple of years. And the $40 million of new money in the
vault means the company won't have to beat the bushes for financing
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the biggest thing E-Loan has going for it is its link
with Schwab and the brokerage's nearly 4 million online clients.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab spent more than a year searching for an Internet mortgage
partner and the brokerage plans on making a big push to promote
E-Loan mortgages on its Web site. It liked E-Loan so much that it
agreed to take warrants to buy up to 13.1 million additional shares
in the company as part of the partnership deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is tremendous upside in E-Loan's value from
having us as a partner,'' said Schwab chief strategy officer Dan
Leeman. A full purse and Schwab's blessing probably means that
E-Loan won't go under. But whether it will thrive or muddle along
until it is bought by a larger and stronger company remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Larsen expresses any doubts. He still has the
evangelical fervor that marked the early days of the Internet, when
paradigm shift was the buzz and no one talked about anything as
crass as profits. He says it's ludicrous to think that consumers
will be taking out mortgages in brick-and-mortar locations in a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is going to be a societal-changing event,'' he
said. ``You've got to stick to your religion and not get caught up
with what's happening in the short term in the capital markets.''

DON'T BANK ON DIVIDENDS 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q:  &LR;  am interested in common stocks that have long dividend &LR; 
 &LR; histories. Can you recommend an information source? I would &LR;   &LR; also
be interested in the names of mutual funds that focus on &LR;   &LR; stocks
that pay high dividends. &LR;
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: Standard &AMP; Poor's keeps close track of dividend
histories. By consulting their monthly Stock Guide _ a handy
booklet with lots of financial statistics about thousands of
publicly traded stocks _ you can find out (among other things) how
long a company has paid cash dividends. General Electric, for
example, has paid them every year since 1899.
</P>
<P>
   It costs more than $100 per year to subscribe to the Stock
Guide, which seems like overkill in your case. See if you can find
a recent copy at the public library. Or ask whether your broker has
a copy lying around. Even one that is a month or so out of date
will serve the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   As for mutual funds that emphasize dividends, you ought to
rummage through the printed or Web-based materials provided by
Morningstar Inc. (Its Web site is  &LR; www.morningstar.com &LR; .) The funds
that will interest you most probably will have the word
``balanced'' in their names _ meaning that the fund manager tries
to draw a balance between income and capital appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to suggest that you might be wrongheaded in placing
heavy emphasis on dividends _ but I'll suggest it anyway. A lot of
truly spectacular stocks don't pay dividends at all.
</P>
<P>
   Take Cisco Systems, for example _ and boy, do I wish I had. It
doesn't pay dividends and never has, but its stock price has more
than doubled in the past 12 months and has shot up more than
twentyfold 20-fold  &LR; in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   If you owned Cisco, you could simulate dividend payments by
selling a few shares now and then. And if you held the shares for
more than a year, you would even get a tax break, because any
profits from the stock sales would be taxed at the reduced,
long-term capital-gains rate. Dividends, by contrast, are taxed at
full rates.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Trying to Track Portfolios
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: Can you recommend a good, free portfolio tracker? I've
tried a few but am invariably led to a screen that says that,
should I continue, all the confidential information I've just given
may go to an unsecured site.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: You won't run into that problem with the Stockpoint
portfolio tracker, sponsored by Iowa's Stockpoint Inc. and
available at  &LR; www.stockpoint.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Stockpoint doesn't pry too deeply when you sign up.
To use its portfolio-tracking tools, you must disclose only your
e-mail address, your age bracket, your gender and your ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very informal. I strongly suspect that if you fudge any
or all of the answers, you will still be able to use the tracker.
Stockpoint, which earns revenues from online advertisers, is quite
eager to expose you to the advertisements, no matter who or what
you are.
</P>
<P>
   Partial Tax Relief
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I need some tax relief. Where and how does one buy U.S.
Treasuries?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: Buying U.S. Treasuries will indeed provide you with tax
relief, but it will be limited. The income they generate is exempt
from state income taxes but subject to the federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   You can open an investment account with the government and buy
Treasuries online through the U.S. Treasury Department Web site. Go
to  &LR; www.treasurydirect.gov  &LR; for details.
</P>
<P>
   You also can sign up off-line by ordering materials from the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The telephone number is
(415) 974-2330.

NEW IBM TINY DRIVE GROWS IN CAPACITY 
 &HT;     BY HENRY NORR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
IBM is tripling the capacity of the Microdrive, its
silver-dollar-size removable hard drive for digital cameras, MP3
players and other portable electronic devices.
<P>
   The company Tuesday will announce 1-gigabyte and 512-megabyte
versions of the tiny drive, priced at about $499 and $399,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The 340-megabyte version the company has been shipping for the
past year will remain available, but at the reduced price of $299.
The other version introduced last year, with a capacity of 170
megabytes, will be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   The new drives will begin shipping in limited volume in July,
</P>
<P>
   according to IBM, but won't reach retailers' shelves until
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Microdrive fits into an industry-standard slot known as CF+,
which is now built into most professional digital still cameras and
some handheld PCs. Via an adapter IBM includes with the drives,
users can also plug them into the PC Card slots found in most
notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   John Monroe, chief analyst for rigid disk drives at Dataquest,
said the market-research company estimates that IBM shipped about
89,000 Microdrives last year, but he noted that volume shipments
didn't begin until June or July. IBM spokeswoman Michelle McIntyre
said her company expects a two- to fourfold increase in shipments
this calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   In part, IBM is betting that the drives will take off in
portable digital music players. A 1-gigabyte drive can hold nearly
18 hours of high-quality digital audio, compared with just over 30
minutes for stock MP3 players today.
</P>
<P>
   A company called i2Go already offers an MP3 player with a
Microdrive-compatible slot, and Diamond Multimedia, manufacturer of
the market-leading Rio series of MP3 players, plans to offer a
340-megabyte Microdrive as an accessory for its recently announced
Rio 600 model.
</P>
<P>
   In a camera, the 1-gigabyte drive can hold up to 1,000
high-resolution digital photos; in a notebook or handheld PC, it
could store 1,000 200-page novels, according to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to increased capacity, the new Microdrives offer
30-percent better performance, 50 percent more resistance to
non-operating shock and power savings of more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On a per-megabyte basis, the Microdrive costs 40 to 60 times as
much as a conventional PC hard drive, but only a half to a third as
much as flash memory, the current standard in handheld devices. In
addition, few current devices can handle more than 128 megabytes of
flash memory at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The new drives weigh less than 1 ounce. By contrast, IBM noted,
its first 1-gigabyte drive, introduced in 1980, was the size of a
refrigerator, weighed 550 pounds and cost $40,000.

THESTREET.COM'S NEW SURVEY TURNS INVESTMENT RATINGS TOPSY-TURVY 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TheStreet.com yesterday joined a growing cadre of print and
online publications and services that rate stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This cottage industry is growing so fast that pretty soon we'll
need a service to rate services that rate analysts. (That's my free
idea of the week for venture capitalists.)
</P>
<P>
   While they can be confusing and sometimes contradictory, these
services are a good tool for investors who wonder if they should
take the advice of the analyst they just saw on CNBC or pay for
Wall Street research being offered by many online brokers and
financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com's survey is the first to combine quantitative with
qualitative data. This methodology resulted in several upsets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it names Morgan Stanley as the top research firm.
Merrill Lynch, rated No. 1 by Institutional Investor magazine and
the Wall Street Journal, ranks only third in TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Morgan Stanley's prominent Internet analyst Mary
Meeker, the perennial favorite in the II survey, comes in third on
TheStreet.com. She was outranked by Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's
coming-on-strong Net guru.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, II had the analyst-rating game to itself. Its
annual All America Research Team became the Wall Street equivalent
of the Academy Awards, and analysts who made the list often found
greater fame, fortune and calls from headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Academy Awards, the II survey is criticized for
being little more than a popularity contest. The results are based
on a survey of institutional investors _ such as pension fund and
mutual fund managers _ who are the main clients for brokerage house
research.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Hollywood, some analysts carried on
behind-the-scenes lobbying campaigns to garner votes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, II says on its Web site: ``To mitigate the likelihood
of extraordinary vote-generating activities on the part of firms or
analysts during the fieldwork, it is the policy of Institutional
Investor not to reveal the details relating to certain aspects of
the survey execution process.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the Wall Street Journal jumped into the game.
Its quantitative survey _ which usually comes out in late June _ is
based solely on analysts' stock-picking and earnings-forecasting
ability. It uses data provided by Zacks Investment Research but is
switching to First Call this year.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com's analysis combines objective and subjective
analysis. It was spearheaded by Laurie Meisler, who spent the past
18 years running II's All Star project.
</P>
<P>
   Like II, TheStreet.com surveyed institutional investors, but it
focused on a smaller number of the bigger firms. Instead of a
write-in ballot, investors chose from a list of analysts nominated
by their brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions were asked to rate analysts on six factors, such as
``well-connected, makes money for me, saved me from disaster and
tells us the truth,'' Meisler says.
</P>
<P>
   Any analyst that received at least one vote from any of the 138
instiutions that responded was then rated based on his or her
stock-picking prowess, using data from IBES International.
</P>
<P>
   ``We calculated what would happen (over a one-year period ending
in February) if you bought what analysts said to buy and held as
long as they told us to hold and sold when they told us to sell,''
says Scott Rosen, director of research with IBES
</P>
<P>
   To come up with a final score for each analyst, TheStreet.com
gave 70 percent weighting to the popularity poll and 30 percent to
the cold hard numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that stock picking is one of the criteria voters
would use, so we didn't want to make it 50/50,'' Meisler says.
</P>
<P>
   By including quantitative data, Meisler thinks her new survey
turns up some unsung heroes such as Daren Marhula, who covers
health care distributors for the lesser-known firm U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ``He ranked near the bottom in voting but got 100
(the highest score possible) in stock picking,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com survey suffers from the same drawback as the II
and Journal studies: All three come out only once a year and use
numbers that are quickly outdated. Even the day-old Street.com
report lists analysts with firms they have already left. Some of
the departures are noted, but some _ such as Rick Shutte, formerly
of Goldman Sachs _ are not.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem for  &LR; www.bulldogresearch.com &LR; . Launched May
1, this Web site is the most dynamic, comprehensive and interactive
analyst rating tool to date. While other surveys cover hundreds of
analysts, this one ranks 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   You can search the site for top analysts by company or sector.
Analysts are ranked separately on their earnings forecasts and
stock recommendations. Results are shown for time periods ranging
from one quarter to several years, and are updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like there's almost too much information, or maybe it's
just poorly organized or labeled. The folks in New York who run
this site say they're making it more user friendly.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, a San Francisco startup called StarMine will
introduce a Web site similar to Bulldog Research.com, but it will
use stars instead of paw prints to rate analysts.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine, like Bulldog, will use IBES data, but will develop
different formulas for interpreting the data. StarMine is already
selling its services to institutional investors. One product it
sells is enhanced earnings estimates, which give more weight to
estimates from analysts with good track records than bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation to all these services is that they are
retrospective. There's no easy way the average investor _ without
direct access to Wall Street research or other expensive services _
can find out what a specific analyst thinks a specific company will
earn in the future, or what stocks he or she is recommending.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's proprietary. You have to pay big bucks to IBES or be a
customer of the brokerage firm'' to get that information, says Joe
Gatto, chief executive officer of StarMine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some institutional investors don't think Wall Street
research is worth the paper it's written on. (Yes, these firms
still produce hard-copy reports, some as big as small laptops.)
</P>
<P>
   The Catch-22 with analysts is that the more popular they become,
the more time they spend doing things that promote their firms'
investment banking business (namely stock underwriting, where the
real money is), and the less time they spend doing pure research.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it makes sense to look for up-and-coming analysts,
and to use any report or recommendation as one tool in your
investment tool kit.

INTEL BRINGS OUT REINFORCEMENTS FOR PROCESSOR WAR  &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Rolling out some heavy artillery for an emerging battle with
startup Transmeta, Intel Monday unveiled five processors for
notebook PCs, including one that could rival its challenger's
much-ballyhooed Crusoe chip in low power consumption.
<P>
   Among the new Intel chips is a low-power mobile Pentium III
designed for 3-pound ``ultraportable'' laptops. Running at 600
megahertz on AC power and, via Intel's SpeedStep technology, 500
megahertz on batteries, the chip breaks no new ground in clock
speed, but it will burn far less power than any previous Pentium.
In battery mode, it requires only 1.1 volts and consumes less than
1 watt in typical use, according to Intel, compared with about 2
watts for previous mobile Pentium IIIs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of ultraportables barely exceed 1 million units worldwide,
but market research company International Data Corp. recently
projected that they will double next year. By 2003, Intel said, it
expects that such units will account for 10 to 15 percent of all
notebook PC sales, which by then should be approaching 35 million
units.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement also included the fastest mobile PC
processor yet, a Pentium III that runs at 750 megahertz on AC power
and 600 megahertz on batteries. In its entry-level Celeron line,
the Santa Clara chip giant added 600- and 650-megahertz mobile
chips plus an extra-low-power version running at 500 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   All five chips are available immediately, according to Intel.
Major notebook vendors such as Compaq, Dell, Fujitsu, IBM, NEC,
Sony and Toshiba are using them in notebooks being introduced this
week and at next week's PC Expo trade show, as well as in
back-to-school models to be announced later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much battery life users can expect from notebooks
with the new chips depends on other hardware variables, such as
screen size and the applications in use. Most notebook
manufacturers today claim around three hours of typical use per
charge for their larger models and two hours or less for
ultraportables, which usually have smaller batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips aren't likely to change those numbers much, but
they will allow notebookmakers to offer higher performance while
maintaining battery life at current levels, according to Frank
Spindler, vice president and general manager of Intel's Mobile
Platforms Group.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta's Crusoe has attracted intense media and industry
attention since its unveiling in January, largely because of the
company's claims that the Windows version of the chip will use less
than a watt of power and that notebooks incorporating it could run
all day on a single battery charge. IBM, Compaq and Gateway, among
others, are expected to demonstrate prototype Crusoe-based laptops
at next week's show.
</P>
<P>
   Those systems won't ship to customers until around October,
according to Transmeta spokesman Ed McKernan. But when they do, he
insisted, they will offer significantly better battery life, lower
weight and less heat than notebooks using the chips Intel announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's low-wattage claims are based on benchmarks that emulate
standard office applications, but in real life, McKernan argued,
users increasingly run graphics-intensive applications that demand
more of the processor.
</P>
<P>
   A Crusoe chip, for example, will consume only about 1 watt when
playing a DVD movie, he said. In a demonstration during yesterday's
Intel announcement, the 600-megahertz, ultralow-power Pentium III
used 3 to 3.5 watts most of the time while playing an ``Austin
Powers'' DVD, though at times it dropped to less than 1 watt.
</P>
<P>
   The Transmeta chips will also have a lower maximum power
consumption _ a variable that has little effect on overall battery
life but is important to notebook manufacturers, who have to make
sure their systems can handle the peak load and resulting heat.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said the maximum _ known in the industry as ``thermal
design power'' _ for its ultralow-power 600-megahertz Pentium III
will be 9.6 watts; for its 750-megahertz mobile processor the
figure will be 15.8 watts. The maximum figure for Transmeta's
Crusoe chips, according to McKernan, will be less than 5 watts.
</P>
<P>
   McKernan also noted that Crusoe has a memory controller built in
and is designed to work with low-power graphics chips; Intel's
mobile Pentiums require a separate memory controller and AGP
graphics, both of which use additional power, he said. The
Transmeta spokesman also said Crusoe will cost notebookmakers less
than $200. Intel's 750-megahertz mobile chip costs $562 in
quantity, while the low-power 600-megahertz Pentium III is $316.
