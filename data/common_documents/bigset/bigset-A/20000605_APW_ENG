<HEADLINE> Blazers Lose 15-point Lead in 4th  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For 38 minutes, the Portland Trail Blazers
repelled every charge the Los Angeles Lakers made. Then the roof
caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's 15-point lead evaporated in a 6{-minute stretch of
the fourth quarter when the Blazers couldn't make a basket. The
Lakers hit three critical 3-pointers, tied the game and then put it
away over the final 1{ minutes for an 89-84 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost this game in one quarter,'' said Scottie Pippen, who
came to Portland this season wanting to add a championship to the
six he won with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers clinched the Western Conference finals 4-3
and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize we sort of made cowards of ourselves in the fourth
quarter,'' Pippen said. ''We played like we were fatigued and they
gained the momentum they needed to pull this game out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers missed 13 consecutive shots in the 6{ minutes
despite getting good looks at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got shots we wanted and didn't hit them,'' said Steve
Smith, who scored 12 of his 18 points over the end of the third and
start of the fourth to propel the Blazers to the 15-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This game and whole series has been a series of runs. The game
of basketball is runs,'' he said. ''We had a great chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it even more painful was the fact that the Blazers all
but made Shaquille O'Neal disappear for three quarters. He had nine
points at halftime and was scoreless in the third quarter when
Portland led by 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were playing their best ball the whole game,'' O'Neal
said. ''We were scratching and clawing and with eight minutes left
we clamped down.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers quickly erasing their deficit, the Blazers went
to Rasheed Wallace, who came up empty time after time despite
leading the team with 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   He missed twice on one possession, then a jumper by Bonzi Wells
went in and out. Pippen missed, then Wallace missed three straight
and the Blazers failed to grab offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I blew some layups in the post, missed some jumpers. I'll live
and die with those shots,'' Wallace said in a subdued locker room.
''It's upsetting, but you've got to live another day. We played as
hard as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers insisted they weren't looking ahead to the finals
when they opened the fourth quarter ahead 71-58.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our guys did an outstanding job for the full 48
minutes,'' coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''Our focus, our concentration
was there. Our defensive intensity was there. We did a lot of
things right for most of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said the momentum change in the fourth quarter affected
the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to be aggressive and continue to take the ball to
the basket, but the momentum of the game shifted. When that happens
the officiating tends to shift and we didn't get the calls that we
were getting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaq was able to camp out in the lane much longer knowing all
of us had five fouls. The officials never focused on that and if
you allowed him to stay in the lane like that, when you have to
sink back in and guys are shooting the ball as well as they shot
from the 3-point line in the fourth quarter, then they're going to
be a tough team to beat.''

<HEADLINE> Brian Shaw Keys Lakers Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Kobe Bryant broke his hand in the Los
Angeles Lakers' exhibition opener nearly eight months ago, little
did they know it would be one of their best breaks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the Lakers placed a telephone call to Brian
Shaw, who ironically, was part of the six players Portland traded
for Scottie Pippen, and then was released by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Kobe doesn't break his hand, I might be up in Oakland on a
fishing boat fishing,'' Shaw said with a smile after helping the
Lakers rally for an 89-84 victory over the Trail Blazers on Sunday
in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. ''I'm just happy to be
here, happy to have the opportunity to be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old guard certainly was against the Blazers, scoring
11 points in 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His 3-pointer that banked in with 4.4 seconds left in the third
quarter cut Portland's lead to 71-58, and he made two more 3s
during a 15-0 run in the final period that tied the game 75-all
with four minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brian Shaw banked in a 3-pointer, and that was a big play that
enabled them to begin cutting the lead,'' Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After Shaw hit that 3-pointer off the glass, we thought that
was the turning point,'' Lakers forward Glen Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't call (bank), I can't lie,'' Shaw said with a smile.
''I've been in a pretty good rhythm this whole series, stroking
them from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   A first-round draft pick of the Boston Celtics in 1988, Shaw was
limited to one game for the Blazers last season due to injury, but
averaged 4.1 points in 74 games as a Lakers' reserve this season
and 6.0 points in the playoffs before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he turned the game around for us,'' Lakers assistant
coach Tex Winter said. ''He's a veteran, we're very fortunate to
have him. He was really a fine pickup for us, we needed depth
behind Ron Harper after Kobe got hurt. He gave us another big
guard, (coach) Phil (Jackson) likes those big guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Shaquille O'Neal played together for the Orlando Magic
in the 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons. O'Neal put Shaw's jersey on
after the Lakers beat the Blazers 103-91 in Game 4 of this series
to show support for the 6-foot-6 Shaw, who was suspended for that
game for coming off the bench during an altercation two nights
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''B. Shaw carried us, he made shot big shots, some big 3s,''
said Lakers forward Robert Horry, who helped out himself with 12
points off the bench. ''Once he got us close, we took care of
business. We closed them out like we were supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers outscored the Blazers 29-9 to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our defense was lucky, they still got a lot of easy shots,
they just missed them,'' Horry said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the comeback showed a lot about the Lakers' character.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were faced with adversity today, and throughout the entire
series,'' he said. ''I wasn't nervous, but it wasn't looking good.
I'm not amazed, maybe it will sink in a little more. This team has
a lot of fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shaw and the Lakers face the Indiana Pacers in the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll get to see my old teammate now as a coach,'' he said with
a smile, referring to Pacers coach Larry Bird with whom he played
in Boston.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake and several strong
aftershocks rocked the Indonesian island of Sumatra, leaving at least 44 dead
and thousands homeless, authorities said Monday. The Indonesian Meteorological
and Geophysical Service said the quake, measuring magnitude 7.3, was centered
beneath the Indian Ocean, about 400 miles northwest of Jakarta and 60 east of
Bengkulu, a city of about 1.2 million. The death toll was expected to rise. In
Western Japan, a moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.7 hit
Monday morning, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.

probation under first offender status.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Player Defects to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Cuban baseball player who hit a key home run last
year against the Baltimore Orioles was reportedly aboard a U.S.
Coast Guard cutter Sunday, one of 31 would-be defectors found on a
boat stranded near Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Gus Dominguez said Sunday that Coast Guard officials have
told him that Andy Morales, a 24-year-old third baseman and
designated hitter, is one of the Cubans aboard the cutter
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials
would not confirm that Sunday. The Coast Guard said the Cubans were
aboard a power boat that ran out of fuel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are being interviewed by INS officials on the cutter,
INS spokesman Rodney Germain said. Those that might have legitimate
claims to political asylum will be brought to the United States for
processing, he said, while the others could be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Morales would be the latest Cuban national team member to
defect, following such current major leaguers as New York Yankees
pitcher Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez; his half-brother, San
Francisco Giant pitcher and 1997 World Series MVP Livan Hernandez;
and New York Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 Cuban baseball players have defected over the last 10
years. Calls to the Cuban Interests Section in Washington on Sunday
went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cuban national team's 12-6 win over the Orioles last May
in Baltimore, Morales delivered the clinching blow, a three-run
homer to center field in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   He zoomed around the bases with his arms spread wide, looking
like a kid imitating an airplane. Zigzagging his way home, he
cheered his teammates in the third base dugout and pointed to the
sky before he touched the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles left fielder B.J. Surhoff called him an ''idiot.'' But
center fielder Brady Anderson said Morales' behavior didn't offend
him, saying, ''Maybe that's the biggest home run he'll ever hit in
his life. Let him take his home run trot, big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, who represents several Cuban players who have
defected, said that he spoke to Morales in Baltimore, despite tight
security by Cuban officials who feared defections. He said Morales
approached him before the game during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was standing on the rail in left field and he told me he
wanted to do something and asked that I help him,'' Dominguez said.
''We couldn't do anything for him then, but we stayed in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Dominguez said, he was surprised when Morales'
father-in-law called him Saturday and told him the player had
defected. He thought Morales would wait until the Cuban team next
played in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when you are desperate, you will do what it takes,''
Dominguez said. Morales' wife apparently remains in Cuba, Dominguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said it will be up to Morales to decide if he wants to
remain in the United States, which would subject him to baseball's
amateur draft, or become a free agent by traveling to a third
country such as Costa Rica as several Cuban players have done.
</P>
<P>
   Professional sports are banned in Cuba. Top athletes are given
favored treatment by the communist government, but salaries and
living standards pale beside those of millionaire athletes abroad.

<HEADLINE> Murder Charges Dropped Vs. Lewis  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Murder charges against Ray Lewis will be dropped
and he will plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of
justice under a deal struck Sunday night, a lawyer for the
Baltimore Ravens linebacker said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Samuel confirmed to The Associated Press that Lewis would
not do any jail time and receive a maximum term of 12 months'
probation under first offender status.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the murder charge, aggravated assault charges
against the linebacker would be dropped in exchange for his
testimony about what he saw the night of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will be required to testify against his two fellow
defendants, Samuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said prosecutor Paul Howard told him that Lewis would be
the next witness to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Howard could not be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have presented little proof that Lewis assaulted
anyone during a Jan. 31 street fight that left two men dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like the prosecution is starting to run out of gas,
and it doesn't seem like they had much in the tank in the first
place,'' said Irwin R. Kramer, a defense attorney from suburban
Baltimore who is following the case.
</P>
<P>
   Without much direct evidence linking Lewis to the stabbings of
Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker, prosecutors are trying to
convince the jury that Lewis participated in a conspiracy to cover
up the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what he is charged with. Lewis and two friends,
Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley, are facing only the more
serious charges of murder, felony murder and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evidence of guilt here,'' said Samuel. ''So all of
the post-conduct circumstances are irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' defense attorneys admit that the NFL star gave a
misleading statement to police on the morning after the killings,
but there has been other testimony that suggests Lewis participated
in some kind of cover-up:
</P>
<P>
   --Duane Fassett, the driver of Lewis' rented limousine,
reluctantly admitted on the stand that after the brawl Lewis told
everyone in the stretch Lincoln Navigator to ''just keep your mouth
shut and don't say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   --Evelyn Sparks, who was riding in the limousine, said she saw
another passenger dump a white hotel laundry bag into a garbage bin
outside a fast food restaurant. Prosecutors say the bag contained
Lewis' bloodstained white suit, which has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   --Sparks also said a photograph of Lewis' entourage, taken at the
Cobalt Lounge on the night of the killings, was destroyed by
Jessica Robertson, a woman described as Lewis' girlfriend. ''She
said she burned it,'' Sparks testified.
</P>
<P>
   All this can be used as circumstantial evidence of guilt. But
it's more effective when combined with more solid evidence, Kramer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they have to do is produce evidence that Ray Lewis was
involved in the fight that led to these deaths,'' Kramer said.
''Without additional evidence, one has to question the strength of
the prosecution's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner also will have to weigh
whether dismissing charges against one or more defendants will
signal to the jurors that she considers the remaining ones to be
guilty, Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a difficult two weeks for Howard, who at times has
shown exasperation at witnesses who change their testimony on the
stand and at a judge who sustains most objections made by the
defense. But he says he is not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you fight for justice and what you think is right ... you
can't be dissuaded or frustrated,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard was to try to finish his case Monday or early Tuesday
after calling forensics experts and medical examiners. He also
would like to put the limousine driver back on the stand, but
Fassett is fighting the second subpoena in Maryland.

   SONOMA, Calif. (AP) -- Ted Graber, the Beverly Hills interior
designer who refurbished the White House family quarters for first
lady Nancy Reagan, died Saturday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   He died in an assisted living facility from complications of
Alzheimer's disease, said his assistant of 45 years, Jean Mathison.
</P>
<P>
   Graber received attention in the 1980s when he directed a
massive remodeling of the White House living quarters for Nancy
Reagan. After the Reagans returned to Los Angeles, Graber remodeled
their Bel-Air home and the president's Century City office.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Los Angeles, Graber began his career in 1945, with
clients that included Alfred and Betsy Bloomingdale, Walter and Lee
Annenberg and, from Hollywood, Joan Crawford, Jack and Mary Benny,
and Jack Warner.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for combining modern, comfortable furniture with
antiques and wood floors to create stylish interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Graber retired to Northern California in 1989.

   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Julian ''Ozzie'' Osborne, a columnist for
The Miami Herald, shot himself to death a day after quitting his
job, police said. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who wrote about life in the Keys, died Saturday in a
Key West hospital. He shot himself late Friday with a .22-caliber
handgun while he stood on the Riviera Canal Bridge, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We at the Herald are deeply saddened,'' said Martin Baron, the
newspaper's executive editor. ''Ozzie made wonderful contributions
over the years to this newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues said he was depressed over leaving his
20-hour-a-week job at the newspaper's Key West bureau. He quit
after he was asked to write six columns a week instead of four.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Osborne wrote a note to his editors apologizing for
resigning on short notice and said he needed to tend to family
business in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne worked at the Herald for 13 years. His column, ''Over
the Fence,'' appeared on Sunday mornings. He reported on ordinary
''Conchs,'' as Keys residents are known locally, to famous
underwater treasure hunters, such as the late Mel Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   His last signed column, published a week ago, profiled an artist
who teaches young children.
</P>
<P>
   A regular vacationer to the Cayman Islands, Osborne ended up in
Key West due to a reservations mix-up. He enjoyed the color of the
island city so much he moved there permanently in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two nephews.
Robert Cochrane:
</P>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Robert B. Cochrane, a former Baltimore Sun
war correspondent who covered the Japanese surrender concluding
World War II, has died. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Cochrane died May 29 of bone cancer, his family said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He originally covered the Navy when the war began but was later
assigned by the Sun to the Pacific theater. He was one of 200
journalists to witness the Japanese formally surrender during a
22-minute ceremony aboard the USS Missouri anchored in Tokyo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The story was included in ''Masterpieces of World War II
Reporting,'' a 1962 book that included stories by Ernie Pyle,
Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Ernest Hemmingway.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 3, 1909, in Asheville, N.C., he began his career at
The Asheville Citizen. After graduating from Duke University, he
worked for the Durham (N.C.) Herald before moving to the Sun in
1934.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Cochrane opened the Sun's Tokyo bureau. In 1946,
he became the first employee of WMAR-TV, which was owned by the
Sun. Cochrane retired in 1975 as the station's programming director
and moved to Florida 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Juanita Shockley Reichard.

<HEADLINE> A Poet Comforts Civil War Wounded  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The poet moved slowly through the hospital
wards, a large, gray-bearded man dressed in gray with a
broad-brimmed hat and a kindly, affectionate air.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Whitman was more a visitor than a nurse, offering his
attention to the wounded and sick from a dozen Civil War
battlefields, listening to stories of the war from Union soldiers
who were little more than boys. Passing out small gifts: a sheet of
writing paper, a postage stamp, an orange, a piece of candy, a
cigar. He wrote letters home for those who could not write
themselves, took messages from dying men for mothers, wives and
sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   ''His presence seemed to light up the place,'' a friend
remembered. When he turned to leave, the voices called out, ''Walt!
Walt! Walt! Come again! Come again!''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was 43, author of the ever-changing, controversial and
groundbreaking ''Leaves of Grass'' and a former Brooklyn, N.Y.,
newspaper editor when his mission among the casualties of war began
with a family quest.
</P>
<P>
   The New York newspapers had listed his brother, George Whitman,
as among the wounded at the battle of Fredericksburg in Virginia
and Whitman went south in search of him.
</P>
<P>
   His brother was not seriously hurt, but Whitman was asked to
accompany other injured men back to the hospitals at Washington and
found his life had changed.
</P>
<P>
   The poet found work as a government clerk to sustain himself and
began the hospital visits that were to last for most of three
years. At war's end he estimated that he had made ''over 600 visits
or tours and went ... among from 80,000 to 100,000 of the wounded
and sick, as sustainer of spirit and body ... in time of need.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the war, Washington saw the establishment at
least 56 hospitals set up in camps and barracks, private homes,
churches, the arsenal, hotels, warehouses, the city hall, the U.S.
Patent Office and for a time, the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman recalled that some hastily built hospitals sprawled
building after building until they appeared about the size of a
small town, if one could imagine a town that held only ''wounds,
sickness and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin G. Murray, writing in Washington History, the journal of
the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., said Whitman spoke with
admiration of the doctors and nurses with ''everything bent to save
a life from the very grip of the destroyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the art of war was far more advanced than the art of
medicine in the first half of the 1860s and many of the patients
Whitman visited were dying.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of 1865, more than 18,000 soldiers had died in
Washington hospitals, with many succumbing to disease, Murray
reports. The city's newspapers gave partial statistics: Deaths due
to gunshot wounds, 3,421; typhoid fever, 2,255, chronic diarrhea,
1,370; and amputation, 560.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's attention to the young men in the hospital wards, many
of whom he kissed, did not please all of the medical personnel; one
nurse called him ''odious.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chief surgeon of one of the largest hospitals later
offered this testimonial in an unsuccessful attempt to win Whitman
a government pension: ''I am of (the) opinion that no one person
who assisted in the hospitals during the war accomplished so much
good for the soldier and for the government as Mr. Whitman.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, of course, was a professional writer and the war and
the wounded, the city and its people, sustained his prose and
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drumtaps,'' published in 1865, contained battlefield and
campground poetry and the moving odes to Abraham Lincoln: ''When
Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed'' and ''O Captain, My
Captain.'' They were later folded into ''Leaves of Grass.''
Whitman's war experiences also resulted in ''Memorandum During the
War,'' ''Specimen Days'' and a volume of letters, ''The
Wound-Dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's sentry-guarded house on a wintry night was to
Whitman ''the White House of future poems, and dreams and dramas.''
Lit by a flooding moon etching the shadows of tree limbs on its
white walls, it was a place ''full of reality, full of illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Whitman's description of the marbled, tall-ceilinged
rooms of the Patent Office, recently a hospital for ''the worst
wounded of the war,'' but now swept clean and decorated for
Lincoln's 1865 inaugural ball:
</P>
<P>
   ''To-night, beautiful women, perfumes, the violin's sweetness,
the polka and the waltz; then the amputation, the blue face, the
groan, the glassy eye of the dying, the clotted rag, the odor of
wounds and blood, and many a mother's son amid strangers, passing
away untended there ... and much for nurse to do, and much for
surgeon.''

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands PM Taken Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A rebel group fighting in the
Solomon Islands took the prime minister hostage Monday and put up
road blocks around the capital, officials in New Zealand said.
</P>
<P>
   Six armed rebels captured Prime Minister Bartholemew Ulufa'alua
early Monday morning and were holding him in ''protective
custody,'' a rebel spokesman told a Solomons Islands radio station
monitored by officials in Wellington, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports that other government officials also had been
taken hostage appeared to be incorrect, New Zealand Foreign
Ministry spokesman Brad Pattersfield said. However, phone lines
were not working and details of the story remained sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were demanding that Ulufa'alua resign within 48
hours, said Pattersfield. He said it was unclear where he was being
held, or what had motivated the apparent coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The armed rebels from the Malaita Eagle Force captured the prime
minister early Monday morning and were holding him hostage on the
main Solomon island of Guadalcanal, Pattersfield said.
</P>
<P>
   In Canberra, Australia, the country's Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade said the rebels had overrun key installations
overnight in the capital, Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita Eagle Force rebel group has taken over police
stations, the Government Telecommunications Center and key
intersections, the department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how many fighters the shadowy rebel
group had used in its attack, or what kind of support it was
receiving from the island's people.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in New Zealand said the Malaita Eagle Force also had
raided a police armory in Honiara and stolen weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Honiara Mayor Donald Fugui issued warned the city's residents
Monday to stay home, Pattersfield said. The streets were reportedly
calm Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent coup in the Solomons was the second recently in the
South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks ago, armed rebels captured Fiji's prime
minister and more than 30 legislators in that country's parliament.
Since then, the military has taken power and accepted many of the
rebels' demands, including dismissing the prime minister, the first
ever elected from Fiji's ethnic Indian minority. On Monday, the
hostages were still being held in parliament as the military sought
a peace deal with the coup leader, George Speight.
</P>
<P>
   In the Solomons, the Malaita Eagle Force and the Isatabu Freedom
Movement rebel groups have been fighting each other for 18 months
on the Solomons' main island, Guadalcanal. The Solomons are about
2,230 miles northwest of Wellington and 1,600 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabu force has been fighting to push thousands of
migrants from the nearby island of Malaita off Guadalcanal.
Honiara, located on Guadalcanal, is largely populated by Malaitans.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita Eagle Force is resisting that effort. The fighting
has left at least 50 people killed or missing, and has forced
20,000 to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between the warring factions in the Solomon Islands
were called off last week, shortly before they were to have
started.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, it was not immediately possible to reach officials of
the Malaita Eagle Force to discuss the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malaitan Eagle Force spokesman Andrew Nori told the
Solomons radio station that rebels had taken over Honiara in an
attempt to accelerate the peace process and prevent ethnic violence
from tearing apart the island nation, New Zealand's foreign
ministry reported.
</P>
<P>
   The militia apparently was acting in cooperation with members of
the Solomons' police ''field force'' -- a small paramilitary unit
which acts as the Solomons Islands' de facto army.
</P>
<P>
   The raid on the police armory added to the arms the militia has
already amassed, most of which have been found by digging through
World War II arms dumps. Guadalcanal was the scene of bitter fight
between U.S. and Japanese forces during the war.

<HEADLINE> Pulp Fiction Fan Donates Books  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- For 30 years, it was love. George Kelley
and the little numbers who kept him company in all those hotel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   They'd always own a little piece of his heart. And a great big
part of his home. Or so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley had another love, the one he married, and she said
he'd have to choose.
</P>
<P>
   He knew she was right. The affair was over, and for the sake of
clean socks.
</P>
<P>
   So Kelley sent packing his collection of 25,000 volumes of pulp
fiction that had turned his basement into a library -- and an
obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife gave me an ultimatum,'' he recalls. ''She said, 'I
can't get to the washer and dryer. You have to make a decision
between the books and clean clothes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The books are now at the University at Buffalo's Lockwood
Library. Five years after Kelley donated them to his alma mater,
librarians have catalogued each volume.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time many of the cheesy sci-fi, romance and
detective novels from decades past have found a place in the
National Bibliographic Database, let alone a permanent spot on a
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Libraries were kind of snobby,'' says Lockwood's director,
Judith Adams-Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   In their heyday, pulps were meant to be quick reads that, at 10
cents to 25 cents a pop, could be tossed out at story's end. The
low-grade paper gave pulps their name, and hardly encouraged their
saving.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, now 50, began collecting them as an adolescent. One
summer, after returning from sleep-away camp, he found that his
mother had disposed of 1,000 comic books, leaving his bedroom and
closet disturbingly clean.
</P>
<P>
   He started with science-fiction paperbacks published by ACE
Books, double books bound back to back with two covers. With ACE's
western and mystery doubles, the habit grew as Kelley did.
</P>
<P>
   When he worked for Opinion Research Associates of Madison, Wis.,
in the 1970s, Kelley logged 100,000 air miles a year and visited
bookstores wherever he went. He'd read three or four paperbacks a
day, in cabs, airports, hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''My worst nightmare is to be in a doctor's office with nothing
to read,'' says Kelley, who chronicles his reading habit like an
addict. ''I got into the Hardy Boys early on... I just never got
rid of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Following tips from readers and collectors, Kelley chased down
titles through used-book stores and flea markets, amassing a
collection of books and magazines that runs from detective stories
to science fiction, through action adventures, westerns and
erotica. Published from World War II through the 1980s, they
include lesser-known authors as well as masters of the genre, like
Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Ed McBain.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, banished to the basement when the weight began
to damage the floors upstairs in his home, is tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   It includes complete sets of Galaxy Magazine, first to publish
Ray Bradbury's classic story ''Fahrenheit 451,'' and Locus, a
semiprofessional ''fanzine'' begun by devotees of sci-fi in the
1970s. There also is an original copy, worth about $500, of
''Junkie'' by William Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These books just don't exist anymore,'' says Kelley, who
teaches business administration at Erie Community College. ''It's
kind of a fugitive literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley put the books in zippered plastic bags early on, hoping
to keep pages from discoloring. It worked, and the books remain
bagged at Lockwood.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Kelley, works like Carter Brown's ''The Hellcat''
won't be lost. The cover, featuring a bikini-clad siren and a
cheetah, beckons: ''Al Wheeler tangles with a fiery redhead who has
a flaming temper -- a sex kitten who can claw as she caresses, kiss
...as she kills.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Hank Janson's ''It's Bedtime Baby,'' with this cover tease:
''Eleven suspects with two things in common. A tattoo on their
bottom and a cance led membership card in a college Virgin's
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Some estimate the collection is worth a fortune. But there is
value beyond dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say pulp fiction provides a trove of popular tropes,
political trends and culture traits.
</P>
<P>
   ''These books actually document our changing tastes and social
mores,'' says David Schmid, who teaches popular literature and
culture courses at the University at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The collection has already proved to be a handy resource. When
Oxford American Magazine was serializing an Elliot Chase novel,
''Dark Wings Has My Angel,'' even the author's family didn't have a
copy. The university did.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what people did when there was no TV,'' says Kelley,
who has a Ph.D. in English from the university, as well as master's
degrees in English, library science and business administration. He
has written numerous articles on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what people spent their beer money on. To understand what
was going on in that time you have to have a collection like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams-Volpe hopes to create a database of detective fiction for
academics, cross-referencing psychological traits and such
preferences of villains and victims as favorite foods and locales.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to turn the cover art of some volumes into
T-shirts and refrigerator magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the collector continues to read, mostly
science-fiction and mystery these days. ''But hardcover because of
the bigger print,'' the bespectacled Kelley says, laughing.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Egyptian Cop Claims Harassment  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Mohammed El Ghanam says he fears for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The retired police colonel is sure his former colleagues follow
him, tap his phones, even bump his car in traffic. He's seeking
safety in Swiss asylum but says the Egyptian government won't let
him leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for such harassment, El Ghanam believes, is his
increasingly public denunciation of alleged corruption and human
rights abuses by the government he served for two decades, which
his father and grandfather served with honor before him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am fighting the Egyptian regime because it is a dictatorial
regime,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   But El Ghanam's crusade is marred by some stunningly eccentric
behavior, actions the government suggests lie behind his
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   He shot and wounded a doctor in a struggle in a government
hospital in 1997, and he's accused of shooting a tax inspector in
the leg in a land dispute two years later. He faces criminal
charges in both cases, serious enough, the government says, to keep
him in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, El Ghanam acknowledges he never thought to expose
government wrong -- indeed, loyally looked the other way when he saw
abuse and corruption -- until his father's death in the government
hospital made him angry.
</P>
<P>
   El Ghanam accuses police officials of wrongdoing ranging from
gathering financial favors to torturing prisoners. His allegations
are based as much on newspaper articles and reports from human
rights groups as on any personal knowledge gleaned as head of the
legal department in the Interior Ministry, which oversees the
police.
</P>
<P>
   In one essay printed in an opposition paper, El Ghanam discussed
various newspaper reports on three prisoners who suffocated in an
overcrowded jail cell in Port Said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this had happened anywhere else in the world, the Interior
Ministry would have been held accountable. But an Egyptian's life
has no value,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In another commentary, he said ''tens of thousands'' of
Egyptians are detained without trial, sometimes for years.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians can be jailed up to six months without trial while
their cases are investigated, under emergency laws declared to
combat Islamic terrorism. Additionally, prosecutors commonly have
suspects released after six months and immediately rearrest them,
with some people detained for years without trial.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Interior legal department, El Ghanam says he
decided whether Egyptian Christians could get permits to build
their churches. Muslims do not need permits to build places of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I speak about the persecution of Christians, it will be a
big problem for the regime,'' he told The Associated Press. ''If I
wrote about it, I would be hit by a car the next day and killed.''
He said he would say more only when he is outside Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Embassy officials in Cairo found El Ghanam's allegations
credible enough to consider his asylum request.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it rather normal that for personal reasons people can
change attitudes,'' said embassy counselor Livia Leu.
</P>
<P>
   After a long interview at the embassy last fall, El Ghanam was
granted a visa so he could make his case for asylum in Switzerland.
But the Egyptian government has imposed a travel ban pending
resolution of the two shooting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Until his father's death in 1997, which he attributes to
incompetent, corrupt medical staff, the 43-year-old El Ghanam had
had little reason to oppose the Egyptian status quo. He was a
high-ranking insider not only in the bureaucracy, but also in the
social elite.
</P>
<P>
   His father was an army colonel, his grandfather a judge. He
vacationed in Europe. He graduated from the police academy and
studied in Rome on a government grant. His doctoral thesis compared
Italian and Egyptian sentencing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Through two decades in the police ministry, El Ghanam said, he
occasionally saw or heard evidence of abuse. But before 1997, he
said he spoke out only ''softly,'' for the most part in texts on
police and legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew for many years that there was corruption, there was
abuse of human rights. But I wasn't involved, I wasn't
responsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oversized, gold-rimmed glasses perch on his round face under a
military-neat haircut -- the picture of self-control he admits he
lost when he scuffled with his father's doctor. El Ghanam says the
shooting was accidental, and he and the doctor, who was wounded in
the leg, settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement issued last month after foreign newspapers
carried accounts of El Ghanam's allegations, Egyptian government
spokesman Nabil Osman described the shooting as premeditated and
said the case remains open.
</P>
<P>
   Osman also alleged El Ghanam shot a tax inspector last year, but
El Ghanam says that case was concocted by his enemies in the police
ministry. As evidence, he produces what he says is an official
police report that concludes the gun allegedly used against the
inspector was incapable of firing.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Assad, a Middle East researcher for Freedom House, a
Washington-based human rights group, has seen the report. He said
Freedom House could not dismiss El Ghanam's suggestion that the
criminal charges had been fabricated to stop him from speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom House wrote to President Hosni Mubarak to ask that El
Ghanam be allowed to leave the country. The government response
cited the pending charges.
</P>
<P>
   Assad expressed concern at how slowly the Egyptian government
was handling the charges. He also noted El Ghanam's claims of being
followed and harassed. ''It increases our worry about his safety,''
Assad said.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, on El Ghanam's
behalf, demanded that the police ministry investigate allegations
he had been harassed.
</P>
<P>
   But the EOHR, one of the oldest and most respected of such
groups in the country -- its own leader has been jailed for
criticizing the government -- has not interviewed El Ghanam about
his human rights charges or asked his help in investigating wider
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because he is a victim, the EOHR must be careful of any
exaggeration,'' said Yousry Moustafa, an EOHR researcher.
</P>
<P>
   El Ghanam acknowledges the ambiguity of his crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am trying to tell the truth,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Denver Grandparents Help Military  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Don't tell Betty and Joe Tinianow about the
military's manpower problem. They've just contributed three
grandchildren to the officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   Not grandsons Brandon, Jeffrey or Ryan. The new second
lieutenants are Natalie, Tracy and Casey -- their granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just find that a sign of the times. None of the boys wanted
to go,'' said Betty. Five of the top ten graduates this year at the
Air Force Academy were women.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy was first, Casey sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think women are showing that they have the ability to do as
well or better in many fields, especially intellectual and
leadership fields, as men,'' said Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I will live to see it but I believe there will
be a woman president,'' said Joe, 76, whose parents fled Russia
during the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   While twins Tracy and Casey, both 21, were graduating at the top
of their class, Natalie, 22, managed to graduate with her class at
West Point despite blowing a knee on an obstacle course. She has a
screw in the injured knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went to both graduations,'' said Betty. Natalie is the
daughter of the Tinianows' daughter, Gerri. The twins are the
daughters of the Tinianows' son, Albert.
</P>
<P>
   The twins have always been precocious and Betty wasn't surprised
by their performance. ''They are in competition with each other all
the time. I thought Natalie did miraculously just to keep up with
the class and graduate after her surgery,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Tinianows' first contribution to the military. Son
Albert is a colonel and in charge of logistics for the Air Force
Space Command in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Joe was in the artillery in World War II. ''The only women
around were nurses.'' He soon married Betty, a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Betty said the grandparents were able to keep a close eye on
Natalie because she lived nearby. ''When she was in 10th or 11th
grade she said she wanted to go into the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''The twins came down from Montana (where their father was
stationed) about a year later and said they had seen a recruiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty said both twins knew the hardships of a military life, and
that it would mean the first real separation in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the time they poked their noses out they were Air Force
brats, and they knew what they were getting into,'' said Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Air Force has been wonderful to us. We've grown up in the
Air Force, and the people are just phenomenal,'' said Casey on
graduation day last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a woman is no different than being a man here,'' added
Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Albert, said, ''I think they wish they could start
serving right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Separated into different squadrons at the academy, the twins
will be back together this fall. The Air Force is sending them to
Northwestern University to become doctors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Missile Defense Plan  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Telling Russians they need not fear American
missile defense efforts, President Clinton went to their parliament
as well as their president with his message of support for
strengthening democratic rule and the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was addressing the Duma, the Russian parliament, before
his goodbye call on Putin. Then he was to fly on to Kiev, Ukraine,
before returning to Washington late tonight.
</P>
<P>
   In a summit statement Sunday, issued in the gilded splendor of
St. George's Hall in the Kremlin, the two presidents agreed there
is ''a dangerous and growing threat'' of nuclear missile strikes
from states outside the lines of world order. They called it a
potentially significant change in the strategic situation.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not agree on what to do about it. ''We're against
having a cure which is worse than the disease,'' Putin said at a
quick, summit-ending news conference -- two questions to each
president.
</P>
<P>
   It ended a long day's deliberations on arms control, economics,
global warming, terrorism and crime. Clinton and Putin conferred
first for well over an hour with only one aide apiece, then U.S.
and Russian delegations met at a long, blonde maple conference
table in St. Catherine's Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said afterward that he and Clinton had established good
business ties as well as personal relations. ''For me, President
Clinton is a person who is a very comfortable and pleasant partner
in negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one heard them calling each other Bill and Vladimir as in the
backslapping days of Boris Yeltsin, Putin's sponsor and
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   But there was room for some banter, as when Clinton pointed out
the three monkey pins climbing the shoulder of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's jacket. They represented an American saying,
''Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil,'' Clinton said.
''That's Madeleine's whole foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   His aim at the summit was to make the most of agreements set
before he and Putin discussed the hard points without settling
them. Clinton said even that was a good thing, ''the candor and
clarity of our disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said efforts to solve the differences would continue when
they meet at three international conferences later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the accords they did sign:
</P>
<P>
   --One to reduce the weapons-grade plutonium stockpiles of each
nation by 34 tons, a 20-year plan that will cost billions. The
United States will spend $200 million to help Russia get started,
and the administration is seeking international funding to keep it
going.
</P>
<P>
   --Another to establish an early warning center in Moscow, from
which U.S. and Russian military experts will exchange information
within minutes on the launching of ballistic missiles or space
vehicles detected by either nation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal covers only launchings that might intrude on Russian or
U.S. territory. It is supposed to reduce the danger that missiles
might be launched because of false warnings of an attack.
</P>
<P>
   They also signed a joint statement on strategic stability,
urging final approval of the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty
by the Senate -- where Republicans may balk at a term-ending
achievement for Clinton -- and looking toward a START III deal.
</P>
<P>
   But there were differences there, too. The START III blueprint
is for reductions on each side to between 2,000 and 2,500 nuclear
warheads, 1,000 fewer than in START II, which isn't in effect yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians want the follow-on treaty to cut weapons to 1,500
apiece, but Clinton said ''it would require us to change our
strategic plan and should be left for future negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The impasse on a proposed U.S. missile defense system was more
sharply etched. A limited system is being tested, and Clinton may
order it started, to guard against future attacks from rogue states
-- North Korea and Iraq are the two cited as possible threats.
</P>
<P>
   That would require changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said Putin
made ''absolutely clear'' that Russia opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he does not want to breach the ABM treaty, but he
did not state flatly that the United States would not exercise its
right to withdraw from the pact.
</P>
<P>
   On a Moscow radio call-in program Sunday night, interviewer
Aleksey Venediktov asked Clinton why he wouldn't accept Putin's
suggestion that they cooperate on a different kind of missile
defense. It would seek to down missiles soon after they are
launched, instead of trying to intercept them in space, which the
ABM treaty forbids.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is, we think it will take 10 years or more to
develop'' that kind of system, Clinton said. ''We expect to face
this threat in the United States within five years,'' when he said
the space-intercept system could be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it frightens Russians, obviously,'' Venediktov said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied: ''Yes, I understand, but I think they wouldn't
be frightened if they understand the exact nature of the
difference. ... If the U.S. has a missile defense that can stop a
couple of missiles from North Korea, does it have the potential to
upset what has kept us safe all these years, which is mutual
deterrence? We say no, the Russians say it might. So we're trying
to work that through.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Primary Season Ending  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY MASSEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- By the time Stephen Flance draws back the
curtain of a voting machine in New Mexico's presidential primary,
it will be too late to help the candidate of his choice -- three
months too late.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico is one of five states quietly bringing the primary
season to an end on Tuesday. Democrat Al Gore and Republican George
W. Bush clinched their nominations in early March -- before half the
states even voted.
</P>
<P>
   Flance, a Santa Fe real estate agent, supported Democrat Bill
Bradley and is none too happy to have his vote rendered meaningless
in the nominating process. Bradley quit the race after March's
Super Tuesday contests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have had a very timely impact on the presidential
race if this primary had been in February or early March. But once
again we find ourselves behind the curve and out of the action,''
Flance said.
</P>
<P>
   Also holding presidential primaries are Alabama, Montana, New
Jersey and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Flance plans to vote Tuesday because he's interested in state
and local races: Congretainly low for Kentucky's primary two weeks ago.
Only 14 percent of registered Democrats and 11 percent of
Republicans voted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is traditionally the presidential contest that draws people
to the polls, whether it's a primary or general election,'' said F.
Chris Garcia, a political science professor at the University of
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   George ''Jeep'' Gilliland, head of the New Mexico Federation of
Labor, said simply, ''We're out of the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rejected last year a proposal to move up the
date of the state's presidential primary to avert exactly what's
happening -- a primary with no presidential contest and only local
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic and Republican parties have left primary
election turnout efforts -- such as telephone banks -- to local
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gore and Bush campaigns in New Mexico already
have turned their attention to the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush visited Albuquerque last week, holding fund-raisers and
speaking on national defense matters at a rally that drew about 500
people. But not once at the rally did Bush appeal to people to turn
out for Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Albuquerque in late April. The 300 invited guests at
a town meeting were ''undecided'' voters -- Democrats, Republicans
and independents who will be needed to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, said the campaign relies on
volunteers rather than mailings or advertising to reach voters in
the late primary states such as New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big country and a long campaign. We save money where we
can and make the best use of volunteers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Look on Gore's campaign Web site for information about New
Mexico and there's no mention of Tuesday's primary. There is a
reminder of the voter registration deadline for the November
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Only New Mexicans registered as Democrats, Republicans or Green
Party voters can cast ballots in their respective primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 9,000 Greens account for roughly 1 percent of
statewide registration.
</P>
<P>
   Although the late presidential primaries may not matter, Garcia
said there's a strong chance that New Mexico, with its five
electoral votes, will receive more attention from the presidential
candidates as the general election nears.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico is among six Western states that have swung between
Republican and Democratic nominees in the past three elections.

<HEADLINE> Museum Honors WWII Veterans  </HEADLINE>
By BRETT MARTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Before time does what enemy fire could not,
America's living World War II veterans will at last see their
triumphant legacy enshrined in a major national event.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of America, Tuesday's opening of the National D-Day
Museum could allay more than a half century of festering guilt over
the fact that something similar hadn't been done earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's way overdue,'' said veteran Bob Slaughter, 75, of
Roanoke, Va., who took a bullet across his head and shrapnel in his
back over the course of numerous battles from Normandy to central
Europe. ''I kept thinking somebody's going to do this, and they
just didn't. The war was becoming forgotten and school children
didn't know anything about it, and it just wasn't fair to the guys
still over there in those graves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 6 million of the more than 16 million people who
served in the military during World War II are alive. Their average
age is 77, and they're dying at a rate of about 1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's opening ceremonies will bring together an estimated
10,000 World War II veterans, the largest gathering since the war
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The D-Day Museum, founded by historian and best-selling author
Stephen Ambrose, will examine the entire war, with special
attention dedicated to the New Orleans-built, shoe box-shaped
landing boats used in every D-Day invasion in Europe and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose speculates that America lagged in national monuments or
museums dedicated to the war in part because those who fought found
the experience so horrific they avoided reliving it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Veterans didn't want to talk about that war,'' said Ambrose,
who researched two best-selling books on the subject. ''Now they've
reached an age where they're beginning to leave us, and we better
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   In his drive to recount the tales of horror and heroism, Ambrose
found veterans generous in donating items to bring those stories to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a 70,500-square-foot renovated structure in the city's
gentrified warehouse district, the museum combines about 5,000
artifacts with oral histories, posters, props, video and animation
to create a vivid history of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nearly every artifact has a story connected to it, whether it
be a hole in a helmet or a belt that a medic carried around with
him as he treated the wounded on the beach,'' Ambrose said.
</P>
<P>
   Oral history booths feature veteran accounts of the war as a TV
screen fades in and out of related still photos, many showing the
storytellers as they looked during the war.
</P>
<P>
   One main theater and three smaller ones will showcase combat and
other war footage, eventually including rare color footage shot by
military cameramen who caught everything from the bloodstained
decks of a landing craft at Normandy to jubilant Parisians lining
the streets as the allies liberated the city from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Audio descriptions of war strategies and troop movements are
illustrated by animated maps, beamed from ceiling projectors onto
white oval floor screens.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is far more grand than the $1 million project Ambrose
envisioned 15 years ago near the University of New Orleans campus,
where he once taught and museum chairman Nick Mueller still does.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose had simply run out of room to keep artifacts he
collected in his research. He found fund raising difficult until he
widened the scope to include those who fought in the Pacific and
North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacific wing opens in August 2001, the final price tag
is expected to be $25 million, Mueller said. The federal government
has given $6 million, while Louisiana contributed $6.7 million. The
rest came from private donors.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the museum became the leading national project
commemorating the war effort, Ambrose still felt New Orleans was
the right place for it, in part because he wanted to emphasize the
role of the late Andrew Jackson Higgins, a local shipbuilder whose
36-foot troop transports brought invading troops ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who chose Ambrose as his
biographer, credited Higgins with winning the war by making it
possible to invade onto an open beach.
</P>
<P>
   Below a pair of fighter planes hanging from the ceiling of the
main pavilion will sit a working replica of Higgins' landing craft.
Researchers failed to find an original one in good enough shape to
restore. The new boat, which took more than two years to build from
salvaged parts, was commissioned by the U.S. Coast Guard last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The No. 1 purpose of the museum is to honor the veterans and
the workers of Higgins Industries,'' Ambrose said. ''Everybody
worked one way or another for the war effort. This is symbolic of
all of them, and soon they're not going to be around.''

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Shakes Sumatra, 44 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake and dozens of
strong aftershocks struck the Indonesian island of Sumatra, killing
at least 44 people, injuring hundreds and leaving thousands
homeless, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Bengkulu, the hardest-hit city, people dug through the rubble
of ruined buildings in search of bodies and trapped survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said the
quake, measuring magnitude 7.3, hit at 11:29 p.m. Sunday and was
centered beneath the Indian Ocean, about 60 west of Bengkulu, which
has a population of 1.2 million. The U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo., estimated the quake's strength at 7.9.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the quake was expected to rise as volunteers
and emergency workers search ruined buildings. Witnesses reported
widespread panic in Bengkulu and said hospitals were overwhelmed
with injured people. Electricity and water supplies had been cut.
Many phone lines were down. The airport was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many houses have collapsed and the walls on bigger buildings
have been fractured. I helped save three of my neighbors who were
trapped under rubble,'' said Edy, a resident of Bengkulu.
</P>
<P>
   The quake lasted several minutes and shook a wide area. A
magnitude 6 aftershock hit 11 minutes afterward, and 53 smaller
tremors were recorded before 6 a.m. Monday, frightening residents
and hampering rescue efforts, Indonesian seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the state geophysical service in Jakarta,
Suhardjono, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said 25
bodies had been recovered in or near the city, all of them killed
by falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue efforts before sunrise were hampered by widespread
electricity and telephone outages. Thousands fled their homes as
aftershocks continued.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Bengkulu treated the injured in the open, fearing
aftershocks might bring down the state hospital, the official
Antara news agency reported. Damage was also reported at Bengkulu
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bengkulu police Sgt. Hariyono said by telephone that many more
people were reported injured in demolished houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quake went on for many minutes. Dozens of homes have been
destroyed, and almost all houses and buildings in the city seem to
have been damaged,'' said Hariyono, who like many Indonesians uses
only one name.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid offered no immediate emergency
response, saying instead that his government had to assess the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent
years, was felt across much of western half of the archipelago
nation and the neighboring island state of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about
20{ miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean -- very shallow in
geological terms. But there were no immediate reports of a tsunami,
a massive wave caused by an earthquake or volcanic eruption.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on the southeastern island of Flores. A
magnitude-7 earthquake is capable of causing widespread and heavy
damage in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, sits on major
fault lines and is prone to frequent seismic upheavals.

<HEADLINE> War Pits Growth, Preservation in Md  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA, Md. (AP) -- A patch of silty water John Mathwin spotted
while canoeing along the Potomac River has rekindled a water war as
old as America, a dispute now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Mathwin followed the mud trail to what he called ''a great scar
on the land,'' a golf course under construction on the Virginia
banks of the Potomac, upstream from an intake that draws drinking
water for 1.2 million Virginians.
</P>
<P>
   While another sign of the encroaching development along the
Virginia banks upset him, what he learned next was even worse:
</P>
<P>
   To draw cleaner drinking water, the Fairfax County, Va., Water
Authority was poised to extend the intake -- which from the Maryland
side resembles a concrete, six-car garage -- into the middle of his
beloved Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   ''It consumes me,'' said Mathwin, 55, who teaches journalism at
a Silver Spring, Md., high school. ''It literally makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathwin's lobbying in 1996 brought the object of his repulsion
to the attention of Maryland's politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the 725-foot intake extension, costing as much
as $8 million, still hasn't been built. It was stymied by a growing
feud between pro-growth forces in Virginia and their
environmentally sensitive counterparts in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's suit, filed in the U.S. Supreme Court in February,
contends that the intake extension is an ''improvement'' it has the
right to build. It also argues the extension is critical to the
health of its citizens. The justices agreed last week to hear the
case.
</P>
<P>
   If the two states were independent nations, ''we would be at war
over this,'' Maryland Senate Majority Leader Clarence Blount
remarked during a debate over the extension earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting ownership of the Potomac under a 1632 land grant from
King Charles I of England, Maryland officials have refused to issue
Virginia a permit to build the intake.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland officials are convinced that its southern neighbor is
trying to escape a problem it has caused by fouling the Potomac
with its unchecked sprawl in Fairfax County, a suburb of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia officials, meanwhile, say Maryland has thrown up
unreasonable obstacles to legitimate development, including a
demand that they show a need for the extension.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening signed into law a bill
that allows Virginia to build the extension under certain
conditions but only after the permit is issued.
</P>
<P>
   The river that separates Maryland and Virginia has been a source
of dispute dating back to the earliest days of the nation. To
resolve questions over their common boundary, an accord was reached
in 1785 at George Washington's Mount Vernon plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The compact declared that although Maryland owns the river, both
states have the right to fish, place crab pots and construct
''wharves and other improvements'' on the Potomac. It still holds
today.
</P>
<P>
   According to Virginia officials, the present water intake pipe
is situated too close to land to avoid sediment and other
pollutants. The chemicals used to treat the water -- at a cost of
$13 million -- expose Virginians to serious risk, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the tenets of water treatment is you start with the
cleaner source of water,'' said James Warfield, executive officer
of the Fairfax County Water Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland argues it has the right to regulate the middle of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it is a health issue,'' retorted Glendening spokesman,
Mike Morrill. ''It's about the health of the entire region,
environmental health as well as the citizens' health.''
</P>
<P>
   The friction stems from radical differences in approaches to
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a Republican, has pushed hard for
growth and economic development, especially in the state's northern
high-tech corridor, home to America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, a Democrat, has made curbing urban sprawl and
preserving undeveloped land a hallmark of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Maryland could soon face lobbying for an extension of its
own intake into the river to avoid sediment problems from its two
most populous counties, Montgomery and Prince George's. The 1.3
million residents in those Washington suburbs also drink treated
water from the Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   John Griffin, head of the water authority on the Maryland side
of the Potomac, fears the state is taking a big risk fighting the
case in the Supreme Court. Maryland could be stripped of its rights
to control the river.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may win the battle but lose the war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mathwin, who still canoes the Potomac's inlets and channels
several times a week, it's worth fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court may rule one way or the other, but the
public should know what's really going on here,'' Mathwin said.
''Increasingly, on the river where you once saw forests, you now
see development.''

<HEADLINE> Better Anti-Terrorism Campaign Urged  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greece should be kept off a list of nations
whose citizens do not need visas to visit the United States, and
instead designated as ''not cooperating fully'' against terrorism,
a government commission contends.
</P>
<P>
   Greece -- a NATO ally -- ''has been disturbingly passive in
response to terrorist activities,'' according to the National
Commission on Terrorism, a panel of private experts and former
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created by Congress two years ago after
bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. It was submitting its report
to lawmakers today.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which the panel said provides ''safe haven, transit
and moral, political and diplomatic support to several groups
engaged in terrorism,'' should be added along with Greece to
countries ''not cooperating fully,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday
that she hadn't seen the report but that the government is looking
at ''what the appropriate means are to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as Greece and Pakistan are concerned, it is a subject
of discussion with them and was raised both when President Clinton
and I were in Pakistan and in Greece recently,'' Albright said.
''And we are pressing them on it, but we are not considering
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the United States permits citizens of certain
countries to visit for three months without a visa. But Congress
should ban countries in the ''not cooperating fully'' category from
the visa-waiver program, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Greece was just approved for the program. U.S. officials said in
February, however, that they would continue to exclude the country
until it tightens its passport procedures against fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is not in the visa-waiver program and Afghanistan is
the only country now in the ''not cooperating fully'' category.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted in April to permanently extend the visa-waiver
program, which began in 1986 among the United States and mostly
European countries. The Senate has yet to consider the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions from the commission include:
</P>
<P>
   --Tracking foreign students in America. The government should
keep tabs on such things as changes in students' study plans -- a
switch from an English literature major to nuclear physics might
arouse suspicion, for example.
</P>
<P>
   --Allowing the military to lead the response to any major
terrorist attack on U.S. soil, as opposed to the FBI or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   --Loosening restrictions on the FBI and CIA in opening
investigations of terrorist suspects or using informants who may
have unsavory backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations have their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''If implemented, these recommendations would severely damage
civil liberties and facilitate abusing behavior by the government,
without necessarily producing any increase in security,'' said Hala
Maksoud, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA also says its restrictions -- started after the agency
admitted close ties to Guatemalan military officers who had
committed human rights abuses -- have not hindered its
intelligence-gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, we just don't believe we face inhibitions related to
restrictions,'' CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said. ''There has never
been a case when higher-ups were asked to authorize utilizing
unsavory people that they didn't say, 'Go ahead.'''

<HEADLINE> Russians Suspicious of U.S. Motives  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Like a lot of Russians, Vladislav Momdjian
appreciates things American. He admired Hollywood's ''American
Beauty,'' and with his Oakley backpack and Nike jacket, he's a
walking ad for U.S. consumer culture.
</P>
<P>
   But like many other Russians, his admiration for America stops
at what he sees as the United States' aggressive foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like American culture,'' said Momdjian, a student at the
Moscow State Institute of International Relations. ''What irritates
me is their foreign policy -- this expansion in all directions,
political and economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say popular disenchantment with the United States
has grown perceptibly between the time President Clinton visited
Moscow in September 1998 and his return trip ending Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia, a Russian ally, caused
widespread anger. But analysts say that's only one factor in a slow
cooling in the Russian public's attitude toward the United States
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Factors include the discrediting of U.S.-backed economic market
reformers in an August 1998 financial collapse, NATO expansion into
Eastern Europe, U.S. charges of corruption and money-laundering and
criticism of Russia's war to subdue rebellious Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative impact has been a willingness to suspect U.S.
motives that is a far cry from the rose-tinted views that followed
the Soviet collapse in 1991. Then, Russians thought they would be
welcomed into the world community and economy, and be rewarded for
bringing the Cold War confrontation to an end.
</P>
<P>
   At Momdjian's institute, terms such as ''the world's
policeman,'' ''aggression,'' ''domination'' and ''hegemony''
cropped up in interviews with students about America. And these
are, for the most part, not nationalists or communists, but the
liberal sons and daughters of the political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Momdjian, as do many others, sharply distinguished U.S. foreign
policy from American culture. His grandparents were Soviet
diplomats who served at the United Nations in New York. ''I heard
nothing but good things about the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of the U.S. government's motives, mixed with
fascination with the trappings of American culture, is hardly
unique to Russia. But in Russia's case it follows a period in which
many looked to the United States as an economic and political
model.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of disenchantment crop up in things like a recent
cigarette ad showing a space-walking Russian cosmonaut painting the
cigarette company's logo on the side of the U.S. shuttle. The
slogan: ''Strike Back.'' Ironically, the brand is owned by a
foreign tobacco company, though a Moscow agency did the ad.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent program about Russia's rusting and underfunded navy,
RTR government television focused on U.S. funding for the
dismantling of missile submarines under arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning that U.S. missiles are also slated to be
taken apart, the show strongly implied that the United States had
selfishly engineered the reduction of Russia's military might,
showing the destruction of the subs to a soundtrack of mournful
classical music. Workers in interviews wondered why Russia was
taking American money to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of resentment was also shown in a recent poll, in
which people were asked why the United States stopped a Russian oil
tanker in the Persian Gulf. Only 18 percent accepted the official
U.S. reason -- to enforce sanctions against Iraq stemming from the
1991 Gulf War. But 57 percent agreed that the Americans wanted ''to
demonstrate their strength to Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Oslon, head of the Public Opinion Foundation, which
conducted the poll, said anti-U.S. sentiment reflected
disappointment over Russia's failure to achieve Western levels of
prosperity after the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is, the U.S. is one of the symbols of the
illusions which we had during the perestroika period and the
beginning of the 1990s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was the model, ''another planet, a kingdom of
reason,'' said Oslon, and Russians expected that soon they would
have what Americans have. When that expectation turned out to have
been unrealistic, resentment and disenchantment set in, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest OAS Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- As hundreds of anti-free trade
protesters chanted outside, foreign ministers from the Organization
of American States launched their annual assembly Sunday, expecting
to focus on Peru's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 41 people Sunday -- 35 of whom were among 200 who
mobbed a bus containing three OAS delegates and a driver, according
to Staff Sgt. Dave Rossell of the Windsor Police Service. Some
protesters sat in front of the bus while others painted vulgar
slogans on it
</P>
<P>
   Protesters chanted ''Shame! Shame! Shame!'' and wagged their
fingers at the police officers, who in turn rapped nightsticks on
riot shields to move the crowd back. Some demonstrators tried to
force their way into the area before police shut the gate, inciting
the demonstrators to throw bottles and debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officers were being pelted by rocks as well as noxious
substances being tossed over the gate,'' Ontario Provincial Police
Sgt. Dave Rektor said. Still, ''this has been a fairly successful,
peaceful protest, with the exception of a small ... group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Windsor protest -- which was mirrored by another across the
U.S. river border in Detroit -- brought the OAS face-to-face with
the same anti-free trade movement that obstructed December's World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocating security measures and hundreds of police in riot
gear prevented demonstrators from crossing into a security zone set
up within a 10-foot fence around several blocks in downtown
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters near the OAS meeting site tried to hang an
anti-free trade banner from the chain-link security fence. When
police ordered the banner taken down because it blocked the
officers' view, the crowd responded by throwing a rocks and a
homemade smoke bomb across the fence at the officers, said Const.
Michele Paradis of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Two police officers were receiving treatment after being hit by
projectiles, which contained an ''undetermined'' liquid, she said.
A third officer was injured in a motorcycle crash during a
disturbance, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police sprayed two people with pepper spray when a group tried
to climb the fence. Later, about 200 people sat in the path of a
bus carrying delegates into the meeting compound. Rossell said the
35 arrested would likely be released without charge within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some OAS delegates complained that the organization was being
wrongly targeted, noting there were no clear trade issues on the
assembly's agenda. The OAS represents more than 30 member Western
Hemisphere nations.
</P>
<P>
   But protest speakers said the OAS -- as part of an international
power structure including the WTO and International Monetary Fund --
had helped erode workers' rights and exacerbate poverty through
free-trade agreements and other deals.
</P>
<P>
   Activist author Noam Chomsky rejected what he called the
''childish nonsense'' of free-trade advocates who said
globalization was an unstoppable tidal wave engulfing the planet.
''Free trade agreements are nothing of the sort, and they're
certainly not agreements,'' he said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit protester Craig Regester, 29, said he was protesting
''an organization that essentially wants to make decisions about my
life and about other workers' lives without me having any say about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening ceremony Sunday night, Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien appeared to refer to such complaints when he said the
OAS must become ''more inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only by engaging all of our citizens, by ensuring that
their voices are heard, that we will gain the confidence we need to
achieve our goals,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old OAS planned during its three-day meeting to
focus on human security issues in the Americas while taking care of
normal business, such as approving a next year's budget and
electing some officers and committees.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks, OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria, of
Colombia, mentioned budget problems and challenges to democracy as
major issues to be addressed. The failure of some countries to pay
annual OAS dues has left the organization's general fund ''in a
critical situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OAS delegates also were scheduled to consider last month's
presidential run-off in Peru, after a human rights report accused
the South American country of failing to meet democratic election
standards. If the foreign ministers agree, they could subject Peru
to OAS sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's President Alberto Fujimori was the only candidate on the
ballot, after challenger Alejandro Toledo boycotted what he said
was an unfair election process.
</P>
<P>
   Several former world leaders, including former President Jimmy
Carter, sharply criticized Peru in an open letter to the foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS meets through Tuesday in Windsor, a middle-class city of
about 262,000 across the Detroit River from the Motor City.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Media Resists Censorship  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- ''Censored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times splashed the single word across the op-ed page
after the government censor spiked its entire report on the
escalation of the war against Tamil separatists in Sri Lanka's
northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal Athas, the author of the article, submitted his manuscript
to the censor ahead of publication, as all journalists reporting
about the civil war in Sri Lanka are now obliged to do. It came
back with a rubber stamp: ''This article, picture/map are censored
and NOT permitted to be published.''
</P>
<P>
   As soldiers fight Tamil rebels in the north and bombs go off
elsewhere in this small island nation, such government screening
has become common. Every day, Sri Lanka's English, Sinhala and
Tamil language papers publish truncated news reports and opinion
pieces with ''Censored'' in bold type sprinkled across the pages,
representing portions deleted by the government censor.
</P>
<P>
   The censorship began May 3, when the government invoked the
Public Security Ordinance to ban the media from reporting news that
officials think will create public disturbance or harm the national
interest. Under the ordinance, criticism of government ministers,
military and police is taboo.
</P>
<P>
   But editors say the censor has not told them what constitutes
national security and how their stories compromise it. In the case
of the Sunday Times article, author Athas said the government
''gave no explanation for censoring the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was about how the president's Cabinet met and what is
happening on the ground in Jaffna,'' Athas said in an interview.
''The map just had all the towns in the north ... something you
find in any atlas, and the photo was a generic picture of a
multibarrel rocket launcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ordinance, police and soldiers can seize any property
or jail anyone for up to a year without giving any explanation. The
earlier censorship laws provided for three warnings, a trial by a
judge and a maximum punishment of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Police have shut down three newspapers, saying they violated
censorship. One of these -- the only Tamil language paper that was
still publishing in the embattled city of Jaffna -- had reported
that air force bombings killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Another had carried mock reports, giving war news but saying it
had ''not'' happened. Two of the closed papers have filed
challenges in the country's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war on this small nation off India's southern tip has
raged for 17 years and has left 62,000 people dead. Most ethnic
Tamils have been protesting what they see as discrimination by the
Sinhalese majority, which controls the government and the military.
The rebels want to establish a homeland in the north and east for
the country's 3.2 million Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are barred by both the military and the rebels from
traveling to the war zone. The government also cut phone lines to
Jaffna, saying it wants to prevent communication with rebels who
may be hiding in the towns.
</P>
<P>
   The government censor routinely deletes references to rebel
claims of casualties in the fighting. Sri Lankan TV carries no
footage of the war other than rare sanitized scenes provided by the
Defense Ministry. Live broadcast of news and current affairs
programs are banned; cable operators have been ordered to cut CNN
and BBC broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the word ''Censored'' stamped throughout their
pages, The Sunday Times and its sister publication, The Daily
Mirror, print a cartoon each day of a blindfolded man, with his
hands tied together and a newspaper stuffed into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see Sri Lanka's upcoming parliamentary elections
as central to the censorship. Ahead of the elections in August,
President Chandrika Kumaratunga is trying to build a national
consensus on an autonomy plan for Tamils while her troops fight the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the censorship is more aimed at the elections than at
the war,'' said C.A. Chandraprema, an independent political
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The chief censor, who deletes from news reports any comment from
the rebels' Web site or radio broadcasts, is also the chief
government spokesman who issues statements each day reporting
military successes. Chandraprema said that means people here have
no way of assessing whether the government claims are true or
false.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that comes through the Internet and fax doesn't have
the credibility of newspapers. It doesn't go through the normal
news process of corroboration and fact checking,'' Chandraprema
said.
</P>
<P>
   International press associations and Western governments have
urged Kumaratunga to lift censorship, which has resulted in
foreigners knowing much more about the war than Sri Lanka citizens.
Robert Menard, general secretary of the organization Reporters
Without Borders, told Kumaratunga the censorship violates the
International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, which
guarantees freedom of expression. Sri Lanka is a signatory.
</P>
<P>
   The president told The Hindu newspaper of India she may end
censorship if the military situation improves. She complained of
''irresponsible'' and ''demoralizing'' reports that could inflame
communal passions and incite Sinhalese radicals to attack the
minority Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Shakes Sumatra, 58 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake and dozens of
strong aftershocks struck the Indonesian island of Sumatra, killing
at least 58 people, injuring hundreds and leaving thousands
homeless, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Bengkulu, the hardest-hit city, people dug through the rubble
of ruined buildings in search of bodies and trapped survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said the
quake, measuring magnitude 7.3, hit at 11:29 p.m. Sunday and was
centered beneath the Indian Ocean, about 60 west of Bengkulu, which
has a population of 1.2 million. The U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo., estimated the quake's strength at 7.9.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Muchtar, Bengkulu health department chief, said 58 people
were confirmed dead. Almost 500 people had been reported injured,
255 seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the quake was expected to rise as volunteers
and emergency workers search ruined buildings. Witnesses reported
widespread panic in Bengkulu and said hospitals were overwhelmed
with injured people. Electricity and water supplies had been cut.
Many phone lines were down. The airport was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many houses have collapsed and the walls on bigger buildings
have been fractured. I helped save three of my neighbors who were
trapped under rubble,'' said Edy, a resident of Bengkulu.
</P>
<P>
   The quake lasted several minutes and shook a wide area. A
magnitude 6 aftershock hit 11 minutes afterward, and 53 smaller
tremors were recorded before 6 a.m. Monday, frightening residents
and hampering rescue efforts, Indonesian seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the state geophysical service in Jakarta,
Suhardjono, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said 25
bodies had been recovered in or near the city, all of them killed
by falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue efforts before sunrise were hampered by widespread
electricity and telephone outages. Thousands fled their homes as
aftershocks continued.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Bengkulu treated the injured in the open, fearing
aftershocks might bring down the state hospital, the official
Antara news agency reported. Damage was also reported at Bengkulu
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bengkulu police Sgt. Hariyono said by telephone that many more
people were reported injured in demolished houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quake went on for many minutes. Dozens of homes have been
destroyed, and almost all houses and buildings in the city seem to
have been damaged,'' said Hariyono, who like many Indonesians uses
only one name.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid offered no immediate emergency
response, saying instead that his government had to assess the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent
years, was felt across much of western half of the archipelago
nation and the neighboring island state of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about
20{ miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean -- very shallow in
geological terms. But there were no immediate reports of a tsunami,
a massive wave caused by an earthquake or volcanic eruption.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on the southeastern island of Flores. A
magnitude-7 earthquake is capable of causing widespread and heavy
damage in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, sits on major
fault lines and is prone to frequent seismic upheavals.

<HEADLINE> Luxury Entices Some Movie-Goers  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Think of it as dinner and a movie --
without the drive in between.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the theaters at Premium Cinemas have
floor-to-ceiling screens, near deafening sound and soft leather
seats, they also feature a gourmet menu featuring everything from
squash ravioli to rib-eye steak.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century after well-dressed theatergoers crowded in
to see the first moving pictures, this new cinema is one of a
handful nationwide trying to turn a night at the movies back into
the event it once was.
</P>
<P>
   From full dinners to Ferris wheel rides to child care, movie
theater owners are doing whatever it takes to lure consumers who
have a range of entertainment options.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be that you could pay 25 cents and get more than
just a feature-length movie for your money,'' said Terrance Demas,
director of the League of Historic American Theaters in Baltimore.
''With TV, that somehow got lost. Now, that's what people want
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, theaters took in nearly $7 billion in ticket sales, up
more than $1 billion from the previous year, according to the
National Association of Theater Owners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid growth of new media and home entertainment
systems, theater owners are concerned those numbers could start to
drop if they don't offer more than just popcorn and a movie.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Sony recently opened a 15-screen Metreon
Theater, complete with restaurants, an amusement park, a children's
museum, stores and four IMAX theaters that show multidimensional
films.
</P>
<P>
   Resort Theaters of America is planning to open about 500
theaters at resorts in California, Utah and Colorado which will
offer gourmet coffee, chocolates and pastries in the lobby, a
supervised playroom for children and a digital screen show before
the movie begins.
</P>
<P>
   And in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Maryland, General Cinemas
has opened Premium Cinemas, where patrons can have dinner --
anything from oven-roasted scrod to chocolate mousse cake -- and see
a movie under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   At the Framingham location, reservations are recommended and no
one under the age of 21 is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons can dine in a restaurant just outside the cinema. A full
bar is set up for drinks, and slow eaters can take their plates
into the theater. Waiters also offer table service inside the
auditorium for late orders, dessert and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   For the show, moviegoers sit in leather lounge chairs with ample
leg room behind private tables. Popcorn is free -- and waiting at
each reserved seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sick of being in a crowded theater with kids kicking me
and screaming in my ear,'' said Michael Kelly, 26, of Marlboro,
before a recent showing of ''Mission: Impossible 2.'' ''For me,
just a chance to have a drink and watch a movie without kids around
is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   That much special treatment isn't cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the average price for admission is $4.26, according
to the National Association of Theater Owners. But in major
metropolitan areas, and at most chain theaters, adult ticket prices
range from $5 for matinees to $10 for evening shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the Premium Cinemas, an adult ticket is $15. That doesn't
include appetizers, which start at $7, or entrees, which range from
$12.50 for the squash ravioli to $18.50 for a rib-eye steak.
</P>
<P>
   Two burgers, some chicken satay and two sodas -- refillable -- on
a recent weekday night came to about $32. Add to that a tip for the
service, and two tickets to the movie, and the total cost for the
night comes to just under $70.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's stupid,'' said Julie Feiler, 28, of Cambridge. An avid
movie-goer, she regularly goes to theaters featuring art and
foreign films. And she never buys popcorn or drinks from the snack
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to sit in the dark and watch a movie,'' she said. ''I
don't need luxuries. If I wanted to be that comfortable, I'd stay
home.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say $15 isn't outrageous, particularly taken in the
context of the cost for other entertainment, such as athletic
events or concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ''People today are just unwilling to go anywhere where they
won't be coddled,'' said Lucy Fischer, head of the Film Studies
Program and the Society for Cinema Studies at the University of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''And why should they? They've grown up having dinner on couches
in front of big-screen TVs. Why go to the movies at all?''

<HEADLINE> Rapper Eminem Arrested in Michigan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- Grammy-winning rapper Eminem was among four
people arrested outside a suburban Detroit nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came early Sunday after a disturbance that began
when a crowd in the parking lot of Hot Rocks Cafe recognized Eminem
and got excited, club manager Scott Lapensee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to get an autograph or just talk with him,''
Lapensee said.
</P>
<P>
   A fight broke out and three bar security guards rushed in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said officers went to the club because security guards
had detained someone with a gun. They arrested four people -- two
men on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon, and a man and a
woman for disorderly conduct. They would not say which charge
Eminem faces. He was freed later Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Eminem, 27, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, has the No. 1
album in the country, ''The Marshall Mathers LP.'' It sold 1.76
million copies in the week following its May 23 release.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's lawyer, Peter Peacock, said Sunday that he had not been
contacted by his client.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Martin, a local record company representative, said the
rapper would not be charged. ''I assume he was held for questioning
in some sort of incident which occurred.''

<HEADLINE> Dame Edna Wins Special Tony  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor Barry Humphries, wearing a tuxedo,
accepted a special Tony award for a live theatrical event, ''Dame
Edna: the Royal Tour,'' with the excuse that Dame Edna was
downstairs getting ''prettied up'' to present the Tony for best
costume design.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian, who pretends they're separate people, puts on
flamboyant gowns, wigs and jewelry to portray the warmhearted,
snobbish, funny Dame Edna.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Edna first appeared on stage in 1955, a dowdy, insecure,
shy, Melbourne housewife, mother of three small, unattractive
infants, I little dreamt her career would end on this magnificent
occasion. Not that it's ending,'' he said, accepting his Tony
before the TV cameras began to roll.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this great accolade of my career, my joy is tinged with
disappointment. I had hoped to be nominated for drama. I wrote a
play which is a profound, sensitive meditation on death, love and
the nature of friendship, whereas Edna, with her relentless ad libs
and refusal to learn her lines, has turned it into a frothy
crowd-pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must thank my producers who, due to the cost of tickets,
unfortunately are not with us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Later when Dame Edna, in full matron-diva regalia, gave the
award for best costume design, she joked: ''I don't have costumes.
I just wear street clothes in my show.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna also startled Martin Pakledinaz, who won the costume
Tony for ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' when she kissed him. Pakledinaz, with
Dame Edna's lipstick on his cheek, laughed when he tried, more than
once, to start the acceptance speech he had been told to make
brief.
</P>
<P>
   He finally said, ''I hope this isn't coming out of my 45
seconds.''

<HEADLINE> Director Blakemore Blase Over Tonys  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadway was buzzing about Michael Blakemore's
head-turning Tony awards coup, but he appeared blase about being
the first director honored for a play and a musical in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have an awful lot of emotions,'' Blakemore insisted
dryly a few minutes after winning best director honors Sunday for
two dramatically different shows -- the cerebral play ''Copenhagen''
and the boisterous Cole Porter musical ''Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards were his first Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters at the awards show pressed for a bigger reaction,
the Australian-born Brit, known for his restraint, reluctantly
conceded he was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like having twins: You get it all over at once,'' he
said. ''I'm delighted and amazed, really a little stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old's back-to-back wins sent Tony organizers
scurrying for the history books. They quickly confirmed his double
directorial win was a first.
</P>
<P>
   A double victory has been possible only since 1960, when the
direction prize was split into play and musical categories.
Blakemore was nominated for both in 1990 with ''Lettice &AMP; Lovage''
and ''City of Angels,'' but he didn't win for either.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was a big night for both of this year's Blakemore shows.
''Kiss Me, Kate'' won five Tonys, including best musical revival,
and ''Copenhagen,'' a thought-provoking play about a mysterious
World War II meeting between two physicists, took home three,
including best play.
</P>
<P>
   The director is already at work on a new project, the Arthur
Miller play ''Mr. Peters' Connections,'' which will open in London.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'd known I was going to win two Tonys, I think I would
have retired,'' Blakemore joked.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter asked Blakemore how he planned to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   He was silent for a long moment as he raised a plastic champagne
flute in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something like this, I think,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> HBO Set To Show 'King Gimp'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a startling spectacle on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   When ''King Gimp'' was named winner for best short documentary,
viewers caught a glimpse of its subject, Dan Keplinger, quaking
with pleasure in his wheelchair in Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium
audience. Then he flung himself to the floor, a vision of literally
unbridled joy.
</P>
<P>
   Keplinger, who was born with cerebral palsy, had spent much of
his 27 years excluded, ignored and, worst of all, misunderstood.
But on that March night, for a moment, there was no mistaking the
grand things he felt, and everyone who saw him felt the same.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Keplinger is meeting with a reporter at HBO's
Manhattan headquarters. He is up from Baltimore, where he lives, to
publicize the film, airing on HBO Monday from 7 to 7:45 p.m.
Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   ''King Gimp,'' which Keplinger wrote, tells his story from
childhood through his mid-20s. Along with more mundane triumphs
such as microwaving popcorn and serving himself, the film records
his rebirth as an artist while in high school. It captures him
graduating from Towson University with a major in art. It shows him
at work, painting with a brush he mounts on a helmet-like device.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I paint, there is a sweet siren voice telling me where
the brush will move,'' he writes, pecking out each letter on a
keyboard with his headstick. ''I obey the brush.''
</P>
<P>
   It is his art, as well as the film, that has brought Dan
Keplinger to Manhattan. During June, two dozen of his expressionist
oils -- bold and unyielding, many of them self-portraits -- are for
sale at Soho's Phyllis Kind Gallery. (And displayed on HBO's Web
site.) It's his first major solo show.
</P>
<P>
   And the latest confirmation of his feisty nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people think 'gimp' means someone with a lame walk,''
Keplinger declares at the start of the film. ''But 'gimp' also
means 'fighting spirit.'''
</P>
<P>
   It does. Look it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our film isn't about a disability, it's about a spirit,''
William Whiteford is telling the reporter. ''It's about a person.
With an attitude.'' And he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteford and Susan Hannah Hadary are the Baltimore-based,
Oscar-winning producers of ''King Gimp.'' Part of Keplinger's life
since he was 12, they have joined him, with his mother, Linda
Ritter, for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of what we do as filmmakers is developing
relationships,'' Whiteford goes on. They filmed Keplinger for 13
years. Not that they expected it would go on so long. ''Each time
we would think of ending it, Dan's life would take a new turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, with his college graduation, we said, 'That's it!'''
adds Hadary.
</P>
<P>
   Keplinger chortles. ''At one point, they were going to lock me
up so I couldn't do any more.''
</P>
<P>
   He even helped them finish ''King Gimp'' by screening footage as
a summer job, then writing the narration himself. It tells of
living in a world that often had no place for him, where ''no one
could understand that I was this intelligent person inside of this
body.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are taking more time to listen to me now,'' he says
when asked about the film's impact. ''They know I have something to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone can make out what he says when he speaks. His
lack of muscular control affects his voice as much as anything
else. His speech erupts -- at least, to the unpracticed ear -- in
mostly unintelligible grunts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dan and I always talked a lot,'' his mother says. And with
obvious affection and not too much trouble, she and his filmmaker
friends share interpreting duties during this interview, as
Keplinger hacks away at too-common misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   No, he explains, he isn't in any discomfort. What looks like
writhing and grimacing is involuntary movement that he chooses not
to tame with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My arms spring out and people think I'm getting excited and
tell me to calm down,'' he says, setting up his punch line: ''I am
only trying to get back together!''
</P>
<P>
   No, he doesn't feel plagued by limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What people think is hard for me I think is normal,'' he
insists. ''People think I'm having a terrible time doing something.
I just think I'm doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keplinger moves through life with one towering advantage: He
never counts on the easy way.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, his mother taught him never to think too far
ahead about hardships that may never come to pass. As a young
single mother determined to raise him like a normal child, she had
to stay in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was worrying when he was 9 about how, when he's 25, he's
going to be heavy and how am I gonna lift him, it would have taken
away the energy I needed to get him past 9. You know? I tell Dan,
you eat an elephant a bite at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   As viewers will discover, ''King Gimp'' documents a splendid
first course.

<HEADLINE> Tim McGraw Arrest 'Misunderstanding'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- An attorney for country music star Tim
McGraw's band said the singer's arrest for allegedly attacking
deputies was a ''misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw and country music singer Kenny Chesney were arrested
Saturday night near Buffalo. The sheriff's office said Chesney rode
away with a deputy's horse and McGraw attacked deputies who tried
to corral him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They only thought they had permission to ride the horse,''
said Tom Eoannou, the band's attorney. ''It's a clear
misunderstanding. Clearly it's over riding a horse and I don't
think these charges will stick at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Erie Sheriff's Department Capt. James Coyle gave
Chesney permission to sit on her father's horse.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney allegedly rode away and refused several orders to stop.
When two deputies tried to get him off the horse, they were
attacked by McGraw, Staebell said. One of McGraw's managers, Mark
Russo, also got involved, Staebell said.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, 33, of Brentwood, Tenn., was freed on $2,500 bail after
he was charged with second-degree assault, obstructing governmental
administration, menacing and resisting arrest. Chesney, 32, of
Nashville, was charged with disorderly conduct and freed on $100
bail.
</P>
<P>
   The two had headlined Saturday night at the George Strait
Country Music Festival.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, son of former New York Mets star reliever Tug McGraw, is
married to country star Faith Hill. He has had 14 No. 1 singles,
including ''Indian Outlaw'' and ''Don't Take the Girl,'' and won
the top male vocalist prize at the Academy of Country Music Awards
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney's tunes include ''How Forever Feels.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 19
points in today's early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 6-5 lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 40 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down six points.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are looking for a bit of consolidation in the market
after last week's record-breaking performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq soared 608 points, or about 19 percent, last week in
its best weekly performance to date.
</P>
<P>
   And while there was some carryover into Asian markets today,
stocks in Europe have been modestly lower.
</P>
<P>
   There's also little in the way of market-moving news today, with
no headline-grabbing economic numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of last week's gains came after investors saw new reports
showing the economy on a less-inflationary path.

<HEADLINE> Court To Settle Phone Cost Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to referee a
dispute over federal rules intended to keep telephone service
affordable in high-cost areas.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the local phone company
GTE.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the justices rejected an appeal by AT&AMP;T and
MCI involving subsidies for Internet hookups for schools and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission long has had rules
designed to ensure affordable ''universal service'' for everyone,
including people in rural and other high-cost areas. Before 1996,
the rules involved shifting costs to other customers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, designed to
open local phone markets to full competition. Because competition
could erode the universal-service subsidies, Congress directed the
FCC to write new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The law also introduced new subsidies for Internet access in
schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted rules requiring all telecommunications
companies to contribute to the universal-service subsidies, based
on their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided that phone carriers' contributions to
high-cost customers should be based only on the carriers'
interstate revenue. But their contributions to the Internet hookup
program were to be based on both interstate and in-state revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies given to companies serving high-cost customers would
be based mainly on the future cost of providing such service, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Various telecommunications companies challenged the rules,
including AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the rules
last July. It generally upheld the rules for subsidies to high-cost
areas, but it said contributions for Internet hookups could be
based only on companies' interstate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal granted today, GTE argued that the subsidies it
receives for serving high-cost customers are unfairly calculated in
a way that understates the real cost.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and MCI said companies' subsidy contributions for the
Internet program should be based on their in-state revenue as well
as interstate revenue. Otherwise, they said, long-distance
companies such as AT&AMP;T and MCI would pay a much larger share of the
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers urged the justices to deny both
appeals even though they said the appeals court erred in saying
companies' subsidy payments for the Internet program could be based
only on their interstate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said that issue was a narrow one and
did not warrant Supreme Court review.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are GTE Service Corp. vs. FCC, 99-1244, and AT&AMP;T vs.
Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co., 99-1249.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 23; Nasdaq Down 12  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened modestly lower today as investors
took some profits from last week's sharp gains.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 23.33 at 10,771.43.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 11.79 at 3,801.59, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 7.53 at 1,469.73.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said a mild decline was to be expected today as
investors capture some gains from a strong, broad-based rally last
week. The Nasdaq rose 19 percent last week, the index's strongest
performance in history and a dramatic departure from the weakness
it demonstrated in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq turned in
a mixed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm fell $4.063 to $68.625. Over the weekend, China United
Telecommunications confirmed that it won't use a mobile-phone
technology designed by Qualcomm for at least three years.
Speculation about the China contract had heightened volatility in
Qualcomm shares in the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba rose $7.75 to $78.25 after the company formed a
partnership with VeriSign Inc. and American Express to provide a
card payment processing function for online business-to-business
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were anticipating a fairly quiet week. Last week's
rally was driven by a stream of economic data that showed a modest
slowdown in the economy. That encouraged investors to believe that
the Federal Reserve may not need to aggressively raise interest
rates to keep inflation from rearing up.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the only economic report expected to move markets is
the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, due out on Friday.
With a dearth of news, the market may struggle to find direction,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 110.33 million
shares, well behind Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.24 to
512.79.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.4 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.7 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Davidians' Sentences Set Aside  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today set aside the lengthy
prison sentences given to five Branch Davidians who survived a 1993
siege at the sect's Waco, Texas, compound. The court ruled that a
federal judge misused an anti-gun law to increase their punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision makes it harder for courts to find
lawbreakers deserve extra time behind bars because they used or
carried machine guns during their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law subjects anyone who used or carried a ''firearm''
during a violent or drug-related crime to five years in prison. The
term jumps to 30 years for anyone who used or carried a ''machine
gun'' during that same crime.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts had split on whether determining use of a
machine gun is an element of the offense a jury must find beyond a
reasonable doubt, or merely a sentencing factor a judge gets to
determine by a preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court said use of a firearm must be
determined by the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe Congress intended the firearm type-related words it
used ... to refer to an element of a separate, aggravated crime,''
Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Five Davidians were convicted in 1994 in the killings of four
federal agents during a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms raid on the compound outside Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The raid led to a 51-day standoff that ended when flames swept
through the compound. David Koresh and some 80 followers died
during the inferno, some from the fire and others from gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury acquitted the five Davidians of murder and
conspiracy-to-murder charges but convicted them of voluntary
manslaughter. Each was sentenced to 10 years in prison for that
conviction. The jury also found them guilty of using firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge tacked on 30-year sentences for four of them
and a 10-year sentence for the fifth after finding that each had
used a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   Renos Avraam, Brad Eugene Branch, Jaime Castillo and Kevin
Whitecliff drew the 30-year sentences; Graeme Craddock the 10-year
term. Craddock also was sentenced to a consecutive 10 years for
using a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
   The jury never had been asked to determine what types of
firearms the five had used. The judge made that determination
during sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing their sentences, the Davidians relied heavily on a
decision in which the justices last year said carjackers cannot be
given tougher sentences unless a jury, not a judge, determines that
victims were seriously injured during that federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   The case presumably will return to a federal trial court where
new sentencing hearings will be conducted. Today's decision did not
suggest appropriate new sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Castillo vs. U.S., 99-658.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes TMI Operators' Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to free the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant's owners from lawsuits by nearly
2,000 people who say their health problems stem from the nation's
worst nuclear accident in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which the
plant owners argued that all the lawsuits should be thrown out
because a trial judge ruled against 10 people whose claims were
designated as a ''test'' case.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also turned down a separate appeal by those 10
people, who said the judge wrongly barred most of the expert
testimony offered to support their claims.
</P>
<P>
   During the accident at the Three Mile Island plant near
Harrisburg, Pa., a combination of mechanical and human failures
allowed the reactor core to lose cooling water and partially melt.
Some radioactive gases were released.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 2,000 people sued the plant's owners, saying exposure to
radiation caused health problems such as cancer and birth defects.
The cases were filed separately, not as a class-action, but for
administrative reasons were handled jointly by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Ten cases were chosen to be tried first as a ''test case'' that
might predict the outcome of the other cases and lead to possible
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Chief Judge Sylvia H. Rambo held a pretrial
hearing and determined that most of the scientific expert testimony
offered by those who sued was not reliable enough to be admitted as
trial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rambo ruled in 1996 that there was insufficient
evidence to link the residents' health problems the radiation that
leaked from the plant. She dismissed all of the nearly 2,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld her
ruling on the expert testimony and the dismissal of the 10 cases.
But the appeals court revived the rest of the lawsuits, citing
those peoples' constitutional right to have their cases heard by a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The plant owners' Supreme Court appeal said the decision to
throw out all of the cases was proper under trial judges'
traditional authority to dismiss meritless claims.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs' lawyers said the plant owners had agreed
that the outcome of the first 10 cases would not be binding on the
other claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the other appeal acted on today, the 10 plaintiffs' lawyers
said the hearing on expert testimony was too extensive and intruded
on their right to have the facts decided by a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's owners said the judge properly performed her
''gatekeeping role'' to ensure expert testimony would be reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are General Public Utilities vs. Abrams, 99-1603, and
Dolan vs. General Public Utilities, 99-1604.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Workers' Rights Broadened  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who go to federal court to appeal a
denial of Social Security disability benefits can raise issues they
did not pursue during an earlier administrative appeal, the Supreme
Court said today.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling 5-4 in a Mississippi woman's case, the justices said
federal law and agency rules do not require all issues to be raised
at such administrative proceedings before they can be pursued in
court. The justices noted the administrative appeal procedure is
informal and many people are not represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences between courts and agencies are nowhere more
pronounced than in Social Security proceedings,'' Justice Clarence
Thomas wrote for the court. The documents for seeking
administrative review ''strongly suggest that the (appeal) council
does not depend much, if at all, on claimants to identify issues
for review.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reversed a federal appeals court decision that said
courts could not hear some of the arguments raised in an appeal by
Juatassa Sims of Como, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Sims applied in 1994 for Social Security disability insurance
and Supplemental Security Income benefits. A former food store
cashier and factory worker, she said she had been disabled since
1992 by depression, hypertension, anxiety disorder and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative law judge at the Social Security
Administration denied her application, and the administration's
Appeals Council agreed in 1997. Sims then took her case to federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the denial of benefits. The appeals court said it could
not consider two of her arguments -- that the administration
improperly determined her ability to work and failed to order a
physical or psychological exam -- because she did not raise them
before the Appeals Council.
</P>
<P>
   Two other federal appeals courts issued conflicting rulings. One
of them said Social Security documents do not notify people that
they might waive an argument if they do not raise it during the
administrative appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Sims' appeal to the Supreme Court said requiring people to raise
all issues during an administrative appeal conflicted with the
''informal, non-adversarial'' nature of those proceedings, where
many people are not represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' opinion was joined in full by Justices John Paul
Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and in part by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer. Writing
for the four, Breyer said Sims was represented by a lawyer who
should have known to raise all issues in the administrative appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Sims vs. Apfel, 98-9537.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 43; Dow Down 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed today as investors
took some profits from last week's sharp gains, but continued
rewarding technology companies with strong growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 5.22 at 10,789.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 42.96 at 3,856.34, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 3.33 at 1,473.93.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly quiet as investors captured some gains from a
strong, broad-based rally last week. The Nasdaq rose 19 percent
last week, the index's biggest weekly gain in history and a
dramatic departure from the weakness it demonstrated in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq turned in
a mixed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm fell $4.25 to $68.188. Over the weekend, China United
Telecommunications confirmed it won't use a mobile phone technology
designed by Qualcomm for at least three years. Speculation about
the China contract had heightened volatility in Qualcomm shares in
the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba rose $9.50 to $80 after the company formed a partnership
with VeriSign Inc. and American Express to provide a card payment
processing function for online business-to-business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Advanced Micro Devices rose
$5.50 to $95.375. The company has introduced a souped-up version of
its Athlon computer chip and a new bargain brand; both products are
viewed as a challenge to industry kingpin Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were still reveling in last week's good
economic news. A stream of economic data showed a modest slowdown
in the economy, which many investors interpreted as a sign that the
Federal Reserve may not need to aggressively raise interest rates
to keep inflation from rearing up.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a widespread perception that the Fed won't raise
rates at its June meeting, and perhaps that they're done for the
year,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities. ''It will be hard for them to justify raising interest
rates when there is evidence of a slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the only economic report expected to move markets is
the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, due out on Friday.
With a dearth of news, the market may struggle to find direction,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 267.90 million
shares, well behind Friday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.26 to 517.29.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court at a Glance  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Supreme Court today:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Struck down a Washington state law that gave grandparents broad
rights to seek court-ordered visitation against parents' wishes.
''So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children ...
there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself
into the private realm of the family to further question the
ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the
rearing of that parent's children,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote in the court's main opinion.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled that prosecutors could not use financial documents
against Webster Hubbell, former assistant attorney general and
friend of President Clinton, that Hubbell was forced to produce
under a limited grant of immunity. Using the documents to prosecute
a misdemeanor tax charge would violate his protection against
self-incrimination under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, the
justices said.
</P>
<P>
   --Turned aside a plea for enhanced privacy by refusing to limit
how telephone companies use information gleaned from customers'
bills in trying to sell them additional services. The justices,
without comment, refused to reinstate Federal Communications
Commission rules wiped out as violations of telephone companies'
free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   --Refused to free the Three Mile Island nuclear plant's owners
from lawsuits by nearly 2,000 people who say their health problems
stem from the nation's worst nuclear accident in 1979. The court
rejected an appeal in which the plant owners argued that all the
lawsuits should be thrown out because a trial judge ruled against
10 people whose claims were designated as a ''test'' case.
</P>
<P>
   --Set aside the lengthy prison sentences given to five Branch
Davidians who survived a 1993 siege at the sect's Waco, Texas,
compound. The court ruled that a federal judge misused an anti-gun
law to increase their punishment.
</P>
<P>
   --Ordered a new sentencing hearing for a convicted Texas killer
after state prosecutors conceded that the life-or-death decision
had been based in part on the fact he is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   --Said that people who go to federal court to appeal a denial of
Social Security disability benefits can raise issues they did not
pursue during an earlier administrative appeal.

<HEADLINE> Director Blakemore Wins Two Tonys  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tony awards kissed ''Kate,'' ''Copenhagen''
and ''Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadway's top honor also kissed Michael Blakemore twice, as the
71-year-old director won awards for his direction of both a
musical, ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' and a play, ''Copenhagen,'' a Tony
first.
</P>
<P>
   The 1948 Cole Porter musical was the night's big winner, picking
up five awards, including the prize for musical revival. Michael
Frayn's dense drama of physics and friendship was named best play.
''Contact,'' an innovative dance musical devised by Susan Stroman
and John Weidman, was chosen best musical.
</P>
<P>
   But Blakemore was the man of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is 'Thank you, America.' And by America, I mean
New York. And by New York, I mean Broadway,'' the director said
during his second trip to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Besides director and musical-revival, ''Kate'' won prizes for
its leading man, Brian Stokes Mitchell, as well as for costumes and
orchestrations.
</P>
<P>
   Stroman's work on ''Contact'' won her the prize for best
choreography, while two of the show's featured (supporting)
performers, Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, also were honored. It was
Gaines' third Tony, having won previously for ''The Heidi
Chronicles'' and a revival of ''She Loves Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dance has lifts and dips and unexpected turns just as real
life does. Had I not fallen in love with Mike Ockrent, I could have
never have written 'Contact,''' said an emotional Stroman
referring, to her husband, a director who died in December of
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Tony nominators ignored ''Aida'' in the best-musical category,
but the Disney musical had its own revenge, doing surprising well
in the numbers race. It tied ''Contact'' with four Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Headley, its radiant star, was named best actress in a
musical as the crowd at Radio City Music Hall cheered its approval.
An emotional Headley told Disney: ''I will work for you for the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice picked up an award for their
pop-flavored score and the lavish musical, set in ancient Egypt,
also got Tonys for scenic and lighting design.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Real Thing,'' Tom Stoppard's meditation on the love,
captured the prize for revival-play as well as the top acting
awards for its two stars -- Stephen Dillane and Jennifer Ehle. The
actress was up against her mother, Rosemary Harris, in the
actress-play category.
</P>
<P>
   Several productions went home empty handed including ''Dirty
Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's play about Mae West; a Stroman-directed
revival of Meredith Willson's ''The Music Man'' and George Wolfe's
adaptation of ''The Wild Party,'' which has been struggling at the
box office.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' the critically praised revival
of Eugene O'Neill's play, could manage only one award -- to veteran
British performer Roy Dotrice for his portrayal of a whiskey-soaked
Connecticut farmer in the featured category. The featured actress
prize went to Blair Brown of ''Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dead,'' a musical adaptation of the James Joyce short
story, also managed only one award: book of a musical for Richard
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Australian actor Barry Humphries -- better known as Dame Edna --
provided the evening's comic highlight. Dame Edna presented the
award for costume design as well as a big, messy kiss to Martin
Pakledinaz of ''Kiss Me, Kate.'' A lipstick-smeared Pakledinaz was
so flustered that he had a hard time delivering his acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   After a year off, Rosie O'Donnell returning as a host of the CBS
Tony telecast didn't improve its typically anemic ratings. In
Nielsen overnights -- reflecting about one-half of the nation's TV
homes -- it notched a 7.2 rating and 11 share of audience, down from
a 7.8 rating and 13 share in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Donnell worked smoothly with co-host Nathan Lane in
moving the show along -- so smoothly that it came up a minute or two
short. The two comics had to vamp until the credits started
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in 21 categories were chosen by 705 members of the
theatrical profession and journalists. The Tony awards were started
in 1947 by the American Theater Wing, a theater service
organization. They were named after the late Antoinette Perry, an
actress and past chairwoman of the theater wing.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 20; Nasdaq Up 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were moving between modest gains and
losses today as investors took some profits from last week's sharp
gains but continued rewarding technology companies with strong
growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 19.50 at 10,814.26.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 7.96 at 3,821.34, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 6.92 at 1,470.34.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was very quiet as investors captured some gains from a
strong, broad-based rally last week. The Nasdaq rose 19 percent
last week, the index's biggest weekly gain in history and a
dramatic departure from the weakness it demonstrated in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq turned in
a mixed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm fell $4.50 to $68.188. Over the weekend, China United
Telecommunications confirmed it won't use a mobile phone technology
designed by Qualcomm for at least three years. Speculation about
the China contract had heightened volatility in Qualcomm shares in
the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $4.688 to $53.188, following a 15 percent gain
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba rose $8.063 to $78.563 after the company formed a
partnership with VeriSign Inc. and American Express to provide a
card payment processing function for online business-to-business
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Advanced Micro Devices rose
$3.25 to $92.125. The company has introduced a souped-up version of
its Athlon computer chip and a new bargain brand; both products are
viewed as a challenge to industry leader Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity stimulated some trading. Primark rose $8.313 to
$37.313 after Thomson Corp. agreed to buy it for $842 million in
cash. Both companies are providers of professional and financial
information.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were still reveling in last week's good
economic news. A stream of economic data showed a modest slowdown
in the economy, which many investors interpreted as a sign that the
Federal Reserve may not need to aggressively raise interest rates
to keep inflation from rearing up.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a widespread perception that the Fed won't raise
rates at its June meeting, and perhaps that they're done for the
year,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities. ''It will be hard for them to justify raising interest
rates when there is evidence of a slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the only economic report expected to move markets is
the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, due out on Friday.
With a dearth of news, the market may struggle to find direction,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert McTeer said
today that there's little question that the Fed's six interest-rate
increases in the past year are having the desired effect. But he
cautioned against placing too much stock in one month's figures.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, he said, ''are always all over the place and it
remains to be seen whether this is a fluke or signs of a changing
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 654.55 million
shares, well behind Friday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.50 to
512.53.

<HEADLINE> SEC Warns Investors on Annuities  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are warning investors to be
wary about variable annuities, an increasingly popular way to save
for retirement that combines features of mutual funds and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While they offer attractive features such as lifelong payments
and death benefits, variable annuities also have some pitfalls
which salesmen often don't reveal to investors, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said Monday. The agency issued an ''investor
alert'' and a brochure on its Web site to help investors understand
the benefits, costs and risks of variable annuities.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came as Paul Roye, director of the SEC's Investment
Management Division, told an industry group that SEC inspectors
have been gathering information on sales of variable annuities from
brokerage firms and financial advisers around the country with an
eye to possible sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is warning, for example, that bonuses offered by some
companies selling variable annuities to lure investors may be
outweighed by higher expenses. The bonuses, typically a small
percentage of the value of the annuity, are in the form of credits
applied to an annuity holder's purchase payments.
</P>
<P>
   The companies offering bonuses may, for example, charge higher
penalties for withdrawals, the SEC notes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mackey, president and chief executive officer of the
National Association for Variable Annuities, acknowledged that
bonus credits ''benefit some, but not all, investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are sold by insurance companies, brokerage
firms and other financial companies. Sales nationwide reached some
$120 billion last year, up from around $100 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A variable annuity is a contract between an investor and the
company selling it in which the company agrees to make periodic
payments to the investor, beginning immediately or at some future
date. The investor buys a variable annuity contract by making
either a single purchase payment or a series of payments.
</P>
<P>
   The payments to the annuity holder vary and are determined by
the performance of the underlying investments. Variable annuities
offer several investment options, usually involving mutual funds
that invest in stocks, bonds or money-market instruments, or some
combination of the three.
</P>
<P>
   With fixed annuities, by contrast, all payments to the annuity
holder are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities differ from mutual funds in several important
ways. They are tax-deferred, for example, which means annuity
holders pay no taxes on the income and investment gains from their
annuities until they withdraw their money.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the SEC says, the benefits of tax deferral will
outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only if it is held as a
long-term investment to meet retirement and other long-range goals.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) retirement plans,
which offer tax deferral at no cost, are often more advantageous
than variable annuities, the SEC notes.
</P>
<P>
   The agency issued the following advice:
</P>
<P>
   --IRAs: If an investor buys a variable annuity through a
tax-advantaged retirement plan such as an IRA or 401(k), he or she
will get no additional tax benefit from the variable annuity.
Investors should consider buying a variable annuity in that
situation only if it makes sense because of the annuity's other
features, such as lifelong payments and a guaranteed death benefit.
</P>
<P>
   --Charges: Before they invest in a variable annuity, consumers
should make sure they understand the charges that come with it,
including sales charges, mortality charges, administrative fees and
expenses of the mutual fund investment options.
</P>
<P>
   --Exchanges: Investors who own a variable annuity and are
considering exchanging it for another one should weigh the decision
carefully. An investor who makes the exchange often loses the
ability to withdraw money without paying substantial charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, the head of the variable annuities trade group, said he
fully supported the SEC's efforts ''to educate the public about
annuity products.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Annuity products should be sold with full disclosure,'' he
said in a telephone interview.

<HEADLINE> Sen Byrd Nears Firearms Center Deal  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Byrd, one of the Senate's masters
of winning federal dollars for the folks back home, is close to an
agreement that would put a $24.9 million government firearms
training center in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging deal would set aside roughly 30 acres of federal
land just outside historic Harpers Ferry, W.Va., a compromise from
an original plan that angered preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's initial proposal for the facility, where the Treasury
Department is to train hundreds of federal agents annually,
involved 327 acres. That was supported by local business owners,
but preservationists complained about potential development and
said the plan would mar the scene of one of Confederate Gen. Thomas
''Stonewall'' Jackson's most impressive victories.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists said Monday that the tentative deal was a
positive development, but said they still wanted to see details.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 41-year Senate veteran, had inserted language into an
agriculture spending bill providing the money to build the center
and transferring the 327 acres to the Treasury Department from the
Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   But under the tentative compromise, the Treasury Department
would receive only about 30 acres. The remainder would be used
''for preservation'' and remain controlled by the Fish and Wildlife
Service, along with the National Park Service, according to a
written statement by Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Byrd all along has been interested in preserving the historic
portions of the property,'' the senator's spokeswoman, Ann Adler,
said Monday in describing the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Guide, deputy assistant secretary for policy for the
Interior Department, said there was ''a conceptual agreement,''
adding, ''There is no reason why we can't work out'' a final
agreement to change Byrd's original language.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department is parent agency of the Fish and
Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rosa, executive director of the Harpers Ferry Conservancy,
a nonprofit land preservation group, called the new plan ''a major
step in the right direction.'' But he said he wanted to see
specific details about plans for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Argust, lobbyist with the National Parks Conservation
Association in Washington, said she was concerned that Byrd's
language would still sidestep federal requirements for an
environmental review and consideration of an alternative site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not quite there yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 82, has brought well over $1 billion in federal projects
to his home state of West Virginia since becoming chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee in 1989. Since 1995, with
Republicans in the majority, he has been top Democrat on that
committee, which oversees one-third of the $1.8 trillion federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Harpers Ferry, about 65 miles from Washington, was the site of
abolitionist John Brown's ill-fated raid on a federal arsenal there
in 1859. In 1862, Jackson outmaneuvered a federal garrison in the
bombed-out city and captured more than 12,500 U.S. troops, the most
Northern soldiers to surrender in any Civil War engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists have long wanted to add more than 1,000 acres --
including the entire Fish and Wildlife Service tract -- to the
existing 2,345-acre Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   Local builders and business people have supported the training
center and, in some cases, using some of the Fish and Wildlife land
for development.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Draws Jeers From Heckler  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- For Vladimir Zhirinovsky, President Clinton's
address to the Russian Duma was hardly an occasion to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame!'' the ultranationalist leader shouted at his colleagues
as Clinton left the podium.''Whom are you applauding?''
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky talked loudly throughout Clinton's 50-minute speech
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him in English, lift the blockade on Iraq, withdraw
troops from Yugoslavia and do not intervene in Russian affairs,''
Zhirinovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first American president to address the Russian
parliament, ignored the flamboyant lawmaker, whose previous antics
included throwing water on deputies and a fight in which he pulled
a female colleague's hair.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Zhirinovsky complained that the U.S. Secret Service
took over the legislative building -- ''They behave like
occupiers!'' he cried -- and claimed that the Russian government had
to bring in people to pad the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were practically no deputies in the hall -- only hired
people brought in from the Foreign Ministry and the Federal
Security Service,'' Zhirinovsky told reporters.''They also brought
cleaning women and other technical personnel here -- and Clinton
thought he was speaking to members of the Russian parliament!''
</P>
<P>
   There were several dozen empty seats in the hall, and
Zhirinovsky said only 120 of the 450 deputies were present.
</P>
<P>
   But Boris Gryzlov, head of the pro-Kremlin Unity group, said
about 300 deputies had attended the session. And legislator Andrei
Kokoshin said some deputies were erroneously told that the speech
would start an hour after it actually did.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Appeal to Americans  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chechen leaders are appealing to Americans to
help accomplish what official Washington and the international
community couldn't -- stop the war in their devastated republic.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by several former cabinet members, actor Richard Gere and
other prominent Americans, Ilyas Akhmadov, who acts as Chechnya's
foreign minister Monday announced a proposal for a cease-fire and
investigation of alleged war crimes in the independence-minded
Russian region.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war has been going on for nine months already and it
brings a lot of suffering to ... civilians,'' Akhmadov said,
estimating the dead at 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Akhmadov, not officially recognized by the U.S. government
because Chechnya is not a recognized nation, said the peace
proposal was sent to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. He said
he will promote it in meetings with senators, congressmen and
Clinton administration officials during a two-week visit.
</P>
<P>
   Akhmadov was encouraged to visit the United States by the
American Committee for Chechnya, a Washington-based group formed a
few months ago, said member Irena Lasota. He said he came to call
Americans' attention to the peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Other members include former national security advisers Zbigniew
Brzezinski and Robert McFarlane, former Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, as well as
other former U.S. diplomats, according to its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Akhmadov said he wasn't asking the United States to mediate, but
that it ''influence, somehow, the Russian side.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal seeks a cease-fire and creation of a monitoring
committee to include the warring sides as well as the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the human rights
watchdog Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Shurgalin, spokesman for the Russian Embassy, said
officials there hadn't seen the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has called for talks with
Moscow before. Moscow has indicated it is looking for a political
solution, but has said repeatedly it will not negotiate with rebels
unless they give up their weapons and turn over any hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also question whether Maskhadov has authority over
the fractured rebel command to enforce a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, and other nations, have
repeatedly told Moscow they oppose the Russian crackdown in
Chechnya, particularly the humanitarian crisis. President Clinton
repeated that again to President Vladimir Putin in his weekend
summit.

<HEADLINE> Putin Looks to Vatican for Help  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In his first trip to the West since his
inauguration, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Pope John Paul
II and Italian leaders Monday for help in gaining Russia's
political and military integration in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The former KGB official called the Vatican stop ''a very
significant visit,'' which he insisted on making at the onset of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no report of progress on a long-sought papal
trip to Russia, the pope's spokesman said the invitation first
issued by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin showed up 20 minutes late, the breach of protocol
didn't seem to upset the businesslike atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Premier Giuliano Amato at the start of his two-day
Italian trip, Putin reached out to the Europeans and reiterated his
call for Russia to work with the West on a possible joint
anti-missile defense that would not breach the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia proposed working with Europe and NATO to create an
anti-rocket defense system for Europe,'' Putin said. ''On one hand,
it would avoid all the problems linked to the balance of force; on
the other, it would permit in an absolute manner a 100 percent
guarantee of the security of every European country.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials had broached similar ideas in talks with U.S.
officials about so-called theater missile defense systems, which
fit into the framework of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But senior U.S. officials consider the option inadequate against
potential long-range missiles from North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin agreed in their Moscow summit to continue
discussions on nuclear issues, including the ABM treaty and nuclear
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin was hoping to escape Vatican admonitions on its war
in Chechnya and Putin succeeded in that. There was no mention of
Putin's uncompromising stand in the bland Vatican communique on the
50 minutes of talks, including a half-hour one-on-one with John
Paul with only interpreters present.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said John Paul
mainly listened as Putin described his mission of enlisting Vatican
help in ''the process of integration between East and West.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight around the Vatican, with police stationed at
major streets near St. Peter's Square. A police helicopter flew
overhead as Putin's motorcade entered the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In greeting Putin, John Paul said, ''I am very happy to receive
you at the Vatican at the beginning of your mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls was cautious about the prospects of a trip to
Russia, long dreamed of by John Paul in his bid for reconciliation
between Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman did note the more positive tone from the Moscow
patriarch, Alexey II, over the weekend, which contrasted with often
harsh accusations that the Vatican is seeking to win converts in
traditional Orthodox territory.
</P>
<P>
   Putin gave the pope a book on the restoration of the Kremlin;
John Paul in turn presented the president with a bas-relief of
Saints Peter and Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Putin set the tone for the trip in an interview Sunday in the
Milan-based financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore. He called his own
election in March -- marking the country's first democratic transfer
of power -- the onset of an investor-friendly time of sustained
political stability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin spoke of his dream of a prosperous Russia, on Russia's
terms, saying, ''We can count on a dignified future if we know how
to unite the universal principles of free-market economics and of
democracy with the unique characteristics of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin paid his first Western visit in April, to Britain, while
still acting president after Boris Yeltsin's resignation. The
inauguration for Putin's elected term came in May.
</P>
<P>
   Putin goes to Milan on Tuesday for meetings with Italian
business leaders, including Gianni Agnelli, scion of Italy's Fiat
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also is due to meet with chiefs of Italy's leading ENI oil
and gas company.

   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's Ministry of Defense, embarrassed by
several recent computer thefts from military and security
personnel, disclosed Monday it has lost 67 laptop computers in the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1997, 59 laptops have been stolen and eight others
mislaid by absent-minded staff, junior Defense Minister Lewis
Moonie said in a House of Commons written answer.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend, a newspaper revealed that Armed Forces Minister
John Spellar -- the man in charge of Britain's nuclear secrets -- had
had a laptop stolen from his home south of London.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Defense confirmed the theft, which occurred
March 25, but said the stolen computer did not contain defense
information.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a series of laptop losses from government and
military officials that prompted a review of security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, a laptop containing training information for
MI6, the spy agency responsible for foreign intelligence, was
mislaid by an intelligence officer after a night out at a London
tapas bar. It was recovered by police two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, a second laptop with classified material on
Northern Ireland was snatched from a MI5 security service officer
at London's Paddington Station when the officer put it down to buy
a train ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, a naval officer lost his computer and his personal
luggage after boarding a train at Paddington station. The computer,
reported to contain detailed information on a new fighter airplane,
was recovered two weeks later by a tabloid newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Court Dismisses Hubbell Charge  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court wiped out presidential
friend Webster Hubbell's guilty plea to a misdemeanor tax charge
Monday, saying he could not be prosecuted with documents he was
forced to provide under immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is abundantly clear that ... (Hubbell's) act of producing
subpoenaed documents was the first step in a chain of evidence that
led to this prosecution,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in the
court's 8-1 decision that bolstered the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The documents did not magically appear in the prosecutor's
office like 'manna from heaven,''' Stevens said. ''They arrived
there only after (Hubbell) asserted his constitutional privilege,
received a grant of immunity'' and provided the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, in a telephone interview, said, ''It's a nice victory
but it's even a better victory for the Constitution ... We've
always felt we were right on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, John W. Nields Jr., said that if the court had ruled
the other way, ''prosecutors all over the country could begin their
investigations by serving broad document subpoenas on their
subjects and just looking through the documents to see what they
can find.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell pleaded guilty to the tax charge last year on condition
his plea would be dismissed if the Supreme Court ruled in his favor
on whether the documents could be used. In doing so Monday, the
nation's highest court ordered the charge against him dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell had reached the plea agreement with former independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who was replaced by Robert W. Ray last
October. Ray's office said it would seek dismissal of Hubbell's
plea and said that following the ruling, ''federal prosecutors
should now be able to accurately predict the full consequences'' of
granting such immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fifth Amendment has trumped the Office of Independent
Counsel,'' said William Moffitt, president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was the former No. 3 official at the Justice Department
early in President Clinton's first term and has been a friend of
the president and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton since their
Arkansas days.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor tax charge alleged that Hubbell evaded paying
taxes on income he received from friends of the Clintons during a
1994 investigation of Hubbell by Starr, who was appointed to probe
the Clintons' Whitewater real estate dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The tax charge, filed in April 1998, was based partly on
Hubbell's financial papers, which he was required to give
prosecutors under a limited grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fifth Amendment protects criminal defendants from
being forced to testify against themselves, it does not protect the
contents of private documents someone created voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   However, the amendment can protect people from being forced to
give such documents to prosecutors when that involves confirming
their existence and authenticity -- a form of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell argued that prosecutors could not use his papers to
prosecute him after giving him immunity to turn them over. A
federal judge agreed and dismissed the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
revived the charge in January 1999 but said prosecutors could use
information from the documents only by showing they had
''reasonably particular knowledge'' of their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office conceded it could not meet that standard and
agreed to dismiss Hubbell's plea if the Supreme Court upheld the
appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion noted that people can be required to provide
incriminating evidence, such as blood or handwriting samples. But
in being forced to turn over documents, Hubbell had to ''make
extensive use of the contents of his own mind,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here the government has not shown that it had any prior
knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of the 13,120
pages of documents ultimately produced'' by Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence
Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Thomas wrote
separately for himself and Scalia that the Fifth Amendment's
protection against self-incrimination may be even broader than
Monday's ruling indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented, saying he agreed
with a judge who dissented from the federal appeals court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Not affected by Monday's case is Hubbell's guilty plea to a
felony charge involving legal work for a savings and loan at the
center of the Whitewater investigation. He was sentenced to a year
of probation on that charge in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The case is U.S. vs. Hubbell, 99-166.

<HEADLINE> OAS May Recognize Fujimori Victory  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- Avoiding a harsh response to Peru's
controversial presidential election, the Organization of American
States considered recognizing Alberto Fujimori's victory while
urging an investigation into vote irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution proposed by host Canada, still undergoing
back-room negotiations over wording before reaching the full OAS
general assembly, would stop short of any sanctions against Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Peru's May 28 run-off vote was plagued with
irregularities, prompting an OAS observer mission to pull out and
Fujimori's opponent to boycott the vote. The United States and
other nations denounced Fujimori's re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   At Peru's insistence, OAS foreign ministers here dropped
language in the resolution that questioned the election results,
Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The current proposal notes that problems tainted the democratic
electoral process, and calls for an investigative mission to head
to Peru ''immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission, comprising OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria of
Colombia and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy,
would work with the government and other political groups on
reforming the election process and bolstering freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   The Peru election was the main issue of the second day of the
OAS three-day general assembly, following protests Sunday by
free-trade activists that led to 41 arrests and prompted
overwhelming security measures.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters turned up at the downtown Windsor meeting site by
mid-afternoon Monday, probably due as much to cold, rainy weather
that descended on this southern Ontario city across the border from
Detroit as to the armed riot police patrolling downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Outside an OAS luncheon elsewhere, scores of demonstrators
linked arms and sat down in the rain to block delegates from
entering. Police had to pick up some of the protesters to clear the
road. No arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The protests Sunday were the largest in memory at an OAS
gathering and brought the grouping of 34 countries face-to-face
with the anti-free trade movement that disrupted a World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle in December and also evoked street
clashes at an International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Stein, the Guatemalan diplomat who headed the OAS
election mission in Peru, said Monday his group pointed out voting
irregularities, such as illegal use of public resources by Fujimori
and moves to stifle the opposition and judiciary. The mission left
Peru before the run-off vote when its request to examine new
computer software introduced to count the ballots was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won 51.2 percent of the vote in a run-off after
challenger Alejandro Toledo boycotted the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission tried to pinpoint some key issues that, if
addressed properly, would have given back a substantial amount of
trust that was lost,'' Stein said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights report has accused the South American country of
failing to meet democratic election standards. Former President
Jimmy Carter joined two former Latin American leaders in an open
letter to the OAS meeting that also criticized the Peru election.
</P>
<P>
   Some OAS nations including the United States wanted a harsh
response to Peru, possibly sanctions, which must be recommended by
the foreign ministers. Other nations, including Brazil and Mexico,
argued the OAS should stay out of internal electoral issues.

<HEADLINE> Tony Ratings Down From Last Year  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie's return did not help the Tony Awards in
the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rosie O'Donnell's reappearance as host, the two-hour
broadcast on CBS Sunday night dropped to a 7.2 rating and 11 share
of the audience, down from a 7.8 rating and a 13 share last year,
according to preliminary Nielsen figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all a little disappointed,'' said Tony spokesman Keith
Sherman. ''But the competition was stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was up against several potent opponents, including
ABC's powerhouse ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the Los Angeles
Lakers-Portland Trail Blazers NBA playoff game on NBC and the
season premiere of ''Sex and the City'' on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell had served as host of the show in 1997 and 1998,
dropping out last year because of a busy schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The television program was a boost, however, for Sunday night's
big Tony winners -- ''Copenhagen,'' ''Contact'' and ''Kiss Me,
Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   The three, which won awards for best play, musical and
musical-revival respectively, reported sizable jumps Monday in
box-office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' the innovative dance musical about relationships
between men and women, was expected to double its daily box-office
take to around $400,000, according to producer Bernard Gersten. The
show, at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, is selling
tickets through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks bleak, though, for at least one musical shut
out of the prizes Sunday night. ''The Wild Party'' was nominated
for seven awards and didn't win any. Its producers are expected to
decide by Tuesday whether to keep the show -- which opened in April
to mixed reviews -- running.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Limit Use of Phone Data  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Monday allowed telephone
companies to continue using customer information -- such as their
phone-using habits -- to market other services to them without their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   That means phone companies don't need to get written, oral or
electronic consent from individual consumers before using their
records to try to sell them other products -- as federal rules had
sought to require. Instead, the companies could use phone bills to
target pitches for new services as long as they disclose they are
doing so and customers do not expressly object.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court had knocked down the Federal Communications
Commission rules implementing parts of a 1996 telecommunications
law. On Monday, the justices, without comment, refused to reinstate
the protections.
</P>
<P>
   U S West, SBC Communications and other local phone companies had
challenged the FCC's rules -- which mandated that customers must
actively ''opt-in'' to allow their data to be used. The commission
concluded that such an approach would best ensure that customers
knowingly waive, at least partially, the privacy of their phone
records.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies said the rules violated their free-speech
rights, by taking away their ability to tailor their communications
to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court has taken a responsible and consumer-friendly
position,'' said U S West spokesman David Fish. ''Now the phone
companies can protect privacy while at the same time answering
customers' desires to be kept up-to-date about new products and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   U S West, a Baby Bell providing local phone service in 14
Western states, said the FCC could safeguard customers' privacy by
allowing an ''opt-out'' approach instead.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal acted on Monday was filed by the Competition Policy
Institute, an independent nonprofit organization that advocates
greater competition in telecommunications and is funded primarily
by companies seeking entry into the local phone market.
</P>
<P>
   The group had sought to reinstate the commission rules -- thrown
out by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals -- arguing that such information is ''data, not speech.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the group said it hopes the FCC will be able to
implement new rules that will protect consumer privacy and be
defensible in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's alarming what might happen unless responsible
policy-makers get involved and return consumers rights to them,''
said Ron Binz, the institute's president. He warned that companies
could release the profiles of customers' calling patterns to third
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy
advocate said that without safeguards, phone records could be used
to ''counter-coupon.'' For example, if a consumer orders items from
one catalog company, that information could be sold to a rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing we need is an Orwell long-distance,'' Catlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies have insisted that they only want to use the
information within their own divisions and that they support
getting prior consent from customers to give the data to
unaffiliated third parties, said Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of
constitutional law at Harvard Law School, who had argued on behalf
of U S West in the 10th Circuit case.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe expressed hope that in crafting new regulations the FCC
would ''draw a more sensitive balance and a distinction between use
by the telephone company itself and use by a third party,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit court, while throwing out the commission's
regulations, did not strike down the underlying provisions of the
telecommunications law and did not bar the FCC from trying to
impose new privacy-protecting rules.
</P>
<P>
   In light of that, the commission decided not to mount a Supreme
Court appeal. Clinton administration lawyers said Supreme Court
consideration of the case would be premature since the FCC has not
yet decided what new rules might suffice.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Competition Policy Institute vs. U S West, 99-1427.

<HEADLINE> White House Must Produce E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the White House on
Monday to retrieve e-mails from President Clinton and the first
lady and 31 presidential aides concerning the FBI files
controversy, Linda Tripp and presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit brought by a conservative group, U.S. District
Judge Royce Lamberth ordered e-mails produced within 20 days in the
case of hundreds of appointees from the Reagan and Bush
administrations whose FBI background files were gathered by the
Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   While calling for a search of White House computer archives,
Lamberth said he will deal later with the problem that 100,000 or
more e-mails were not archived and are being reconstructed from
computer back-up tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative group, Judicial Watch, is trying to prove that
the Clinton administration routinely attacked its political enemies
by using confidential material protected by the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is allowing the conservative group to delve into two
side issues -- the use of information from Linda Tripp's personnel
file at the Pentagon and the White House's release of personal
letters of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Lifts Foreign Media Censor  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lanka's military said Monday it
killed 1,000 rebels during May in fighting for the northern Jaffna
peninsula, and the government stiffened its stand on pursuing peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the government lifted censorship on foreign news
media coverage of the 17-year civil war. It continued censorship on
the local news media.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the separatists of duplicity, President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said there was no point in holding talks with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''For six years we have tried to talk to them and for six years
they have lied,'' Kumaratunga told the British Broadcasting Corp.
in an interview broadcast Monday. ''They have deceived foreign
countries and governments on the pretext they are going to talk and
up to date they have refused to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry's top spokesman, Brig. Palitha Fernando,
said 1,000 Tamil Tiger rebels have been killed and an equal number
wounded in fighting in the past month in the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have come to this figure after monitoring terrorists'
transmissions and from information from our units,'' Fernando told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said 800 of the deaths were in the first three weeks of May,
while a lull in the fighting since then has resulted in only 200
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of his statement. The
government does not allow journalists to the war zone. However,
fighting has decreased in the region, which suggests the rebels may
have suffered losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers did not comment on their Web sites. The group,
which is banned in Sri Lanka, also does not allow journalists into
combat areas.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga decided to end a month of censorship on what
foreign-based news media send to the rest of the world because
''they have been very responsible,'' Media Minister Mangala
Samaraweera said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sri Lankan government said foreign reports about the
civil war will continue to be censored before they can be printed
or broadcast locally.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been fighting since
1983 to create a homeland for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, who make
up 18 percent of the 18.6 million population. The war has left
62,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rebels made spectacular military gains in the past
two months, since May 22 their advances were halted by troops with
better weapons bought from international markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a sea battle Monday, Tamil Tiger rebels destroyed an
Israeli-made navy attack craft while the Sri Lankan air force sank
another by mistake, a Sri Lankan naval officer told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The naval officer said the air force mistakenly fired on one of
the navy's Dvoras, which then sank. The officer said he could not
confirm how many men were on the boat or what happened to them, but
he said such craft normally carry about 15 crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of Tigers rebel radio, monitored in the town of
Vavuniya, said the insurgents killed 15 government sailors and lost
13 fighters in the sea battle.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, foot patrols shot and killed seven rebels in the
outskirts of Jaffna city, said government spokesman and chief
censor Ariya Rubasinghe. There was no mention of government
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 soldiers are defending Jaffna from attacks
by rebels seeking to regain their stronghold of 1990-95.

<HEADLINE> Wagner Family Clashes Over Festival  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The family feud between Richard Wagner's
descendants over the world-famous music festival he inaugurated was
dragging out to Wagnerian-like lengths, after the festival board
put off a decision Monday on who would head the event.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over who should direct the festival has been brewing
for years, but it won't be resolved until after this summer's
festival in the Bavarian city of Bayreuth.
</P>
<P>
   ''High Noon in Bayreuth'' was how Berlin's Tagesspiegel
newspaper labeled the showdown between Wagner's 80-year-old
grandson, who has led the festival for nearly 50 years, and other
descendants, who want to breathe fresh life into the staid corners
of German culture.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gains the directorship could make major changes to the
festival Wagner started by staging the premiere of his 18-hour Ring
opera series in 1876.
</P>
<P>
   However, the board postponed its decision because two candidates
-- Wagner's great-grandchildren Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Wieland
Lafferentz -- decided to vie for the directorship separately, rather
than together, and needed time to form individual proposals for the
festival, said Josef Erhard of the Bavaria state Culture Ministry,
chairman of the festival foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have until Oct. 1 to come up with their plans,
Erhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Current director Wolfgang Wagner has insisted he will stay on in
the job under his lifetime contract, unless the board chooses his
wife and longtime assistant, Gudrun, to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   But the voices for change are numerous and have the support of
lawmakers looking to cut the festival's subsidies. Along with four
members of the Wagner family, the 24-member festival board includes
members of federal, state and local government.
</P>
<P>
   Other Wagner descendants have called for major changes to the
festival. Great-granddaughter Nike Wagner proposed replacing some
traditional pieces with other Wagner works typically unheard at the
festival, as well as with works by other composers.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested inviting corporate sponsorship and holding added
festival events on Bayreuth's main square outside the Festspielhaus
theater, which Wagner designed as the ideal stage for his work.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Could Be Tailored for Genes  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors accused her of being a hypochondriac:
The woman suffered dizziness and a racing heartbeat from each
antidepressant she tried, even though she was taking doses normally
far too low to cause side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate woman finally saw Dr. Raymond Woosley, who scanned
her DNA with a special ''gene chip'' and discovered she actually
has a genetic quirk that makes her super-sensitive to certain
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   She's lucky: Some people die while taking some of the world's
most popular drugs -- from antibiotics to heartburn remedies -- all
because no one knew their genes made them uniquely susceptible to
devastating side effects.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. A new science called
''pharmacogenomics'' aims to curb the problem by replacing today's
one-dose-fits-all culture with simple tests to help doctors
customize prescriptions, picking the safest, most effective drug
for each patient's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Woosley and colleagues are testing the new technology
at Georgetown University Medical Center. Just swab the inside of a
patient's cheek for a DNA sample, and run it over a tiny glass gene
chip the size of a postage stamp. The chip detects an errant enzyme
system called p450 that affects how safely people metabolize dozens
of popular medicines.
</P>
<P>
   P450 testing is so successful that Woosley just launched an
international registry, closely watched by the Food and Drug
Administration, to investigate other gene variations that make some
people collapse with a lethal irregular heartbeat after taking any
of 50 common drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And some companies are poised to begin offering, possibly within
the next year, the first direct-to-consumer pharmacogenomic
testing. The idea: Instead of waiting for gene chips to reach your
doctor's office, just send a cheek swab to a gene-testing
laboratory to see if you're at risk from certain drugs, explains
Josh Baker, president of PPGx Inc., one company hoping to offer
consumer testing. Then give the test results to your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear this concept works,'' says Woosley, a clinical
pharmacologist and heart specialist. New research to pinpoint who's
at risk ''is some of the most exciting stuff I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the best medicines don't help everyone. Drugs are sold
after they prove an effect on the average disease sufferer, not
every individual. So there's little way to know who's wasting time
on treatment that will fail, and who will suffer side effects. Some
2 million Americans are hospitalized annually for side effects, and
100,000 die.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacogenomics aims to improve that.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your standard gene test. It doesn't reveal
disease-causing gene mutations. Instead, tests hunt subtle genetic
variations called polymorphisms that can determine reactions to
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Take p450, the best-known family of drug-processing enzymes. An
estimated 7 percent of Americans lack certain p450 enzymes,
allowing some drugs to climb to toxic levels in their bodies. Other
people's p450 enzymes work too fast, clearing a drug out of the
bloodstream too fast for it to fight disease.
</P>
<P>
   P450 isn't the only concern. Leukemia specialists are starting
to test patients for another enzyme deficiency that makes the
standard dose of a children's leukemia therapy called
mercaptopurine far too high for their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 50 common drugs occasionally cause a lethal irregular
heartbeat. Patients' hearts first exhibit a rhythm change called
''long QT interval'' before going into the arrhythmia with the
unwieldy name ''torsades de points.'' Some genes can spur this
problem by making drugs 10 times more potent at blocking heart
relaxation channels, Woosley said.
</P>
<P>
   His lab just launched an international effort to research
survivors and create gene chips to test patients for the risk
before they take a new drug. Doctors, or torsades survivors, can
check http://www.qtdrugs.org to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Gene chips will take several more years to hit the market. But
PPGx and other labs today can find gene-drug interactions through
standard, cheap gene-test methods -- they already provide p450 and
other enzyme tests for drug manufacturers. Consumers very soon will
demand such tests, too, Baker predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they shouldn't take a drug, they should know. I know I
would want to know.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Eyes Territorial Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought
to speed up peacemaking, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Monday that Israel's security depends on a ''settlement presence''
along the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more ground we have, the better,'' Barak said during a
break in more than three hours of talks with Albright. It was the
start of a three-day Middle East trip by Albright that will include
a meeting with Syria's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also suggested he was inclined to sweeten his territorial
offers to the Palestinians in a drive to conclude a final accord
over such sensitive problems as Jerusalem's future and how much
land Yasser Arafat will have for his Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on the settlers issue in a televised interview,
however, Barak said it would be a historic achievement if he could
reach an agreement with Arafat that keeps 150,000 of the 200,000
Jewish settlers on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also accused Arafat of ''a certain amount of
foot-dragging'' in the prolonged and tedious negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright held two meetings with Barak, interspersed with a
working dinner at his home, and plans another session Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard very clearly Prime Minister Barak's commitment to an
agreement, and the discussions focused on how to get there,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed at a news conference about reports that he had
determined retention of the Jordan Valley was no longer essential
for Israel's security, the former Army chief of staff said a
land-for-peace trade-off is complicated. He said it is too early to
talk about areas Israel intends to keep.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we need security and a settlement presence along
the Jordan Valley,'' Barak said, ''but the details can be decided
only through negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright aims to set up a three-way summit for President Clinton
with Barak and Arafat and to prod the two leaders toward agreement
by their promised deadline of mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who accompanied Clinton on his trip to Russia, passed
up his stop in Ukraine to follow up on a meeting between the
president and Barak last week in Portugal and Clinton's telephone
talk from there with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Barak has offered to dismantle settlements
containing up to 60,000 Jewish settlers as part of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Haim Ramon, a close Barak aide who is minister for
Jerusalem affairs, told Israel's parliament the Knesset: ''Most of
the residents of the West Bank will be concentrated in settlement
blocs. We said most of the settlers -- not most of the
settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already virtually conceded establishment of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, meanwhile, have urged courage
on Barak and Arafat but insist they are not making separate
American proposals to cut through the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are there, ready to roll up our sleeves,'' Albright told
reporters at the prime minister's office. ''There really is a
historic opportunity, and we have to pursue it full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the building, about two dozen demonstrators shouted
''Albright, go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the concessions could involve Israel's surrender of
about 93 percent of the West Bank, coming closer to Arafat's
initial demand for a state on 99 percent of the territory Israel
won from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, traveling with Albright to Israel from
Moscow, said her aim was to determine ''what can and what cannot be
done'' by Barak and Arafat and to make preparations for a summit.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said to expect
at least one more trip by Albright to the region before any meeting
involving Clinton, Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the official said, there would still be a gap between
the two sides' positions. He said none of the major issues -- the
future of Jerusalem, the amount of land to be taken over by the
Palestinians and compensation for refugees -- has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   At Albright's request, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
agreed to meet with her Wednesday in Cairo. He will be in the
Egyptian capital with several other Arab foreign ministers for a
conference. Albright also will see Foreign Minister Youssef bin
Alawi of Oman and President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   She and Arafat are scheduled to meet Tuesday in Ramallah, on the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clinton is meeting in Washington on Tuesday
with King Abdullah of Jordan. If Israel turns over Jordan Valley
territory to the Palestinians, it could have an impact on Jordan's
security. The majority of Jordanians are Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Israel and Syria broke down in January over
whether Israel would give up land all the way to the Sea of Galilee
in returning the Golan Heights to Syria. Israel won the strategic
high ground in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The senior U.S. official said the door to negotiations remains
open, but he gave no indication the talks would be resumed.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Links Smog, Heart Attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Smog apparently doesn't hurt just your lungs:
New scientific research suggests that even moderate smog may induce
sudden death in people with existing heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound evidence, culled from more than a dozen studies on
humans and animals, shows that tiny pieces of soot called
particulates may alter the heart rate in some people, the Los
Angeles Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The link has not yet been proven, but there is a strong
likelihood that the particles cause the heart problems, possibly
indicating air pollution poses a greater public health threat than
previously thought, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease is the top killer in the United States,
responsible for about half of all deaths.
</P>
<P>
   At smog levels found in many U.S. cities, the inhalation of
particulates can disrupt a person's ability to regulate the pumping
of blood. The threat is particularly severe for older people who
have arrhythmia, a condition marked by an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''When particulate pollution increases, the heart rate seems to
go up a little bit and the variability in the heart rate seems to
go down. Those are things classically seen (in people) with heart
failure,'' said Dr. Timothy Denton, a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Studies suggest that people are dying relatively rapidly after
you see an increase in particles. Sometimes it's within 24 hours,''
said Robert Devlin of the Environmental Protection Agency's
clinical research branch.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in heart rhythm that occur after breathing particulates
are subtle on an electrocardiogram and do not affect healthy
people.
</P>
<P>
   Arden Pope, an epidemiologist at Brigham Young University, said
''it's incredibly good news'' if the link can be proven.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already know that about half of us die of cardiopulmonary
disease, and if this is true about particulates, we have found a
preventable cause,'' Pope said.

<HEADLINE> Death-Row Inmate Wins New Hearing  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Casting doubt on the fate of at least eight other
condemned inmates in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a
killer's death sentence Monday after prosecutors conceded that the
penalty was based in part on the fact that he is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered a new sentencing hearing for Victor Hugo
Saldano, convicted of murdering a man for his wallet and watch in a
Dallas suburb in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During the punishment phase of Saldano's trial, psychologist
Walter Quijano testified for the prosecution about Saldano's
''future dangerousness,'' an aggravating factor that allows Texas
courts to administer the death penalty instead of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano listed 24 factors in his assessment, including Saldano's
ethnicity. He testified that blacks and Hispanics are
over-represented in prison, and that Saldano's Hispanic background
''was a factor weighing in favor of future dangerousness.''
</P>
<P>
   In upholding Saldano's death sentence, the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals said that permitting use of his ethnicity was not
a ''fundamental error.''
</P>
<P>
   However, after Saldano's lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court, Texas Attorney General John Cornyn and his staff said the
state ''confesses error'' and joined in asking for the new
sentencing hearing. Saldano's guilt was not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano gave similar testimony at the trials of eight other
death row inmates, and those cases will get a closer look, said
Mark Heckmann, a spokesman for the Texas attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are reviewing those cases and expect to release our
findings by the end of the week,'' Heckmann said. He would not
identify the eight cases.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano was the state prison system's chief psychologist in the
early 1980s and is now in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano was on vacation Monday and unavailable for comment.
However, a colleague at his clinic said that whatever Quijano's
testimony was, it was based on scientific reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sworn to tell the whole truth, yet sometimes we are not
allowed to do that because attorneys orchestrate what is
disseminated in the courtroom,'' said the colleague, clinical
psychologist Roger Saunders, who like Quijano frequently gives
expert testimony for both prosecutors and defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Saldano is from Argentina, which joined 10 other Latin American
countries in urging the Supreme Court to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   ''Argentina finds it intrinsically offensive for anyone to
suggest that any Hispanic is more dangerous -- and therefore more
deserving of the death penalty -- simply because he is Hispanic,''
lawyers for Argentina told the court.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks Ukrainians  </HEADLINE>
By MARINA SYSOYEVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- To the suprise and delight of many
Ukrainians, President Clinton addressed them repeatedly Monday in
their own language, borrowing the words of beloved national poet
Taras Shevchenko.
</P>
<P>
   ''Borites, poboryte!'' Clinton exhorted. The phrase, which means
''fight and you shall overcome,'' drew cheers from thousands of
people who packed into a downtown plaza to hear Clinton speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Ukraine has the best opportunity in a thousand years
to achieve both freedom and prosperity,'' Clinton said. ''Do not
give up. Keep on fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the phrase at least four times during his speech,
which he ended with another native phrase: ''Slava Ukraina'' --
''Glory to Ukraine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He chose the key words to say,'' a woman told Ukraine's One
Plus One TV. ''He told us to fight ... and I heard that there is
freedom waiting ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and television reports estimated more than 50,000 people
came to the central Mykhailivska Square to listen to Clinton,
undeterred by 86-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight, however, and many frustrated Ukrainians
remained outside police cordons even though they were wearing
invitations they had received in the mail days earlier. An
enterprising company handed out leaflets advertising the new
''President'' brand of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian television reported that there were some 2,500
plainclothes officers and security agents on the square, while
sharpshooters were posted on surrounding roofs and church bell
towers.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience hoped to hear that Washington was ready to
provide aid for closing down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant --
which Clinton had already announced during his meeting with
President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived at the square after his session with Kuchma and
went into the newly reconstructed, gold-domed Mikhailivsky
Cathedral, which was demolished during the rule of Soviet dictator
Joseph Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging soon afterward, he laid a wreath at a small monument to
millions of Ukrainians who died during Stalin's forced famine of
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   While mournful music played, Clinton stood on a blue and yellow
podium -- Ukraine's national colors -- flanked by two girls who had
participated in a U.S. exchange program. Both greeted Clinton with
short speeches in Ukrainian and English.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd waved small U.S. and Ukrainian flags and cheered as
Clinton urged them not to despair on the difficult road to
democracy and economic rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing his speech to the peals of church bells, Clinton went
straight to the crowd, shaking outstretched hands and reaching
beyond the first rows of people to those who tried to grab his hand
from farther back.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Closure Problems Abound  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian leader Leonid Kuchma's plan to
close the troubled Chernobyl power plant will take years to
complete because of an array of technical and social complications.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the logistics of dismantling a facility filled with
radioactive material and aging machinery, Ukraine faces the
question of what will happen to thousands of people who depend on
the plant for their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''To our sorrow, political decisions precede the technical
ones,'' Chernobyl spokesman Oleh Holosokov told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Once Chernobyl's sole remaining reactor No. 3 is taken out of
service, maintaining the plant will cost about $6 million a year
until its nuclear fuel is completely unloaded -- a process that is
expected to take about five years.
</P>
<P>
   The first and second of Chernobyl's four reactors, already
idled, required twice that amount for maintenance this year, but
the government was too strapped to finance it completely, Holosokov
said. The other reactor was destroyed in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the closure, many of the reactor systems would have
to be dismantled, and those contaminated by radioactivity would
have to undergo deactivation. The plan also requires construction
of new facilities such as a $30 million heating plant and
reprocessing and storage sites for liquid nuclear waste and spent
fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
   The planned closure also poses a social problem: unemployment.
Chernobyl employed nearly 5,900 workers, so about 4,000 workers in
nearby towns will be left jobless. Immediate layoffs may affect up
to 3,000 workers, Chernobyl officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 law makes former Chernobyl employees eligible for
financial assistance from the state for more than a year while they
seek work elsewhere, but it remains unclear whether Ukraine's
struggling government will find enough money to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's economy has been declining since the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, and the country has few resources to deal with
the consequences of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Kiev estimate the Chernobyl accident affected 3.4
million of Ukraine's 50 million people. At least 4,365 of those who
took part in the hasty cleanup effort have died, government figures
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 400,000 adults and 1.1 million children are entitled
to state aid for Chernobyl-related health problems. Yet government
funding covered little more than 50 percent of Chernobyl relief
needs between 1996 and 1998, and only about one-third last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has pinned its hopes on international aid, particularly
on a donor nations' conference scheduled for July. ''We hope the
Chernobyl announcement will give a new impulse and cause
enthusiasm'' among donors, said Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr
Chalyi.
</P>
<P>
   The donors are expected to focus on the so-called
''sarcophagus,'' a leaky steel and concrete structure covering the
reactor that exploded and which is believed to contain tons of
nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of making Chernobyl environmentally safe has been
estimated at about $750 million. International donors have pledged
$400 million. On Monday, President Clinton announced an additional
U.S. contribution of $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, which gets about 40 percent of its electricity from
nuclear power plants, also hopes foreign nations will help build
two new atomic reactors to compensate for the loss of Chernobyl.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks New Red Cross Emblem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Israel has balked at plans to create a neutral
third emblem for the Red Cross movement, meant to clear the way for
the Israeli society to join after more than 50 years, officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the International Committee of the Red Cross use
a red cross or, in Muslim countries, a red crescent as their
emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's counterpart organization, Magen David Adom, uses a red
Star of David on a white flag -- which the Red Cross has refused to
sanction as a symbol for relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross leaders proposed adopting the new emblem that could be
used by all countries -- probably a red diamond framing a regional
symbol, such as the cross or crescent.
</P>
<P>
   But ''the Israelis have told us that they wish to make
amendments to the draft protocol,'' said Red Cross spokesman Chris
Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Magen David Adom, Dr. Moshe Mellul, said his
organization had serious reservations about the diamond -- which he
said signified flammable materials in some countries and a casino
in others.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not suitable for a humanitarian society,'' Mellul said
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also wanted the right to use the six-pointed Star of
David in its symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution of the emblem problem would clear the way for the
Israeli society to be admitted as a voting member of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
where it has held only observer status since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The international federation has arranged a conference Nov. 14
for its 176 member societies to vote on the new symbol. A
conference of the 188 nations of the Geneva Conventions will likely
be held in October to approve a new protocol to the conventions.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Clash in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Even as it fought artillery duels with
Uganda, the Rwandan army said Monday it would complete its
withdrawal from the Congolese city of Kisangani and turn control
over to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan forces used heavy artillery and small-arms fire against
Rwandan soldiers who assembled in downtown Kisangani where they
waited for U.N. military observers to escort them out of the city,
Rwandan army spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials in Kisangani said four civilians were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Ndahiro insisted: ''We are on the path of withdrawal. We are
about to finalize it, unilaterally if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda had fought in August and again in May in
Kisangani, but then agreed to pull back 60 miles and let the United
Nations take charge of the divided city, which is used by both
sides to resupply their troops in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The two neighbors sent armies into the Congo two years ago to
support a rebellion against President Laurent Kabila. But they
differed over how the war should be fought and which of the three
rebel groups to support.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences led to their clashes in Kisangani, the only
city in Congo where both armies have troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two shells landed near the house used by U.N.
military observers in Kisangani, who moved to a local church, said
a U.N. military spokesman in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo once involved five intervening nations and
three rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and the rebels signed a peace deal last August, as did
Rwanda and Uganda and Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   A 5,537-strong U.N. force is supposed to protect the more than
100 unarmed military observers now deployed in the vast country to
oversee the cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops. A
battalion was expected to arrive in Kisangani in July.

<HEADLINE> Police Rescue Six Kidnap Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police killed three kidnappers in a
10-minute firefight Monday and rescued six people held hostage for
more than a month in a rural town in southeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout occurred when six heavily armed police officers
approached the kidnappers' hide-out in Socorro, 70 miles north of
Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kidnappers, who were armed with machine-guns and heavy
caliber weapons, opened fire as soon as they realized they had been
discovered,'' officer Amarildo Pedroso de Moraes said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting ended, police rushed into the small house and
found three kidnappers dead. They arrested another three who turned
themselves in, Moraes said.
</P>
<P>
   The six hostages -- three men and three women -- were unhurt and
''in relatively good condition after the ordeal.'' One police
officer received a bullet wound in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Moraes would not confirm media reports that said the kidnappers
had cut off part of one hostage's ear and sent it to his family to
pressure it to pay an undisclosed ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo Adriano de Oliveira, one of the dead kidnappers, was
believed to have taken part in last year's abduction of Wellington
de Camargo, the brother of country music stars Zeze di Camargo and
Luciano. Camargo was held for more than three months, and was freed
after his brothers paid a $300,000 ransom.

<HEADLINE> Israel Worries Over 9 Abducted Jews  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Relief in Israel over the rescue of a
12-year-old boy maimed by Chechen kidnappers was mingled Monday
with worry over nine other Jews abducted by Chechen rebels in the
past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The case of young Adi Sharon has focused attention the missing
Jews, all of whom were from Russian republics around Chechnya and
have relatives in Israel. Some were seized as early as 1992 and
have not been heard from in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been such a long time that the chances that they are
still alive are very slim,'' Israeli Deputy Immigration Minister
Marina Solodkin, ''but we have to keep trying to find out what
happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adi returned to Israel on Sunday after spending nine months tied
up in a cellar. His kidnappers cut off both of his pinky fingers
and left him badly malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon was captured while visiting his father in Russia and held
while kidnappers demanded $8 million in ransom. Last week, Russian
security forces stormed the hide-out where he was being kept in the
town of Penza, about 350 miles southeast of the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The nine missing Jews are only a few of more than 1,000 Russian
and foreign civilians who have been seized for ransom by the
Chechens since the war with Russia began.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims, Jews and non-Jews, were abducted because the
kidnappers thought they had money, but Israeli officials say
anti-Jewish feelings may have entered the picture. In a videotape
captured by the Russian forces and screened worldwide on Russian
television channels, Arbi Barayev, one of the Chechen warlords,
said the Chechens hate Israel and the Jews and will continue to
kidnap Jews because they have money.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not so much classical anti-Semitism as Islamic
fundamentalism,'' Solodkin said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Jewish victims are seized because the kidnappers
suspect they have sold their homes and belongings prior to
emigrating to Israel and therefore have large sums in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Ashurov, 71, was abducted as he was on his way home from
an Israeli mission office where he had been arranging his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Natan Sharansky on Sunday gave visiting
Russian counterpart Vladimir Rushailo the names of eight of the
missing Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Solodkin said there is a ninth missing Jew, but his relatives in
Israel refused to give Israeli officials his name, saying they
intend to pay the ransom and don't want authorities to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight on Sharansky's list, one is known to be alive.
Three are believed to have been shot dead by their captors,
Solodkin said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, authorities get to the victims in time. In
addition to Adi's dramatic rescue last week, four kidnapped Jews
have recently been freed and now live with their families in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lichtman, 18, was already living in Israel when she was
kidnapped during a visit to Russia. Like Adi, she was rescued by
Russian special forces.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Fail, 14, was released after top officials from the
Caucasian Republic of Ingushetia interceded with the Chechens on
his behalf. The terms of Fail's release are secret and reflect the
complex relations existing between Chechnya and the other Caucasian
republics, Solodkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another teen-ager, Oleg Imiliantev, is believed to have been
released by his captors as Russian troops drew near and was
returned to his home in the Israeli city of Ashdod, also having
lost two of his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Sunday that
Russia could have freed Adi Sharon months ago, but Solodkin said
the Russian government was doing its best to free all kidnap
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is cooperating with us and has even given the
Jewish victims priority,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Planes To Pay for US Airspace Use  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airplanes flying through U.S. airspace will be
charged for air traffic control services, even if they do not land
or take off here, the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new fees will take effect Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the U.S. government has not charged for such
flyovers, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Most other
countries impose such charges.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave the FAA the right to require the payments in 1996,
but a federal court ruled in 1997 that the fees first announced
were not consistent with the law. That delayed the change until the
FAA could recalculate its costs for providing air traffic control
services.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the agency said, a flight from Copenhagen,
Denmark to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil passes through airspace
controlled by France, Portugal, the United States, the Netherlands
Antilles and Venezuela, as well as that of Denmark and Brazil. Of
these, the United States is the only one not currently charging
overflight fees.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's new rule sets fees of $37.43 per 100 nautical miles
over land and $20.16 per 100 nautical miles over the ocean while
under U.S. air traffic control. A nautical mile is 1.15 regular
miles.
</P>
<P>
   No charges will be assessed on military and civilian aircraft
operated by the U.S. government or by foreign governments, and
users who accrue $250 or less in fees per month will not be
charged. There will also be no charges on Canada-to-Canada flights
that pass through U.S. airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it will send users monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said about 235,000 flights pass through U.S. airspace
annually and estimated that during the first year it will bill
airlines for $39.6 million in fees.

<HEADLINE> State Still Backs Iran Dialogue  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Monday it continues
to support an official dialogue with Iran despite new allegations
that Iran was responsible for the attack on Pan Am flight 103 that
killed 270 persons in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were made by a 32-year old Iranian defector, Ahmad
Behbahani, who told the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' he was an
intelligence official involved in Iranian terrorism operations for
a decade or more before his defection to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official expressed strong doubt about
Behbahani's credibility. The official, asking not to be identified,
said he was not at liberty to discuss the reasons except to note
that Behbahani would have been about 20 at the time of the 1988
bombing, too tender an age to have been involved in such a mission
either in its planning or execution.
</P>
<P>
   He surfaced in Turkey, where the country's secret service, the
National Intelligence Agency, said he was seeking asylum in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He told CBS that he proposed the 1988 Pan Am operation, brought
on board a radical Palestinian terrorist living in Syria, then
imported and trained Libyan operatives to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The program said his motive was to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's
mistaken shooting down five months earlier of an Iranian passenger
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Iran vowed the skies would ''rain blood'' after the USS
Vincennes, in what was described as a case of mistaken identity,
shot down an Iran Air flight in July 1988, killing 290 persons. It
was widely assumed at first that Tehran ordered the destruction of
the Pan Am airliner with Syrian-sponsored help.
</P>
<P>
   Behbahani also said Iran planned the 1996 bombing of a U.S.
barracks in Saudi Arabia. The attack killed 19 U.S. Air Force
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the administration
learned of the defection last week. He said Behbahani's allegation
of Iran's role in the Pan Am 103 bombing, if confirmed, would not
trigger a change in U.S. policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the United States seeks an end to Iran's role in
terrorist activities, to its efforts to develop weapons of mass
destruction and to its opposition to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to see a government-to-government dialogue so
that we could address those things and issues of concern,'' Reeker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyan defendants are under trial in the Netherlands for the
Dec. 21, 1988 bombing, which killed all 259 persons aboard the
plane and 11 more on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Since the suspects are Libyan, there have been suspicions that
the Libyan government ordered the bombing. But the testimony of
Behbahani raises an alternate possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the United States is prepared to follow evidence
wherever it leads.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's always been our position,'' he said. ''Right now, we
are assessing credibility of any information that may be provided.
And that's all I have to say at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been attempting to reach out to
Iran following elections in 1997 and this past February in which
moderate forces have shown strength. The moderates have been
challenging the supremacy of Islamic fundamentalists who have been
in charge for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This past March, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright delivered
a speech in which she lifted a ban on the import of luxury items
from Iran and invited that country to open a ''new relationship''
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iran thus far has shown no interest in official discussions,
preferring unofficial exchanges instead.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 21; Nasdaq Up 8  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended an extremely quiet session with
mixed results Monday as investors took some profits from last
week's big gains but continued rewarding technology companies that
have strong growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.54 to close at
10,815.30.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 8.38 to 3,821.76, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.63 to
1,467.63.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was very calm as investors captured some gains from a
strong, broad-based rally last week. The Nasdaq rose 19 percent
over the week, the index's biggest weekly gain in history and a
dramatic departure from the weakness it suffered in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   The essential optimism that drove the market's rally last week
remained intact, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market's doing extremely well,'' said Edward Yardeni,
chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''The summer rally
clearly is upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yardeni cautioned that the market may still struggle for
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may cover a lot of territory in a short period of time and
go sideways for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq turned in
a mixed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm fell $5.438 to $67.25. Over the weekend, China United
Telecommunications confirmed it won't use a mobile phone technology
designed by Qualcomm for at least three years. Speculation about
the China contract had heightened volatility in Qualcomm shares in
the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $3.375 to $54.50, following a 15 percent gain on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba rose $10 to $80.50 after the company formed a partnership
with VeriSign Inc. and American Express to provide a card payment
processing function for online business-to-business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Advanced Micro Devices rose
$1.625 to $91.50. The company has introduced a souped-up version of
its Athlon computer chip and a new bargain brand; both products are
viewed as a challenge to industry leader Intel.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose $4 to $112.438, helping to keep the Dow in positive
territory. Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich said that while
the company's second-quarter earnings may be fairly mediocre,
profit growth is accelerating and should provide for a strong
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity stimulated some trading. Primark rose $8.25 to
$37.25 after Thomson Corp. agreed to buy it for $842 million in
cash. Both companies are providers of professional and financial
information.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were still reveling in last week's good
economic news. A stream of economic data showed a modest slowdown
in the economy, which many investors interpreted as a sign that the
Federal Reserve may not need to aggressively raise interest rates
to prevent a flareup of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a widespread perception that the Fed won't raise
rates at its June meeting, and perhaps that they're done for the
year,'' Yardeni said. ''It will be hard for them to justify raising
interest rates when there is evidence of a slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the only economic report expected to move markets is
the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, due out on Friday.
With a dearth of news, the market may struggle to find direction,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert McTeer said
there's little question that the Fed's six interest rate increases
in the past year are having the desired effect. But he cautioned
against placing too much stock in one month's figures.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, he said, ''are always all over the place and it
remains to be seen whether this is a fluke or signs of a changing
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.02
billion shares, compared with 1.39 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.27 to 513.30.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.4 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> EPA May Relax Pollution Rules  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is
considering giving industrial plants greater flexibility to meet
air pollution requirements, according to an internal EPA document.
</P>
<P>
   While critics complained Monday that the proposal could weaken
pollution controls, senior EPA officials characterized it as ''very
preliminary'' and ''not remotely close'' to being put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA ''draft white paper'' proposes that the EPA allow state
and local authorities to issue ''smart permits.'' They would
require overall limits on air emissions but allow considerable
leeway in meeting requirements within plants to let them make
operational changes or expand operations without new permits. That
would make it easier for the plants to meet changing production and
manufacturing demands.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials played down the proposal's significance and said
the agency does not plan to change the permitting process in ways
that would lead to weaker pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   The draft paper ''has not been seen by anyone in senior
management of the agency,'' said EPA spokesman Dave Cohen. ''This
thing is very embryonic. It doesn't represent much of anything.''
He characterized it as ''an idea sheet'' by midlevel staff members
in the agency's air pollution control offices.
</P>
<P>
   The new permitting approach would be designed to help facilities
with ''acute flexibility needs'' such as rapidly growing computer
chip manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies, according to a
memo to EPA regional air pollution control directors, who last
month were asked to comment on the draft white paper.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the documents, disclosed Monday by The Wall Street
Journal, were made available by Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility, an environmental advocacy group with close ties to
federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ruch, the executive director, called the proposed change a
''dramatic shift in air quality regulation'' if given final
approval. He said the white paper was leaked by EPA employees
worried that the changes would weaken enforcement of air pollution
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are big unanswered questions about how pollution permits
with this much flexibility can be enforced or even consistently
applied from state to state,'' said Ruch.
</P>
<P>
   Industry has complained for years that EPA's air pollution
requirements, which direct how states and local authorities issue
pollution permits to industry, are too rigid under the 1990 Clean
Air Act. The permits limit the amount of pollution a plant may be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of companies in rapidly changing or fast growing
industries have complained that too often companies must obtain new
pollution permits if they expand a plant or make major internal
production changes, even when overall emissions may not change
significantly. New permits can take months to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA white paper suggests that a so-called ''smart permit''
could be used when a plant would be expected to request frequent
permit changes because of rapid growth or production or
manufacturing demands. The flexibility would reduce long-term
administrative costs, encourage pollution prevention and get
companies ''to comply in a smarter, more efficient fashion,'' the
internal EPA analysis added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, US Question Iran Defector  </HEADLINE>
By AYLA JEAN YACKLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. and Turkish agents were questioning
an Iranian defector who claims to have evidence that Tehran planned
and financed the bombings of Pam Am Flight 103 and a U.S. military
barracks in Saudi Arabia, reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The defector, who identified himself as Ahmad Behbahani, told
the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' that he was a senior
intelligence official and has documents to prove his claim that
Iran was behind the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has not issued an official response to the claims. But the
hard-line daily Tehran Times claimed Monday that Behbahani is a
member of the outlawed Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen Khalq.
The Mujahedeen Khalq denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyans are on trial before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands for the 1998 bombing of the Pam Am jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people -- most of them
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Law experts said Behbahani's statements were unlikely to affect
the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 truck bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia killed
19 U.S. Air Force personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's National Intelligence Agency confirmed that its agents
and agents of a foreign secret service had interrogated a man it
identified as Seyyid Behbahani. It did not identify the foreign
agency, but newspapers said that Behbahani was questioned by the
CIA. There was no official explanation for the discrepancies in the
first names, but an Iranian expert said Behbahani, as an
intelligence officer, traveled under different names.
</P>
<P>
   ''Behbahani, who was seen as suspicious, has been interviewed by
our agency,'' the Turkish intelligence agency said in a statement
carried by the Anatolia news agency. ''The person claims that Iran
organized some terrorist actions in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In his initial testimonies, he said he worked for a while at
the Iranian Intelligence Ministry and escaped from Evin prison
where he was imprisoned in 1998 for spying on behalf of a foreign
country,'' the statement said. Evin prison is in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The National Intelligence Agency said Behbahani contacted ''60
Minutes'' before coming to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Behbahani arrived in the eastern city of Van on March 7 after
crossing the Iranian border and applied for asylum at the local
bureau of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am in a difficult position. I fled to Turkey because they
were going to kill me,'' the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet quoted
Behbahani as telling UNHCR officials. ''I want America to grant me
asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Ankara and the UNHCR would not comment about
Behbahani. In Washington, the State Department said it still
supports an official dialogue with Iran despite the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''60 Minutes'' report aired Sunday, Behbahani said Iran
planned the Pan Am bombing to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's mistaken
downing of an Iranian passenger plane in early 1988. He said he
recruited a radical Palestinian terrorist living in Syria, then
imported and trained Libyan operatives to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   According to ''60 Minutes,'' Behbahani also claimed that Iran
was behind the 1994 bombing attack of a Jewish community center in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, that killed 86 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Reza Nourizadeh, an Iranian columnist at the London-based
Kayhan weekly, told The Associated Press that Behbahani was a
deputy intelligence minister and had ''slipped into Turkey after he
realized that a car accident in which he was involved was really an
assassination attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran's reformist President Mohammad Khatami ordered a purge of
the Intelligence Ministry after it admitted ''rogue'' agents were
behind the killings of five dissidents in the fall of 1998, curbing
the powers of Iranian secret agents.
</P>
<P>
   Nourizadeh said Behbahani was a right-hand man of former
intelligence minister Ali Fallahian and was in danger since he told
an investigative committee that his former boss had ordered the
dissidents' murders.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money is pouring into politics as never
before. Thirty-seven House candidates have already raised at least
$1 million -- a fourfold increase over last time. And the Democratic
and Republican parties have almost doubled their intake of soft
money since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will there be a record that hasn't been broken by the end of
the cycle?'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that studies money and
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican nominee George W. Bush set the pace by raising more
than $84 million so far to shatter all presidential fund-raising
records.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission reported Monday that 37 House
candidates had raised at least $1 million between Jan. 1, 1999, and
March 31, 2000, compared with just seven during the same 15-month
period two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats need just six seats to recapture the House, and
both parties and campaign contributors are focusing on a handful of
competitive races that will decide who holds the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes two Republicans who presented impeachment
evidence against President Clinton to the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   --The top House fund-raiser, Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., faces a
tough challenge from California state Sen. Adam Schiff in a
district Rogan won with just 51 percent of the vote in 1998. Rogan
raised $3.8 million through March 31 -- more than twice the $1.4
million raised for his entire 1998 campaign. Schiff raised $1.9
million to lead all challengers.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who raised $1.6 million for his
successful 1998 campaign, already has raised $1.8 million for his
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   One of the targeted Democrats, Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., who
raised $1.3 million for her last race, raised $1.2 million through
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because people believe there are only 20 or 25 seriously
competitive races out there, each one of them is their own private
Fort Knox,'' Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said. ''Money is
flowing into the handful of races in unprecedented amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who fail to raise money early may have trouble later
because so many donors have already been tapped out, Republican
fund-raiser Carolyn Machado said. ''As you get further along in the
season, those dollars dry up.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, 22 House candidates reported having at least $1
million in the bank as of March 31, double the number of two years
ago. They were led by Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who since has taken
his $3.5 million bankroll and entered the U.S. Senate race against
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate Lazio replaced, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, raised more money than anyone else, $19.3 million.
Clinton was next at $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Wall Street millionaire Jon Corzine, seeking the
Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in New Jersey, was third on
the list with $11 million, most of it his own money. Since March
31, he's reached deeper and wound up spending an estimated $33
million in advance of Tuesday's primary, breaking the old record of
$30 million for a Senate race set by California Republican Michael
Huffington in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Senate candidates who raised more than $1 million
through March 31 increased 25 percent between 1998 and 2000, from
40 two years ago to 50 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, House and Senate candidates raised $463 million, up
$125 million over the same period two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The political parties are raising more as well. Contributions of
unregulated soft money to the national Democratic and Republican
parties have almost doubled since 1996, the last presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, 1999 through last March 31, the GOP took in $86.4
million in soft money -- unlimited donations from corporations,
unions and individuals not subject to federal election laws. That's
a 93 percent increase over the $44.7 million the party raised
during the same period in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic committees, meanwhile, raised $77 million in soft
money, up 94 percent from the $39.7 million raised during the same
period in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   The parties have been helped by the booming economy and the
growing number of high-tech millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just a lot more money out there,'' Republican
consultant Eddie Mahe said. ''You've got thousands and thousands of
multimillionaires in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which boosted
its soft money donations from $3.4 million in 1995-96 to $21.9
million in 1999-2000, was to add to its totals Monday at a
fund-raiser celebrating the 70th birthday of New York Rep. Charles
Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   With a top ticket of $100,000, the event was expected to raise
$3 million for the DCCC, the most the committee, which contributes
to Democratic candidates for the House, has ever taken in at a
fund-raiser outside of Washington.

<HEADLINE> AP Clarifies Estate Taxes Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press reported June 4 that a
married couple can effectively get a $1.3 million exemption in 2000
from federal estate taxes, or twice the $675,000 exemption for an
individual.
</P>
<P>
   That is true, but it is not automatic. Certain estate planning
steps must be taken first by the couple, such as creation of a
credit shelter trust.
</P>
<P>
   An example: A couple has $1.3 million in assets when the man
dies. He leaves $675,000 to his wife, which is exempt from tax
because they were married. The remaining $675,000, also exempt from
tax under the man's individual exemption, goes into a trust for the
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   When the wife dies, her $675,000 share goes to the heirs
tax-free because of her individual exemption. The trust also goes
to the heirs without tax because it is considered to have already
been exposed to tax -- even though the man's exemption applied at
the time.

<HEADLINE> UN Observers in Georgia Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Kidnappers in Georgia's separatist
region of Abkhazia freed four U.N. observers Monday, after taking
them hostage for ransom last week.
</P>
<P>
   The observers -- two Danes, a Briton, and an Abkhazian -- were
released without the U.N. paying ransom, said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard in New York. Raul Khadzhinba, head of Abkhazia's Security
Service, also said no ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
   The observers were abducted Thursday in the remote Kodor Gorge,
the only part of separatist Abkhazia still under Georgian control.
A fifth member of the group, an Abkhazian, was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The two Danes and the Briton were flown to Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital, on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian mass media said the kidnappers had demanded $300,000
for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Danish officials said in a statement that the released Danes
were Maj. Thomas Rosenquist, 41, and Capt. Kaj S. Laursen, 21. The
Briton was John Fulford, who works with the Halo Trust de-mining
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government forces
during a 1992-93 war and have run almost all of the province since
then. The two sides reached a cease-fire in 1994.

<HEADLINE> 601,000 Farmers Benefit From Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 601,000 farmers who grow soybeans,
sunflowers and other oil-bearing crops are getting payments
totaling $462 million under the farm-aid package passed by Congress
last year, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The checks are intended as compensation for the relatively low
prices that growers have been getting for the crops.
</P>
<P>
   The payments will amount to $593 for a farmer who grew 100 acres
of soybeans, and about $407 for the same area of sunflowers. Other
crops that qualified for the payments include flaxseed, canola and
mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that the Senate and House passed in May would
provide similar payments on this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   ''American farmers have been hit hard by collapsing prices and
market conditions beyond their control,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said. ''This assistance should be helpful since the 1996
farm bill has failed to provide farmers with an adequate economic
safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   Payments were calculated according to a formula based on the
5-year average price for each crop.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa growers are getting the largest share of payments at $75.8
million, followed by Illinois at $68.8 million and Minnesota at
just under $46 million.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Said Sought a Race War  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prosecutors told a London court Monday that the
British engineer on trial for murder had hoped to start a race war
when he planted bombs in minority neighborhoods and a gay bar,
killing three people.
</P>
<P>
   The court also heard during the opening day of the trial that
David Copeland, 23, made his nail bombs from instructions obtained
on the Internet, and got the idea for last year's attacks from a
1996 bombing in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but denied the charge
of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, Copeland planted bombs in London's Brixton
district, which has a large black population, in Brick Lane, a
Bangladeshi neighborhood, and in a gay bar in the heart of London's
West End theater district.
</P>
<P>
   A pregnant woman and two male friends who were visiting the city
for the night were killed when a bomb packed with 1,500 nails
exploded in the crowded Admiral Duncan bar.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Nigel Sweeney said Copeland told police his motive
was political.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told them that he was a National Socialist or Nazi, who
believed in a white master race,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not like either black people or Asian people and wanted
them out of this country. He thought British people had the right
to ethnic cleansing like the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney added that Copeland ''thought his bombs would be the
spark to set fire to this country and would set off a racial war
and get whites to vote for the (neo-Nazi) British National Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland also said he was homophobic and thought ''gay men were
perverted degenerates who were no use to society and who should be
put to death,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland lived in Farnborough, a commuter district southwest of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people injured in the blasts, as well as their
relatives, packed London's Old Bailey Central Criminal Court for
the trial. The proceedings were broadcast through an audio link at
a nearby police station for those who could not get in.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps resumed flights of the MV-22
Osprey, the hybrid helicopter-airplane that came under severe
scrutiny after one crashed April 8 in Arizona and killed 19
Marines.
</P>

   The Marines announced that flight tests were restarted Monday at
the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division at China Lake, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Osprey to come off the production line, initially
sent to Marine Corps Air Station New River at Camp Lejeune, N.C.,
will join three other Ospreys at China Lake so they can fly
together on missions designed to evaluate the Osprey's readiness to
join the Marine Corps' active air fleet. Evaluation began last
November but was interrupted when the Osprey crashed upon approach
to Marana Airport in Tucson, Ariz., in April.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation is scheduled for completion in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines announced last month that mechanical failure was
ruled out as a cause of the crash, although the investigation is
continuing. It was the deadliest air disaster for the Marines since
22 died in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Annan Encourages Women's Equality  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- From all corners of the globe,
high-ranking ministers and ordinary women joined the U.N.
secretary-general and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday
to demand that equality of the sexes become a reality at the start
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the biggest global gathering of women in
history adopted an ambitious platform to achieve women's equality,
nearly 180 nations met at a special General Assembly session to
review progress. The initial report card found this answer: too
little.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker declared that the achievements since the
1995 Beijing conference are far outweighed by the remaining
inequalities and persistent discrimination against women. ''Much
remains to be done,'' said Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We come here because for all of the progress we can point to
our work is far from done,'' echoed the first lady, now a candidate
for U.S. Senate from New York. ''When girls are doused with
gasoline, set on fire and burned to death because their marriage
dowries are too small and when 'honor killings' continue to be
tolerated, our work is far from done.''
</P>
<P>
   As they did in Beijing, thousands of women from grass-roots
organizations around the world came to New York to lobby the
delegates. Their colorful opening ceremony across the street from
U.N. headquarters included speeches by Annan, Queen Noor of Jordan
and U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson and
entertainment by singer Judy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese women, who are running a workshop to increase women's
participation in politics, wore sashes reading ''Don't be a
Nobody.'' Members of the Indonesian Women's Forum for Democracy,
wearing T-shirts saying ''Democracy is Not Enough, We Need Gender
Justice,'' were selling textiles and jewelry made by women.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is supposed to come up with innovative, practical
ways to accelerate implementation of the 150-page plan of action
adopted in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It called on governments to provide equal education and
employment, demanded that business and government put women in top
decision-making posts, and stated for the first time in a U.N.
document that women have the right to decide freely all matters
related to their sexuality and childbearing.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights and women's activists are concerned that the
conference may roll back the gains from Beijing because of
opposition from the Vatican and a few Islamic countries including
Algeria, Iran, Libya, Pakistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be no going back on the commitments,'' Robinson
said. ''The whole platform of action must not only be maintained
but must be reinvigorated and given practical impetus around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing, Clinton took center stage, attacking China's human
rights record and demanding that women become equal partners in
building a better world -- a demand she echoed at a panel on one of
the issues she promoted in 1995, small loans to help poor women
escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us not just mark, but celebrate, a new century in which
women's rights are once and for all treated as human rights, fully
respected in every country in the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her reception on Monday was overwhelming, just as it was in
Beijing, which ranks among her finest hours on the international
stage as first lady. At the start, she was cheered. At the end, the
audience stood up spontaneously, started singing the American civil
rights anthem, ''We Shall Overcome,'' and then mobbed her.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Annan cited progress in women's health and
education, in making violence against women illegal, and above all
in having more countries understand ''that women's equality is a
prerequisite for development.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also reported that the gap between the salaries of men
and women is widening, that women continue to be denied inheritance
rights, that violence against women is increasing despite
legislation and that ''a worldwide plague'' of trafficking of women
and children has erupted.

<HEADLINE> Peru Prosecutor Confirms Conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A special prosecutor on Monday confirmed the
existence of a conspiracy to forge signatures to help register
President Alberto Fujimori's candidacy for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutor Mirtha Trabucco -- who is widely perceived as
loyal to Fujimori -- told a special congressional panel that after a
97-day investigation, the only culprits who had been charged were
the two young whistle-blowers who first revealed the fraud, as well
as their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Trabucco said she could not be ''rushed'' into filing additional
charges, but that her investigation ''will determine if there are
others responsible'' for the forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori coasted to a guaranteed victory in the May 28
presidential runoff after his challenger, economist Alejandro
Toledo, boycotted the vote, alleging the election was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Independent monitors, who refused to observe the runoff because
it failed to meet basic international standards of fairness,
complained throughout the campaign that Fujimori's government was
dragging its feet on the forgery investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's leading newspaper, El Comercio, broke the story in
February, reporting that Fujimori's re-election campaign had hired
more than 400 people to systematically forge about 1 million
qualifying signatures, copied from the 1998 municipal election
voter rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The reports were based on information from Carlos and Marita
Rodriguez, a brother and sister who copied signatures, and who
later offered to testify. Their mother, who also claimed to take
part in the fraud, came forward a short time later. They have not
been arrested and Trabucco did not specify what penalty they could
face.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Rejects OAS Vote Findings  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A Haiti election official is
rejecting a claim by the Organization of American States that
Haiti's method of determining the winners of its parliamentary
elections was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS said Friday it found flaws in how the winning
percentages in the May 21 local and legislative elections were
calculated. It was the latest hitch in an election seen as a last
chance for democracy in this impoverished Caribbean nation of 8
million people.
</P>
<P>
   OAS mission chief Orlando Marville asked the council to
recalculate the percentage of votes for all candidates to preserve
the election's credibility. A recalculation could force several
declared Senate winners to run in a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral Council official Macajou Medard said on state
Television Nationale late Sunday that the head of the OAS elections
observer mission had no right ''to order'' any changes. The council
will issue a statement formally rejecting the criticism, Medard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the OAS said Monday it was not trying to usurp the power of
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are certain things being misinterpreted or
misread,'' said Elizabeth Spehar, executive coordinator of the OAS
unit for promotion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   According to partial returns, former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's Lavalas Family party seized control of Haiti's Senate,
sweeping 16 of 17 seats at stake.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti sided with the OAS.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States exhorts the provisional electoral council to
correct the problems the Organization of American States
identified,'' it said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Marville didn't deny that most voters cast their ballots for
Aristide candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But his request for a recalculation of winning percentages cast
suspicion on a first-round Lavalas landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian law says that to win in the first round, a candidate
must get 50 percent plus 1 vote. If not, the top two finishers meet
in a second round, set for June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian election law, officials count all the ballots
cast, and then discard all but the four top vote-getters. Medard
conceded that while this could change the winning percentages, it
does not change the amount of votes won by each candidate. However,
he said, foreign observers had no objections to similar procedures
in 1990, 1995 and 1997 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Marville ''showed lack of respect not only to the electoral
council but to the country and every single Haitian,'' said Medard.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti declared winners in at least eight Senate races where no
one won more than 50 percent, said Ernest Colon of the opposition
Christian Movement for a New Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a Parliament since January 1999. President Rene
Preval shut it down after an 18-month standoff with opposition
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was elected in 1990 and overthrown in a 1991 coup. U.S.
troops restored him to power in 1994. Haitian law barred him from
seeking a consecutive term in 1995. He is expected to run again for
the presidency is expected to win easily.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Inmate Escapes Via Helicopter  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANTOWN, Fla. (AP) -- An inmate at a center for sex offenders
made a Hollywood-style escape Monday in a helicopter that landed on
the grounds and whisked him away before crashing in an orange grove
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, with a student pilot at the controls, cleared a
15-foot razor-wire fence surrounding the Martin Treatment Center,
then went down about 100 yards away, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Steven Whitsett, 28, and the pilot ran off into the
marsh surrounding the center. Two gun holsters were found beside
the helicopter, said Jenell Atlas, spokeswoman for the Martin
County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prison guards from the Martin Correctional
Institution, adjacent to the center, searched the area with
helicopters and dogs. They also searched trucks along a highway
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do consider them armed and dangerous, and frankly,
desperate,'' Atlas said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was Clifford Sebastian Berkhart, 23, according to
Beach Scott, an investigator with the National Transportation
Safety Board in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsett had been convicted in 1994 of child molestation and
finished his prison sentence in 1999. He was being held at the
treatment center while awaiting a civil trial under a law aimed at
keeping dangerous sexual offenders locked up and in psychiatric
treatment even after they finish their prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The breakout took place around 1 p.m. Berkhart had taken off in
a training helicopter from a Fort Lauderdale airport. He had been
in flight training for two months, Scott said, and this was only
his second solo flight. He did not yet have an FAA license.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is out of a Hollywood script, isn't it?'' Atlas said. ''He
landed in broad daylight, and he (the inmate) ran out like in a
movie. But unlike in a movie they crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment center is about 35 miles northwest of West Palm
Beach. Guards at the treatment center are not armed. But guards at
the prison nearby have weapons and are responsible for security at
the treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   Orange groves, swamps and woods surround the center, and Atlas
predicted the inmate and his accomplice would have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not prepared to stay out here like we are,'' Atlas
said. ''They likely don't have food or water and come nightfall,
the bugs will carry them off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a drug kingpin tried to escape the Dade County
Metropolitan Correctional Center by helicopter but also crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In December, two women hijacked a helicopter at gunpoint and
ordered the pilot to fly to a maximum-security prison in northern
Florida to break out an inmate on death row. They abandoned the
plan after flying within sight of the prison.

<HEADLINE> Court Strips Pinochet of Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A court on Monday announced its decision
to strip Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his immunity from prosecution,
leaving Chile's former dictator facing a long legal battle over the
human rights abuses committed under his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the former dictator cheered and wept for joy, while
Pinochet's defense team said it would appeal the ruling, the
outlines of which were leaked to the media two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Santiago Court of Appeals voted 13-9 on May 23 to remove the
congressional immunity Pinochet enjoys as a senator for life. He
faces 110 lawsuits filed on behalf of those killed or missing
during his 17-year rule, which began with a bloody 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the 55-page decision, court President Ruben
Ballesteros said the 22 members of the court ''resolved that there
are grounds to begin a case'' against Pinochet for the right-wing
dictatorship that ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers have said they will appeal to the Supreme
Court within the five days allowed under law.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's attorney, Pablo Rodriguez, has said an appeal will be
based on ''Gen. Pinochet's total innocence.'' The former dictator's
defense also is expected to portray Pinochet, now 84, as mentally
unfit to understand and consult with his lawyers about the legal
proceedings against him.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Supreme Court rule against Pinochet, he would face
prosecution for the disappearance of 19 victims of the so-called
''Caravan of Death,'' a military group that toured several cities
soon after the coup, dragging prisoners from jail and executing
them.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 people have never been found and are among some 3,191 who
died or disappeared under Pinochet's military rule, according to an
official report compiled by the civilian government that succeeded
him.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Pinochet celebrated in the streets, many hugging
each other as the decision was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable what we've just heard, but we did it!'' said
Viviana Diaz, the leader of a group representing the disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The army, which Pinochet led for a quarter century until
stepping down as commander-in-chief in 1998, had no immediate
comment. Its current commander, Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, has said he
would respect the decisions of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But some retired officers expressed their displeasure openly.
</P>
<P>
   Retired navy Adm. Jorge Martinez characterized the decision as a
''judicial coup d'etat'' and suggested in comments to reporters
that the court actions had political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 retired officers, including five generals, are
currently under prosecution for human rights abuses from the
military era, included forced disappearances and slayings of
perceived enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has amnesty for all abuses committed between 1973 and
1978. But federal judge Juan Guzman, who is leading the prosecution
effort, contends the 19 cases of the disappeared from the Caravan
of Death are ongoing kidnapping cases. As such, he argues, those
crimes do not fall under the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Several obstacles remain for prosecution of Pinochet, among them
determining whether he is mentally fit to stand trial and whether
he would be tried in a civilian or military court. Those over age
70 must also undergo a battery of medical tests required by Chilean
law.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest chapter in a lengthy series of legal battles
that began with Pinochet's detention in London in 1998 on a Spanish
judge's warrant seeking to try him on human rights charges. He
returned home to Chile in March -- freed by Britain after doctors
there declared him physically and mentally unfit for trial.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Tax Exemption Is Rejected  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER KERR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to exempt
public school teachers from the state income tax was unanimously
rejected Monday by legislative budget negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had said the $545 million plan was a pioneering effort to
ease California's teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, that saves $500 million,'' conference committee
chairman, Democratic Sen. Steve Peace, said to laughter from the
panel as the proposal was voted down.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's three Democrats and three Republicans instead
approved a package of improved retirement benefits and tax cuts,
including a maximum $500 credit for teachers who buy classroom
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor last month proposed the income tax break
for the state's 283,000 teachers as part of his plan to spend an
estimated budget surplus of $12.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to address a teacher shortage in California and to
draw high-quality teachers to the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal drew immediate and near-universal opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said setting tax policy by occupation was a dangerous
precedent that would prompt other public employees, such as police
or firefighters, to seek similar exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The state's biggest teachers' union, the California Teachers
Association, did not endorse it. The second-largest, the California
Federation of Teachers, opposed it, saying the money could be
better spent on higher salaries for beginning teachers or improved
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor has not given
up and is still negotiating with legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just round one,'' McLean said. ''Governor Davis
continues to believe that all 34 million Californians will benefit
if teachers receive the extraordinary recognition he proposes
through the tax code.''

Court Strips Pinochet of Immunity
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A court on Monday announced its decision to strip
Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his immunity from prosecution, leaving Chile's former
dictator facing a long legal battle over the human rights abuses committed under
his rule. Pinochet's defense team said it would appeal the ruling. The Santiago
Court of Appeals voted 13-9 on May 23 to remove the congressional immunity
Pinochet enjoys as a senator for life. He faces 110 lawsuits filed on behalf of
those killed or missing during his 17-year rule.

Chernobyl Nuclear Plant To Close
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma on Monday ordered the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant closed, drawing praise from President Clinton, who
provided $80 million in American aid to close the plant forever. The April 26,
1986 accident spread radioactive material over much of Europe. The Ukrainian
government has blamed the disaster for at least 8,000 deaths, including 31
killed immediately, many more killed in the massive cleanup operation and others
who later died of cancer and other radiation-related illnesses. The plant will
close on Dec. 15, Kuchma said.

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Rebels seized the prime minister of the
Solomon Islands on Monday on Guadalcanal. Phone lines and air links to the
Solomons were cut as the rebels from a shadowy group calling itself the Malaita
Eagle Force set up roadblocks around the capital. The Malaita Eagle gunmen
demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Bartholemew Ulufa'alu, according to
Australian and New Zealand officials. The apparent coup attempt was the second
in the South Pacific in weeks -- with armed rebels in Fiji still holding the
deposed prime minister and more than 30 other people seized in a raid on
Parliament on May 19.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Casting doubt on the fate of at least eight other condemned
inmates in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a killer's death sentence
today after prosecutors conceded that the penalty was based in part on the fact
that he is Hispanic. The court ordered a new sentencing hearing for Victor Hugo

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought to speed up

also suggested he was inclined to sweeten his territorial offers to the
Palestinians in a drive to conclude a final accord over such sensitive problems

Court Curbs Grandparents' Rights

that Washington state went too far in letting grandparents and others seek
visitation. ''So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children ...
there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private

Braves Blame Rocker Demotion on Pitching

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Braves officials insist that John Rocker's demotion
to the minors is unrelated to a confrontation he had yesterday with the reporter
who wrote the story in which the Atlanta reliever disparaged gays, minorities
and foreigners. Rocker was fined ''a substantial amount'' for the confrontation
with Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman, said manager Bobby Cox. General
manager John Schuerholz says Rocker was optioned because he was not pitching
well. Rocker has walked 25 batters in just 18 1/3 innings this season.

<HEADLINE> Congress Hears Complaints On Pensions  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 28-year electric utility employee told
Congress the company's conversion to a new cash-balance pension
plan will cost him $400,000 in benefits, which he said is evidence
the popular plans discriminate against older workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, this is a very serious loss,'' James Bruggeman, 51, of
the Central and South West Corp. in Tulsa, Okla., told the Senate
Aging Committee. ''It may very well change my retirement plans. I
would have to work several more years to make up the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruggeman said that because of his long service, retirement
benefits he expected under the company's previous traditional
pension plan would have been 30 percent higher than under the new
plan. And due to what's known as ''wearaway,'' the initial cash
balance in his new pension account was $56,000 less than the
equivalent lump sum in the old one and will require two years to
recoup.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that something somebody is entitled to is
lost,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Similar complaints have been raised by hundreds of veteran
employees around the country as more than 450 companies converted
to the new plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under a cash-balance pension plan, companies pay a fixed
percentage of employees' annual salaries toward retirement benefits
each year. Workers build up money evenly throughout their careers.
Employees can also take pension funds they have accrued at one
company and move them if they take another job.
</P>
<P>
   The plans frequently save employers money and provide younger
workers with pensions that are more flexible, easier to carry from
job to job and simpler to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for older people, however, say they violate
anti-discrimination laws because, in cases like Bruggeman's,
promised pension benefits are reduced for workers with long
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is very definitely, for an older worker, less
accumulation than there is for a younger worker,'' said Joseph
Perkins, immediate past president of the AARP. ''We worry about the
fact that it's the older worker who gets the raw end of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Several bills have been introduced in Congress on the issue,
some focusing on greater disclosure of how changes would affect
individual workers and others requiring that companies give workers
greater choice between new and old plans. In addition, several
Clinton administration agencies are trying to determine if age
discrimination laws are being violated.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives told the Aging Committee of many
advantages to cash balance plans and said they don't inherently
discriminate against older employees. An analysis by Watson Wyatt
Worldwide Inc., a leading human resources consultant, showing that
only about 45 percent of companies it studied saved greater than 5
percent in pension costs by making the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cost reduction was not what a majority of the plans were
trying to achieve,'' said Sylvester Schieber, Watson Wyatt's
research director.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Sweatt, benefits manager for Dallas-based CSW -- the
company Bruggeman works for -- said the company took several steps
to ''minimize any detrimental impact'' when it switched to the new
plan. These included a choice between the new and old plans for
employees who were 50 years old and had 10 years of service and an
addition of 13 percent in base pay to accounts of workers who were
over 40 and had at least five years' service.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses testified that more laws and regulations might
force some companies to drop pensions altogether and continue a
downward trend that has seen such benefits drop from 114,000
companies in 1985 to 44,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to believe that it is up to employers to decide
what retirement strategy works best for them,'' said John Woyke, an
attorney testifying on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Gore Eyes More Fed Services Online  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Al Gore promised on Monday that as
president he would have nearly all federal services online by 2003
in a ''second American Revolution'' linking the people and their
government via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He raised a vision of buyers competing for government business
via Internet auctions. And he called for the creation of a
''g-bay,'' similar to e-bay auctions, for selling off government
equipment that is no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many states, cities and counties already provide some services
online, as does the federal government, including electronic filing
of taxes. But Gore said in a speech at North Carolina State
University that he is aiming to break down barriers between
departments and make them more accessible to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The power of government should not be locked away in
Washington but put at your services -- no further away than your
keyboard,'' the Democratic presidential contender said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that under his plan, people could use the Internet to
get information about Social Security benefits, to apply for a home
loan through the Federal Home Administration, to report a crime or
to find the health plan that would work best for them.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted government ''online -- so you don't have to
stand in line.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said that a wired-in government could help
''an electorate that is too often alienated and often feels
voiceless in a system corroded by special interests and powerless
to make change.'' He did not mention online voting.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics fear the security of casting ballots via the
Internet, but Arizona's March primary was conducted successfully
online.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he plans to discuss later this week digital keys,
combinations and other ways to keep such data secure in order to
protect privacy of people corresponding with the government.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say how much his plan would cost but contended it
would save billions in the long run. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
said later that implementing it would cost about $100 million,
which would be paid through budget surpluses over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would require government agencies to file progress
reports online and that interested citizens could respond via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''With your help, as president, I will lead a second American
Revolution -- to make our self-government far less costly, far more
effective and far more relevant to every American,'' Gore told
about 100 teachers and students at the university's Centennial
campus in the heart of the state's Research Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said the nation's investment in information
technology, which now accounts for about one-third of the country's
economic growth, should double. Gore and Commerce Secretary William
M. Daley released a report showing that such spending has grown
from $243 billion in 1995 to $510 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is recognized for his interest in technical
subjects, though he also has been subjected to ridicule for telling
CNN last March that he ''took the initiative in creating the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been increasing its online business,
including an estimated 35 million income tax returns filed
electronically this year -- a 20 percent increase over the previous
year. Nearly 30 percent of all tax returns were filed on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Gore gave the commencement speech at Tarboro
High School, which sheltered refugees from Hurricane Floyd's
floodwaters last September.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are American heroes,'' Gore said. Speaking before a crowd
of about 2,400 in the school football stadium, he described the 136
graduating seniors as ''sterling successes by any measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North Carolina last
September, and the resulting flooding was blamed for at least 51
deaths and $6 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recounted how some of the graduates lost all of their
possessions, yet showed up at the high school to ask how they could
help.
</P>
<P>
   ''You made a difference in reaching out to others instead of
just caring for yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore flew to New York, where he attended a record
$3-million dinner and reception for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, which assists Democratic candidates for the
House. U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., attended the reception at The
Supper Club, which doubled as a 70th birthday celebration for Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Ways and
Means Committee.

Gretzky Gets Honorary Doctor of Laws at University of Alberta
<TEXT>

   	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky became Dr. Wayne Gretzky
in a ceremony Monday that saw graduates break ranks to kiss him,
shake his hand and jump in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to you kids graduating today, don't forget what got you
there. Don't forget your family. Don't forget your grassroots and
the community that you are in,'' Gretzky, dressed in a red gown
with white trim, told graduates at the University of Alberta.
</P>

HRDC Withdraws 10 Times Too Much Money From Widow
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Advocates are calling for an apology and a policy
change after the Human Resources Department withdrew 10 times too
much money from an elderly widow's bank account without telling
her.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Parry of Ottawa, only learned the federal department had
dipped into her funds to recover her dead husband's old age
security benefits after the bank mailed her copies of the
government claim form and a bank draft for $8,399.68.
</P>
<P>
   The sum should have been $839.68 or two months' overpayment. But
poor paperwork and bad handwriting by a bureaucrat at the
department's income security programs branch left the impression
the amount owing was 10 times more.
</P>
<P>
   An HRDC official said it's not department policy to go to the
bank without first trying to recover money through the client. She
blamed an administrative error for the foul-up.

British Columbia Attorney General Orders Corrections Probe
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- British Columbia's attorney
general has ordered an independent investigation into how seven
Chinese migrants managed to bolt from a detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it appropriate ... to review the circumstances that
occurred here so we can both find out what happened and prevent it
from happening,'' Andrew Petter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Investigations Inspections and Standards office is to report
back with recommendations to Petter's ministry and the British
Columbia Corrections Branch, which is housing the migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Police captured six of the seven men but are still in pursuit of
one man, believed to be hiding in the dense and dangerous bush near
the Prince George Regional Correctional Center about 500 kilometers
north of Vancouver.
</P>

   The escapees are among 168 people being detained since their
illegal arrival last summer on a decrepit ship off British

Man Convicted Of Murder For the Fourth Time This Year
</P>
<P>
   SAINT JOHN, New Brunswick (AP) -- Michael Wayne McGray has been
convicted of murder for the fourth time this year in the ongoing
story of a man's chilling urge to kill.
</P>
<P>
   McGray, a Nova Scotia-born drifter who has claimed
responsibility for 16 slayings across North America, appeared
briefly in court Monday and pleaded guilty to the 1987 stabbing
death of Saint John resident Mark Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   McGray, 34, sullen, unshaven and with his feet shackled, said
little during his appearance. He told Justice Hugh McLellan of the
New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench he was guilty of second-degree
murder and that he had no statement or explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to life in prison, which will run concurrent to
the life sentences he's already serving for the first-degree
murders of a woman in Moncton, New Brunswick, in 1998 and two men
in Montreal in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He is not eligible for parole for 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Arson Fires Closer to Main Station  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Arsonists struck in Reno again Monday for the
17th time in two months and investigators said the fire-starters
may be challenging them with a deliberate burn pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the fires are linked ... They are closer and closer to
the main fire station in downtown Reno,'' said Bill Burney, a fire
inspector for the Reno Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fire destroyed an empty office at the front of a
recycling business within four blocks of the main fire station.
</P>
<P>
   Someone poured gasoline or another flammable liquid on an
exterior wall and ignited it some time between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.
Monday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire investigators think the same people -- possibly a gang of
youths -- are responsible for the series of fires at unoccupied
buildings since March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sooner or later they are going to hurt somebody, whether it's
themselves or a firefighter or somebody in an adjacent building,''
Burney said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been injured in the fires but total damage is
estimated in excess of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Burney said that whoever is setting the fires is probably doing
so as a civil disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Possibly a white group, possibly a gang. Possibly 'Gothic'
dress (all black clothing) -- against the establishment, consistent
with a photograph sent out last week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities released photographs last week of two men caught on
surveillance cameras spreading gasoline around a medical office
before a fire that caused $500,000 damage May 27 .
</P>
<P>
   The men in the photos are white, tall and in their late teens or
early 20s. They were wearing black T-shirts and pants and white
tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''On fires you look for people on the fringes of these areas who
have a habit of wanting to watch the fire,'' Reno Deputy Police
Chief Jim Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   A reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution
of those responsible now exceeds $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fires have destroyed two homes under construction in northwest
Reno, an office complex in southwest Reno, an apartment building
near downtown and part of a pallet yard east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller fires have damaged the Reno police Internal Affairs
building, an emergency child protection center and the Saint Mary's
HealthFirst medical building, both in south Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Two fires set a week ago at construction sites south of Reno
were extinguished before they could do much damage.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
Yankees-Expos:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: RHP Ramiro Mendoza was scratched from his start
against the Expos because of pain in his right shoulder. David
Cone, who pitched a perfect game against the Expos last July 18,
started in Mendoza's place. Cone was originally scheduled to face
Montreal's Javier Vazquez on Tuesday in what would have been a
rematch of the starters in Cone's perfect game. ... The Yankees
plan to use a reliever to start in Cone's place on Tuesday,
depending on who pitches Monday night. Jason Grimsley has made two
starts this year and Mike Stanton started once last season for New
York. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch was also taken out of the starting
lineup before the game with a strained left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: RHP Dustin Hermanson made his first start since moving
to the bullpen in mid-May to replace injured closer Ugueth Urbina.
... LHP Steve Kline tied a team record Sunday by saving his fourth
straight game. Kline joined Claude Raymond, John Wetteland, Mel
Rojas -- who did it twice -- and Ugueth Urbina. Urbina saved four
straight last May 26-30. ... Kline and Hermanson have combined for
eight saves since Urbina injured his right elbow May 12.
Red Sox-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: OF Carl Everett, second on the team with a .324 batting
average, didn't start. Everett, a former Marlins player, has a
10-game hitting streak. ... OF Darren Lewis, the only Red Sox
player to have faced Marlins starter Reid Cornelius, doubled off
him to open the game. ... 1B Brian Daubach flipped his bat into the
stands not once but twice in the same at-bat. He had a bat boy
retrieve the first one, but when the second one came on a
strikeout, he let the fan keep it.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Mark Kotsay hit three fly balls near the fence
Sunday against Toronto. Manager John Boles is confident similar
swings from Kotsay will result in home runs next season. ''I don't
think he's done maturing yet. He's still growing and he's still got
room on his frame for some muscle.'' ... Boles has just about
stopped looking at the numbers of his young players against
opposing pitchers. ''We don't have numbers against anybody.'' ...
The Marlins demoted RHP Vladimir Nunez (0-6, 8.35 ERA) to Triple-A
Calgary and reinstated OF Mark Smith from the 15-day DL.
Orioles-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Manager Mike Hargrove rejoined the team. He missed
two games in Montreal while attending his son Andy's high school
graduation in Cleveland. ... Mike Mussina made his first start ever
at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets recalled OF Jason Tyner from Triple-A Norfolk
and designated IF-OF Ryan McGuire for assignment. Tyner, 23, was
immediately put into the starting lineup, leading off and playing
left field. ''I think I'll be all right, once I get all the
butterflies out of my stomach,'' Tyner said. Said Mets GM Steve
Phillips: ''He gets to face Mike Mussina tonight, then Scott
Erickson and then Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte. Welcome to the
big leagues.'' ... RHP Rick Reed, who missed Friday's scheduled
start against Tampa Bay because of a strained abdominal muscle on
his left side, is set to pitch Tuesday.
Devil Rays-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays are 0-11 this year when a left-hander
starts and 21-60 since the start of the 1998 season, the worst in
the majors. They are not scheduled to see a left-handed starter in
their series with Philadelphia. ... DH Jose Canseco is scheduled to
come off of the DL on Friday. He was on the DL with a bruised heel.
... Devil Rays fans were able to follow the entire draft online,
complete with comments from scouting director Dan Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Mike Lieberthal, who hit three home runs in the
last two games, was rested. ... Before Monday's games, Phillies'
opponents had a .541 winning percentage, highest in the majors.
White Sox-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Frank Thomas, who sat out Sunday after playing the
first 54 games, was back in the lineup at first base. He was in a
2-for-19 slump. ... Thomas needed to score one more run to become
the sixth active player with 300 homers, 1,000 runs scored, 1,000
RBIs and 1,000 walks. The others are Harold Baines, Barry Bonds,
Fred McGriff, Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken Jr. ... The White Sox
didn't play the Reds last season. Instead, the Reds traded their
series for an extra three-game series against Cleveland. ... Ray
Durham, who led off the first interleague game at Cinergy Field
with a homer in 1997, led off Monday's game with a triple. ...
Chicago chose Stanford OF Joe Borchard with the 12th overall pick
in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: OF Alex Ochoa was back in the clubhouse for the
first time since he was taken to a hospital last Wednesday for an
appendectomy. He's on the DL and can't work out yet. ... RHP Mark
Wohlers threw one inning for Triple-A Louisville, allowing one hit
and one walk and striking out two Scranton batters. He had only
thrown at Class A until Monday as part of his rehab from
reconstructive elbow surgery. He'll pitch for Louisville again on
Thursday. ... RHP Osvaldo Fernandez will miss his next scheduled
start because of a sore elbow, jammed when he hit a line drive
Sunday. ... The Reds chose high school SS David Espinosa with the
23rd overall pick in the first round.
Indians-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians entered the three-game series Monday in
Milwaukee with an all-time record of 197-197 against the Brewers in
the past 30 seasons. ... RHP Paul Rigdon is scheduled to start a
30-day rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A Buffalo. He'll start
Tuesday in Buffalo against Indianapolis. ... The Indians have used
the DL 12 times this season for 11 players. OF Manny Ramirez
(strained left hamstring) is on the DL for the first time in his
career. ... Chuck Finley (4-4) will make his 12th start of the
season Tuesday. He's second in the NL with 82 strikeouts in 75.2
innings.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers selected 18-year-old OF Dave Krynzel of
Henderson, Nev., with the 11th pick of the first round of the
draft. Krynzel is batting .438 with five home runs and 31 RBI this
season for Green Valley High School. ... The Brewers, who opened a
three-game series with Cleveland, were 2-1 against the Indians in
1999. ... Brewers wives will auction the ''Turn Back the Clock''
uniforms to be worn by Milwaukee on Wednesday night. Proceeds will
go to Brewers Charities. ... Miller Park, being built just beyond
the outfield bleachers of County Stadium, is 80 percent complete.
The first game will be played in the retractable-roofed stadium in
298 days.
Twins-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins are batting .204 with seven doubles, two
home runs and eight RBI in their three interleague games, all
losses. Though Twins pitchers have hit .333 in those games, they
have never hit a home run in interleague play. In fact, the last
Twins pitcher to hit a home run was Jim Kaat June 11, 1972, vs.
Cleveland. ... The Twins have fewer home runs than any team in
baseball with a team total of 43 before Monday. That included 25 on
the road before entering home-run friendly Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Moises Alou has been out eight days with a left quad
muscle strain and probably won't return before Wednesday. Manager
Larry Dierker said Alou worked out lightly Monday and will do so
again Tuesday before the team makes a decision on his availability.
Dierker says Alou could have been used as a pinch-hitter over the
weekend but no situation with runners on base presented itself.
''He could have knocked somebody in, limped down to first base and
then got a pinch runner to run for him,'' Dierker said. ''But
without men on base, it wasn't worth pinch hitting him.'' ... The
Astros say the first-round draft pick Robert Stiehl started only
one game in his brief career as a pitcher at El Camino (Calif.)
Junior College doesn't concern them. Stiehl, normally a catcher and
closer who often caught eight innings of games this year and
pitched the ninth innings, has a 91-to-96 mph fastball and a strong
curve. Astros director of scouting David Lakey said the club knows
plenty about Stiehl. ''We have a club team he pitched for in the
winter in L.A.,'' Lakey said. ''We saw him quite a bit then. He has
an above average fastball and a good curve and if he comes up with
a third pitch, we don't see any reason why he can't make it to the
big leagues.''
Royals-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Before the game, the Royals placed 2B Carlos Febles
on the 15-day DL with a strained left shoulder. Febles was injured
diving for a ball in the 11th inning at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The
Royals called up INF Ray Holbert, who batted .264 with one home run
and 15 RBIs in 40 games for Triple-A Omaha. ... The interleague
series marked the return of former Cardinals closer Ricky Bottalico
to St. Louis. He was 3-7 with a 4.91 ERA and 20 saves last year and
wasn't offered a contract. ''I didn't give them a real big reason
to keep me,'' Bottalico said. ''So you can't be bitter.'' ... The
three-game interleague series completed a 32-game stretch during
which the Royals had only six games at home. They open a nine-game
homestand on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Garrett Stephenson was named NL pitcher of the month
for May, when he was 5-0 with a 1.42 ERA. Stephenson threw two
consecutive complete games, one of them his first career shutout.
The last Cardinals pitcher to be honored was Bob Tewksbury in April
1994. ... OF Ray Lankford was out of the lineup for the second
straight game with a strained left hamstring, and might be out of
the lineup for a few more games. ''I definitely want to be out
there, but you've got to be cautionary,'' Lankford said. ''You
don't want to make the situation worse.'' ... Reliever Jesse Orosco
makes his third rehab start Tuesday for Triple-A Memphis. Each of
the first two outings lasted 12 pitches for Orosco, a specialist at
retiring left-handed batters.
Dodgers-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: When Los Angeles lost 8-7 Sunday in their series
finale against Anaheim, it marked the first time this season that
the Dodgers lost a game in which they led by four runs or more. The
Dodgers led 4-0 after the first inning and 7-3 in the sixth. ...
Eric Karros hit the 227th homer of his career Sunday, leaving him
one short of Ron Cey for fourth place on the Dodgers home run list.
... The Dodgers used their first-round pick in Monday's draft to
selected RHP Ben Diggins, who was 10-4 with a 3.83 ERA in 17 games
for Arizona State this season. The 6-foot-7 pitcher struck out 127
in 113 innings with a fastball consistently clocked at 95 mph.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: For the first time in franchise history, Texas selected a
catcher in the first round of the baseball draft. The Rangers took
Scott Heard from Rancho Bernardino High in San Diego with the 25th
overall pick. AL MVP Ivan Rodriguez, who has won eight Gold Gloves
as the Rangers catcher, wasn't even drafted, much less taken in the
first round. He was signed by the Rangers as a non-drafted free
agent in 1988. ... OF Gabe Kapler, on the DL since May 4 with a
partial tear of his right quadriceps muscle, began a three-game
rehabilitation stint with Double-A Tulsa on Monday. Texas manager
Johnny Oates said Kapler looked good in a Monday morning workout at
The Ballpark in Arlington before he flew to El Paso for the three
games. If all goes well, Kapler will return to the Rangers lineup
as the starter in center field for Friday's game at Colorado. He
began the season in right field, but will move to center to replace
rookie Ruben Mateo, who is out for the season after breaking his
leg last Friday night.
Tigers-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Juan Gonzalez was out of the Tigers lineup on Monday.
He drove a foul ball off his already-sore left foot in Sunday's
game against the Cubs. Tigers manager Phil Garner waited to post a
lineup until he was sure of Gonzalez's availability. ... Coming to
generic Three Rivers Stadium was a major letdown for the Tigers
after spending their first weekend in Wrigley Field. Some of the
Tigers were in awe of Wrigley. First baseman Rob Fick was so taken
with the place that he brought family members on the field after
the game to pose for photos. Fick said he always had a fondness for
Boston's Fenway Park but, ''this blows them all away.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Kevin Young, the Pirates' former cleanup hitter, was
batting sixth in Monday's lineup. Young is in a 1-for-19 slump that
has dropped his average to .239. He was dropped to fifth a few
weeks ago. John Vander Wal replaced him the No. 5 spot in Monday's
game. ... Jimmy Anderson will make his first start since May 28 on
Tuesday. Anderson's future in the rotation and on the major league
roster are uncertain because he's 0-3 with a 7.47 ERA since getting
his only win over the Mets on April 15. Anderson's biggest problem
is the first inning -- he's given up runs in the first inning in
each of his last six starts.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Randy Johnson said there were no problems with his
shoulder Monday when he played catch, the first time he's thrown
since his last start. The 1999 NL Cy Young winner was scheduled to
start Monday against the Cubs, but he skipped it after experiencing
tightness in his pitching shoulder. He had a cortisone injection
last Thursday. ''It was fine,'' Johnson said after playing catch
for 10 minutes. ''I'll try to throw catch tomorrow again, and then
Wednesday I'll throw on the side. That'll be the real test.''
Johnson (9-1) said he hopes to be back this weekend, when the
Diamondbacks play Anaheim. ''Shooting for Friday, I guess,'' he
said. ... Greg Colbrunn was back in the lineup Monday night after
missing Sunday's game. Colbrunn was hit in the elbow and arm
Saturday. ... Before the game, the Diamondbacks called up INF Danny
Klassen from Triple-A Tucson and optioned Nelson Figueroa to
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Cubs manager Don Baylor was thinking small when he made
out his lineup card for Monday's game. That's small as in short.
Chad Meyers, listed generously at 6-feet, was at second and Augie
Ojeda, who is 5-foot-8, was at short. ''I've got the shortest
lineup I've ever had in my life,'' Baylor said before the game,
laughing. ''Some scrappers out there.'' ... Despite a 2-4 record so
far in this nine-game homestand, the Cubs starting pitchers have
averaged almost 7 2-3 innings and have a 2.82 ERA. If the Cubs
could get some offense, that record might improve. ''I just hate to
waste the real good pitching performances we've had of late because
our hitting has been spotty,'' Baylor said. ... SS Ricky Gutierrez,
on the DL since May 25 with a separated right shoulder, would like
to return this week, but he doesn't know if that will happen. ''I
haven't thrown or hit yet,'' Gutierrez said. ''I'll see by this
week how far I am. I really don't have a timetable.''

<HEADLINE> OAS Debate Underway on Peru  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- A resolution to investigate Peru's
electoral process but not to sanction the South American nation was
winning support Monday evening from most foreign ministers at a
conference of the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   The organization of 34 Western Hemisphere nations met for a
second day Monday and focused on Peru, where President Alberto
Fujimori was re-elected May 28 in a runoff vote that featured
himself as the only candidate. His opponent boycotted the runoff,
alleging the election was rigged, and independent monitors refused
to observe the vote because it failed to meet basic international
standards of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution being considered by the OAS on Monday was
authored by host Canada. It stops short of any sanctions against
Peru, but notes that problems in the voting that re-elected
Fujimori tainted the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   Debate by the OAS general assembly began after two days of
back-room negotiations that pitted Peru and some Latin American
allies that oppose foreign intervention in election issues against
the United States and others seeking a harsh response to
irregularities in the Peruvian voting.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies earlier said
wording that questioned the result of the vote would be dropped
from the resolution. But the draft proposed for debate includes a
reference to concerns that the outcome's credibility had been
undermined by ''persistent reports of irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign ministers said they supported the proposal as a
strong step to confront a weakening of democracy in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''Latin America as a whole is affected by any backsliding with
respect to democracy by any of our countries,'' said Marie Alvear
of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Rangel, however, said the
resolution amounted to unwanted intervention and lacked the
consensus of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''One cannot harm or affect democracy on behalf of democracy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed resolution orders an investigative mission of two --
OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Canadian
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy -- to leave for Peru
''immediately'' to work on ways to strengthen democracy there.
Specific issues to be studied include reforming the electoral
process and bolstering freedom of the press, the proposal says.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was likely to disappoint human rights groups that
wanted the OAS to suspend Peru or otherwise pressure it to hold new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights report has accused the South American country of
failing to meet democratic election standards. Former President
Jimmy Carter joined two former Latin American leaders in an open
letter to the OAS meeting that also criticized the Peru election.
</P>
<P>
   Peru was the main issue of the second day of the OAS three-day
general assembly, following protests Sunday by free-trade activists
that led to 41 arrests and prompted overwhelming security measures.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters turned up at the downtown Windsor meeting site by
mid-afternoon Monday, probably due as much to cold, rainy weather
that descended on this southern Ontario city across the border from
Detroit as to the armed riot police patrolling downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   Outside an OAS luncheon elsewhere, scores of demonstrators
linked arms and sat down in the rain to block delegates from
entering. Police had to pick up some of the protesters to clear the
road. No arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The protests Sunday were the largest in memory at an OAS
gathering and brought the grouping of 34 countries face-to-face
with the anti-free trade movement that disrupted a World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle in December and also evoked street
clashes at an International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Shoots 58 In Qualifying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Shigeki Maruyama of Japan took golf's
magic number one notch lower Monday by shooting a 58 during
qualifying for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The score will not be recognized as a PGA Tour record because it
happened in a qualifying round, but it was more than enough to get
Maruyama into the 100th U.S. Open next week at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama had 11 birdies and an eagle on the par-71 South course
at Woodmont Country Club, one of 12 qualifying sites for the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of my shots were perfect this morning,'' Maruyama said
through an interpreter. ''I wanted to make a good score, and I
thought I had to play well on the easier course because rain is
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He required 16 more strokes on the North course Monday afternoon
-- a 74 -- but still easily qualified at 132. David Berganio was the
medalist at Woodmont at 130.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest score in tour history is a 59 set by five players --
David Duval, Chip Beck, Al Geiberger on the PGA Tour; and Doug
Dunakey and Notah Begay on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama holed a wedge from 96 yards for eagle on No. 9, and
reached the par-5 18th in two from 250 yards away. He two-putted
for birdie and a 58.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama first drew attention by going 5-0 for the International
team in 1998 Presidents Cup. His best finish on the PGA Tour this
year was a tie for second in the Buick Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama's lowest round in a professional tournament was 63. He
said his lowest round anywhere was 61.
</P>
<P>
   ''After playing here today, I'm very tired,'' he said. ''I hope
I play well at this year's U.S. Open so I don't have to do this
again. It was like running a marathon.''

<HEADLINE> Rockers 69, Sting 53  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Eva Nemcova scored 16 points as the
Cleveland Rockers beat Charlotte 69-53 Monday night, the Sting's
eighth consecutive loss dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   The game was never close for Charlotte (0-3), which was
outrebounded 38-23, had 18 turnovers and missed all 13 of its
3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Nemcova opened the game with a jumper and a 3-pointer, and
Merlakia Jones scored seven straight points to give the Rockers a
12-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (2-1) had a 19-7 lead with 10:56 to play in the first
half when Charlotte coach T.R. Dunn pulled his starters. The
reserves fared no better, though, and Cleveland pushed the score to
27-9 when Dunn sent guard Dawn Staley back in three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland took a 40-17 lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers took their largest lead of the game three minutes
into the second half when Suzie McConnell Serio hit a 3-pointer to
make it 47-21.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting then got a spark from Andrea Stinson, who scored five
straight points in a 10-0 run that made it 47-31 with 12:04 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Rhonda Mapp later made two jump shots and a free
throw in a 5-0 run that cut the score to 59-48 with 1:59 to play.
But Mapp missed a chance to pull the Sting within single digits
when her 3-point attempt bounced off the rim with 80 seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got the rebound and converted on Rushia Brown's layup
that made it 61-48 with 1:17 to play, sealing the win for the
Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones added 11 points for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Mapp led the Sting with 17 points and Stinson added 15.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Women Emphasize Diplomacy  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More American women than men believe in
emphasizing international cooperation and diplomacy over military
action, a nationwide poll revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 69 percent of American women surveyed in the poll believe
global problems make it necessary for the United States to work
with other countries through international institutions like the
United Nations, compared to 61 percent of American men.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, nearly 10 percent more women than men -- 43 percent
to 34 percent -- believe the United States should emphasize
diplomacy over military action in international policy, the poll
reported. And half the women surveyed believe the United States
should increase or maintain the attention it devotes to
international issues.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, carried out by Belden Russonello and Stewart, was
sponsored by A Women's Lens on Global Issues, a project of the
Aspen Institute. The polling firm interviewed 1,500 women and 701
men by telephone. The margin of error was 2.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this poll tells us is that American women are aware and
interested and recognize that the safety of their home or hearth is
intimately connected to what happens in other countries,'' said
Joan Dunlop, director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women's concept of security is based on cooperation, not
conflict, and on international agreement, not aggression,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the poll were announced at the United Nations on
the first day of a U.N. General Assembly special session to review
progress in seeking women's equality worldwide. The session is a
follow-up to the 1995 U.N. conference on women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The poll asked respondents to choose areas of U.S. action in the
world. It said a majority of women would give priority to
preventing child diseases, while close to half would push for equal
education for girls and making birth control available.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, called the poll
''good news'' for those who want American women's support for the
U.N. Population Fund's international family planning programs and
for payment of U.S. dues to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 3, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Carl Everett hit a solo home run in the ninth
inning as the Boston Red Sox snapped their longest losing streak of
the season at five games with a 3-2 win over the Florida Marlins on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, a former Marlins player, entered the game as a
pinch-hitter in the seventh inning, hitting into a fielder's
choice. He stayed in the game, though, and got another at-bat with
one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the first pitch from Ricky Bones (1-1) into the
right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield (2-4) allowed one hit and one walk in two innings
for the win. Derek Lowe pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 11th
save.
</P>
<P>
   The come-from-behind win spoiled another strong outing by
Marlins starter Reid Cornelius. Cornelius allowed six hits and one
run over 6 1-3 innings. He gave up one run in eight innings at
Pittsburgh last week.
</P>
<P>
   After Braden Looper gave up back-to-back hits to start the
eighth, Armando Almanza intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra to
load the bases. After striking out Brian Daubach, Almanza walked
Jason Varitek to tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored a pair of runs in the first inning on Cliff
Floyd's 10th home run of the season. Luis Castillo singled and
advanced to third on a stolen base and an error by Red Sox starter
Pete Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek had Castillo picked off at first, but his throw to
Brian Daubach was in the dirt. Two batters later, Floyd's hammered
Schourek's 3-2 pitch into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Schourek settled down after the shaky start, retiring 15 of
the next 17 batters before giving up a two-out double in the sixth
to Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Boston manger Jimy Williams lifted Schourek for Everett in the
seventh, and the move paid off two innings later.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek allowed five hits and two runs. He struck out three
without a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox cut the lead in half with a run in the second
inning. Jason Varitek walked, moved to third on Manny Alexander's
double and scored on Donnie Sadler's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Strikeout leader Preston Wilson of the Marlins struck out
three times, giving him 79 this season. ... Castillo stole two
bases, giving him a major-league best 25 this season. ... Everett
has an 11-game hitting streak.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought to speed up
peacemaking, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that Israel's
security depends on a ''settlement presence'' along the Jordan Valley. Barak
also suggested he was inclined to sweeten his territorial offers to the
Palestinians in a drive to conclude a final accord over such sensitive problems
as Jerusalem's future and how much land Yasser Arafat will have for his
Palestinian state.

Chernobyl nuclear power plant closed, drawing praise from President Clinton, who
provided $80 million in American aid to close the plant forever. The April 26,
1986 accident spread radioactive material over much of Europe. The Ukrainian
government has blamed the disaster for at least 8,000 deaths, including 31
killed immediately, many more killed in the massive cleanup operation and others
who later died of cancer and other radiation-related illnesses. The plant will
close on Dec. 15, Kuchma said.

who wrote the story in which the Atlanta reliever disparaged gays, minorities
and foreigners. Rocker was fined ''a substantial amount'' for the confrontation
with Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman, said manager Bobby Cox. General
manager John Schuerholz says Rocker was optioned because he was not pitching
well. Rocker has walked 25 batters in just 18 1/3 innings this season.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Activist Puts Bounty on Cop  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) -- A Mexican activist on Monday offered
$10,000 to anybody who kills a U.S. Border Patrol agent, a move
that was immediately condemned by the Mexican government and called
a publicity stunt by local officials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also opened an investigation into the bounty
offered by Carlos Ibarra Perez, spokesman for an advocacy group
called the Citizen Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarra, 60, says too many illegal immigrants are being slain by
federal agents and private landowners while making their way into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Border Patrol) are massacring people,'' Ibarra said
at a news conference in this city just across the border from
Texas. ''And now we're ready to defend ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounting tension between undocumented immigrants, federal
authorities and border residents has been more evident in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a Border Patrol agent in nearby Brownsville shot
and killed an illegal immigrant during a struggle on the banks of
the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, ranchers are patrolling their spreads armed with
rifles and others are detaining suspected illegal immigrants for
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Mexican government hired a Washington, D.C. law
firm to seek damages from vigilantes who have detained illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Mexican government harshly criticized Ibarra's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The embassy of Mexico strongly condemns such irresponsible
actions and finds such a statement to be an intolerable
provocation,'' said Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, spokesman for the
Mexican embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Local media and officials in Reynosa said Ibarra, a retired oil
worker, apparently doesn't have the money to pay the offered
reward. ''This offer was not made in earnest,'' said Reynosa city
spokesman Rodolfo Martinez. ''This guy is just looking for
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The group he claims to lead has a few dozen activists at most
and is mostly involved with illegal takeovers of land by squatters,
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents were expected to review a videotape of Ibarra's news
conference. Threatening a federal agent is a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Activists for immigrants decried Ibarra's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already live in a climate of tension that we believe leads
to abuse,'' said Nathan Selzer, spokesman for Project Libertad, a
Harlingen-based immigrant rights group. ''Now you're putting in the
back of agents' minds that everybody is trying to kill them. It's
just going to create more violence.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dodger Marshall Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Former major league outfielder Mike
Marshall, now the manager of the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, was
suspended for eight games by the nonaffiliated Northern League for
taking his team off the field in a game last week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday at Allentown, Marshall ordered his team off the
field in the bottom of the eighth inning with the Ambassadors
leading 15-3. The game was declared a 9-0 forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Diamond Dogs were fined $5,000 and Marshall was
fined an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he felt the Ambassadors were trying to run up the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ''They kicked our butts, and then they rubbed our noses in it,''
Marshall said. ''My hat's off to them for kicking our butts, but
there's respect for the game and your opponents, and they went over
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern League president Dan Moushon said Marshall was
remorseful.
</P>
<P>
   ''He basically admitted he made a mistake and said if he could
do it again, he would have handled it much differently,'' Moushon
said. ''He feels bad about it, and he was very apologetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall played for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1981-89. He hit
148 homers in an injury-plagued career with the Dodgers, New York
Mets, Boston Red Sox and California Angels. He was a National
League All-Star in 1984 and helped the Dodgers beat the heavily
favored Oakland A's for the 1988 World Series title.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore: Politics is Personal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORRIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Tipper Gore appealed for votes Monday for
her husband's Democratic presidential campaign in traditionally
Republican eastern Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped short of calling Al Gore's home state a battleground
in the November election against Republican George W. Bush but
reminded her audience that ''politics is personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to leave you with a thought, particularly in East
Tennessee where every single vote is critically important,'' she
told about 250 Anderson County Democrats who came despite heavy
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''When John Kennedy ran for election in 1960, after everything
was said and done, they went back and counted the votes. And do you
know he won by one vote per precinct? Just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''So take that message to young people, veterans, women, people
that we work with, ... people that think their voice doesn't matter
or their vote isn't going to count.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently said he has a ''pretty good chance'' of carrying
the state in November.
</P>
<P>
   A Mason-Dixon poll conducted in March showed Gore with 47
percent support in Tennessee, to Bush's 41 percent, with a margin
of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance earlier in the day at Erma Siegel Elementary
School in Murfreesboro, Mrs. Gore said that, if elected, her
husband will put more mental health professionals in schools and
get teachers trained to recognize mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   She said he also will seek better insurance coverage for mental
illness treatment.

<HEADLINE> Expos 6, Yankees 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- David Cone was far from perfect this time.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cabrera hit a three-run homer one pitch after being
knocked down by Cone, and the Montreal Expos beat the New York
Yankees 6-4 Monday night for their season-high sixth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (1-6) was facing Montreal for the first time since his
perfect game against them at Yankee Stadium last July 18, and he
lost for the 11th time in 14 decisions since then.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-all in the sixth inning and runners on first
and second, Cabrera was sent sprawling by a high, inside pitch with
a 1-0 count, Cabrera drove the next pitch into the left-field
stands for his sixth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting his home-run trot, Cabrera flipped his bat
toward Cone, who had hit the previous batter, Mike Mordecai.
Montreal's first runner of the inning, Brian Schneider, had reached
on a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Cone started in place of Ramiro Mendoza, scratched prior to the
game because of pain in his right shoulder. New York tries to get
Cone an extra day of rest between starts, and he originally was
scheduled to face Javier Vazquez on Tuesday night in a rematch of
the starters in the perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cone allowed six runs and seven hits in six innings,
the seventh time in 12 starts he gave up four runs or more.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson, making his first start since May 7 -- he had
been sent to the bullpen to replace injured closer Ugueth Urbina --
allowed three runs and seven hits while throwing 80 pitches in four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Johnson (2-0) allowed three hits and one run in two-plus
innings of relief as Montreal improved to 4-0 in interleague play
this year. Steve Kline pitched the ninth to convert his fifth
straight save chance, his sixth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has won seven straight home games and 10 of 11,
improving to 22-9 at Olympic Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was scratched before the
game with a strained left forearm he reaggravated last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which dropped back into a tie with Boston for the AL
East lead, took a 2-0 lead in the first on Ricky Ledee's leadoff
homer and Scott Brosius' RBI single -- center fielder Peter Bergeron
threw out Jorge Posada at third base to end the inning before Tino
Martinez touched home plate while trying to score from second.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero tied it in the bottom half with his 17th
homer, then doubled with two outs in the third and scored on Lee
Stevens' single for a 3-2 lead. Ledee tied it with an RBI double in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' sacrifice fly drove in New York's final run in the
seventh. With two on, Anthony Telford struck out Clay Bellinger and
retired pinch-hitter Felix Jose on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees plan to use a reliever to start in Cone's place
on Tuesday. Jason Grimsley has made two starts this year and Mike
Stanton started once last season. ... Kline set a team record with
five straight save conversions, topping a mark accomplished by
Claude Raymond, John Wetteland, Mel Rojas (who did it twice) and
Urbina.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits East Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake rattled northeastern
Taiwan on Tuesday morning, seismologists said. No damage or
injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.8-magnitude quake's epicenter was 21 miles south of Ilan
city, the Central Weather Bureau said. Ilan is about 60 miles south
of the capital, Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed
by 51 fault lines, Taiwan is hit by scores of earthquakes each
year, but few cause serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   A 7.6-magnitude quake devastated central Taiwan in September,
killing about 2,400 people and destroying thousands of homes. Since
the earthquake, more than 12,000 aftershocks and minor tremors have
rattled the island. Most have been harmless.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 4, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jose Valentin and Greg Norton homered, and
Chicago's bullpen had just enough to close out James Baldwin's
solid start as the White Sox beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-3 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got their fifth win in six games, improving the
AL's best record to 33-23. It's the second time this season that
they're 10 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin (9-1), off to the best start by a White Sox pitcher
since he won nine of his first 10 decisions in 1996, turned a 3-0
lead over to the bullpen with one out and two on in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young had an RBI double off Kelly Wunsch and
Benito Santiago drove in another run with a groundout off Bobby
Howry. Keith Foulke pitched two innings, giving up a solo homer in
the ninth to Sean Casey, as he converted his 12th consecutive save
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds couldn't build upon their three-game sweep of Minnesota
because they couldn't take advantage of their few chances against
Baldwin. The right-hander gave up seven singles, two by Ken Griffey
Jr., and a pair of walks in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin escaped two-on threats in the first and the sixth by
handling Dante Bichette, the Reds' hottest hitter with a homer in
each of his previous four games. Bichette grounded back to Baldwin,
who started a second-to-first double play in the first, then ended
a sixth-inning threat by striking out.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin improved to 7-0 on the road with a 1.73 ERA. Heading
into Monday's game, only Boston's Pedro Martinez's road ERA (0.51)
was better.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (2-8) took his career-high eighth loss and remained
winless since May 9 by giving up a pair of runs and three hits in
six innings. Parris is 0-4 in five starts since his last win.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham, who led off the first interleague game at Cinergy
Field in 1997 with a homer, opened the game with a triple and
scored on Valentin's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive game that Durham had a leadoff
extra-base hit. He homered Sunday as the White Sox beat Houston to
take 2 of 3 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, in a 3-for-27 slump, led off the sixth with a
first-pitch homer off Parris. Norton, only 4-for-24 in his last
eight games, hit his first homer since May 17 with one out in the
seventh off Scott Sullivan for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko had a pinch single in the ninth off Dennys Reyes
for Chicago's final run. Konerko and Reyes came to the Reds
together from Los Angeles in the 1998 trade for closer Jeff Shaw,
and Konerko was traded to the White Sox later that year.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Frank Thomas, who sat out Sunday after playing the first 54
games, was back in the lineup at first. He went 0-for-2 with a pair
of walks, extending his slump to 2-for-21. ... Baldwin also pitched
in Cincinnati as part of that initial interleague series in 1997
and got his only major league hit. He was 0-for-3 Monday but
reached when he struck out on a wild pitch. ... RHP Mark Wohlers
pitched one scoreless inning for Reds' Triple-A Louisville club on
a rehab start, allowing one hit and one walk and striking out two
Scranton batters. ... RHP Osvaldo Fernandez will miss his next
scheduled start in Cleveland because of a sore elbow, jammed when
he hit a line drive Sunday. ... Griffey was 2-for-4 with a pair of
strikeouts, leaving his average at .216. He's in an 8-for-54 slump.

<HEADLINE> Fans React To Rocker Demotion  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves fans won't be able to cheer John Rocker,
at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta reliever, struggling on the mound and under fire
again for threatening a reporter, was demoted to the minors before
Monday night's game against the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   While Rocker received a standing ovation every time he pitched
at Turner Field, some fans supported the Braves' decision to send
Rocker to Triple-A Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad he's gone,'' said Barry Blair of suburban
Fayetteville. ''A professional athlete should be able to conduct
himself in a professional manner. After all, they are role models
for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The move came one day after Rocker's heated confrontation with
Sports Illustrated's Jeff Pearlman, who wrote a story detailing the
pitcher's derogatory comments against gays, foreigners and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to deal with some consequences here,'' said Creighton
Kelly of LaGrange. ''The Braves have done all they can to let him
work his way out of this. He needs to have some discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves said Rocker was sent to the minors to work on his
control, not as punishment for Sunday's incident. He has 25 walks
in 18 1-3 innings. The threats against Pearlman resulted in a
$5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to work on his control, so maybe this is a good
idea,'' Rhoda Wells of LaGrange said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kind of move that may help him until it all dies
down,'' added Anne Powers of Alpharetta, ''especially since he
hasn't been pitching very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ewing of Peachtree City noted that Rocker has 10 saves in
11 chances and his ERA is a respectable 3.93.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shouldn't do anything about him,'' Ewing said. ''He's
doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bo Rutledge, who came to the game from Shreveport, La., said
Rocker shouldn't have to go to the minors to work on his control
after saving 38 games a year ago -- one short of the franchise
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't do any good to send him down,'' Rutledge said. ''If
they want to get rid of him, they ought to send him away, trade
him. But, no, I don't think they should get rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, fans were disappointed that Rocker may not be with
the Braves when the team starts a four-game series against the Mets
on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rocker maintained a verbal war with New Yorkers
through both the NL championship series against the Mets and the
World Series against the Yankees. And many of his derogatory
comments in Pearlman's story were aimed at the city's residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mets fans are going to be real disappointed,'' said Ted Bajek,
attending Monday night's Mets-Baltimore game. ''But he's got to
take his medicine some time. When he does, we'll be here to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is required to stay in the minors only 10 days, but Mets
reliever Turk Wendell predicted it will be longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to bet, I'd bet he wouldn't be here when the Braves
come to town. They don't need that kind of distraction,'' Wendell
said. ''He's an idiot. Let him grow up and mature a little bit, on
and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, New York released Rickey Henderson -- a
persistent problem to Mets management. Wendell felt the Braves were
sending a message about Rocker's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Braves are a first-class organization, a classy
organization,'' Wendell said. ''He hasn't handled himself in a
first-class manner in any way, shape or form. Before, he could get
away with it because he was pitching well. Now, he can't.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles 4, Mets 2  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Albert Belle, playing his first game at Shea
Stadium, had three hits and drove in two runs as the Baltimore
Orioles beat the New York Mets 4-2 on a windy Monday night and
broke a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Tyner, playing his first game in the big leagues, was
2-for-3 for New York, including an RBI single off Mike Mussina. The
23-year-old rookie was promoted from Triple-A Norfolk before the
game and immediately became the Mets' leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Mike Hargrove, back after missing two games
while attending his son's high school graduation in Cleveland, made
an unusual move that paid off during a three-run rally in the
seventh off Mike Hampton (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who had won four straight decisions, gave up a leadoff
homer to B.J. Surhoff that made it 2-all in the seventh. Mark Lewis
followed with a single and Mussina, allowed to bat, bunted into a
forceout at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Amaral walked and, with Mussina at second, Hargrove sent in
Delino DeShields to run for the pitcher. Mike Bordick delivered a
single to center field that scored the speedy DeShields -- Mussina
likely would not have made it.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Belle blooped an RBI double for a 4-2 lead that
finished Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (3-6) gave up two runs in the second, ending the inning
by getting Mike Piazza on a fly ball with the bases loaded. Mussina
allowed little else before leaving after the sixth, retiring his
last nine batters.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's bid for a solo home run in the eighth was knocked back
in play by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin pitched the ninth for his fifth save. Orioles
pitched retired their final 18 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner, batting .347 at Norfolk and leading the International
League with 27 stolen bases, was New York's first-round draft pick
in 1998. Called up earlier in the day, the left fielder made a fast
impression with the Mets, too.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the bottom of the first, he hit a one-hopper off
Mussina's glove and beat third baseman Cal Ripken's throw for a
single. Tyner's try at stealing second was foiled when Derek Bell
hit a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bell then grounded into a forceout at second base, but Tyner
hustled and slid into Bordick, forcing a wild throw.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the second, Tyner sliced an opposite-field
single to left for a 1-0 lead. Edgardo Alfonzo later drew a
bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   Belle hit a single in the third that drove in Amaral, who scored
twice and stole two bases.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tyner was flawless in the field. The Mets hope he can fill
the leadoff spot left when Rickey Henderson was released last
month. ... RHP Rick Reed will start Tuesday night for the Mets. He
missed his last start because of an injured side muscle. ... The
Orioles improved to 10-22 on the road. They were coming off a
three-game sweep at Montreal.

<HEADLINE> NY Council Urges NRA Not Open Shop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The City Council on Monday urged the National
Rifle Association not to open a theme store and restaurant in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is currently negotiating to lease space for an eatery
tentatively called The N.R.A. Grille. An adjoining shop is to offer
virtual-reality trap and skeet shooting, outdoor clothing and
hunting accessories.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no plans for the store to sell guns, the idea
has gotten a cool reception since it was announced last month by
NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.
</P>
<P>
   In its resolution Monday, the Council said, ''The promotion of
guns has no place in such an entertainment venture and especially
not in Times Square, where the city has worked hard to rid the area
of guns and gun-related violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Powers, the NRA's director of public affairs, said the
vote would have no effect on the group's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the City Council of New York cannot stomach the fact that
40 million Americans participate in shooting sports, they will
choke on their own political correctness,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 9, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Rookie Chris Woodward's three-run homer capped a
five-run first inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays cruised to a 9-3
victory over Atlanta on Monday night in the Braves' first game
without John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi added a three-run homer in the third for the Blue
Jays, who lead the AL with 93 homers. The Braves have lost three of
four since beginning interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells became the AL's first 10-game winner with six solid
innings. The left-hander (10-2) allowed two runs and seven hits
before turning the game over the bullpen with a 9-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves a year ago, was demoted to Triple-A
Richmond before the game. He was struggling with his control and
under fire again for threatening a reporter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker wouldn't have played a role in this game. The Blue Jays
pounded John Burkett (4-3) in the first and knocked out the Atlanta
starter in the third, ending his four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the first, Craig Grebeck walked, Raul Mondesi
singled and Carlos Delgado brought home the first run with a
single. Burkett had a chance to escape the inning after striking
out Jose Cruz Jr., but Alex Gonzalez made it 2-0 with another
single and Woodward followed with a drive into the left-field
stands, his second homer since being recalled from Triple-A
Syracuse on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett gave up two more hits leading off the third, prompting
manager Bobby Cox to call in Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen struck out Wells and retired Stewart on a sacrifice fly
that increased Toronto's lead to 6-0. Grebeck hit a grounder to
shortstop Rafael Furcal, who bobbled the ball for an error. Mondesi
made the Braves pay for their miscue, sending his 12th homer over
the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored two runs in the fourth on RBI singles by Brian
Jordan and Javy Lopez. Jordan drove in another run with an
eighth-inning single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wells, already leading the AL with only 1.1 walks per nine
innings, did not walk anyone and struck out six. ... Atlanta's 1-4
start in June is their worst for the month since 1995. ... The
Braves dropped to 10-17 at home in interleague play.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands PM Taken Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Rebels seized the prime minister
of the Solomon Islands on Monday on Guadalcanal, where U.S. Marines
first took the offensive against Japan after the attack on Pearl
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Phone lines and air links to the Solomons were cut as the rebels
from a shadowy group calling itself the Malaita Eagle Force set up
roadblocks around Honiara, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita Eagle gunmen demanded the resignation of Prime
Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, and officials from the tiny South
Pacific nation met Tuesday to vote on a motion to oust him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu had offered last week to resign as his support
dwindled, but the necessary government meeting never took place
because officials from around the sprawling island nation did not
arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ulufa'alu was seized, the rebels asked him if he would
voluntarily resign, but he said he would prefer to see his
political fate determined through a government vote, said Brad
Tattersfield, a spokesman for the New Zealand Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaita rebels overran police stations and the Government
Telecommunications Center in Honiara early Monday, Australian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in New Zealand said the rebels raided a police armory
in Honiara and stole weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent coup attempt was the second in the South Pacific in
weeks -- with armed rebels in Fiji still holding the deposed prime
minister and more than 30 other people seized in a raid on
Parliament on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Fiji's military chief said rebel leader George
Speight could play no role in any new government. Speight responded
that he was ready to keep his captives as long as necessary to get
his way.
</P>
<P>
   While the standoff on Fiji represented friction between the
majority indigenous Fijians represented by Speight and ethnic
Indians, the conflict on Guadalcanal -- the Solomon Islands main
island -- involved residents of different islands in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 18 months, the Malaita Eagle Force and another
rebel group, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, have been fighting on
Guadalcanal, where thousands of migrants from the nearby island of
Malaita live.
</P>
<P>
   Honiara is largely populated by Malaitans, including Ulufa'alu.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabu force wants to push the Malaita migrants off
Guadalcanal, while the Malaita Eagle forces have resisted with
weapons dug up from World War II arms dumps on the island.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people have been killed or have disappeared in the
fighting between the islanders and 20,000 have been forced to flee
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent skirmish, the headless body of a rebel was left on
a street in Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fiji's crisis, the entire government of the Solomon
Islands was not captured. The government was still functioning,
making it unclear whether a full blown crisis was unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the rebels, lawyer Andrew Nori, told a Solomon
Islands radio station, monitored by officials in Wellington, that
Prime Minister Ulufa'alu was being held at home in ''protective
custody'' after being captured by six Malaita group gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, said he
understood Ulufa'alu was allowed to move freely about Honiari,
provided he did not stray from the Malaita gunmen who followed him.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Power Plant To Be Closed  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Fourteen years after the world's worst
nuclear accident, Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma ordered the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant closed, drawing praise from President
Clinton, who dispensed $80 million in American aid to entomb the
plant forever.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a hopeful moment,'' Clinton said in this former Soviet
republic, the last stop in a weeklong European tour before
returning to Washington late Monday night. ''It is also a moment
when we remember those who suffered as a result of the accident
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The April 26, 1986 accident spread radioactive material over
much of Europe. The Ukrainian government has blamed the disaster
for at least 8,000 deaths, including 31 killed immediately, many
more killed in the massive cleanup operation and others who later
died of cancer and other radiation-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The plant will close on Dec. 15, Kuchma said. The U.S. Energy
Department said it will help find replacement sources of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in Moscow, Clinton used an address to the Duma, the
lower house of the Russian parliament, to criticize the Kremlin's
crackdown in Chechnya. And he paid a nostalgic visit to former
Russian President Boris Yeltsin at his dacha on the outskirts of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeltsin looked good,'' Clinton told reporters on Air Force One
on the way to Kiev. ''He's in good spirits, happy. He and his wife
and daughter were there. We all just had a nice visit. It was like
old times.''
</P>
<P>
   The money Clinton pledged will help contain radiation from the
destroyed reactor, with $2 million earmarked for improving safety
at Ukraine's other nuclear power plants. It comes atop about $200
million the United States has already spent to improve nuclear
safety in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The new money will go toward repairing a cover, or sarcophagus,
which was built not long after the disaster but now is considered
unstable. During his half-day visit, Clinton announced steps to
open the door to expanded U.S. cooperation with Ukraine's
struggling space program and a $25 million program for small and
medium-sized Ukrainian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''America will stand by you as you fight for a free and
prosperous future,'' Clinton told tens of thousands of people, many
waving Ukrainian and American flags.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Clinton became the first U.S. president to address
the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not destined to be adversaries but it is not guaranteed
that we will be allies,'' Clinton told Russian lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   His 50-minute speech drew mostly polite applause, although
several dozen sat impassively.
</P>
<P>
   Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky shouted before and
after Clinton's speech and muttered audibly several times during
it. ''Shame! Whom are you applauding?'' Zhirinovsky asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped Russia would take advantage of recent
economic growth -- due largely to higher oil prices -- to create a
more diversified economy. He offered U.S. support should Russia
seek to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Russian crackdown in Chechnya, he said: ''I know
you disagreed with what I did in Kosovo, and you know that I
disagreed with what you did in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made yet another pitch for modifying the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to open the way for the United States
to build a national missile defense -- something Russia continues to
oppose. ''I ask you to think about this, to debate it, as I know
you will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also paid a 30-minute farewell visit to his weekend
host, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin then flew to Italy,
where he met with Italian Premier Giuliano Amato and later
suggested to reporters that he might support an anti-missile system
if it would protect Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Clinton's speech to the Russian Duma was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said, ''I thought that
Clinton would assess the situation in Russia in a more honest way.
It is a bankrupt country, a beggar country, the result of 10 years
of democratic reforms ...''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the left-wing Agrarian group: ''I
liked the speech, there was no aggression in it. He was not trying
to impose his opinion on us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Communist Vasily Shandybin, a hard-liner, said, ''Clinton is
an enemy of the working class of Russia. ... Many patriots
boycotted this meeting.''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kristin Folkl had her first career
double-double with 19 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Minnesota
Lynx past the Detroit Shock 88-68 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game in which a Lynx player recorded
a double-double (Betty Lennox had 15 points, 10 rebounds Saturday
against Los Angeles). Minnesota players accomplished the feat just
once all last season.
</P>
<P>
   Folkl had career highs in rebounds and assists -- five -- as the
Lynx (2-2) snapped a two-game losing streak and set a franchise
record for points in a game. Rookie Grace Daley and Katie Smith
each scored 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Palmer scored 15 points and Claudia Maria das Neves had 12
for Detroit (1-1), which shot 36.7 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota never trailed after opening the game with a 12-2 run.
The closest Detroit came was 28-25 at the 3:53 mark, but the Lynx
went on another run to finish the half with a 40-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA president Val Ackerman was in attendance for the game as
she makes her way around the league. Ackerman said she has already
visited three of the four new WNBA cities and has seen great fan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unpredictability is exciting,'' Ackerman said. ''It's
apparent that we have just incredible competition in the league.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Quake Rescue Intensifies  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENGKULU, Indonesia (AP) -- The search for survivors and victims
of a massive earthquake intensified Tuesday on the island of
Sumatra, where victims lay three to a bed outside a ravaged
hospital and rumbling aftershocks kept scared survivors outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on the Indonesian island reported downed
communications and desperately stretched emergency services in the
wake of the quake, which crushed many victims when their poorly
built houses caved in on them while they slept.
</P>
<P>
   The official death toll stood at 58 on the Indonesian island.
However, a local newspaper claimed 94 had died in Sunday night's
magnitude 7.9 quake.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of known dead is now 58. But we fear it will go
higher,'' Bengkulu police chief Lt. Col. Nainggolan said. ''We
still haven't heard from outlying areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In badly hit Bengkulu town, on the island's southwest coast,
tens of thousands of people spent Monday night outdoors, too afraid
to return to damaged homes in case another big quake struck. More
than 300 aftershocks have been recorded since the initial quake
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the town of 250,000 had no electricity supply. Its
airport was closed because of damaged communications.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're too scared to go indoors again. What can we do now?
Everything has gone,'' said Mohair Mayhem, whose house was reduced
to a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 badly injured patients -- some two or three to a
bed -- were being treated in the parking lot of the devastated Young
General Hospital. Doctors performed emergency operations under
plastic sheeting. Twelve patients had died from quake-inflicted
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of the town, the hospital's badly cracked walls and
caved-in roof was testament to the severity of the temblor, which
was centered beneath the Indian Ocean, only 60 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got all patients and staff out immediately after the quake.
It's unsafe inside,'' said physician Buddy Mulana. ''We are finding
things very difficult. We have only two days supply of medicines
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood supplies also were running low and medical equipment was
lost under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of homes in Bengkulu were damaged or destroyed, police
and witnesses said. Major buildings had cracked walls. Smaller
structures collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The walls of my house fell in. I pulled my three boys from the
rubble. They are hurt, but they are alive, thank God,'' said one
patient, who goes by the single name of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Police said teams of rescuers, including police and soldiers
along with local people, had stepped up search efforts. Two navy
ships were bringing emergency supplies. Rescue personnel were being
deployed from other parts of Indonesia, and some foreign countries
had offered assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone services and roads in some parts of the region
remained cut Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest fears center around tiny Enggano island, about 125
miles southeast of Bengkulu town and closest to the quake's
epicenter. Initial reports said as much as 90 percent of its
buildings were flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia. Even so, Sunday night's
tremor was one of the most powerful recorded here in several years.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was felt across much of western half of the
archipelago nation. People in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, more
than 310 miles to the southeast, as well as in the neighboring
island state of Singapore fled their apartments after high-rise
buildings swayed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, said the quake's
epicenter was about 20 miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean
-- very shallow in geological terms.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no report of a tsunami, a massive wave caused by
an earthquake or volcanic eruption. In December 1992, a magnitude 7
earthquake triggered a tsunami that killed about 2,500 people on
the southeastern island of Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. agency put the strength of Sunday's quake at 7.9. The
Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said it measured
7.3.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A court on Monday announced its decision to strip
Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his immunity from prosecution, leaving Chile's former
dictator facing a long legal battle over the human rights abuses committed under
his rule. Pinochet's defense team said it would appeal the ruling. The Santiago
Court of Appeals voted 13-9 on May 23 to remove the congressional immunity
Pinochet enjoys as a senator for life. He faces 110 lawsuits filed on behalf of

<HEADLINE> Astros 8, Twins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell broke out of a 1-for-15 slump with a
two-run homer, giving him 1,000 RBIs in his career and helping the
Houston Astros beat the Minnesota Twins 8-2 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio singled to lead off the sixth inning against Brad
Radke (3-7) before Bagwell followed with his 14th homer of the
season to make it 4-2. He became the first player to reach 1,000
RBIs with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (4-1) allowed two runs and eight hits in seven
innings. He walked two and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, who had been 8-2 in interleague play for his career,
allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings. He has lost five
of his last six decisions. The Twins lost their fourth straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros trailed 2-0 before Daryle Ward's two-run homer in the
fifth tied the game. There have been 105 home runs in 29 games this
season at Enron Field. Last year, there were a total of 118 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 1-0 lead in the second after Ron Coomer led off
with a double, moved to third on a single by Corey Koskie and
scored on a groundout by Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   Matt LeCroy's leadoff homer in the fifth inning made it 2-0
before the Astros rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Houston added four runs in the eighth on a sacrifice fly by
Biggio, a two-run double by Lance Berkman and an RBI double by
pinch-hitter Julio Lugo.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston has homered in 32 of its last 34 games. ... Houston
has not been shut out this season and owns the longest active
streak for avoiding shutouts at 85. ... Radke has walked more the
two batters in only two of his 13 appearances this season. ...
Richard Hidalgo appeared to have hit his 19th home run in the
second inning. However, after he had rounded the bases and entered
the dugout the hit was ruled a double by third base umpire Brian
Runge. The ball hit at the top of the left-field wall in fair
territory and bounced to the left into the stands in foul
territory, based on TV replays. Houston manager Larry Dierker
argued the call for several minutes. ... In the eighth inning,
Mitch Meluskey was called out for fan interference when he hit a
potential home run which was caught by a fan who reached over and
swiped the ball before Huskey could catch it.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 2, Dodgers 0  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ryan Glynn, a Triple-A player called up
specifically for the start, won a duel against $105 million pitcher
Kevin Brown as the Texas Rangers beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-0
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn (1-0) was promoted from Oklahoma to start in place of
Darren Oliver and allowed two hits in eight shutout innings,
striking out six. John Wetteland finished to convert his 13th
consecutive save chance, his 16 in 19 opportunities overall.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough to beat Brown (4-2), who allowed five
hits in his second complete game. He walked none and struck out a
season-high nine.
</P>
<P>
   Texas went ahead in the sixth when Mike Lamb singled and scored
on Jason McDonald's broken-bat double with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer doubled leading off the seventh and scored on David
Segui's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Brown faced the minimum 15 batters in the first five innings and
didn't allow a ball out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn started slowly, giving up consecutive walks with two outs
in the first. He then struck out Eric Karros, starting a stretch in
which he retired 13 of his next 14 -- the only runner reaching on
Lamb's error at third base.
</P>
<P>
   He carried a no-hitter into the sixth before F.P. Santangelo, a
.141 hitter, had a leadoff single to center only to be thrown out
trying to steal second base.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek then hit another single back up the middle and
Shawn Green walked with two outs in the sixth before Karros ended
another threat by striking out.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, 2-3 in 11 starts, skipped his turn in the rotation after
complaining of having a tired arm in each of his last two outings.
Glynn is likely to be spent to back Triple-A, and Oliver could
return to face Colorado on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown started his major league career with the Ranger. When he
took the mound for the first inning, the song ''Money'' blared over
the stadium speakers. Brown signed a record $105 million,
seven-year contract with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brown has 68 complete games in his career. ... AL MVP Ivan
Rodriguez took most of the night off after manager Johnny Oates
gave him the option of taking Monday or Wednesday off. Bill
Haselman got his eighth start in 56 games this season, but was
replaced in the ninth after Haselman was lifted for a pinch runner.
... Glynn had to step off the mound momentarily with two outs in
the fifth when the crowd erupted in cheers. The Dallas Stars hockey
team had just scored a goal in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Bank Ceases Payments  </HEADLINE>
By MIHAELA ARMASELU
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Increasing the turmoil on financial
markets, a private bank said Monday it would not allow clients to
withdraw their savings for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian Popular Bank, with more than 50 branches and
500,000 clients nationwide, blamed its decision on the uncertainty
generated by the collapse of a large investment fund and fears of
bank closures.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Romanian Popular Bank urged calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our business is correct and honest,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of clients lined up Monday at its buildings in Baia Mare,
Brasov, Craiova, Galati and Timisoara asking for their deposits,
national radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, legal authorities ordered the National Fund for
Investment to stop operations. Thousands of investors took to the
streets and demanded their money. The fund has over 300,000
investors and reported assets of more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's collapse generated fears that the country's biggest
bank, the Romanian Commercial Bank, was close to bankruptcy. A
government guarantee dissipated such fears, but added to the
general climate of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Five banks have collapsed in recent years. Pyramid schemes,
sometimes dressed up as investment funds, have also wiped out the
savings of thousands of Romanians, who make about $93 a month on
average.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire left the game with an injured
hamstring, and Jermaine Dye tied a Kansas City record by homering
in his fourth straight game as the Royals beat the slumping St.
Louis Cardinals 7-4 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who was moved from cleanup to third in the lineup, left
the game in the fourth inning after straining his right thigh and
hamstring attempting to field a ball. McGwire is listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went 0-for-2 with a strikeout and has just one homer in
his last 11 games. The Cardinals, who lead the majors with 101 home
runs, have lost five of six, totaling 12 runs in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Dye became the ninth Royals player to homer in four straight
games when he hit his 18th of the year off Pat Hentgen (4-6) with
one out in the third. The last player to do it was Chili Davis from
Aug. 23-27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney had a two-run double in the sixth and two more runs
scored on a fielding error by Shawon Dunston, who moved from left
field to first base after McGwire's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City improved to 5-2 on a nine-game road trip, after
starting the season 8-17 away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki (3-0) gave up four runs in 5 1-3 innings and got his
first career hit when he singled and scored in a four-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He retired 12 straight batters after giving up an RBI double off
the top of the center-field wall to Dunston in the second before
running into trouble in the sixth when the Cardinals scored three
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Spradlin worked the ninth for his sixth save in eight
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina also left the game for St. Louis when he strained
his right hamstring trying to beat out a ground ball in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Vina's replacement, Placido Polanco, walked for the first time
in 93 plate appearances this season to start the sixth. He then
stole second and scored on Edgar Renteria's single. Eric Davis, who
came into the game for McGwire, followed with an RBI double and
J.D. Drew drove in another run with a single off Suzuki's glove to
cut the gap to 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen allowed three runs -- two earned -- and seven hits in five
innings. He has one victory in his last eight starts, that coming
in a 19-4 victory over Pittsburgh May 20.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Besides injuring his hamstring, Vina is in a 6-for-38
slump. ... Rookie pitcher Rick Ankiel, who's 7-for-28 with two
homers and five RBIs, struck out in his first career pinch hit
appearance to end the fifth. ... Hentgen has a 10-7 career record
against the Royals. ... The Royals are 6-4 in interleague play
against the Cardinals. ... George Thampy, 12, of suburban Maryland
Heights, Mo., the winner of last week's National Spelling Bee, will
throw out the first pitch Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> CBS Document Exposes Army's Orders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS reported Monday that U.S. Army investigators
have found a document showing that the Army requested U.S. war
planes to strafe columns of South Korean refugees approaching
American lines during the chaotic early days of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The document adds to a growing body of reports reflecting that
in the opening weeks of the Korean conflict, when American forces
were in retreat, the U.S. military adopted a policy of deliberately
firing on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Army launched a probe after The Associated Press quoted U.S.
veterans and South Korean survivors saying American GIs carried out
a mass killing of civilians in July 1950, at the hamlet of No Gun
Ri. Some ex-GIs said they received orders to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-GIs spoke of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The Koreans
say 300 were shot to death after 100 had been killed in an aerial
strafing.
</P>
<P>
   In its report last fall, AP reported that declassified military
documents showed general orders had been issued to shoot at
civilians who crossed front lines. ''Fire everyone trying to cross
lines. Use discretion in case of women and children,'' said an
order issued by the Army's 1st Cavalry Division headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said that during the Korean War, the U.S. Army asked the Air
Force to strafe civilians because it was afraid that North Korean
soldiers were infiltrating groups of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army has requested that we strafe all civilian refugee
parties .. approaching our positions,'' said the memo cited by CBS.
''To date, we have complied.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS said the memo was written by Air Force Col. Turner Rogers
and was found at the National Archives in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Rogers memo, the Army was concerned that
''large groups of civilians, either composed of or controlled by
North Korean soldiers, are infiltrating U.S. positions.'' However,
the Air Force colonel warned that targeting civilians ''may cause
embarrassment to the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story in December, the AP cited after-mission reports from
the Korean War which showed that U.S. Air Force pilots sometimes
questioned their targets. In one, pilots said a Korean group
strafed at an airborne controller's instruction ''could have been
refugees.'' In another declassified report they said their target
''appeared to be evacuees.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS said Army investigators looking into the No Gun Ri
allegations have not found any record from the Army of the request
to strafe civilians.

<HEADLINE> Support for Japanese Govt. Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The public support rate for the Cabinet of Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori plummeted to 17 percent in May with the
disapproval rating surging to 66 percent, a newspaper poll
published Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
   The poll in Japan's top economic daily, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, was the latest survey to show Mori's government plunging
in popularity ahead of June 25 lower house elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai cited Mori's recent comment calling Japan a
''divine nation with the emperor at the center'' as being
especially damaging. Critics have linked the comment to the
emperor-worship of Japan's wartime past.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll, conducted from Friday through Sunday,
questioned 3,000 eligible voters nationwide, of whom 60 percent
gave a valid response. No margin of error was given.
</P>
<P>
   The disapproval rating of 66 percent was double that registered
in a Nihon Keizai poll in April. The support rating of 17 percent
was less than half of that in the previous poll.
</P>
<P>
   As in other recent polls, the Nihon Keizai survey showed doubts
about Mori's capacity to lead. Among those who do not support
Mori's Cabinet, 60 percent said they do not trust Mori, and 50
percent said he lacks leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The voter discontent, however, may not be enough to topple the
ruling three-party coalition, led by Mori's Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP continued to win the highest support with a rating of
37.5 percent, marking a 5 percentage point drop from the previous
poll. All the opposition parties received higher ratings compared
with the April survey, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori took office on April 5 after then-Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi suffered a stroke. Since then, Mori has faced a string of
scandals and criticism that he is weak on policy. Obuchi died on
May 14.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Ruler Says No More Grants  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military ruler said Tuesday that the
rebels holding government hostages in parliament won't be getting
any additional concessions and should accept an amnesty offer to
end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama also warned army reservists who are
holed up in Fiji's parliamentary compound with George Speight's
rebels to come out or lose their salaried commissions. Less than a
dozen reservists are believed to be inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not take any more demands,'' Bainimarama told a news
conference. ''We are requesting them to release the hostages,
return arms and in return, we will grant them amnesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said Speight's wish for a system that will give
indigenous Fijians greater rights than the nation's ethnic Indian
minority ''will be reflected in the constitution.'' He would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has indicated he is willing to hold onto his more than
30 hostages -- including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry,
the first Indian to hold that office -- for as long as it takes to
get his way.
</P>
<P>
   But talks between the two sides have broken down and there was
no sign when they might resume.
</P>
<P>
   Fijian police held a funeral at their barracks in the capital of
Suva on Tuesday for an officer who was the only person killed in
the crisis. Speight supporters shot Filipo Seavula during street
fighting May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama has ruled out the use of force to try to free the
captives. Speight says such a move would lead to the hostages being
executed by his rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The military also hinted Tuesday that it is willing to let the
crisis go on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama urged residents to go about their daily lives with
as much normalcy as possible in Fiji, 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia. He said this can happen even if Speight remains
inside parliament with his gunmen and the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama declared martial law and took charge of Fiji on May
29 after the crisis had dragged on for more than a week. He
disputed Speight's suggestions that the military was hoping to hang
onto power.
</P>
<P>
   ''They keep saying we want to be the government,'' Bainimarama
said. ''That's one of the issues they keep harping about. We don't
want to be the government.''

<HEADLINE> Pistons Replace Sund With Dumars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons have selected Joe
Dumars, a member of the ''Bad Boys'' teams that won NBA
championships in 1989 and 1990, as head of basketball operations,
according to newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dumars will replace Rick Sund, who will become an assistant to
Dumars, The Detroit News said in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons have called a news conference for 4 p.m. Tuesday at
which they are expected to name interim coach George Irvine as
their permanent coach. Dumars' appointment is to be made at the
same time, according to the News and Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Dumars, 37, is getting a four-year deal with the Pistons, the
Free Press said.
</P>
<P>
   The first job for Dumars would be to retain the services of
Grant Hill, who becomes a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like I just started working here,'' Dumars told the
Free Press on Monday. ''Grant and I talk all the time. We have
known each other since his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I haven't developed a relationship with him over the past
six years that can stand on its own merits, then I've been doing
something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Irvine's appointment, Dumars said: ''I know what
people think. Why not a bigger name coach? But a big name coach
only means he did something big someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumars played for the Pistons from 1985-99. He became vice
president for basketball operations in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 5, Phillies 3, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vinny Castilla hit a two-run single off
Jason Boyd with two outs in the 12th inning Monday night, leading
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays over the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd (0-1) walked Randy Winn leading off, Gerald Williams
sacrificed, Mike Difelice grounded out and Fred McGriff was
intentionally walked. After a wild pitch put runners on second and
third, Castilla lined a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie (1-0) pitched two innings of hitless relief, and
Rick White pitched the 12th for his first save. Tampa Bay's bullpen
didn't allow a hit in five innings, and completed a five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Andy Ashby took a one-hitter into the eighth
inning but couldn't hold a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Steve Cox doubled and third baseman Kevin Jordan
threw wildly past first on Winn's ground for an error that allowed
pinch-runner Ozzie Guillen to score.
</P>
<P>
   Winn, who was credited with a single, took third on the error
and scored on Williams' single.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was caught stealing but Jose Guillen reached on an
error by shortstop Desi Relaford, who has four errors in the last
three games and 15 this season. Mark Holzemer allowed a single to
McGriff before Wayne Gomes struck out Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored their first run thanks to some nifty
running by McGriff and Castilla, who were on first and second with
one out. John Flaherty hit a grounder to second baseman Mickey
Morandini, who charged the ball. Castilla stopped before Morandini
could tag him which forced a throw to first. Castilla got into an
extended rundown as McGriff scored.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa starter Cory Lidle struck out a career-high six in seven
innings. All three runs he allowed unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu homered with two outs in the sixth inning after a
throwing error by shortstop Felix Martinez allowed Doug Glanville
to reach and Ron Gant singled.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tampa Bay's Greg Vaughn, who has been hampered with a
strained right hamstring and left Sunday's game early, sat out as a
precaution. ... Ashby's five walks were the most he has given up in
a game this season.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Set To Sign Irvine  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- George Irvine changed his mind. Now
the Detroit Pistons must hope they get lucky with Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are expected to announce Tuesday that Irvine has
signed to coach for the next three years. They were also to
announce the promotion of former star Joe Dumars to head of
basketball operations, The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed interim coach after the Pistons fired Alvin
Gentry in March. The team was 14-10 under Irvine, who was endorsed
by Hill and Jerry Stackhouse, the club's leading scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over from Gentry, Irvine said he wasn't
interested in the head coaching job again. But by the time the
season ended, with a first-round playoff loss, it was apparent
Irvine was reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine agreed to a deal last Friday that could pay him up to
$5.2 million, starting with a $1.5 million salary during the
2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is small change compared with what the Pistons are
prepared to offer Hill, who will become a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with six years experience, the Pistons can offer
Hill the league maximum of $86.6 million. That's based on a
starting salary of $9 million, with annual raises of $1.12 million.
That would give him a salary of $15.7 million in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is making $7.5 million this season, could do even
better by signing a one-year deal with Detroit, then becoming a
free agent again.
</P>
<P>
   Under that scenario, Hill would sign a one-year contract to play
for the Pistons next season at $9 million. Then, in August of 2001,
he could sign a seven-year deal, starting at $11 million, which
would pay him $105.875 million.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Pistons are prepared to pay Hill about $115
million over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pistons can convince Hill to remain in Detroit, it
obviously would make Irvine's job a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old coach came to the Pistons two years ago from the
Indiana Pacers where he worked 16 seasons, primarily as vice
president of basketball operations.
