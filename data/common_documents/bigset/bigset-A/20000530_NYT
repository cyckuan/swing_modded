NOW RICE IS COOKING

<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Ask Glen Rice, and he'll tell you directly: He
wasn't missing for the last few weeks, just underused.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's breakout, 21-point effort Sunday lifted the Lakers to
their Game 4 victory at Portland. And although he had averaged just
12.9 points in the postseason, Rice assured that he's still capable
of a surge like that any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I was already in gear. Anytime you go out there and
you get anywhere from five to eight shots, it's kind of hard to do
the things that you want to do,'' he said Monday. ``But they got me
a little more involved, and I've always said all along that once
I'm involved and moving around a lot more, it's going to help the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to start the third quarter, when coach Phil
Jackson designed a play for Rice to come off two screens a strength
of his game, but not a staple of the Lakers offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thought that came to my mind was, `All right, now I
can do what I do best.' And when I'm able to do that, I'm much,
much better for the team,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly found a rhythm, scoring 12 points in a pivotal
10-minute stretch of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always make a conscious effort to try and get Glen the ball
if he's hot,'' Jackson said. But consistently designing plays for
Rice ``would mean calling sets or calling plays, and we're not
about that as a team. We do it occasionally on timeouts or after
halftimes. Then once Glen got going he was fine. We didn't even
have to go back to specific sets. But it was something that got him
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Rice hadn't hit the 20-point plateau since an
April 14 regular-season game against Sacramento. Averaging 12.9
points in the playoffs wasn't a comfortable feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get down a little bit when you can't go out there
and do the things you know you're capable of doing,'' he said. ``It
makes it much easier when we are winning. ... I realize the games
are long, the series is not over, we got a lot more playoff games,
just realize I gotta be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates have been supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been real tough for him,'' Robert Horry said. ``He goes
from a guy who's a go-to guy to a third option on a team. It kind
of plays mind tricks on you. But Glen's a competitor, he just stays
in there and he goes for what he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspended animation: An NBA suspension meant Brian Shaw had to
watch Sunday's game from his Portland hotel room, and he said it
wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like when you have a kid and they're out playing Pop
Warner football, and they get hit real hard by a big lineman,'' he
said. ``I was kind of flinching at different times when things
weren't going good, and I was jumping up and cheering like I was in
the stands when we got on a good run.''
</P>
<P>
   And when in the closing minutes, he saw his teammates take turns
wearing his No. 20 jersey in tribute?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was touched. It made me feel special,'' he said. ``It made
me feel that my presence was with them, and it was a great feeling.
It got me pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rookie Devean George (sprained left ankle) will be
re-evaluated today but is considered doubtful for tonight's game.

TURNER'S DEATH IS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is a photo hanging on the wall in my
mother's home in Ventura. In it she is standing next to Eric
Turner, who looks proud and strong and distinguished as he drapes
an arm around my mom's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription, written by Turner, reads: ``Mom, thank you for
everything. Love, Eric Turner.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought about that photo when I got word that Turner, the
former UCLA and Oakland Raiders safety, died Sunday of
complications from abdominal cancer at the age of 31.
</P>
<P>
   Eric always considered my mother Sylvia his second mom. She
worked in the Guidance Counselor's Office at Ventura High when he
was a student there from 1984-86, and they formed a special bond
that strengthened over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Eric may never have known, but his friends in Ventura looked at
him likewise. He was, in essence, Ventura's son, our hero and star.
His success was our success, something to be shared and enjoyed
together.
</P>
<P>
   So when he rose from little Ventura to stardom at UCLA, a little
bit of us rose with him. When he moved on to the Cleveland Browns
as the second overall pick in the 1991 NFL draft, was selected to
the Pro Bowl in 1994 then signed with the Oakland Raiders in 1997
as a free agent, part of us was there, too.
</P>
<P>
   What's so wonderful is that Eric never minded the company. He
appreciated the fortunate position he was in and the unique chance
he had to let all his friends share some of the glory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 31, an age when most people are just finding themselves,
Eric is gone, and a little bit of us is, too.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fair, but death never is. It hovers over us, reminding
us again and again that it can quickly snatch away the young and
the old alike. We see it every day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no way to prepare for the times when death
brushes against us in such a personal, powerful way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Eric closed himself off to his friends the last
few months, denying to the very end the seriousness of his
condition. Maybe he wanted to spare us the agony he was going
through, or shield us from the pain of seeing this indestructible
force succumbing to such an unforgiving illness.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been Eric's wish that we remember him as the
6-foot-1-inch, 215-pound package of power, speed and athletic
ability he was. The guy who roamed football fields searching out
running backs and wide receivers to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   And so we will.
</P>
<P>
   Eric's nickname is E-Rock, and as any ballcarrier who had the
misfortune of getting hit by him knows, it was an appropriate name.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember watching Eric, who was a few years younger than
me, play at Ventura High and worry that he might hurt opposing
players. That's how big and fast he was, and how hard he hit.
</P>
<P>
   As physical and intimidating as he was one the field, Eric was a
gentleman off it. I personally appreciate how he looked upon my
mom, surprising her with phone calls and flowers and inviting her
to come see him play when his teams were in town.
</P>
<P>
   He'll never know how wonderful he made her feel when she'd get a
card from him thanking her for always believing in him over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   I will remember how he trusted my father and considered him an
influence. When Eric was struggling with his decision on where to
go to college in 1986, he invited my dad to dinner one night so
they could talk about it. My dad, who died a few years later and
never saw Eric play in the NFL, would brag that he was the reason
Eric went to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   I'll also recall those recent afternoons during the offseason
when I'd see Eric at the gym in Ventura, lifting weights and
playing basketball with the fellas. We'd talk about how his year
went and what lied ahead, the moves his teams were making and the
great football stars he played with and against.
</P>
<P>
   He never minded. But he was always just as interested in what
was happening in our lives and jobs, inquiring about our families
and mutual friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's Eric.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remember how close he was to his mother and stepfather,
Joan and Mark Bailey, and to his older brother, Art Malone Jr., and
younger brother, Derrick.
</P>
<P>
   Art, a terrific athlete who played football at the University of
Washington, was Eric's best friend. I can't even imagine how
difficult the past few months have been on Art and the rest of
Eric's family.
</P>
<P>
   I will remember how devoted Eric was to his 8-year-old son Eric
Jr., attending every youth game he played in around town the last
few years. Eric returned to the West Coast to play for the Raiders
when he was a free agent just so he could be closer to his boy.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Jr., of course, deserves better than this.
</P>
<P>
   We all do.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to put this in perspective, why such a horrible
fate was inflicted on such a young, healthy, giving person. To even
try makes it all the more unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we focus on what Eric stood for and follow the example
he set. The kindness and generosity, the two scholarships he
endowed at Ventura High, the work he did with the Make-a-Wish
Foundation and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   This is what we will remember about Eric Turner, who was taken
from us far too soon, leaving behind memories that will never fade.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hanging on a wall inside Larry Johnson's Westchester
County home, there is a photograph of the Knicks' broad-shouldered
forward with his three children, all standing in a back corridor of
Madison Square Garden. In front of the camera, Johnson is posed
with his forearm in the shape of his ``Big L'' while the little
ones do their best to copy their dad with what amounts to three
lowercase ``L's''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess that was taken about a year ago,'' Johnson said on
Monday night after the Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers, 91-89,
in Game 4. ``Just after that 4-point play.''
</P>
<P>
   On that night, Johnson punctured the spirits of the Pacers with
a play that became one of the signature moments during an
improbable run to the finals for the Knicks. On Monday night, when
the Knicks' 17-point halftime lead had been sliced down to a
precarious 1 point, Johnson took his place on the far sideline and
waited for a chance to undo Indiana again.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby grabbed a rebound and whipped the ball to Johnson,
who sent a 3-pointer arching off his fingertips and splashing down
into the net with 6 minutes 22 seconds remaining in Game 4 of the
Eastern Conference finals. Two minutes later, he escaped the
attention of the Pacers one more time and delivered another three
to the delight of a Garden crowd in the middle of a flashback.
</P>
<P>
   It was last year revisited. It was Johnson at his 3-point best,
hitting 5 of 5 3-pointers, anchoring an offense without Patrick
Ewing and coming up with 25 points to give the Knicks a remarkable
victory to even the four-of-seven-game series at two games apiece.
Game 5 will be played in Indiana on Wednesday night at Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They was creeping back into it, got it back to 1 point,''
Johnson said. ``That was a big three. That one was a momentum
changer.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, every ache and pain the Knicks were feeling went
numb for a team that used adrenaline as a wonder drug. Only Ewing,
unable to play with the pain from tendinitis in his sprained right
foot, was unable to play in Game 4. Latrell Sprewell danced around
on a bad foot, Camby leaped on a sore knee and Johnson hung out on
the wing unencumbered by a chronically sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised that they gave full effort,'' Coach Jeff
Van Gundy said of his banged up team. ``I don't think there is any
question about if they were able to play, how hard they'd play. It
was about how effective they could be, how long they could play,
and they did a great, great job.''
</P>
<P>
   They simply ignored the pain. Sprewell had trouble getting the
lift he normally does and was a little slow in tracking Jalen Rose
(18 points) in the second half, but he had 12 points and drew
double teams each time he slashed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to try and suck it up and do what I could,''
Sprewell said. ``I felt like I couldn't explode like I normally do,
but I was just trying not to think about it. It's the playoffs, no
way I wasn't going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a temporary burst of excitement during pregame
warm-ups when Ewing trotted through the tunnel as the last man out
and bounded onto the court. But after a couple of layups, plus a
spin move on the sideline, Ewing went back to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in too much pain, I couldn't cut, I would have been a
liability,'' Ewing said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would play in Game 5, Ewing said: ``It feels a
lot better today than it did yesterday and the day before, so I'm
hoping that by Wednesday it will be fine and I'm able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a small lineup, the Knicks out-rebounded the Pacers,
41-32. And the Knicks found high percentage shots by pushing the
ball on the break and finishing with layups. They shot 49 percent
while the Pacers hit 45.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the ubiquitous Charlie Ward (16 points, 7 assists, 6
rebounds) was the choreographer. In transition, he directed guys in
place as he fired passes through keyholes to Thomas and Johnson for
layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie is really playing his heart out,'' Johnson said.
``There's always been this back-and-forth with the fans on how they
want a different point guard. But they love him now. It's nice to
see that, really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Penetrating, running and slashing through the lane, Ward had the
Pacers panting at the action. By halftime, the Knicks held a
shocking 57-40 lead after Ward put up 10 points, 5 assists and 5
rebounds. Johnson had 12 points, as did Thomas, who exceeded his
playoff career high of 11 points in 19 minutes of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers came out much more assertive in the third
quarter. They got the ball to Rik Smits, Rose came alive and
challenged Sprewell's mobility, and Reggie Miller submerged his ego
and let his teammates have their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our usual start,'' Coach Larry Bird said. ``We didn't
play any defense in the first quarter. They were hitting shots,
just ripping us apart. We gave them too many offensive rebounds and
every one of them killed us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this series was going to be tough. They were coming
out of Miami after seven grueling games. Maybe they had to catch
their breath. We know they are not going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers showed some resiliency, too. The Knicks were sloppy
at the start of the third quarter with two straight turnovers. With
a quick 12-5 run, the Pacers cut the Knicks' lead to 10 points.
With a 73-65 lead by the Knicks entering the fourth, Miller (24
points) started to shake free of Allan Houston (17 points). Getting
open in transition off a turnover by Johnson, Miller punctuated a
6-0 run with a 3-pointer to close the Pacers to within 1, at 77-76.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like us in Game 1,'' Sprewell said. ``They expended a lot
energy to get back into the game and make up that 17-point lead we
had. But then I'm not sure how much they had left. Larry stepped up
huge for us. He hit those big threes and really gave us some
breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there was drama at the end. After the Pacers pulled to
within 3, at 90-87, with 6.4 seconds remaining, Sprewell missed two
free throws with 4.1 seconds on the clock. But on the second miss,
Rose was called for a lane violation. On the third try, Sprewell
connected and gave the Knicks an impenetrable 4-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to hit that one,'' Sprewell said. ``I had a second
chance. I relaxed, took a breath and hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers didn't have a 4-point play in their bag. They could
not unearth the kind of miracle Johnson came up with a year ago. &QL;

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a joke going around the Big Apple that if the
Knicks lose a few more players to injury, they're a lock to win the
NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   The more adversity they face, the better the Knicks seem to
play. And things could scarcely have been worse for the Knicks
entering Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing was again out with a sore foot. Marcus Camby was
hobbled with a gimpy knee. Then it was discovered that Latrell
Sprewell had a broken bone in his left foot, just the latest in a
string of cosmic jokes being played on the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out the joke was on the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we should say the choke was on the Pacers after the
Knicks walked off the floor Monday with a stunning 91-89 victory
Sunday before 19,763 true believers at Madison Square Garden, a win
that evened the best-of-seven series 2-2 entering Wednesday's game
at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake, true believers are the only ones who would
have bothered showing up considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers obviously didn't believe the Knicks had a chance,
because they didn't bother to show up. Until it was too late, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing missed his second straight game with acute
tendinitis in his right foot, Sprewell _ true to his word _ played,
as did Camby.
</P>
<P>
   For Sprewell, it was a performance that even his harshest
critics will have to admit was gutsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to try and suck it up and give us what I could,''
said Sprewell, who wound up scoring 12 points in 44 minutes despite
the broken bone. ``I feel like I can't explode the way I normally
like to. I didn't feel comfortable out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who looked supremely comfortable was Larry Johnson,
who carpet-bombed the Pacers with a game-high 25 points. Johnson
hit 10 of 16 shots, including all five of his 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I was so open for those 3-pointers,'' said
Johnson, who added seven rebounds and four assists. ``I need a
little time to get that thing off, and if somebody's there, it's
going to bother my shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's most crucial 3-pointer came with 6:24 remaining in the
game, right after Reggie Miller hit a 3 to cut the Knicks' lead to
one point. But after Kurt Thomas missed a layup, Camby grabbed the
loose ball and hit Johnson for another 3-pointer _ one that not
only bumped the Knicks' lead back up to 80-76 but seemed to deflate
the Pacers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was probably the biggest basket of the game,''
said Miller, who finished with a team-high 24 points. ``He hit some
big shots tonight to really carry that team, especially with Allan
(Houston) and Latrell struggling a little bit. He was their go-to
guy, and he hit some big shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fought our way back into the ballgame, cutting it (the
Knicks' lead) to one (point), and the momentum was kind of changing
a little bit. If he had missed that shot, it probably comes off
long and we get a fast break. But, as you know, he knocked it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   He knocked a lot of them down, as did the rest of the Knicks,
who wound up shooting just a tick under 50 percent for the game
(35-of-71), and over 71 percent on their 3-point attempts
(10-of-14). Houston scored 17 points, Charlie Ward had 16 points
and seven assists, and Thomas came off the bench to throw in 16
points for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were manhandled in the first half, falling behind by
14 points at the end of the first period and by 17 at halftime. And
while Indiana made a run in the second half, the Knicks had a
counterpunch for every late jab the Pacers threw at them late in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play defense in the first quarter,'' said Indiana
coach Larry Bird, obviously frustrated by his team's performance.
``They were hitting shots and just ripping us apart. In the second
half we decided to defend, but we forgot to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pacers were able to rally, scoring seven straight
points in a span of 1:06 to pull to within 90-87 with 6.4 seconds
left. But the Pacers' next mistake was their last _ and most
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best had just hit a jumper that the referees mistakenly
counted as a 3-pointer even though his foot was clearly on the
line, pulling the Pacers to within three points. The Knicks
inbounded the ball to Sprewell, who was fouled with 4.1 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell missed his first foul shot, giving the Pacers a glimmer
of hope. But as he drew the ball up for the second shot, Jalen
Rose, anticipating a miss and hoping for the rebound, leaped into
the lane to block Sprewell out. Sure enough, the ball skipped off
the rim and Indiana's Dale Davis ripped down the rebound and
signaled for a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   But the referees whistled Rose for an obvious lane violation,
giving Sprewell yet another shot, which he made, giving the Knicks
a four-point cushion and putting the game out of reach.

U.S. AND ALLIES WARN PERU ABOUT ELECTION RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its allies issued stern
warnings to Peru on Monday, saying that the re-election of
President Alberto K. Fujimori without opposition risked serious
harm to Peru's standing in the international community.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
prepared for consultations with their counterparts in Europe and
the Americas, U.S. officials called the handling of the election
undemocratic and its result illegitimate. The election was
boycotted by the opposition and was carried out despite objections
from the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official called the handling of the voting
``a serious threat to the inter-American system and its commitment
to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, the official said that ``no president
emerging from such a flawed process can claim legitimacy'' and that
``we do not see the election as being valid.'' But later, the
official said in an interview that the comments were intended as
``guidance'' rather than as a formal statement of U.S. policy. The
official spoke on condition of not being identified. Richard
Boucher, the department's top spokesman, was traveling with
Albright to a meeting in Europe and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton said he regretted Peru's insistence on not
delaying the election and added that ``we are consulting with our
partners in the hemisphere and the international community to
determine appropriate next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The first opportunity for consultations comes in Portugal, where
European leaders are meeting this week. Clinton is leading the U.S.
delegation before going on to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   European nations joined in the criticism on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Anne Gazeau-Secret,
said that ``conditions under which the balloting was held were not
satisfactory.'' In Spain, Foreign Minister Josep Pique said there
had been ``no guarantees of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States is to meet in Canada on
Wednesday to hear a report from election observers, who backed out
after Fujimori's government refused to delay the election.
</P>
<P>
   The election, which brought him his third term, was criticized
for numerous irregularities including state support for his
campaign and questions about the computerized system for counting
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said on Monday that the date of the election could not
be legally changed, and defended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a result of an election which is just, fair,
transparent,'' he said on the CNN program ``Worldview.'' ``And
unfortunately we couldn't have these international observers as we
wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Peru's foreign minister would attend the meeting of
American states in Canada to defend the election process.

PIPPEN CAN'T CONVINCE CRITICS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A small-time player in the basketball shoe
business hooked up with the third pick in the 1984 NBA draft and
everybody snickered, the way everybody did recently when Angelina
Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton got hitched.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's laughing now, of course, about the union of Nike and
Michael Jordan. Consummated in the Oregon burgh of Beaverton in
1984, it would go on to become the model of all marriages between
an athlete and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Jordan became one of the most recognizable
athletes on the planet even before he established himself as one of
the all-time best and Nike's swoosh was branded into the sports
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was so big on Madison Avenue, it was really onerous for
anybody else affiliated with the Chicago Bulls to reap much
recognition beyond Madison Street, where the Bulls' home arena
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Scottie Pippen, who ripened into a superstar while
everybody was riveted on Jordan. He developed into one of the
game's most dogged defenders and became a chameleon on offense,
adapting his skills to give the Bulls whatever look they needed to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's highest scoring average in his 11 years with the Bulls
was 22.0 points in 1993-94, the year Jordan ditched basketball for
baseball. His collaboration with Jordan resulted in six NBA
championship rings but there never seemed any question in the
public's eye whose legacy the Bulls' dynasty secured:
</P>
<P>
   It was Michael Jordan's production, everybody else was just
props.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen yearned to direct his own perfect ending, longed to step
out from Jordan's enormous shadow. After a trying season in
Houston, providence delivered Pippen to Portland. (Providence
appeared to have a keen eye for irony, sending Pippen to a region
that has Jordan's, uh, footprints all over it.)
</P>
<P>
   But Rasheed Wallace was there and Damon Stoudamire and Brian
Grant and Arvydas Sabonis. It was a supporting cast in search of a
star, and Pippen perfectly fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is that Pippen's world validation tour had to stop in
L.A. on its way to the NBA Finals. Because the ongoing Western
Conference finals between the Trail Blazers and the Lakers feature
more than one ex-Bull with assumptions to grind.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers last summer brought in an entire coaching staff that
was highly motivated to prove the triangle offense could shine
without Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pippen, coach Phil Jackson has six NBA rings and an ego
healthy enough to try to defy the notion that he owes all of his
success to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Tex Winter, the architect of the triangle offense and
Jackson's longtime assistant in Chicago, whose rightful place in
the basketball Hall of Fame has been denied him because it's so
hard for some people to see where Jordan's influence on the
triangle ended and Winter's began.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to dust for fingerprints to find evidence of
Jackson's and Winter's impact on this year's Lakers, who are 77-19
(10-4 in the postseason). The proof is in Shaquille O'Neal's pretty
passes and shuddering shot-blocking.
</P>
<P>
   It's in Kobe Bryant's reeled-in offense and relentless defense.
It's in the team's spacing on the floor, its serenity in the final
minutes of close games and its solidarity (witness O'Neal and Derek
Fisher donning Brian Shaw jerseys toward the end of Sunday's game,
which the Laker reserve sat out because of a league-imposed
suspension).
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has taken a parental interest in seeing O'Neal and
Bryant grow up, and with his prodding they have matured faster than
even Jackson could have foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   They've carried the Lakers to within one victory of a berth in
the NBA Finals by sinking last-second shots, staging second-half
revivals and making their teammates around them better.
</P>
<P>
   Their success reflects well on Jackson. His contribution to the
Bulls' dynasty will be upgraded, in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers' failings against the Lakers, meantime, aren't
likely to change the opinions of those who've wondered all along
whether Pippen possesses the leadership qualities to will a team to
wins as Jordan did.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers have a slew of weapons, but they find
themselves down for the count _ a loss tonight and the Lakers win
by TKO _ because they've had no answer for the Lakers' one-two
punch of O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, the Trail Blazers were able to counter-attack nicely,
with Wallace collecting 29 points and Pippen contributing 11
rebounds, three assists and 21 points in a 106-77 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, Pippen had 12 points, nine rebounds and six assists
but Wallace and Sabonis contributed just two points apiece in the
fourth quarter, and the Trail Blazers lost by two points.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace collected 34 points and 13 rebounds in Game 4, but
Pippen, perhaps exhausted from trying to guard every Laker at once,
petered out at the end of the Trail Blazers' 103-91 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen missed all three shots he tried over the final 12 minutes
and appeared to spend what little energy he had left jawing at
Jackson on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, his breath would have been better spent rallying his
troops.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying Pippen isn't a great player. We're not
questioning his competitiveness. We're simply wondering whether
this series isn't confirming what some people suspected all along:
that Pippen makes a better consort than captain.

BLAZERS NOT READY TO GIVE UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're circling the wagons, talking brave and
preparing for a long series.
</P>
<P>
   They're also getting testy, crying about the officials and
blowing off the media.
</P>
<P>
   When you're down three games to one like the Trail Blazers,
there is no single approach. There might be no life preserver,
either, but that doesn't mean you don't look for one.
</P>
<P>
   What the Blazers and everyone else can agree upon is, if they
lose tonight's Game 5 of the Western Conference finals to the
Lakers, that's a wrap.
</P>
<P>
   If few right-thinking people can imagine Portland defeating the
Lakers three consecutive times, the Blazers are still claiming all
things are possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people, the way we've played, who
feel that we can still do it,'' Blazers guard Steve Smith said. ``I
don't think it's been a lopsided series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's 3-1, but look at each game. We've pretty much
dominated the first half, and they've played well the second half.
But we dominated Game 2, so people know we're capable of beating
them. I don't think it's `shock the world.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get this one, we go back to Portland. I don't feel we'll
lose three games in a row in Portland. So we're thinking we can
make it back here.''
</P>
<P>
   They have, of course, lost two consecutive at home to the
Lakers, which left them with their precarious hold to their season.
</P>
<P>
   But they take hope in knowing they defeated the Lakers at
Staples Center during the regular season and blew them out 106-77
here in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for us is, we're not in uncharted territory for
ourselves,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``We've been here in
tough times during the year and come up with big wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the focus from our standpoint is, we have to be more
aggressive. We have to take the ball to them and see if we can get
the referees to call any fouls on Shaq (O'Neal). There were three
times in (Sunday's) game where they don't call any fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he's not Wilt Chamberlain yet. You can foul him out of
a game between now and when he retires.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy also complained O'Neal was frequently guilty of hanging
around the paint defensively, but officials failed to call illegal
defense.
</P>
<P>
   At least Smith and Dunleavy were talking. After the Blazers flew
Monday morning from Portland, they bussed directly to Staples for
an afternoon media session and workout.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace, who played all 48 minutes on a sprained ankle
Sunday, refused to talk to the media. Scottie Pippen, the man
Lakers coach Phil Jackson put the onus on for the Blazers' series
hopes, spoke but briefly before walking off miffed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was frustrated by Portland's situation, Pippen
said: ``Me? Nah, I'm fine. Trust me, I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Blazers started each game so well in Portland,
only to fizzle, he said: ``I don't know. You watch the game a lot
more than I do, so I'm going to let you answer that. That's it. I'm
done for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, everyone had their head up. The Blazers all know it's
getting late in the game for any magical answers. Dunleavy said he
didn't expect to come up with any special strategy now.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are just counting on sneaking one away tonight, and
then figuring anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll have an attitude of desperation in a positive
way,'' forward Brian Grant said. ``This is it. Let's give
everything we've got, or go home. I think we'll come out ready to
play.''

TEACHER'S SEEN IT ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eleanor Bralver is Sylmar High School's hedge
against sexually transmitted diseases, gang violence and teen
pregnancy. The ninth-grade health teacher is a focus of school
spirit, leading the ``Spartan Spellout'' at football games.
</P>
<P>
   And when her union needs her support, Bralver can be found
downtown, chanting and marching shoulder to shoulder with her
United Teachers Los Angeles comrades.
</P>
<P>
   There might be only one thing Bralver isn't gung-ho about:
</P>
<P>
   Retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly the nation's oldest working teacher, the 86-year-old
Bralver plans to work until she's 90.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Thursday morning, she was working just as she has
since 1967 at Sylmar, northwest of downtown Los Angeles, teaching
her young charges about avoiding the primary pitfalls of their
young lives.
</P>
<P>
   There's sex and its consequences, such as AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases. There's drugs. There's gangs.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a 4-foot-11-inch grandmother standing in front of
them, wearing a blue denim vest and pants and wire-rimmed glasses,
telling them she knows the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not ready to have sex yet,'' she told her class.
``There are too many risks.''
</P>
<P>
   And in case they're not worried about acquiring a fatal illness,
she's supplied them with a handout one of perhaps 1,000 she gives
out for the year on what the schedule of the average teen mother is
like, colicky baby and all.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the attendant risks of childbirth. Hammering
home one example after another, Bralver explains dozens of possible
birth defects, risk factors for those defects and the pain of
giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   To drive the point home, a bulletin board has tabloid newspaper
clippings, one in Spanish about a ``monster baby'' next to a large,
grotesque photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had probably more energy than most of the people on
campus,'' said Principal Linda Calvo. ``She's genuinely interested
and concerned about students, and she genuinely loves teaching. I
think she derives her energy and her focus from that. It's her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also a popular figure at football games, where she leads
the fans in the ``S-P-A-R-T-A-N-S'' cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as she walks up to the podium'' in her white slacks
and blue Spartans sweat shirt, Calvo explains, ``the fans start to
cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bralver was a grade-school student in the 1920s, students
still dipped their pens in inkwells and the principal marked the
end of periods by ringing a hand-bell.
</P>
<P>
   When she began teaching physical education in 1935, in the
middle of the Great Depression, ``kids were much more respectful of
teachers,'' Bralver said. ``The kids dressed decently and you
didn't find gum on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bralver got married, raised two sons and 22 years later
time-warped into the modern era of education.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior was lacking, but the teacher adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a tough teacher with love,'' she said. ``I
will not talk when they are talking.''
</P>
<P>
   When students misbehave or show a lack of respect, however,
``they will get their comeuppance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a fun teacher and she encourages us to learn,'' said
sophomore Sulma Sandoval, 16. ``She's pretty old but she's
interesting she laughs and makes jokes about things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Bralver prizes most about her decades of
experience is her look into what makes teens tick.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Simon and Schuster published her book, ``Teenagers
Inside Out,'' a collection of her students' papers that gave
insight into the values and opinions of youth, she said. ``You have
to love what you do,'' Bralver said earnestly. ``With me, it's a
passion.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal seemed almost to have grown bored
with toying with supposed rival Portland. The Los Angeles center
was looking for other challenges, something to excite him as this
series had in its season-long buildup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the anticipation that led to the Western Conference
finals meeting of the Lakers and Trail Blazers, only one team has
shown any real growth since last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers did surprise the Lakers with a 29-point win in
Los Angeles. But the Lakers' weekend sweep in Portland turned that
bad night into a fluke, an aberration of a trick defense and the
Lakers' temporary inability to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   Since that night eight days ago, the Blazers have looked every
bit as fragile as they were last spring, when the Spurs used a
miracle trey to send them reeling toward another two-game Rose
Garden collapse in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, O'Neal decided, now needed to test themselves
against something greater, something tougher than the Trail Blazers
and their still-delicate psyches. So he called out natural science.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hot,'' O'Neal said, dismissing the Blazers' fast
starts and looking elsewhere for a rival. ``Nothing stays hot
forever. Look out there at the sun. Nothing stays hot forever. It's
not hot today.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the universe's first rapping, dunking and now even
free-throw-shooting eclipse in size-22 high-tops, decided the
Lakers had evolved beyond the reach of the Blazers and their
arrested development.
</P>
<P>
   This day, the NBA knew, could eventually come. The Lakers, it
seems, have grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Harper
</P>
<P>
   ``We have matured some, I think,'' said Ron Harper, a veteran of
14 NBA seasons and three titles with the Bulls. ``We came in at
halftime, and I felt guys were very calm and confident. So I
believe we came a ways. We were very calm in the fourth quarter. We
feel good. We still have some things we can do. But we know what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Lakers were also swept out of the playoffs by
the Spurs. Like the Blazers then and now, when tough times hit,
they crumbled. The confidence they put on display proved a false
bravado, too brittle to withstand a worthy competitor.
</P>
<P>
   They still have not been tested by actually falling behind in a
series, but the Lakers have struggled at times. They lost three
games in the first two series, clinching both with home routs.
Against Portland, they faced double-digit first-half deficits in
perhaps the most hostile and ear-splitting of road venues.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike past seasons, they never cracked, seeming to almost
relish a chance to exercise their new poise and composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Lakers _ from last year or two or three years ago _
they might have panicked,'' Lakers veteran center John Salley said.
``This team now, no.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking their impressive, series-changing win in Game 3 on
Friday, the Lakers seemed primed for one of their familiar,
immature letdowns. Under similar circumstances in the series
against the Suns, they barely showed up at the arena, and then it
seemed only to trade tales of the previous evening's revelry.
Lakers coach Phil Jackson lamented before that game, ``We're just
not a mature team.'' The Lakers were routed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, with the home-court advantage already reclaimed, they
took the Blazers' best shot, calmly got back up and rolled to a
decisive win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it builds character,'' Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said.
``It builds toughness and togetherness. We hung in there together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like playoff basketball at its finest. There was a lot
of trash-talking going on. It was physical _ guys throwing balls at
one another, throwing elbows at one another. That's fine. That
forces us to step up as basketball players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' weekend in Portland might have shown the maturation
many have predicted and perhaps even feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing stronger game to game,'' Bryant said. ``Every
tough game, every adverse situation we put ourselves in makes us
stronger. I'm learning how to play every game I'm in. This is the
deepest in the playoffs I've ever been. This is new territory for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about challenges in this game. If this game did not
present any kind of a challenge, I would not play it. It makes it
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is not a sudden discovery for the Lakers. But it
seems more genuine now and far less fleeting under pressure. These
might only be steps in that direction. But they have been
unflappable under the pressure of the road and the Blazers' fast
starts, executing their game plan coolly and making the decisive
plays down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in that situation before,'' O'Neal said. ``A couple
times, we went to a couple arenas, we messed around, and teams were
up by 14. We had to say, `All right, let's go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to beat us. Everybody's always pumped up to
play us. They always play their `A' game. No team has beat us. We
always beat ourselves. No team has dominated us. They might hit a
couple 3s or might get a couple calls or score off turnovers. No
team has beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they (the Blazers) beat us by 29, they didn't beat
us. We beat ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a collapse seems impossible now. And as troublesome as that
development has been for the Trail Blazers, it could be as
distressing for the rest of the league. If the Lakers will not beat
themselves, there might not be anyone left who can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we found our rhythm,'' Bryant said. ``And once we're
able to figure out a team, and where their heart is, we feel like
we can take it right from them.''
</P>

<P>
   DENVER _ A cloud of predictability hovered above the Astros' 8-7
loss to the Colorado Rockies on Monday, and there was no silver
lining in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel was on the mound, which almost certainly meant the
bullpen would play a key role in the outcome. Considering the
unreliability of the Astros' bullpen this season, that in itself
was somewhat predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros blew a two-run lead over the final two innings to
lose for the 14th time in 16 one-run games. They have lost 10 of
their last 14 games and 12 of their last 15 on the road, including
the past seven in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Want more predictability? The Astros have an all-time record of
9-25 in Denver, where they seem to find a way to lose more times
than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been difficult here,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to winning at Coors Field is to keep putting
runs on the scoreboard, which the Astros were unable to do. Each
team scored four runs through the first three innings, but while
the Rockies kept scoring, the Astros' offense hibernated. The
Astros scored just one more run after leading 6-4 through four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of zeros on the board late in the game, and they
kept putting up numbers,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' bullpen had something to do with the Astros' sudden
run stoppage. After Rockies starter Pedro Astacio left the game
with two out in the sixth, the Astros managed just three hits and
struck out six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't walk guys, and they made good pitches,'' Astros
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said of the Rockies' relievers. ``They
came right at us.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the Astros' bullpen, which allowed three runs
on five hits over the final 2 innings. The decisive blow was Todd
Helton's eighth-inning solo homer off Jose Cabrera. It was the
second homer of the game for Helton, who is hitting .417 with 17
homers and 49 RBIs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' Bagwell said of his Rockies counterpart.
``He's been doing it all year. He's been the best first baseman in
the game this year. It's tough to defend those balls that go over
the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker wasn't pleased with the way his pitchers approached
Helton, particularly considering Larry Walker is on the disabled
list, and Helton's lineup protection consisted of Darren Bragg and
Jeffrey Hammonds, who have a cumulative batting average of .280,
compared to Walker's .347.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a weakness in Helton's game, Dierker said:
``He's not very fast. You can walk him. You're better off to walk
him. There's no one behind him. The whole idea was not to throw him
any strikes. We threw it right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel's season has consisted of one no-decision after another,
and that trend is likely to continue until he doesn't run his pitch
counts so high so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel needed 111 pitches to get through 5 innings, and he has
pitched more than six innings just once in his 10 starts. Monday
was his sixth no-decision of the season and his fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is when he pitches,'' Dierker said. ``He
runs high pitch counts, and it's tough because you have to use up
the bullpen every time he pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the option of facing the Astros at home or on the road,
it's safe to assume Astacio wouldn't pick Coors Field. After
allowing seven runs in 5 innings Monday, Astacio has an 11.81 ERA
against the Astros at Coors.
</P>
<P>
   But in three road starts against the Astros since joining the
Rockies in 1997, Astacio has a 2.59 ERA, bolstered by a three-hit,
one-run complete game at Enron Field three weeks ago. He hardly
looked like the same guy Monday, allowing nine hits (two homers)
and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen very often against Pedro,'' Bagwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put the leadoff runner on base in each of the first
three innings, leading to one run in the first and three in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado also scored four runs through the first three innings,
starting in the second with the first of Helton's solo home runs.
Catcher Brent Mayne also drove in a run in the second, and two more
in the third with the second of his three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's two-run homer to straightaway center field broke the
tie in the fourth, and Ken Caminiti's sixth-inning solo shot
provided a three-run cushion for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel issued a leadoff walk to Curtis Goodwin in the sixth,
signaling the beginning of the end for the Astros righthander,
whose day was over after he walked Jeff Cirillo to give the Rockies
two on with one out. Dotel walked six batters, all in his final 3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin scored on Hammonds' pinch-hit single off Joe Slusarski
to cut the Astros' lead to 7-5. The run was charged to Dotel, as
Slusarski extended his scoreless-innings streak to 6. Goodwin drove
in a run in the seventh inning, during which the Rockies tied the
score on Mike Lansing's RBI single off Cabrera.

LOS ANGELES _ Defeat can wear many faces, and the once-confident
Trail Blazers were a runway full of supermodels all decked out in
those silliest of get-ups that normal people wouldn't wear to a
cockfight.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen was dourly dashing while bemoaning the fact the
referees would not let him play his game. Rasheed Wallace wore a
snazzy sneer and defiant tone. Brian Grant, dreadlocks sagging like
his spirit, was trying to convince himself that it's still not
over, mon.
</P>
<P>
   But it is, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   That much was written all over the face of team owner Paul
Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp., as he left his baseline seat
with equally depressed buddy Bill Gates, king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Poor little rich boys.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the highest payroll in the NBA _
$73.9 million _ has not been enough to get the Blazers a single win
on their own court in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Garden was turned into a house of thorns once again for
the home team.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago it was David Robinson, Tim Duncan and the Spurs who
rolled over Portland on their way to a championship. This time it
was Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers who dropped the
hammer and left the Blazers befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a rowdy, ear-splitting, ``Beat LA!'' crowd Friday
night shuffled out in silence when Ron Harper hit the
difference-making jumper and Bryant blocked the last-ditch prayer
by Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   What had been hopeful nervousness and a glimmer of life Sunday
became muttering discontent when the Lakers put their arms on the
Blazers' windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called jackals who were whooping it up in a pack a week
ago after an upset win at the Staples Center now give the plaintive
wail of a lone coyote as they try to make everyone believe they can
do it again.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen, of course, this coming back from the near-dead
out of a 3-1 hole. We know this better than most in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It is a spark that can become a flame. Then the flame grows into
a roaring conflagration, and there is no firefighting team on the
planet that can put it out.
</P>
<P>
   But that spark must come from a leader, and that's what the
Blazers _ for all their moneyed pedigree _ are still without.
</P>
<P>
   They are a company with a dozen vice presidents and no CEO to
provide direction. They are a stable full of solid, hard-working
horses you can hitch to the plow, but there's not a single
Secretariat who can outrace everyone else to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Clyde Drexler left town, the Blazers have been
perspiration with no inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   For years now we have heard about the great depth of Portland's
roster, as if the game depended on how many players you can use
rather than how many players can use their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Dunleavy's rotation that regularly employs 10, 11,
even 12 men has been trumpeted as a strength, when in fact it is a
way to cover up a weakness. It is a cheap parlor trick that may
enable the Blazers to stay fresh and pile up wins during the long
regular season. But the 10th man on your bench does not win you a
title.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the playoffs, the game is all about stars,
about big-time players making big-time plays. And in that regard,
the Blazers' cupboard is bare.
</P>
<P>
   The big-time players in this series are all wearing the purple
and gold of the Lakers. From Shaq and Kobe to the veteran of the
Bulls' dynasty Harper to Glen Rice, who celebrated his 33rd
birthday by exploding in the third quarter of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   To whom can the Blazers turn for any of that leadership in the
clutch?
</P>
<P>
   Surely not to Pippen, the ultimate character actor who could
never cut it as a marquee attraction. Every time Scottie tries to
pump himself up into the role, he only weighs himself down, which
is why Phil Jackson opened the series by playing mind games with
Pippen. On Sunday he scored just one basket in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has the talent to put his name up in lights. But his
always-on-the-brink-of-implosion demeanor in the heat of battle
makes him a character whom others are reluctant to follow. A leader
must always be cool, not on the verge of having a mental meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith is too mild-mannered. Arvydas Sabonis is too
lumbering. Damon Stoudamire is too inconsistent. Grant is too much
like the scenery. Bonzi Wells is too Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   All of which brings the Blazers back to the brink, with too much
and too little.
</P>
<P>
   Poor little rich boys.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN the Comets arrived at Compaq Center on Monday afternoon, they
wore their here-and-now game faces. Coach Van Chancellor swears
nobody in his locker room was giving an iota of thought to their
prospects of four-peating as WNBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about one thing,'' Chancellor said, ``nothing
else: Can we beat the New York Liberty in our first game?''
</P>
<P>
   But before they could play this season opener, there was some
unfinished business to address. The Comets had to receive their
three-peat rings from last summer, the sparkling, bejeweled symbols
of a grand triumph over real adversity, the life-and-death variety.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony would, of course, include a poignant memorial to
their fallen teammate, point guard Kim Perrot, who lost a gallant
battle with cancer shortly before the 1999 playoffs began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed it on the program,'' Chancellor said of the tribute
to Perrot, ``but it didn't really hit me until I walked out there.
The first person I saw was Kim's sister, and then her mother came
over and gave me a big hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Van cried unashamedly, as did Cynthia Cooper, Perrot's closest
friend. Chancellor admitted he was ``emotionally drained'' by
tipoff, and the Comets gave every indication they had misplaced
their hard edge, too.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes, the Comets had missed 14 of 16 shots, incurred
six turnovers and pretty much let the New York Liberty dictate the
tempo, although the visitors' own erratic shooting kept the score
from getting out of hand. The Liberty never led by more than six.
</P>
<P>
   Then slowly, inevitably, the Comets got their groove back.
Cooper finally made a jumper drop after four bricks in a row, then
added two free throws and fed Tina Thompson with as slick a
needle-threading pass as you'll witness.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the only champions the WNBA has known were off on a
rip-roaring 13-2 run, doing all the little things _ plus the big
ones _ that will give them every opportunity to claim that fourth
ring. They collectively took a deep breath, coach included.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure when you've won three in a row,''
Chancellor argued later. ``Now, if I'd lost three in a row, I'd be
a nervous wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, tough enough to have dragged the Comets into a
do-or-die showdown in last year's best-of-three Finals, would have
one tension-building second-half run left in them, trimming a
16-point margin to six with 7{ minutes to go. But the Comets'
wherewithal advantage with the outcome suddenly up for grabs made
sure the New Yorkers' last gasp went for naught. The Comets pulled
away for an 84-68 victory.
</P>
<P>
   So they're 4-for-4 in openers, the best possible way to head
toward being 4-for-4 in titles. Nobody knows how to win like they
do. In the WNBA, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a team, men or women, boys or girls, pro or
college, rise to the occasion like we do, when we absolutely have
to,'' Chancellor said. ``And I've never seen one play better
defense than we do, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The C's ``D'' was more imperfect than normal Monday, but they
picked their spots to make their stops, depriving the Liberty of
field goals on seven consecutive possessions after the Comets' lead
had shrunk to 66-60. And although New York is loaded with offensive
threats, none went off for more than the 15 points by Tamika
Whitmore, whose safe-like shape belies her delicate touch.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes, ever the WNBA's most lethal one-two
punch, combined for 46 points in turn, serving to remind the
sellout crowd and national TV audience what makes the Comets such
heavenly bodies. The opposition has yet to figure out a way to
stymie either effectively, never mind both at once.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, with 19 points, surpassed 2,000 for her career, a WNBA
first, and Swoopes, eight years her junior, showed why she'll
probably end up with way more than Coop when all is said and won,
scoring 27. Chancellor may have lost a small piece of himself when
Perrot passed away, but he's quick to remind us he's very blessed
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the 78th birthday of his father, Winston. The
occasion prompted Van to mention the phone call he made to Dad when
he first visited Houston to interview with the Comets. Chancellor
pere warned Chancellor fils he'd be ``the dumbest man in
Mississippi if I accepted the job and walked away from all my
friends.'' After Van's meeting with owner Leslie Alexander,
however, they conversed again, and the subject of salary came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad asked me how much money we _ we _ would be turning down,''
Van recalls. ``When I told him it was about twice what I was
getting at Ole Miss, he said, `Boy, with your personality, you can
make a lot of new friends in Houston, Texas.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he has. We do love a winner.

   PALESTINIANS-CAMPS Ain el Hilwe Camp, Lebanon) _ For the
300,000 Palestinians who have lived for half a century in squalid,
supposedly makeshift refugee camps in Lebanon, the Israeli troop
withdrawal last week proved a bittersweet experience. For them, the
moment was distinctly powerful: From the newly opened border area,
they could gaze on the hills of what they consider their land. For
an entire generation of Palestinians in Lebanon, it was the very
first glimpse, and suddenly, painfully, they felt both closer and
farther away than ever. By Deborah Sontag.

bounty ever in Japan, which is struggling to reduce record-low

   PERU-POLITICS (Lima, Peru) _ Analysis: The students have been

Minutes later, the first stones were thrown in a weekend of street
violence that left six French soldiers and one U.N. police officer
injured, several buildings burned and dozens of foreign cars
damaged. It is the nature of Mitrovica, the last town in Kosovo
with a significant presence of Serbs, to explode without warning.

   WEST-FIRES (Washington) _ The wildfire that swept through Los
Alamos, N.M., earlier this month is setting off alarms across the
mountain West, where more and more Americans have chosen to live on
the forest's edge. Experts say those housing shifts have multiplied
the danger that other fires could kindle similar disasters. They
lie behind an urgent new congressional quest for millions of
dollars in emergency money to try to ease the risk. Across the
country, the damage caused by wildfire to homes and property
increased sixfold between the 1980s and 1990s, to a total of $3.2
billion over the last 10 years, federal officials say. In an
average year over the past decade, 1,200 homes have burned. By

   LABOR-POLITICS (Undated) _ Organized labor may have suffered a
bruising setback when the House of Representatives approved the
China trade bill last week, but there is widespread agreement, even
among labor's opponents, that the nation's unions are growing
stronger after years of decline. After steadily losing influence
for two decades, the labor movement has begun to rebound under John
Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, by reversing its membership slide
and by throwing its weight around far more in elections and on
Capitol Hill. Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said it would be foolish to dismiss labor's power because
of the China trade vote. By Steven Greenhouse.

   NY-SOUTHHAMPTON-TAX (Southampton, N.Y.) _ Behind the privet
hedges that shield the many monstrous mansions in this village by
the sea, something semi-revolutionary is brewing. The rich folks
who summer in the Village of Southampton are up in arms, in a
law-abiding kind of way, about an American principle for which
colonial patriots tossed tea into Boston Harbor: taxation without
representation. This village has been floating in a deep green sea
of property tax money since the 1890s, when plutocrats like W.K.
Vanderbilt began to erect gargantuan houses they called cottages.
Since then, more and more summer people have bought their way into
Southampton, and they pay about three-quarters of the property
taxes. The justice that summer people seek is the right to vote on
village matters while still keeping their permanent residences back
home. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-MUSEUM (North Adams, Mass.) _ Once one of the most down and
out of the New England milltowns, North Adams, Mass., has been
transformed into a Soho of the Berkshires. The unlikely catalyst of
this change was a gigantic museum in an abandoned factory featuring
trees growing upside down and sculptures made out of tons of
industrial debris. But before it could be born, itwas nearly hooted
out of existence as a $35 million state boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   NY-WAITERS-RACE (New York) _ One reality has dominated the

reasons for their absence. By Glenn Collins with Monte Williams.

   MICROBREWERS (Boston) _ The craze in the 1990s for craft-brewed

Bohemian Pilsner, Long Trail Double Bag Ale, Rogue Shakespeare
Stout and Pig's Eye Pilsner. For consumers used to basic labels
like Coors and Bud, it was a bit too much. Some microbrewers
collided with distributors who refused to carry their products and
financiers who clamored for profits even as sales slowed. As a
consequence, for the first time, more microbreweries in the United
States closed last year than opened. By Julie Flaherty.

that has been a vital home for both traditionalists and listeners

natural selection, as most biologists have assumed, but by the
other strong evolutionary force called sexual selection. In this
view, which he lays out in a newly published book called ``The
Mating Mind,'' humans are imaginative, artistic, humorous, and

SUN SHINES ON MARINERS IN FOUR-RUN FIFTH AGAINST CHICACO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Playing at an unusual starting time of 5 p.m. on an
even rarer sunny holiday, the right fielders at Safeco Field faced
an enormous challenge Monday. With the bright sun often shining
straight into their eyes, it must have been like staring directly
into Rickey Henderson's jewelry cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Jay Buhner, who also homered, made a good catch on
a line drive in the second inning when he appeared to simply fling
his glove up at the last moment and hope for the best. He fought
off the sun a couple other times as well to make catches.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago right fielder Magglio Ordonez, however, didn't fare so
well on a crucial line drive in the fifth inning of Seattle's 5-4
victory.
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle trailing 3-1, two out and the bases loaded, Edgar
Martinez sent a low fly ball into right field. The ball likely
would have been a flyout under normal circumstances, but Ordonez
was unable to get a good read on the ball in the intense sunshine
and it dropped in for a game-tying two-run single. Another run
scored right after that on a wild pitch, giving Seattle the lead,
4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty John Halama and the bullpen made the lead stand up as the
Mariners opened a long homestand and kept the lead in the crowded
American League West. If Memorial Day marks the traditional start
to summer, it should be a tight one in the division, where just 2{
games separate first from last.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners needed a well-pitched game after Sunday's debacle,
when starter Gil Meche went only five innings and became a
candidate for the disabled list with a ``dead arm'' (he was to be
examined before Monday's game by the team doctor), while reliever
Jose Mesa pitched so poorly _ nine runs allowed and one batter
retired _ that manager Lou Piniella resorted to using John Mabry.
Halama came through with seven strong innings, and the bullpen
finished up with two scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated this season, Halama has pitched well since a terrible
inning a couple weeks ago when he lost touch with the strike zone.
He threw an 87-pitch shutout two starts ago and gave the Mariners a
quality start against Baltimore last week, plus another one Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Halama is effective when he keeps batters driving the ball into
the ground. He was able to do so against the White Sox _ he struck
out none, walked one and retired 12 batters on grounders.
</P>
<P>
   The only runs he allowed Monday were on home runs. Ordonez hit a
three-run homer in the fourth inning, and Carlos Lee slammed a shot
that got over the left-field fence in a hurry in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Halama got some help from his fielders as well, which often
happens when you throw strikes and keep the defense on its toes.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's defense is much improved this season, even with the
departure of Ken Griffey Jr. In addition to Buhner's work in right
field, center fielder Mike Cameron, a former White Sox top
prospect, made a Junior-like catch in the fifth inning, leaping and
reaching beyond the center-field fence to rob Herbert Perry of a
home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners also received more effective relief pitching than
Sunday, which isn't difficult when you're only trying to better
Mesa and Mabry. Lefty Arthur Rhodes retired the three batters he
faced in the eighth and closer Kazu Sasaki pitched a scoreless
ninth inning for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   The four-run rally against Chicago starter Mike Sirotka wasn't
especially impressive. In addition to Martinez's single, Dan Wilson
reached on an error, Mark McLemore and Cameron walked, and
Rodriguez drove in the first run on a slow, two-out roller that
went for an infield single.

MARINERS CONTINUE TO SEEK ANTIDOTE FOR POISON 'PEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's not known whether the Mariners have a
game-disaster plan.
</P>
<P>
   But if they do, putting position player John Mabry on the mound
to finish a game would have had to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching choice in the eighth inning of Sunday's game in
Tampa didn't come out of the book of baseball percentages. Unless
the book was titled, ``In case of emergency, break glass and
pull.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite June yet, so it's a tad embarrassing for a
division leader to resort to emergency staffing. But when the
previous pitcher gets every bit as undressed as Charlie Brown by
the worst team in baseball, shame is no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   After Jose Mesa gave up nine runs in one-third of an inning _
his single-game ERA is still being calculated by senior research
fellows at MIT _ the Mariners find themselves in an unusual place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the franchise that over the past five years has
not only written the book on bullpen troubles, but done the movie
as well as syndicated the TV show to Europe, they were adrift in
the uncharted.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as relief pitching had been since 1995, the Mariners at
least had enough bad relievers. Boy, did they have enough bad
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, manager Lou Piniella found himself drained of what
was believed to have been be an inexhaustible supply.
</P>
<P>
   This was like Tonya Harding running out of purple eyeshadow,
Marlboros and bail bondsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Who woulda thunk?
</P>
<P>
   So Piniella resorted to Mabry, a versatile guy who pitched as
recently as high school, rather than subject another overworked
reliever to what became an 11-run debacle. He gave up three hits, a
walk and two runs and must tack an ERA of 27.00 onto his eternal
baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not. He rates a few more innings. While he
won't be the first Mariners reliever to have an ERA almost matching
his age (29), he deserves another chance at least as much as Mesa
to put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners aren't going to dump Mesa. But longtime fans knew
that. After the endless endurance developed watching the
late-edition Norm Charlton along with Bobby Ayala and Heathcliff
Slocumb, fans know that one little 11-run inning will not deter
this club from sticking with underachievers, as long as they are
veteran underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners soothed brows by beating the Central
Division-leading Chicago White Sox 5-4 with seven solid innings
from starter John Halama and one shutout inning each from relievers
Arthur Rhodes and Kazu Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   And pitching coach Bryan Price took Mesa out behind the barn.
Not for a whuppin', but for some instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Seems that Mesa, by throwing open the left side of his body too
soon, is giving hitters a long look at his grip on the ball, which
telegraphs the type of pitch.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the story from Price and the Mariners, and
they're sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still hope there's some magic in the body,'' said Price,
apparently not referring to the fans' request for the old
saw-in-half trick.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa aside, much of what is stalling the staff this season is
attributable to the accursed fates.
</P>
<P>
   Now that 21-year-old Gil Meche has developed a still-undiagnosed
``dead arm'' and is a looming candidate for the disabled list, only
two starters, Halama and Aaron Sele, will have kept their appointed
rounds in the first two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 pitcher Jamie Moyer and No. 2 pitcher Freddy Garcia went
on the same April weekend, where they have remained. Brett Tomko, a
possible No. 5 starter, was injured during spring training and
started the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki, the heralded closer who ballooned to a 5.06 ERA before
Monday night, had been troubled by a bad back, thanks to a soft bed
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The only health break the Mariners have caught was by Paul
Abbott, and that was because he was only slightly instead of
seriously injured Thursday in Baltimore after stopping a splintered
bat with his face.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in the clubhouse, he looked like Chuck Wepner after a
bout with Ali. After treatment by some of the best cut men in the
fight game, he will start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be lucky to get through five innings, which gets to
the source of the train wreck Sunday that Piniella and his staff
have seen coming since the injuries to Moyer and Garcia: Too few
innings from starters giving too many innings to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Abbott gone from middle relief, we have a lot of
(short-inning) people in the 'pen,'' Piniella said. ``We need
someone who can give us two or three innings at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Mariners are contemplating bringing up Kevin Hodges
or Tom Davey from Tacoma, the persistent pitching injuries mean
that there is no room for failure among the handful of healthies.
That includes Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners insist on pursuing the magic. If found, it will be
a world-record rabbit pulled from a size-one hat.

SUN SHINES ON MARINERS IN FOUR-RUN FIFTH AGAINST CHICACO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Optional story, subs for previous.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fortunately for Seattle, this time John Mabry wasn't summoned to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   One day after their ugliest loss of the season, things went
somewhat better for the Mariners Monday afternoon in a 5-4 victory
over the Chicago White Sox in Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Starter John Halama pitched seven solid innings, relievers
Arthur Rhodes and Kazu Sasaki pitched two scoreless innings, the
Mariners played excellent defense behind all three and _ most
important _ the pitchers mound was strictly a No Mabry Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (his ERA) is going to stay where it is,'' manager Lou
Piniella said of Mabry, an M's utility player who now has a 27.00
ERA after his emergency relief outing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners needed a well-pitched game Monday after Sunday's
train crash in which a dead arm limited starter Gil Meche to five
innings and reliever Jose Mesa pitched so poorly _ nine runs
allowed and one batter retired _ that Piniella resorted to Mabry in
order to spare his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Halama was very much aware of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (pitching coach Bryan Price) before the game that it
wouldn't hurt my ego to stay in and give up some runs,'' Halama
said. ``To save the bullpen and give them some innings, I'll eat
some runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a starter, I'm looking to go six, seven innings and keep
the game close. It's not magic. Just get your starter out there and
have him get in some innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama made sure they were quality innings as well, allowing
three earned runs in seven innings before turning things over to
Rhodes and Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he got some help from his fielders, which often
happens when you throw strikes, put the ball in play and keep the
defense on its toes as Halama does.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Mike Cameron robbed the White Sox of a home run,
Alex Rodriguez and Mark McLemore comined on some nifty doubleplays
and Jay Buhner played outstanding defense while facing down the
glare of the early evening sun.
</P>
<P>
   Combine an unusual late afternoon start with an even rarer sunny
holiday and playing right field was like staring directly into
Rickey Henderson's jewelry collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' Buhner said. ``That time of day is the
worst it can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, who also homered, made a good catch on a line drive in
the second inning when he simply raised his glove at the last
moment and hoped for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just basically stared at it for as long as I could, then
basically the ball was gone,'' Buhner said. ``I just stuck out my
glove and it hit the thumb and I was able to snowcone it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago right fielder Magglio Ordonez, however, didn't fare so
well on a crucial line drive in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle trailing 3-1, two out and the bases loaded, Edgar
Martinez sent a low fly ball into right field. The ball likely
would have been a flyout under normal circumstances, but Ordonez
was unable to get a good read on the ball in the intense sunshine
and it dropped in for a game-tying, two-run single. If Ordonez had
made the catch, Chicago would have escaped the inning with a 3-1
lead. Instead, Seattle led 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a chance,'' Martinez said. ``I didn't hit it
that good, and it was high enough to hang up there. The sun is
tough out there, so it could have been a combination of that and
him playing deep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the sun is really bad out there even when it doesn't
look like it's that bad,'' Buhner said. ``There are these hot spots
where the ball goes in and the sun gets bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, a former White Sox top prospect, made a Junior-like
catch in the fifth inning, leaping and reaching beyond the center
field fence to rob Herbert Perry of a home run that would have put
Seattle down 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an easy play to make even when you don't have to
fight the sun, and he had to,'' a much impressed McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well defensively all year,'' Piniella said.
``It's one of the reasons we've been able to remain in first
place.''

``historic.'' There has been a ``reconciliation of Switzerland with
itself.'' To judge by the gushing enthusiasm of Swiss Europhiles,
you would think that the result of the May 21 referendum, in which
67 percent of the voters approved a deal to open Switzerland up to
the European Union, was nothing less than an end to Swiss
isolationism. That would be overstating its significance, yet the
surprising strength of the pro-European vote does suggest that
something is stirring in this stubbornly independent-minded
nation. &QL;

nobody in New York wants to know about Rudolph Giuliani. The new

unheard of outside Long Island who will now be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's opponent for the U.S. Senate. Some New York Republicans
are distraught by the withdrawal of the bare-knuckle-fighting
Giuliani. But they need not be so downcast; Lazio may have a better
chance of slaying the demon than Giuliani. For a start, Lazio will
pick up a ton of votes for the simple reason that he is not

   AUSTIN _ The Rio Grande forms an 800-mile border between the
United States and Mexico. Under a treaty of 1944, Mexico is meant
to give Texas access to at least 350,000 acre-feet of water each
year from the river and its tributaries. Now Mexico has fallen so
far behind in its promised deliveries that it owes the United
States more than 1 million acre-feet. The situation has left
thirsty Texas farmers high and dry _ and angry. &QL;

this past year than global warming. Popular culture embraces all
things Latino, from callipygian pop stars to taco-touting
chihauhuas. Given that, it was inevitable that Latinos would become
a politically powerful group. Whether they are an interest group is
another matter, and depends on where you sit. The two main
political parties certainly believe they are a block to be wooed

   ALMATY _ Listen to the talk of huge oil discoveries off the
coast of Kazakhstan, and you might think that this impoverished
country is about to turn into a Saudi Arabia. Perhaps it will, but
it is too early to be sure. Oil has been found beneath parts of the
sea controlled by Russia and Azerbaijan, so it is not so
unreasonable to expect a big field on the other side in Kazakhstan.
If true, it would be the biggest oil find anywhere in the world for
20 years. A real gusher there would have an enormous effect on the
pipeline politics that have bedevilled the region.

   NEW YORK _ Anybody surprised by the hostile reaction to the bid
on May 24 by UAL, operator of United Airlines, for US Airways must
not fly much. In the two decades since the American industry was
deregulated, it has seen wild expansion, with more than 100 new
carriers launched in the 1980s, followed by equally manic
consolidation, with more than 100 failures and takeovers in the
1990s. Even if the deal can be done, there is good reason to
question whether it should be. Whatever the outcome, the benefit to
consumers may come from the antitrust scrutiny that such a deal
will inevitably bring. &QL;

American and Japan? No, their trade gap is modest compared with

that the Martians have been dumping cheap exports in world markets?
Come to think of it, some of those ``green'' protesters in Seattle
last year did seem rather other-worldly. &QL;

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTH LEBANON _ The bearded Hezbollah guerrilla puts
down his load of stolen Israeli grenades and turns to admire the
view. ``See how they go?'' the guerrilla asks, waving towards the
fleeing Israeli soldiers who have occupied southern Lebanon for 22
years. ``They leave everything and go like dogs.'' Despite the
denials of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, his army certainly
seemed this week to leave Lebanon with its tail between its legs. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Ehud Barak's election promise to end Israel's
22-year occupation of a slice of southern Lebanon was brave as well
as popular. Israel's dark military adventure into Lebanon was never
its proudest hour. This week's dramatic events, which turned an
orderly withdrawal into a disorderly rout, should not detract from
the wisdom of the decision to get out. Still, the chaos adds
markedly to the tribulations of Barak as he battles to make peace
with his Arab neighbors. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ After threats of war, the dangers of peace... When
Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, took office on May 20, it
marked the first democratic transfer of power in 5,000 years of
Chinese history. Taiwan, he proclaimed, has stood up. Yet the event
provoked no new crisis in China, which still insists that there is
but one China, that Taiwan is part of it, and that the government
in Beijing is in charge. It has long threatened to invade if Taiwan
declares independence. As ever with Taiwan and China, however, it
is hard to tell which is the phonier: Beijing's threat of war, or
this week's hope for peace. &QL;

American investors are putting more cash than ever into

for transforming America's economy from the industrial dinosaur of
the 1980s into today's high-growth, high-tech animal. But as the
venture-capital industry grows bigger and more global, more may not
always prove merrier. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Ehud Barak's election promise to end Israel's
22-year occupation of a slice of southern Lebanon was brave as well
as popular. Israel's dark military adventure into Lebanon was never
its proudest hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has caused the death, directly or indirectly,
of many thousands of people and few Israelis could see much reason
for continuing to risk their soldiers' lives by staying on.
</P>
<P>
   This week's dramatic events, which turned an orderly withdrawal
into a disorderly rout, should not detract from the wisdom of the
decision to get out.
</P>
<P>
   But the chaos, as Israel's proxy militiamen took to their heels,
forcing its own soldiers to beat a rapid retreat _ and thus leaving
the Hezbollah guerrillas in control _ adds markedly to the
tribulations of Barak as he battles to make peace with his Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Peace with Syria was top of the prime minister's original list.
Although Syria's military strength has declined as quickly as
Israel's has swollen, President Hafez Assad has not lost his talent
for mischief-making, let alone his overall control of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A Syrian deal would have gone far to putting a full stop to half
a century of Israeli-Arab hostility. It would also have opened the
way for a graceful exit from Lebanon, since no Lebanese government
can make peace with Israel until Syria does so first.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent agreement with the Palestinians, though desirable,
was secondary in Barak's book. To start with, all went well. Assad
and Barak exchanged effusive compliments. The Syrian seemed
genuinely keen on peace: he wanted to clear things for his son and
heir, and he sought a new and more profitable relationship with the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In January, talks were held in West Virginia, taking off from
the point at which discussions in Maryland had ended four years
before. There was a hiccup when an Israeli newspaper leaked
details, but both sides seemed to feel that a deal was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had agreed to withdraw from the Golan Heights in return
for security arrangements and normal, peaceful relations. But when
U.S. President Bill Clinton tried to clinch the understanding with
Assad, it turned out that both sides thought the other had given
way on the exact position of the border: a tiny matter of a few
hundred meters but crucial to both.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither side would give a meter, the talks, at least for
now, have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's response was to reaffirm that he would go ahead
regardless with Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon by July
7. He also, for lack of an alternative, turned his fuller attention
to the faltering talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Retreat is ever a hazardous business, but Israel had hoped that
its imminent departure, plus the threat of massive retaliation,
would keep the Syrians and Lebanese quiet while it went about the
business of getting its soldiers out and building new
fortifications on the border.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck, even though a foretaste of retaliation was
delivered when Israel bombed Lebanon's power stations earlier this
month. Lebanon's guerrillas merely increased their attacks on the
South Lebanon Army, the Israeli-run militia. And the militia lost
its nerve.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had never decided what to do about this force _
beyond hoping that it would cover their retreat. The question of
where the soldiers should go when their protectors departed was
left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, mostly Christian Lebanese, might look to
comfortable retirement in France, but the rank-and-file would be on
their own. If they stayed in Lebanon, should they keep their arms?
Confusion thus reigned, awaiting catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the militiamen took matters into their own hands by
simply running away, fleeing with their families into Israel, and
abandoning their weapons to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lebanon's rejoicing at Israel's ``expulsion,'' and its
proxy army's flight or surrender, could be short.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, in its triumph, may be showing a certain
responsibility. Yet if one of Lebanon's militant forces, with or
without Syria's consent, decides to continue the war by lobbing a
rocket into northern Israel, retribution will be swift and
terrible.
</P>
<P>
   And the new order of battle will, according to Israel's chief of
staff, take the form of a bombardment against ``all the
power-holding elements in Lebanon, including Syrian targets in
Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The troubles facing Barak in the West Bank and Gaza are far less
dramatic than this week's flight from Lebanon. However, if the
obstacles that stand in the way of a political agreement with the
Palestinians are not surmounted pretty soon, the vacuum in policy
could have even uglier consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have stumbled along, making little progress. The
poverty of results has left the Palestinians dangerously
disenchanted and volatile, almost as angry with their own leaders
as with Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations quickly flare into violence, as they did in the
West Bank last week when Israel's nightmare _ a gunfight between
the well-armed Palestinian police and the Israeli army _ came
briefly true. The police soon turned their attention to calming
their own people, but the shooting gave a glimpse into a
frightening future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present is our problem. The future will be their
problem,'' says an East Jerusalemite who believes that, although
Israel holds all the best cards at present, the Palestinians have
demography and determination on their side, and it is these that
will tell in the end. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900, OR CONTINUE TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is true that a lot of wild words are heard in the West Bank
these days, as Palestinians, whose standard of living drops by the
day, rage at principles betrayed, or about to be betrayed.
Disillusion goes deep. And it is probably worth noting that
Islamists have recently been winning quite a few student and
trade-union elections.
</P>
<P>
   With several deadlines already missed, it is vitally important
that Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinians' leader, come to a
quick and sensible agreement, even if not a comprehensive one.
</P>
<P>
   But, though Barak is prepared to offer the Palestinians more
than his predecessor did, his government still gives the
impression, as its predecessor did, that any Israeli measures that
advance a peaceful solution are ``concessions'' for which the
Palestinians should be duly grateful.
</P>
<P>
   They are not grateful, of course, and nor were the Lebanese, let
alone the Syrians. The belief that they might say thank-you and
behave nicely is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis feel that when they have done something good _ ceasing
to occupy part of Lebanon, for instance _ the Arabs should
acknowledge this and respond in kind. But the Arabs are as
bloody-minded as anybody else, and they cherish a long, deep grudge
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Barak, who does seem to be trying hard to do
the right thing, has to try even harder. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``A taboo has been broken.'' The vote was
``historic.'' There has been a ``reconciliation of Switzerland with
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the gushing enthusiasm of Swiss Europhiles, you
would think that the result of the referendum on May 21, in which
67 percent of the voters approved a deal to open Switzerland up to
the European Union, was nothing less than an end to Swiss
isolationism, and an unambiguous endorsement of efforts to tempt
the country into the EU.
</P>
<P>
   That would be overstating its significance. Yet the surprising
strength of the pro-European vote does suggest that something is
stirring in this stubbornly independent-minded nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why the Euro-enthusiasts were celebrating.
The referendum sought Swiss popular backing for seven bilateral
agreements with the EU, to come into force in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Each dismantles barriers between the two, prising the landlocked
country open to the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements include one to let big trucks from other EU
countries thunder across Switzerland, in return for the Swiss right
to tax them for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Another would end the job-quota system that restricts the free
movement of people between the EU and the Alpine country, under
which the Swiss can roam freely inside the EU from 2003 but need
not return the favor fully until 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although the deal was always expected to pass, chiefly
because it was backed by all the four parties in the federal
government, the strength of approval came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Euro-enthusiastic French-speakers, who account for
only 17 percent of Swiss citizens, were keen: 80 percent of the
canton of Vaud, next to Lake Geneva, for example, backed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the vote also bridged the linguistic divide
between them and their German-speaking countrymen: in Zurich, the
most populous canton, no less than 70 percent of voters said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the country's 26 cantons, Italian-speaking Ticino _
which seemed to fear an influx of job-grabbing ``foreigners'' from
neighboring Italy _ and conservative Schwyz, in its mountain
fastness, said no.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the oddity of the result was that, while the Europhiles
declared it was their victory, so too did those who fiercely reject
any efforts to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
   The populist Swiss People's Party, which astounded its
detractors by snatching second place at the parliamentary election
last year, claimed that the deal went through precisely because it
dishes out to the Swiss just as little of Europe as they want: the
economic benefits, without any loss of sovereignty to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they say, the question about joining the Union is now
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Who is right? Switzerland has long been ambivalent about opening
up. On the one hand, its businesses are highly international. It
has two of Europe's top five banks.
</P>
<P>
   Only this week, its bourse, Swiss Exchange, the world's
sixth-biggest, announced that it and London's Tradepoint were
planning a new pan-European exchange for blue-chip stocks. It sends
doctors into war zones worldwide, most famously through the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fifth of the Swiss population, who live under a
multilingual constitution, is foreign. Yet, at the same time, the
Swiss People's Party, which urges a clampdown on asylum-seekers and
carries echoes of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in neighboring
Austria, is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants seeking Swiss citizenship are already subject to a
humiliating beauty parade in their local canton before a vote is
held on their suitability for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   And the country jealously guards its totems of an independence
that borders on isolation: namely, neutrality, and non-membership
of such bodies as the EU and the United Nations, not to mention
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Swiss, and particularly the older German-speakers,
seem happy to live with this disjunction. But plenty of younger
Swiss, especially in French-speaking parts like Geneva, regret the
sense of aloofness and apartness, from fellow Europeans in
particular, that they feel it brings.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their system of direct democracy, Swiss politicians
are coy about offering leadership, taking their cue instead from
the popular mood. They would never dare to push against the general
will.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the government, though it backs in principle an
application to join the EU, insisted that this week's referendum
had nothing to do with EU membership. Next month, parliament has to
decide whether to back a referendum proposal to begin negotiations
to join.
</P>
<P>
   After this week's result, it may well be that Switzerland's
politicians can afford to be less cautious about offering a lead.
Their silence merely leaves the way open for extremists. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ After threats of war, the dangers of peace.
</P>
<P>
   For Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, who took office on
May 20, it has been a heartening week. His inauguration marked the
first democratic transfer of power in 5,000 years of Chinese
history. Taiwan, he proclaimed, echoing Mao's words when the
Communists took power on the mainland in 1949, has stood up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the event provoked no new crisis with China, which still
insists that there is but one China, that Taiwan is a part of it,
and that the government in Beijing is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   It has long threatened to invade if Taiwan declares
independence. Earlier this year it threatened to attack if Taiwan
put off talks on reunification for too long.
</P>
<P>
   As ever with Taiwan and China, it is hard to tell which is the
phonier: China's threat of war, or this week's hope for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has gone about as far as any democratically elected
Taiwanese president dares these days in trying to meet China
halfway. This week he repeated his campaign pledge that he will not
declare Taiwan independent _ unless, that is, China turns violent _
nor hold a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes to expand the ``three links'' with the mainland,
meaning trade, transport and communications, which his predecessors
had kept under strict control.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he again turned aside the mainland's demand that
``one China'' must be a precondition for the talks China wants him
to engage in, he did offer as a subject for those talks what sort
of place a ``future'' one China might be.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider that might seem a bridgeable difference, yet
peace is by no means guaranteed. Nor is war. For all their
bellicose behavior in recent months, some of China's leaders also
have reason to want to avoid a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Their oft-proclaimed priority is economic growth. More threats
against Taiwan would have undermined the Clinton administration's
efforts to persuade Congress that China should be granted permanent
normal trading relations as a last step before it joins the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After fierce lobbying, the vote passed. With luck, that will
serve to bolster the influence of reformers in China, who see
membership of the WTO as the surest way to set about establishing
the rule of law and getting China's flabby economy fit for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely the pull of the future that makes the Taiwan
issue so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of the election result _ China had previously declared
independent-minded candidate Chen unacceptable and its threats were
designed to frighten voters away from him _ may encourage China to
take a harder look at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It will not like what it sees. Thus far China has seemed to
believe its own propaganda, which claims that, bar a few
``splittists,'' 23 million Taiwanese compatriots are yearning for
union with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   That could scarcely be further from the truth. There may be
little support for outright independence, since that would provoke
China to lash out, but there is precious little for reunification
either.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's is an affluent, energetic young democracy that wants
nothing better than to be allowed to prosper and mind its own
business in peace. China, despite 20 years of economic reform, is
still a Communist Party dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   As the economic going has grown more difficult, and the appeal
of Marx has been lost to the lure of the marketplace, the party's
bosses have encouraged a visceral nationalism as a means to justify
their continuing hold on power. Free, democratic and well-heeled
Taiwan poses a threat to their rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the approach to the next party congress in 2002, the battle
will intensify between those who want to build an economically
stronger China and those who prefer a still socialist China with
nationalist characteristics. Policy towards Taiwan may well be
dragged further into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Taiwan faces two more immediate dangers. One is that
Chen's conciliatory tone this week will be mistaken by hard-liners,
including some in China's armed forces, as proof that, despite the
unwanted election result, their threats have worked, and that more
threats would work even better.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Chen dropped his aim of independence because
Taiwan's voters did not care for it, not because it offended China.
</P>
<P>
   The harder China now tries to lean on Taiwan, the harder it will
be for Chen to stretch a hand across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that others will lose interest now that talk
of war has subsided. Outsiders cannot mediate between China and
Taiwan, which must decide for themselves if China is one country
with two systems, as the Chinese insist, or one nation embracing
two states, as the Taiwanese might accept.
</P>
<P>
   They can, however, help to avoid misunderstandings. Americans,
Japanese and Europeans with an interest in Asia's stability need to
remind China that threats of force are unacceptable, and that force
itself would not go unanswered. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Rudy who?
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's out of the Senate race, nobody in New York wants
to know about Rudolph Giuliani. The new man of the moment is Rick
Lazio, a congressman hitherto largely unheard of outside Long
Island who will now be Hillary Rodham Clinton's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A clean-cut youthful fellow who has niceness written all over
his beaming face, he looks like the sort of opponent the
increasingly impressive Mrs. Clinton will eat for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder some Republicans, dismayed by the withdrawal of the
bare-knuckle-fighting Giuliani, talk of the first lady having,
perhaps literally, the luck of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   They should not be so downcast. Lazio may have a better chance
of slaying the demon than Giuliani. For a start, Lazio will pick up
a ton of votes for the simple reason that he is not Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Some psephologists reckon that Mrs. Clinton has so many
negatives that if the Republicans nominated a bag of bagels it
would poll 30 percent against her. Exactly why is hard to pin down
precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Being a ``carpetbagger'' from out of state has something to do
with it (helpfully, Lazio was born and bred in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton also seems to have a gift for grating with her
natural supporters. Some successful female professionals resent the
way that she has risen on her husband's coattails whilst presenting
herself as a career woman.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticize her for standing by her man despite being
publicly humiliated by his sexual antics. Manhattan liberals will
bad-mouth her as a hypocrite who presents herself as a saintly,
selfless, caring figure, when in fact all she cares about is her
own political advancement.
</P>
<P>
   And those are the views of sympathetic moderates. Best not to
get a Republican activist started on the Whitewater scandal or the
suicide of Mrs. Clinton's very good friend, Vince Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio can also count on the many Hillary-haters outside New
York, who stumped up a fortune for Rudy's campaign, and _ even if
Giuliani exercises his right to keep that cash for some future
campaign of his own _ are likely to do the same for his successor
in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's inflammatory fund-raising letters allowed Mrs.
Clinton to paint him as part of some right-wing conspiracy. With a
little subtlety, Lazio should be able to win the same support,
without ruining his reputation for being likeable _ a
characteristic even black Democratic congressmen from New York
happily affirm.
</P>
<P>
   This points to another potential advantage: as well as not being
Hillary, Lazio is not Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, like his erstwhile opponent, was terribly unpopular
with a large chunk of the electorate. He so antagonized New York's
blacks, particularly by his forceful defense of the police after
they shot three unarmed men, that he might have provoked a record
turnout of ethnic minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even if few of them will now switch to support Lazio, far fewer
will feel provoked to turn out to vote against him.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his support of the death penalty and apparently
straightforward personal life, Lazio can also count on the support
of New York's small Conservative Party, which opposed Giuliani, who
offered neither.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 years, no Republican has won statewide office without
Conservative backing. And, unlike Giuliani, who loves nothing more
than being mayor of New York City, Lazio really wants to be a
senator, and has the commitment, time and energy to mount a
campaign to match the exhaustingly vigorous one of Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio will not share the mayor's reluctance to campaign upstate,
particularly when the Yankees are playing _ a mistake which allowed
Mrs. Clinton to win support in the Republican heartlands.
</P>
<P>
   Not being Rudy certainly has some drawbacks too. He loses the
support of the tiny Liberal Party. And Lazio does not have
Giuliani's hard-won reputation as the man who restored law and
order to the city that never sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, New Yorkers seemed profoundly ungrateful on
this score. If the newly nice Giuliani campaigns for Lazio
energetically enough, some law-and-order Democrats may see a vote
for Lazio as a way of thanking Giuliani without having to tolerate
him in their face.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Lazio's own record. By most standards he has been an
effective sort in Washington (in fact he might prove a better
senatorial politicker than either Giuliani or Mrs. Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has already branded him a ``Newt Gingrich
conservative'' _ a good tactic in a state where Democrats outnumber
Republicans. But Lazio stands by his support for the unmissed
Gingrich's ill-fated ``Contract with America,'' especially its
promised balanced budget, tax relief for working families and
strong defense. ``What is it exactly they don't like?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Lazio does not match the usual unpalatable Gingrich
stereotype. He has voted for bills protecting the environment,
subsidizing health care for the working disabled and securing
low-rent housing for the poor. He is broadly pro-choice, though he
opposes ``partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>

political celebrity, Mario Cuomo.

   When Giuliani was still running, senior Republicans fretted that
the clash of egos allowed Mrs. Clinton to hide her big-government

   Now they hope that Lazio can flush out the real Hillary. That
strategy in turn relies on two things: the untested Lazio managing
to avoid making gaffes; and Mrs. Clinton not changing her
definition of the ``real Hillary'' yet again.

<P>
   Lazio is in with a chance, but she starts in front _ and who
would have thought that possible even three months ago? &QL;

<P>
   AUSTIN AND LOS ANGELES _ Ricky Martin's hips and Jennifer
Lopez's haunches have done more to raise temperatures around
America this past year than global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture embraces all things Latino, from callipygian pop
stars to taco-touting chihuahuas.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, it was inevitable that Latinos would become a
politically powerful group. Whether they are an interest group is
another matter, and depends on where you sit. The two main
political parties certainly believe they are a block to be wooed
and won.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos themselves are less sure about it. They have seldom
played the ethnic card in politics, not least because they are a
heterogeneous lot united mostly by language.
</P>
<P>
   Like most voters, their interests stem mostly from where they
live and how much money they make, not from their skin or culture.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of their position becomes clear by contrast with the
pressure groups around them. Most of these _ from the National
Rifle Association to the teachers' unions _ derive their power from
organization, money, loyalty and a clear agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos retain a hold over the Democratic Party without any of
these things. They give precious little money, and vote relatively
seldom; virtually every senior Democrat entertains some doubts
about their long-term loyalty, and their agenda is still relatively
vague.
</P>
<P>
   The result: things are offered almost before they are demanded.
So far, it seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats got around 70 percent of the Latino vote in the
1996 election. President Bill Clinton even managed to win 65
percent of Latinos earning more than $75,000 a year. Virtually all
the elected Latinos outside Miami are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The few Latino organizations that exist tend to have a
Democratic bias, though they are far less active than black
political groups. The arrival of Latinos has helped swing several
congressional seats to the party.
</P>
<P>
   So why pay so much attention? One reason is demographics. The 32
million Latinos in the United States make up 11.7 percent of its
population. Soon Latinos, whose numbers have swelled by a third
since 1990, will overtake blacks to be America's largest minority.
</P>
<P>
   Around a third of the Latinos are not yet citizens of the United
States, and of those who are, 40 percent are too young to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even among those eligible to vote, registration still lags, so
that Latinos cast only 5 percent of the votes in the 1996 election
(up from 3.7 percent in 1992), and are expected to cast about 7
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is fear. Democrats remember the swing to Ronald
Reagan in 1980 among traditionally Democratic Irish, Italian and
Polish Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are fond of saying that Latinos are ``natural
Republicans'' on the strength of their religiously-based social
conservatism. They have done little so far to awaken them
nationally to their supposed nature, although there are some large
pockets of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has regularly picked up 40 percent of the Latino
vote as the group's choice of presidential candidate, thanks to his
rapport with them in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His governor-brother Jeb, a fluent Spanish-speaker with a
Mexican wife, does even better among Latinos in Florida with a
potent blend of social conservatism and concern for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Parties usually deal with interest groups by giving them what
they want in exchange for money and votes. The problem with Latinos
is that their interests do not make up a coherent set of demands.
As a result, recent attempts by Democrats to shore up their support
among Latinos have had a hit-and-miss feel.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Gore, who from time to time breaks into patchy Spanish,
jumped into the argument over Elian Gonzalez in a bid to appeal to
Florida's Cuban-Americans, he did himself harm with Latinos
elsewhere, who favored returning the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest thing to an issue among Latinos is their support for
liberal immigration policies. The most spectacular evidence of this
is the disastrous damage the Republican Party did to itself in
California in 1994 with its support of Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   This ballot measure, which passed into law, withdrew social
services from illegal immigrants in the state, the bulk of whom
were Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The support the measure received from Pete Wilson, then the
Republican governor of California, helped to sink the party in the
polls, leaving all the senior offices in California today in
Democratic hands. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush does not talk much about Wilson. The Democrats assiduously
exploit the issue. Gore's announcement in March that the
administration is proposing an amnesty for immigrants who came
illegally to America before 1986 got wide coverage in the
Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Democrats also successfully lobbied the AFL-CIO to
change its policy on immigration. The trade-union movement, until
recently narrow-eyed about foreigners of any sort taking its
members' jobs, has now become much more sympathetic to Latinos, who
make up an increasing number of those members.
</P>
<P>
   A much-publicized strike by caretakers in Los Angeles is led by
a union almost entirely composed of recent Latino immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that is looming large on the Latino agenda is the
U.S. census.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, alongside
the Democrats but not the Republicans, has lobbied for having a
statistically estimated adjustment in the census, to take account
of the many poor, migrant, homeless and illegal people whom the
census may miss.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to boost the number of congressional seats for
Latino areas. The parties' positions are a mark of everyone's
confidence that such seats will be won by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Garcia, a political scientist at the University of New
Mexico, argues that Latino votes will depend most heavily on health
care, education and welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   All are traditional Democratic issues, but in concentrating on
them Latinos are following the pattern of earlier immigrants: they
are adopting middle-class American patterns of political behavior,
rather than putting their ethnic identity above everything else.
And this is the way they have always behaved.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, this special-interest group is neither
special, nor one interest. That will be the Republicans'
opportunity. &QL;

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK _ It's a strange thing about Arkansas: the state
that propelled Bill Clinton to the peak of politics also produces
the people who do him most damage.
</P>
<P>
   First Cliff Jackson, the tireless Whitewater digger; then Paula
Jones; and now the state's lawyer-discipline committee which, on
May 22, started proceedings to disbar President Clinton from
practicing law in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   This was quite an eye-opener in a state with a reputation for
sweeping such matters under the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it reflects two things _ the obduracy of Clinton's
opponents (not least, Kenneth Starr and Jones); and the fact that
the Arkansas bar takes itself much more seriously than outsiders
might expect.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may become the first sitting chief executive of the
United States to lose his law license. His fate now rests in the
hands of a randomly-selected circuit court judge in Little Rock and
the state Supreme Court; both must uphold the panel's
recommendation for disbarment, which could take a few months, or
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The disbarment action was prompted, first, by a filing with the
committee in September 1998 by a conservative legal foundation, and
then by an April 1999 referral from District Judge Susan Webber
Wright of Little Rock, who oversaw the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy enough for Clinton to dismiss the first filing as the
work of the inevitable vast right-wing conspiracy. But Judge
Wright, who dismissed Jones's complaint, is another matter. She was
particularly offended by Clinton's apparent attempts to mislead the
jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, the bar is considered an institution of dignity:
``shyster behavior,'' as one member puts it, is not easily
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The rules say disbarment is an appropriate punishment for
``serious misconduct,'' including ``dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or
misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court itself has ruled, in another
disbarment hearing, that ``lawyers holding public office assume
legal responsibilities going beyond that of other citizens.'' Lying
is particularly frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these strictures need a pinch of salt. Taken literally,
they suggest that being a lawyer is incompatible with political
success of even the lowest sort.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee can bite. Five to ten lawyers come before the
bar each year for misbehaving, and most voluntarily surrender their
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   If disbarred, Clinton would find himself in relatively familiar
company. To begin with, there are all his friends that Kenneth
Starr has rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   Seven lawyers, including another former governor of Arkansas,
Jim Guy Tucker, face the loss of their licenses because of the
Whitewater investigation. And there are also a fair number of
political types.
</P>
<P>
   One former Democrat state senator of 29 years' standing, Nick
Wilson, resigned at the end of last year rather than face
disbarment proceedings for racketeering. Another recent casualty
was John Arens, the Arkansas chairman of Ross Perot's 1992
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his keenness to fight the charges in court, Clinton is in
more select company. Last year, P.A. ``Les'' Hollingsworth, a
well-known Little Rock lawyer, lost his case with the Arkansas
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also insisting that he will not take the stand while
in office, something that may count against him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that normal Americans would much rather forget about
legal Clintonia of any sort. But Clinton's fate is now in the hands
of Arkansan lawyers, some of whom see Clinton's possible disbarment
as a chance to clean up the state's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   One early sign of this new thirst for probity is the fact that
eight members of the committee on professional conduct have already
excused themselves in the name of unbiased justice.
</P>
<P>
   A judge, who was removed from the bench earlier this month for
practicing law on the side, illegally switching license plates and
writing 59 bad checks, was up for election this week; the newly
moralistic voters of Arkansas turfed him out. &QL;

<P>
   AUSTIN _ The Rio Grande, which forms an 800-mile border between
the United States and Mexico, is usually shown as an ankle-deep
flow with lots of immigrants in it. But it does contain a fair
amount of water, which is often the only drinkable source for miles
around.
</P>
<P>
   Under a treaty of 1944, Mexico is meant to give Texas access to
at least 350,000 acre-feet of water each year from the river and
its tributaries. Now Mexico has fallen so far behind in its
promised deliveries that it owes the United States more than 1
million acre-feet.
</P>
<P>
   According to gasping Texan farmers, the trouble began in 1992,
when the Mexican government started hoarding water during a
regional drought. In a parched region, water-hoarding is a high
crime, especially when it allows Mexico to grow crops for export
that compete with America's.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials reply that the drought counts as an
``extraordinary'' exception under the treaty, and they are still in
a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Mexico, rainfall has been below average for the past
six years. The reservoirs are so low that they can barely supply
the needs of some northern Mexican cities, and production of maize
(for tortillas, the pillar of the Mexican diet) has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Texan officials question the treaty's vague use of
``extraordinary.'' Meanwhile, as Mexico fails to make its water
deliveries, Texan farmers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   One study, by a consortium of businesses from the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, shows that farmers are losing about $400 million a
year because of Mexico's water debt to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One underlying cause of the water war is explosive growth. Since
the signing of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
foreign direct investment has poured into the region.
</P>
<P>
   The border population _ at present about 6.4 million on the
United States side and 5.6 million on the Mexican side _ is
expected to jump to 24 million by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in California, another problem is wasteful practice.
Farmers soak up about 85 percent of the border region's scarce
water, and on the semi-arid land on both sides they grow thirsty
cash crops like sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient system of water rights means that many farmers pay
only modest amounts to obtain their annual allocations from the Rio
Grande, and poor pipelines and irrigation systems allow lots of
water to leak out.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government is now demanding that Mexico make a
good-faith effort to deliver the water owed for the current year as
well as a small part of the accumulated shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 2, it hopes to have wrung at least 400,000 acre-feet out
of its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of goodwill, Mexico has transferred to American
ownership a total of 138,000 acre-feet of water in the Amistad and
Falcon international dams. And it has promised to give Texas all it
owes since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But when will it do so? That depends on the rain; and Texas
weathermen see few clouds coming for a very long time. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Until recently, Serbia was an authoritarian state.
Its citizens were kept in check by a powerful security police and
by heavy state control over their economic affairs _ in such
matters as jobs, housing and financial transactions _ while still
enjoying the outward forms of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia was not totalitarian. Disorderly but lively opposition
parties, as well as independent media outlets, were tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But that distinction may disappear, as Yugoslavia's President
Slobodan Milosevic girds himself for what could be his last battle.
</P>
<P>
   This time he is not fighting other ethnic groups, but fellow
Serbs whose anger over the country's isolation and poverty is
reaching the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the mounting repression _ the closure of television
and radio stations, scores of arrests, and threats to introduce an
``anti-terrorism law'' that would mean something like emergency
rule _ Milosevic may be reaching that point too.
</P>
<P>
   By closing the airwaves to the opposition, he is taking the risk
that popular discontent may boil over. Yet he, and the toughest
parts of his coalition, apparently calculate that the anger already
in evidence may sweep them away unless they crack down hard.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree that dismays even the president's own Socialist
supporters, rivals in the Yugoslav Left party _ run by his powerful
wife, Mira Markovic, and the ultranationalist Radicals headed by
Vojislav Seselj _ are gaining prominence as their calls for the
suppression of pro-western ``traitors'' grow more strident.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, meanwhile, has called a fresh street
demonstration for May 27. Provincial towns like Kragujevac, Nis and
Cacak are seething with discontent, and threaten to displace
Belgrade and multiethnic Novi Sad as the main bastions of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs Kosovo for the United
Nations, this week described the regime in Belgrade as a ``fascist
island in the Balkans, counting its last days.''
</P>
<P>
   If his language sounded strong, it was because he was trying to
parry the anger that has swept through the province's
ethnic-Albanian majority since 143 Kosovars were jailed last week
for ``terrorism'' by a court in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Milosevic feels he has nothing to lose by
raising the stakes. Neither he nor his most trusted lieutenants can
travel to any western country for fear of being arrested on
war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that only about a fifth of Serbia's
voters, many of them old-age pensioners, want to keep Milosevic in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, his government is facing an opposition
movement that is not tainted, in the public's mind, with the
perceived failings of the regime's other opponents: power-seeking
vanity and a compulsive tendency to quarrel.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely structured movement known as Otpor, or Resistance,
is made up of young people, many of them students, who seem
desperate enough to risk their skulls to fight a regime that is
blocking their future.
</P>
<P>
   Though state propaganda portrays them as agents of the wicked
western powers that bombed Serbia last year, the charge carries
little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   As for the older opposition parties, public skepticism about
them may have grown since May 17, when the authorities abruptly
turned the screw by shutting down Studio B, the main independent
television channel, and two radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000 or so people who turned up to denounce the closure,
and were beaten up by the police, later got little moral support
from the politicians who had been addressing them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Vuk Draskovic, the best-known opposition leader,
was in Montenegro, where a standoff continues between westernizers,
who dream of detaching the republic from Serbia, and politicians
loyal to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Tension could reach a breaking point after local elections on
June 11, when the pro-Serbian opposition will mount a challenge to
President Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has been artful enough to broaden links with the rest
of the world _ including the European Union and his Croatian and
Albanian neighbors _ while keeping at bay the threat of a coup by
the local Yugoslav garrison to reassert the authority of the
government in Belgrade. But that government would not miss an
opportunity to meddle if it saw one.
</P>
<P>
   The scale and the limits of Milosevic's unceasing campaign to
destabilize neighboring countries were highlighted this week at a
conference in Brussels on the reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, for those who still seek to build a multiethnic
Bosnia, is that the Serb nationalists are failing to keep their
ethnic cousins, who control 49 percent of Bosnia's territory,
hermetically sealed from the Muslims and Croats who run the
remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Movement across the ``inter-entity boundary'' that separates the
two halves of Bosnia has never been so free since the peace
agreement signed in Dayton came into force in 1996. It called for a
sort of ``soft partition'' followed by gradual integration.
</P>
<P>
   Another good omen for Bosnia's international protectors is that
the number of people reclaiming their old homes, in areas now
controlled by a rival ethnic group, has doubled in each of the past
four years. This year it could reach as many as 160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the claimants are Muslims returning to parts of eastern
Bosnia from which they were ejected in 1992, or Serbs who had fled
from Sarajevo or points west. In the north Bosnian town of Doboj, a
bastion of Serb chauvinism, a Muslim jeweller is once again doing a
roaring trade.
</P>
<P>
   The grimmer news is that Bosnia's federal institutions remain
weak and their leadership poor. The bad old days of bloodily
unbridled nationalism could return all too quickly if Bosnia ceased
to be kept under close supervision; the ramshackle republic's
internal equilibrium is still vulnerable to mischief stirred up
from within or without.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's Croat politicians, at least, have grown more amenable _
about letting displaced Muslims come home, for example _ since
their nationalist sponsors in Zagreb lost power to a more liberal
government. But the Bosnian Serbs may still be tempted by
chauvinism as long as that cause is championed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   An even harder test for international bureaucrats _ and equally
crucial to their campaign to show that they, not Milosevic, are
calling the shots _ will be the effort to woo displaced Serbs back
to Kosovo in decent numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency this week gave its most precise estimate
so far of the number of non-Albanians who fled the province after
NATO marched in last year: about 180,000 went to Serbia proper, and
30,000 to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The more of these people (mostly Serbs) who can be persuaded to
return to Kosovo, the more credibility will be enjoyed by Bishop
Artemije, the Kosovo Serbs' moderate leader, who has defied local
hard-liners, and enraged the government in Belgrade, by cautiously
agreeing to cooperate with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be few returns unless ethnic Albanians can be
dissuaded more forcefully from taking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   As power struggles among the Serbs _ in Belgrade, Pristina
(Kosovo's capital) and elsewhere _ become more desperate, the
outcome will be influenced not only by western pressure but by
Russia's new administration, which has sent mixed messages to its
traditional Balkan friends. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000, OR CONTINUE TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first signals from President Vladimir Putin, after his
election in March, boded ill for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Russia appeared to be slowing down on gas deliveries to Serbia,
as well as military cooperation, and pressing the Serb leader to be
more flexible over Kosovo. But this month's visit to Moscow by the
Yugoslav defense minister, and the announcement of a $100 million
Russian loan for Serbia, suggested that its rulers still have
powerful friends in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   So, however, does the Serbian opposition; at any rate, Draskovic
and other anti-Milosevic politicians are due in Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin holds his first summit meeting with President Bill
Clinton on June 4, both sides will be conscious that Russia could
be very helpful _ or unhelpful _ in what could turn out to be the
Yugoslav endgame. &QL;

<P>
   ALMATY _ Listen to the talk of huge oil discoveries off the
coast of Kazakhstan, and you might think that this impoverished
country is about to turn into a Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will, but it is too early to be sure. For months, the
people of Kazakhstan have been hopefully watching the Kashagan oil
field, the first in the country's bit of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Oil has been found beneath parts of the sea controlled by Russia
and Azerbaijan. So it was not so unreasonable to expect a big field
on the other side in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The government talked of finding at least 1 billion tons of oil,
a sizeable deposit, but a report attributed to American government
sources suggests that the area may contain as much as 6.8 billion
tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the claim turns out to be true, it would be the biggest oil
find anywhere in the world for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, is
talking of cranking out as much oil as Saudi Arabia, the world's
biggest oil producer, by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   If Kashagan turns out to be a real gusher, it will have a big
effect on the pipeline politics that have bedevilled the region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been scheming to prevent Central Asia's
as-yet-untapped oil and gas riches from reaching the market via
Russia and Iran. Better, say the Americans, that the stuff should
flow westward via the relative safety of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia and Iran happen to be giant neighbors that the poor
Central Asian states have to live with, and which offer reasonably
cheap access to world markets.
</P>
<P>
   To tempt countries such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, which also
has visions of oil-fired prosperity, the Americans have been
promoting a rival route for Caspian oil. They would like to see it
flow from Baku, on the coast of Azerbaijan, west to the safe
Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the Americans have won only reluctant
commitments from the multinationals involved, among them Britain's
BP Amoco, which heads the main Azerbaijani oil consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan's oil would reach Baku either by tanker or, less
likely, through a possible underwater pipeline. One difficulty is
the estimated $2.4 billion it would cost for the 1,730-km
(1,075-mile) tube through which the oil would travel. A bigger
problem is that at present there is simply not enough oil to fill
it.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, where drilling is more advanced than in Kazakhstan,
has so far disappointed oilmen by yielding up mostly natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matzke of Chevron puts it bluntly: ``There isn't any oil
looking for a transportation system. Most pipelines are built after
the demand, rather than before the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but if the new finds in Kazakhstan turn out to be as big as
expected, say boosters of the Americans' plan, then their pipeline
is back in business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. One reason it may not be is timing: the hoped-for oil
from Kazakhstan's fields will not start flowing in serious
quantities until 2008, but America wants the companies to complete
the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is possible competition from Iran. Getting oil to the
Gulf would be much cheaper than getting it to Turkey. In time,
argue fans of an Iranian route, America's hostility to business
dealings with Iran's thuggish regime will fade. But that could take
a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, companies that have tried to do business with the
mullahs report that bureaucratic wrangling and other difficulties
greatly raise the costs and risks of the Iranian option.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the only sure winner from any oil bonanza in
Kazakhstan is Russia. A fair amount of oil already crosses
Kazakhstan through a pipeline from Atyrau, in the west of the
country. A new pipeline is expected by 2001 that will transport oil
to the Russian port of Novorossiysk.
</P>
<P>
   The only other ways that Kazakhstan's oil gets to market now,
via rail and tanker, also often rely on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Russia has lots of new ideas to suck up
Caspian oil, and so earn the fat transit fees. If Kazakhstan's oil
finds turn out to meet the latest giddy expectations, all the rival
pipeline schemes may find themselves in business.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of that? Nobody really knows. The leaks
from American officials are probably self-serving attempts to keep
their troubled project afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria of Kazakhstan's officials is likely to be equally
baseless, if less surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who may really know are those in the companies
actually doing the drilling at Kashagan. All they will say, at the
moment, is that their results are ``very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Their final report, which is due in two or three months' time,
is eagerly awaited. Pipeline punters near and, especially, far will
be holding their breath. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anybody surprised by the hostile reaction to the bid
on May 24 by UAL, operator of United Airlines, for US Airways must
not fly much.
</P>
<P>
   In the two decades since the American industry was deregulated,
it has seen wild expansion, with more than 100 new carriers
launched in the 1980s, followed by equally manic consolidation,
with more than 100 failures and takeovers in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the one constant was poor service and high prices:
business travellers to some destinations, such as Houston, Texas,
still pay fares that could take them around the world on
international airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the airlines have continued to lose money. As
recently as 1995, after years of mergers and cost-cutting, the
cumulative earnings of the industry over its entire history were
still negative.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder regulators, investors, employees and passengers all
doubt the wisdom of another large acquisition. Shares in UAL fell
by as much as 15 percent after the merger was announced.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, what United wants to do appears to make some
sense. Although it is the world's largest airline, it is not strong
everywhere. Domestically, its routes tend to go east-west, mostly
longer trips.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, the country's sixth-largest carrier, specializes in
shorter trips, especially north-south on the two coasts. It is
strong in the northeast, where United is weak.
</P>
<P>
   United wants US Airways to broaden its services nationally,
along with increasing its economies of scale. For this United is
offering to pay more than a 100 percent premium on US Airway's
share price, for a total deal value of $11.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows just how hard it is to realize such apparent
advantages. For one thing, it is hard to get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   When United and US Airways last tried to wed, in 1995, the
carriers' powerful pilot unions blocked them. The pilots have said
they oppose the new deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities are another barrier. The Department of
Justice's trustbusters, who say the airline industry is their
biggest concern after Microsoft, are suing to block a partial
merger between Northwest and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   And, even when mergers take place, they often stumble over
combining routes, computer systems and cultures. US Airways lost
money for nearly a decade after buying Piedmont in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the deal can be done, there is good reason to question
whether it should be. Whatever efficiencies there may be in
mergers, they rarely result in savings for fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, bigger carriers tend to have more weight to throw
around, locking up landing slots at hubs, offering incentives to
travel agents for preferential bookings and temporarily slashing
prices to fend off competitors (the U.S. Department of Justice is
suing American Airlines for allegedly doing just that).
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by the congressional General Accounting Office
concluded that, between mergers and alliances, two-thirds of
American travellers will soon fly to markets dominated by a single
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This concentration is already harmful. Since 1994 domestic
prices, measured in cents per passenger mile, have steadily risen,
even as fuel costs were falling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the newfound profitability of the industry is mostly
explained by the failure of airlines to pass the fuel savings on to
the customers, which suggests a lack of effective price
competition.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a problem unique to America: airline markets
everywhere remain bastions of monopoly. But in the age of Internet
travel auctions and online pricing, the cost of the industry's
inefficiencies has never been more glaring.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this latest merger goes through or not, the greatest
consumer benefit may come from the antitrust scrutiny that the deal
will inevitably bring. &QL;

<P>
   SYDNEY _ The Sydney Harbor Bridge, one of the city's two grand
symbols, will be closed to cars on May 28 for only the third time
since it was built 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as many as 250,000 people will take over the bridge in a
walk to mark reconciliation with Australia's aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``people's walk'' will follow a ceremony the previous day at
the opera house, Sydney's other great symbol, where aboriginal
leaders will hand to the Australian government a document that
calls for a national apology over injustices to indigenous people
and recognition of their customary laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both events are meant to mark a high point in Australia's
attempts to make symbolic amends with its indigenous people 212
years after the British invaded or settled the country, depending
on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   But under the government of John Howard, reconciliation has
become mired in politics. Howard refuses to make an apology. He
maintains Australians should not be held to account for the
misdeeds of previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation, he says, should involve practical measures, like
giving money to help lift aborigines' deplorable health standards
and put more of them into schools and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's record in this regard is not bright. Death rates for
aborigines from all causes are twice as high as those for Maoris in
New Zealand; they compare badly with those for indigenous Americans
and are more than three times the total Australian rate, according
to Gustav Nossal, the deputy chairman of the Council for Aboriginal
Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Parliament started the reconciliation process in
1991, and aimed at achieving it by 2001, the centenary of the
country's federation. Howard committed himself to this goal
``genuinely,'' as he put it, on his re-election in 1998. But his
actions since then have made some critics wonder how serious he is.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he abandoned the 2001 deadline, saying it had been
a mistake. Then his government attacked a U.N. committee that had
criticized the way mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern
Territory and the state of Western Australia had led to the jailing
of mainly unemployed, black youths.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations disapproved of the Howard government's
refusal to override these laws, as it has the power to do.
</P>
<P>
   The government's most controversial stand has been towards one
of the most painful episodes of Australia's recent past. This
involves the tens of thousands of mixed-race children, known as
``the stolen generation,'' who were taken from their parents by
government officials between 1910 and 1970 in the cause of wiping
out their indigenous heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Howard has ignored a recommendation in a 1997 report by
Australia's human-rights and equal-opportunity commission that the
government should formally apologize to the stolen generation.
</P>
<P>
   In April, his government outraged aborigines and many
non-indigenous Australians by claiming that, because only 10
percent of aboriginal children had been involved, the stolen
generation did not really exist.
</P>
<P>
   Howard has also quibbled over the wording of the document that
the members of the reconciliation council will present to him at
the Sydney ceremony. Instead of its call for an apology for past
injustices, he wanted an expression of ``sorrow and profound
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more he has dug in his heels over these symbolic
aspects, the more he has inflamed the aborigines and their
supporters, who include Australia's most influential newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that 80 percent of Australians support
the aims of reconciliation, but not necessarily an apology.
Whatever they think about that, many Australians are tired of the
divisive politics that have flared around the issue. Howard's
refusal to say sorry could damage his government. &QL;

   YANGON _ Sit down on a stool at a tea stall in Yangon, the
capital of Myanmar, and young men will come to tell you of their
dreams of escape to Europe or America.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them about politics, and in urgent whispers most explain
they cannot answer for fear of arrest. But when the rain falls
noisily a few brave ones dare to speak up: ``It is very bad here,
very bad. Yes, we have rice every day, but we have no jobs. The
government is very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, however muted, is particularly risky at the moment:
like the country's innumerable pagoda bells, the junta's nerves are
jangling.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27 ten years ago, the voters unambiguously backed the
National League for Democracy (NLD) in a general election, the
result of which has never been honored. Almost nothing has changed
in the country since then, except its name, which used to be Burma.
</P>
<P>
   A military dictatorship remains in charge. It likes to believe
the election is only a distant memory, but fears that the
anniversary could be the trigger for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border in Thailand, some 90,000 refugees, together
with opposition leaders from Myanmar, will mark the anniversary
with demands for change and international attention. The visit of
Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, to the border region a few
weeks ago encouraged the refugees and annoyed the junta.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thai government is wary of more violence after
anti-regime fighters from the border region, though not necessarily
from the refugee camps, attacked Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok last
October, and then held a group of hostages in a bloody siege of a
Thai hospital in January.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Myanmar, any demands for change are likely to be rather
less dramatic. Some of the country's 500,000 monks, notably the
younger ones, propose to ``strike,'' but that will merely mean they
reject offerings from army officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the military government has been hunting down more
troublesome dissenters. Anyone spotted carrying NLD pamphlets or
stickers has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The central areas of Yangon are strewn with barbed-wire
barricades. The junta says that any street demonstration will have
been organized by foreign agents, and anyone taking part will be
dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is described in the official
newspapers as a ``democracy actress'' and foreign lackey. The
regime claims that increasing numbers of her party have resigned
``willingly and of their own accord.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, it says, 470 people left the party in one district of
Yangon, while in March over 120,000 rallied against the
``pessimist'' NLD. Anyone who may have other ideas is warned that
the regime aims to ``crush all internal and external destructive
elements as the common enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Suu Kyi is, of course, one such enemy. Though no longer
under formal house arrest, she remains under close watch by
military intelligence. She is no longer allowed to make public
speeches, though videotaped remarks by her were smuggled out this
week to be broadcast by friendly television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   She has called again for a peaceful dialogue with the junta and
for more international pressure for change, especially from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The road to her house is barricaded. Taxi drivers who take
curious foreigners to drive nearby for a snapshot have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Since she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, Miss Suu Kyi has
gone a bit out of fashion. Because she speaks like the Oxford
academic's wife she once was, because foreign journalists are
usually smitten by her and because the generals' grip on power
seems stronger than ever, it can be easy to see her as some sort of
western-imposed savior, irrelevant to Myanmar's harsh realities.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the junta would like. Yet she is not. Her western
background and fame are relevant to Myanmar because they make it
hard to lock her up again, or to treat her with the casual cruelty
most ordinary opposition politicians endure.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Suu Kyi's real importance is as the sole repository of
the hopes for peaceful change harbored by huge numbers of Myanmar's
people.
</P>
<P>
   Although anniversaries are seen as important, the real impetus
for change in Myanmar, peaceful or not, could be economic collapse.
The regime may be fearful that people are beginning to feel they
have less and less to lose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations tell of malnutrition in remote
rural areas. The thousands of people who have fled to Thailand have
been driven by desperation for a job as much as by their dislike of
the junta.
</P>
<P>
   The military men claim 10 percent GDP growth a year. But that
figure looks like fantasy and is certainly not reflected in the
value of the currency, the kyat, which is in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers who try to stay in business by raising prices are
threatened with arrest. To keep soldiers and government workers
sweet, they were given increases of five or six times their pay
this month, a recipe for more inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The junta is losing its few remaining foreign friends. A
Japanese car company, Toyota, the HSBC bank and a foreign
manufacturer of monosodium glutamate have all announced in the past
few months that they will pull out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Approved foreign investment fell by 90 percent last year and the
only companies set to stay are those exploiting natural resources
such as oil and timber. Even they may be embarrassed by a recent
report by the International Labor Organization condemning the use
of forced labor in army projects, some of which have benefited
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the organization aims to push other United Nations
agencies to distance themselves from the junta until it can prove
that forced labor is no longer used. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Myanmar is not a hopeless case, hardly worth bothering
about. Since so many people are so oppressed by so few, they will
presumably one day do something about it. And, as one side has
nearly all the guns, the result may be bloody. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Take a couple of people with a bright idea and a
garage, mix in a dollop of venture capital and, hey presto: another
world-beating company.
</P>
<P>
   That is what American entrepreneurs eager to become the next
Cisco or Amazon believe _ and it is why American investors are
putting more cash than ever into venture-capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   As America's innovative economy has become the envy of the
world, so have its venture capitalists. Today, all countries want a
venture-capital industry to turn their garages and bright ideas
into gold. This enthusiasm is mostly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital allows entrepreneurs to build a firm without
having to borrow and pay high interest charges before they generate
any revenues, let alone profits.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists hand over money in exchange for shares that
may not be worth anything for years, if ever, in the hope that they
will turn out to own a slice of a multibillion-dollar company.
</P>
<P>
   Without venture capital, people with bright ideas would have to
go to a risk-averse bank manager, or fight through the bureaucracy
of an established firm that may be hostile to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The wet-behind-the-ears youngsters who created Cisco and the
rest could not have done it so fast had their only source of
finance been a bank or a big company _ which is often all that has
been available in Britain, Germany or Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that venture capital works its magic in
isolation. Other things have been essential to American success:
stable, low-inflation macroeconomic policies; labor markets that
make firing and hiring easy; and an entrepreneurial culture in
which people work for little or nothing if they have share options
and in which those who fail are lionized nearly as much as those
who succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But venture capital deserves a slice of the credit for
transforming America's economy from the industrial dinosaur of the
1980s into today's high-growth, high-tech animal. Other countries
are therefore right to seek to foster venture-capital industries of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the venture-capital industry gets bigger and more global,
more may not always prove merrier.
</P>
<P>
   To use the jargon of the new economy, venture capital is not
easily ``scalable.'' Traditionally, it has been a cottage industry.
Small close-knit partnerships each invested a few million dollars a
year, and partners spent much time advising and monitoring managers
as they built a firm into a sustainable business that could be sold
to investors in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists were often a small ``cluster,'' based in
such places as Menlo Park, Calif. Specialisms and reputations were
well-known, so would-be entrepreneurs knew who to go to. The
grapevine ensured that not too many similar companies were
financed.
</P>
<P>
   Now so much money is flooding in that it threatens to drown the
good with the bad. Successful partnerships are placing more, bigger
bets, and have less time for mentoring and monitoring. And this at
a time when problems such as recruiting the right people and
managing growth mean that start-ups need support more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Californian cluster of venture capitalists is now a loose
global network; the large number of near-identical e-retailers
launched in the past two years is evidence that the grapevine no
longer works.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to institutionalize venture capital through
``incubators,'' which aim to take an idea from brain to viable
business in a few weeks by supplying accounting, marketing and
legal advice in exchange for equity, or via publicly traded
venture-capital firms are, at best, unproven _ and will be tested
if the recent sell-off in tech shares continues.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in venture capital reflects the opportunities created
by the Internet. But it also reflects a stock market bubble that
has been particularly pronounced for initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The markets' tumble, which has led to the postponement or
cancellation of many IPOS, may stop venture-capital investors
taking a stock market flotation for granted.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just as likely that, after a short break, the game
will resume as before. That would mean that much of the money
invested in venture capital would continue to be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Does that matter? Part of the point of venture capital is that,
as in Hollywood, many investments yield no returns _ but those that
do then pay off by the bucketful.
</P>
<P>
   Too much investment in innovation is unlikely to be damaging in
quite the same way as too many buildings or factories. Yet the
venture-capital industry has thrived partly as a disciplined
risk-taking process that put as much emphasis on managing as on
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong lesson for other countries to draw from its success is
that, if you simply throw enough money at new ideas, it will stick.
That was the approach taken by investors in boo.com, the European
sports-goods e-retailer that went bust after frittering away $135
million. Too much fertilizer can sometimes be as bad for a plant as
too little. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ As the trade imbalance between the two blocks
widens, the most serious trade war of all time is surely looming.
</P>
<P>
   America and Japan? No, their trade gap is modest compared with
this. According to official statistics, the whole world is now
running a massive current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that we are importing much more from Mars than we
export to it.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, individual countries' current-account deficits and
surpluses should cancel each other out. But because of statistical
errors and omissions they never do.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from J.P. Morgan show that the world is expected to run
an overall current-account deficit this year of $245 billion,
equivalent to 3 percent of world exports of goods and services _
and that the gap is widening. In 1997, the world had a small
current-account surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the increasing global deficit is, by definition,
unknown. A similar problem emerged in the early 1980s when the
world also had a large current-account deficit with itself. Then
the problem mainly involved investment income: countries were more
scrupulous about recording payments than receipts, so as interest
rates rose sharply the gap swelled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the problem seems to relate mainly to
merchandise trade. Since 1997 global imports have been growing much
more quickly than exports. Philip Suttle, an economist at J.P.
Morgan, suggests three possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ironically, is freer trade. With less red tape it has
become harder for governments to measure trade accurately.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is the surge in sales over the Internet, which
official number-crunchers find hard to track.
</P>
<P>
   A third could be greater uncertainty about exchange rates since
the 1997 Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At such times in the past, exporters have understated export
revenues as a way of exporting capital illicitly. The snag with
this theory is that today there are fewer exchange controls that
exporters need to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Does the world's black hole matter? It might. Since 1997 the
increase in the global discrepancy almost matches the increase in
America's current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it is possible that the alarming jump in America's
deficit is an illusion caused by mismeasurement of its exports.
Sadly, that seems unlikely. America's Department of Commerce has
put much effort in recent years into improving the quality of its
trade numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely, suggests Suttle, that the errors lie in the
emerging economies: the current-account deficits of Latin America
or Eastern Europe may be smaller than reported, or Asia's surplus
may be bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Our preferred explanation, however, is that the Martians have
been dumping cheap exports in world markets. And come to think of
it, some of those ``green'' protesters in Seattle last year did
seem rather other-worldly. &QL;

   MARJAYOUN _ The bearded Hezbollah guerrilla puts down his load
of stolen Israeli grenades and turns to admire the view. Two
hundred meters (650 feet) down the hill, the Israeli workers
building a new defensive position to replace the one he has just
looted have left their bulldozers running and darted for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond, the odd car skitters about in the Israeli village
of Margaliyot. Farther below, the towns and farms of Galilee
stretch south towards the heart of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how they go?'' the guerrilla asks, waving out towards the
country whose soldiers have occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years:
``They leave everything and go like dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the denials of Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, his
army certainly seemed to leave Lebanon with its tail between its
legs.
</P>
<P>
   The troops pulled out in such a rush that the air force had to
fly in and blow up all the equipment they left behind. Near Houla,
villagers pointed out a tank left smoldering in the road. Its
occupants, they claimed, had jumped out and fled the last few
hundred meters to Israel on foot. Later, helicopter gunships bombed
the vehicle to stop it falling into Hezbollah's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Travelling in south Lebanon has become even more dangerous since
the evacuation, as hooting Lebanese youths teach themselves to
drive armored vehicles by a process of trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers who abandoned them were from the South Lebanon Army
(SLA), Israel's proxy militia in Lebanon; they also left impromptu
barricades of Mercedes Benzes and BMWs on the Lebanese side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The last stragglers crossed the frontier in the wee hours of May
24, as Israeli fire held back the guerrillas on the hillsides
above.
</P>
<P>
   As the Israeli papers morosely noted, Israel's carefully planned
disengagement from its unpopular and unwinnable war in south
Lebanon had somehow degenerated into a second Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the withdrawal was always going to be a messy
business. Barak made the pledge to pull out a focal point of his
election campaign last year. But he had hoped to do so as part of a
comprehensive peace agreement with both Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   When talks to that end collapsed, the Lebanese government, egged
on by its allies in Syria, went out of its way to make matters
difficult. It raised extravagant territorial claims, refused to
deploy its army to the evacuated areas, issued veiled threats to
send Palestinian fighters to shoot over the border and allowed the
guerrillas of Hezbollah to harass the retreating troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, it was unarmed civilians who prompted the
occupation's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, a crowd of Shia Muslim protesters led a march to
retake the village of Qantara, on the fringes of the occupied zone.
The Israeli army had withdrawn from the nearest front-line fort a
week before, leaving a Shia brigade of the SLA to cover their
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   When the demonstration arrived beneath their position, they
simply dropped their guns and gave themselves up to the Lebanese
authorities. Emboldened, the protesters pressed on, walking
unopposed into seven more villages and effectively cutting the
occupation zone in half.
</P>
<P>
   For two more days, the Israeli army and the remains of the SLA
tried to hold back the surge, throwing up hasty barricades and
shooting at people who came too close; seven were killed. But the
Israelis had left too few troops in the enclave to bolster the
faltering SLA.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of three days, over half of the SLA's 2,500
soldiers surrendered to the Lebanese army and Hezbollah, leaving
the Israeli army exposed. Barak had no choice but to order an
immediate pullout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Who's in charge now? As good as the guerrillas may be at things
like that, both locals and their neighbors in northern Israel would
like to see a more formal authority take charge. The Israeli
government has pledged to retaliate in force if anyone fires over
the border _ something any one of the thousands of armed and
jubilant men driving along the frontier road could easily do.
</P>
<P>
   The final collapse came too quickly for contractors to complete
the new defensive earthworks and roads they had been building on
the Israeli side of the border. They can resume work now only by
putting themselves in the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   In places, the hills on the Lebanese side rise so steeply above
the border that a determined guerrilla could jump the fence without
difficulty, or lob a grenade into one of the settlements on the
other side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question-mark now hangs over the Shibaa farms, an
agricultural zone straddling the frontier between Lebanon and the
Israeli-occupied portion of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Lebanese government suddenly claimed the area,
hitherto considered part of Syria. The Syrians, eager to make
trouble for the Israelis, confirmed the story.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Shibaa, the mayor waves old colonial
deeds which, he says, prove the land belongs to Lebanon. The
frontier was so complicated, he asserts, that different branches of
the same olive tree lay in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   But all the olive groves are firmly in Israeli hands now _ and a
supply route to the Israeli bases on Mount Hermon runs through
them. When it became clear that the Israeli army was withdrawing
from all other occupied territory, the Lebanese government hastily
reiterated its claim. Hezbollah backed it up with an attack on an
Israeli position in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the rest of the former security zone, the state
seems in no hurry to restore its authority. The electricity company
is already laying new connections to the evacuated villages, but
the army has not sent in a single soldier. Instead, the president
has said that Israel cannot expect peace on its northern border
until it allows Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Such brinkmanship is unlikely to do much for the Palestinian
cause. But it does risk dragging Lebanon into another conflict with
Israel, only days after the last one ended. &QL;

 BY MAUREEN WEST  
(PHOENIX) - Maria Elena Orozco is a shooting star, the first in her
family to graduate from high school and the first to attend
college.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's one of the bright lights that flash from the Phoenix
area's barrios, where girls tend to marry young and where high
school dropout rates are among the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Maria's family is amazed, and a little worried, following her
graduation last week from El Mirage's Dysart High School. She
enters unfamiliar territory next week when she begins classes at
Estrella Mountain Community College in Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Her college adviser, Juanita Parra, suggested that Maria start
college classes right away instead of taking the summer off. Parra
has seen too many children of first-generation immigrants fail
because they stopped to take a breath, giving in to bad choices and
easy pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old Maria understands: ``We are at a very
dangerous moment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her 16- and 17-year-old brother and sister dropped out of high
school though they are bright and hold high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of growing up Hispanic and female is sometimes
crushing: Hispanic girls lead teenage girls nationally in rates of
depression, substance abuse and pregnancy, all of which can be seen
as attempts to escape from overwhelming job, school and family
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanic girls live in two worlds, a traditional one that
encourages dependence on the family and a modern American one that
values independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult carrying the world on your shoulders,'' Parra
said. ``In Anglo families, normally the girls are taken care of.
Hispanic families ask their teenagers: `What are you going to do to
help the family?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Maria faces questions about why she isn't more
interested in parties, boys and marriage. People wonder if she
isnt' setting herself up for disappointment by shooting so high.
Her friends sometimes encourage her to put down her books and call
in sick for work.
</P>
<P>
   What inoculates her from such temptations, she says, are her
dreams for herself, and her love and concern for her mother, who
married at 16 and now works as a housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Maria says her mother gives her unquestioning moral support and
encouragement even if she doesn't always understand Maria's goals.
Maria plans to study communications and wants to become a teacher
or a writer. &QL; 
JUGGLING JOBS, SCHOOL &QL; 
Getting where Maria is today has meant learning English at the age
of 14, working up to 30 hours a week and carrying a full load at
school.
</P>
<P>
   Through high school, she would start her days at 6 a.m. and work
until midnight, then study late into the night, sometimes by
flashlight so as not to wake two of her sisters, who share a
bedroom with her.
</P>
<P>
   Maria, the oldest of six children, has been a dishwasher,
cashier, table buser and waitress. She has changed or lost jobs
sometimes because she didn't want to make excuses for her very
complicated obligations and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   At inopportune times, she is called on to translate for her
parents and grandparents or baby-sit the younger children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers don't understand my responsibilities,'' Maria said.
She is now working at a conven ience store near her home in
Surprise. Her boss has tried to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   The work and family demands facing Maria and many other Hispanic
students often put them out of the running for scholar ships that
require involvement in athletics, clubs and other activi ties.
</P>
<P>
   But through efforts by her teachers, Maria received a $1,000
scholarship from the Arizona Community Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Maria also had the help of Sun City West retiree Dick Orr, a
retired high school principal. Orr has been her one-on-one tutor
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   What they share is a faith in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Orr shuttled Maria and several of her classmates to Estrella
Community College and helped them with their college registra tion.
He helped Maria get a used computer. It sits in the family's living
room like a shrine, and Maria's brothers and sisters are learning
to use it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cares about me,'' Maria said of Orr, who wept on her last
day of high school and snapped photos at her graduation as though
she were his own daugh ter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not like other giggly girls looking for the next dance
partner. She'll reach her goals,'' said Orr, a former Marine, who
still wears a close-cropped hair cut. &QL; 
1-ON-1 ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   One of Maria's teachers, Susan Fernandez, believes the

AN INSPIRATION FOR ALL
</P>
<P>
   Maria's graduation party was the first-ever such event for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins, aunts and uncles came from around the Phoenix area and
even out of state to celebrate with a traditional Mexi can feast.
</P>
<P>
   Maria's mother, Virginia Perez, was filled with intense feelings
of happiness and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle, Homer Perez, said he is so inspired by Maria's
success that he may try to get his high school equivalency degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Maria can do it . . .,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   But even at the graduation party, old pressures were ap plied.
Other teen girls and rela tives asked: ``A good time to get married
now, Maria? You have finished your schooling, yes?''
</P>
<P>
   She told them firmly that she isn't done yet, she has a long way
to go. Adults nodded. Little ones treated her with admiration.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Maria's success may be catching. Maria
convinced her friend, Nora Car illo, who has been out of high
school for two years, to sign up for college with her.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria tutors her 10- and 13-year-old sisters, Ady and
Ibette, and other children in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A regular club of neighborhood kids gather around Maria's
grandparents' backyard picnic table for help with their home work.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be a role model, showing them what's possible. &QL;

FIRE (Phoenix) _ A fire burning deep into one of northern Arizona's
most pristine forests continued to defy firefighters Monday, May
29, racing up Kendrick Mountain and threatening a historic cabin
and a lookout tower. Smoke from the fire was threatening to close
Arizona 180, a popular road to the Grand Canyon. But a blaze that
caused evacuation of a Sedona-area campground and the closure of
U.S. 89A was more than half contained.

   HOSPITAL (PHOENIX) _ Some Arizona hospitals are hemorrhaging
financially as deep reductions in federal Medicare reimbursements
threaten their future. Especially at-risk are institutions that
care for the poor as hospitals compete with nursing homes, health
maintenance organizations and other health-care providers that want
Congress to increase payments to them. By DELLA DE LAFUENTE. Story

   MARIA (PHOENIX) _ Maria Elena Orozco is a shooting star, the
first in her family to graduate from high school and the first to
attend college. She's one of the bright lights that flash from the
Phoenix area's barrios, where girls tend to marry young and where
high school dropout rates are among the highest in the nation.
Nineteen-year-old Maria understands: ``We are at a very dangerous
moment,'' she said. Her 16- and 17-year-old brother and sister
dropped out of high school though they are bright and hold high
expectations. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A''

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Maria Elena Orozco is a shooting star, the first in her
family to graduate from high school and the first to attend
college.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's one of the bright lights that flash from the Phoenix ar
ea's barrios, where girls tend to marry young and where high school
dropout rates are among the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Maria's family is amazed, and a little worried, following her
graduation last week from El Mirage's Dysart High School. She
enters unfamiliar territory next week when she begins classes at
Estrella Mountain Community College in Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Her college adviser, Juanita Parra, suggested that Maria start
college classes right away in stead of taking the summer off. Parra
has seen too many children of first-generation immigrants fail
because they stopped to take a breath, giving in to bad choices and
easy pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old Maria under stands: ``We are at a very danger
ous moment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her 16- and 17-year-old brother and sister dropped out of high
school though they are bright and hold high expecta tions.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of growing up Hispanic and female is some times
crushing: Hispanic girls lead teenage girls nationally in rates of
depression, substance abuse and pregnancy, all of which can be seen
as attempts to escape from overwhelming job, school and family
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanic girls live in two worlds, a traditional one that
encourages dependence on the family and a modern American one that
values independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult carrying the world on your shoulders,'' Parra
said. ``In Anglo families, nor mally the girls are taken care of.
Hispanic families ask their teen agers: `What are you going to do
to help the family?''
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Maria faces ques tions about why she isn't more
interested in parties, boys and marriage. People wonder if she
isnt' setting herself up for disap pointment by shooting so high.
Her friends sometimes encour age her to put down her books and call
in sick for work.
</P>
<P>
   What inoculates her from such temptations, she says, are her
dreams for herself, and her love and concern for her mother, who
married at 16 and now works as a housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Maria says her mother gives her unquestioning moral support and
encouragement even if she doesn't always understand Ma ria's goals.
Maria plans to study communications and wants to become a teacher
or a writer. &QL; 
JUGGLING JOBS, SCHOOL &QL; 
Getting where Maria is today has meant learning English at the age
of 14, working up to 30 hours a week and carrying a full load at
school.
</P>
<P>
   Through high school, she would start her days at 6 a.m. and work
until midnight, then study late into the night, some times by
flashlight so as not to wake two of her sisters, who share a
bedroom with her.
</P>
<P>
   Maria, the oldest of six chil dren, has been a dishwasher,
cashier, table buser and waitress. She has changed or lost jobs
sometimes because she didn't want to make excuses for her very
complicated obligations and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   At inopportune times, she is called on to translate for her
parents and grandparents or ba by-sit the younger children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers don't understand my responsibilities,'' Maria said.
She is now working at a conven ience store near her home in
Surprise. Her boss has tried to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   The work and family demands facing Maria and many other Hispanic
students often put them out of the running for scholar ships that
require involvement in athletics, clubs and other activi ties.
</P>
<P>
   But through efforts by her teachers, Maria received a $1,000
scholarship from the Arizona Community Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Maria also had the help of Sun City West retiree Dick Orr, a
retired high school principal. Orr has been her one-on-one tutor
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   What they share is a faith in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Orr shuttled Maria and several of her classmates to Estrella
Community College and helped them with their college registra tion.
He helped Maria get a used computer. It sits in the family's living
room like a shrine, and Maria's brothers and sisters are learning
to use it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cares about me,'' Maria said of Orr, who wept on her last
day of high school and snapped photos at her graduation as though
she were his own daugh ter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not like other giggly girls looking for the next dance
partner. She'll reach her goals,'' said Orr, a former Marine, who
still wears a close-cropped hair cut. &QL; 
1-ON-1 ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   One of Maria's teachers, Susan Fernandez, believes the
one-on-one attention that her 40 migrant students receive from Sun
Cities tutors like Orr keeps them engaged and in school. This year,
Fernandez had only three drop out, and they left because they
needed to work for their families to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez believes her stu dents' need to work so much is a
major barrier to academic suc cess.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the money Maria earns goes to the family. This
summer she may start a second job in order to contribute more.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money Maria earns goes for the kinds of things every
teen-aged girl wants: a stereo, a phone and fashionable clothes.
She also pays to keep her old car running and insured, a constant
battle and expense in an area without meaningful public
transportation. &QL; 
AN INSPIRATION FOR ALL
</P>
<P>
   Maria's graduation party was the first-ever such event for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins, aunts and uncles came from around the Phoenix area and
even out of state to celebrate with a traditional Mexi can feast.
</P>
<P>
   Maria's mother, Virginia Perez, was filled with intense feelings
of happiness and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle, Homer Perez, said he is so inspired by Maria's
success that he may try to get his high school equivalency degree.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: In the eye of the beholder
 &HT;    For release May 31, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Many years ago, one of my wife's cousins gave her a gift
of old watch parts _ framed. She hung it on the wall in the
hallway. Shortly, my father came along, observed the framed watch
parts and told us that when the transmission falls out of his car,
he'll know what to do with it -- please save some wall space.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we didn't. But we found a place where an old auto
transmission can be considered art. It's the Georges Pompidou
Center, known to the French as Beauborg because the French don't
want to call things and places by the same name as the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou's exterior is rivaled by what's inside: you just
don't know what to make of it, and since all the placards are in
French, you get no help either. Ever been in one of those nouveau
California cuisine restaurants where everything in the ceiling _
the air conditioning pipes, ducts, conduit and whatnot -- are
exposed? Well, that's how the exterior of the Pompidou appears.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of the interior is more conformist, but not
what hangs from the walls or occupies floor space. That's where my
wife and I stopped dead in our tracks upon entering the fourth
floor of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   My father was here. Set in front of us was the transmission, and
a whole bunch of other auto parts, all compacted into a singular
rectangular mass of crumpled steel defined as art but exactly like
you see when you go to an auto junk yard where old cars are pressed
into scrap metal for meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pompidou, this is art. So is something that candidly and
movingly portrays all the stages of the digestive system from
beginning to end, and I do mean end.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to not being a fan of modern art but I have been
trying. There is some that, while I cannot possibly translate what
the artist had in mind when he began flinging his paint or pieces
around, I can grudgingly appreciate as being decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Also within the weird walls of the Pompidou, you can gaze upon
work by Dali, Picasso, Chagal, Calder, Miro -- somewhat traditional
non-traditionalists compared to what is going on a floor below.
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou is the last major Paris museum I have visited, this
being my sixth or seventh trip here. Several years ago, I decided
to have a try at it but was warded off by a pro-Bosnia
demonstration that was taking place in its courtyard. (Or was it an
anti-Bosnia demonstration?)
</P>
<P>
   This time, I persisted. It was there that the memory of my late
father was rekindled. My wife and I stared at the hunk of
compressed auto parts, then caught each other's eye in a gleeful,
knowing expression that, yes, Dad, your transmission made it to a
place far more exalted than our hallway wall.
</P>
<P>
   As we ambled along the aisles, we found even more interesting
things. Often, you are fooled. There were two obscured bodies under
blue blankets on the floor, their anatomies heaving in heavy, deep
sleep breath. Don't touch, it's art -- with a small compressor.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a mannequin clad in a dress made of dried meat.
Haute couture carpaccio? Or was it semi-formal beef jerky?
</P>
<P>
   We waited 10 minutes in line to see a special exhibit, of which
we had no prior knowledge. It reminded me of the mobilized field in
Homestead, Fla., immediately after the ravages of Hurricane Andrew
in 1992. A long line had assembled toward a field tent. I asked
someone waiting in it what he was waiting for. ``I don't know,'' he
answered, ``but there's something at the end of this line, and I'm
going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something at the end of the Pompidou line as well, but
once I got it, I didn't want it. Made to lie on the floor in a
round room, we observed a nine-minute, 360-degree film of the
encapsulated body of a young girl (clothed) in various known places
of the world (Times Square, Rome, Hong Kong, the pyramids of Giza,
etc.) No explanation, sometimes an occasional sound of car horns
for effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that?'' I asked upon getting up and leaving. ``Art,''
I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    The high-profile controversy surrounding ``Dr. Laura''
Schlessinger, the syndicated radio talk-show host and newspaper
columnist, came to Boston last week with a protest demonstration in
downtown.
 &HT;    The local protest_ one in a series of nationally coordinated
rallies that have been held in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los
Angeles and San Francisco _ comes at a time when the ``Stop Dr.
Laura Campaign'' is gaining considerable momentum.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Laura,''who holds a Ph.D. in physiology, but no degrees in
psychology or psychiatry,has rankled the gay community for some
time now, with her highly inflammatory, if not defamatory,
rhetoric. Schlessinger has referred to homosexuality as ``deviant''
behavior and a ``biological error.'' She also advocates
``reparative therapy,'' which attempts to ``cure'' people of
homosexuality.
 &HT;    Her current three-hour-long Dr. Laura Program is the one of the
most-listened-to radio programs in North America, with an estimated
18 million listeners on more than 450 stations in the United States
and Canada.
 &HT;    But a national gay and lesbian media watchdog group, as well as
Internet activists, public-relations executives and media
professionals, are asking Paramount Television to drop its plans
for Laura Schlessinger's one-hour TV program, scheduled to air this
fall. Gay activists nationwide are calling on various local TV
stations to drop the show, which stars Dr. Laura as the highly
directive advice-giver, who tells her listeners what to think and
what to do.
 &HT;    Spearheading the nationwide protests are the Gay &AMP; Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and an Internet activist group,
StopDrLaura.com.
 &HT;    GLAAD (www.glaad.org),with its mission of promoting and ensuring
accurate and inclusive representation of gays in the media, has
been monitoring Schlessinger's insolent language for nearly two
years.
 &HT;    Advertisers have started taking the activists seriously. For
example, Proctor &AMP; Gamble, the nation's second-largest advertiser
(spending more than $2.6 billion annually), announced earlier this
week that it will not sponsor the TV show and will stop advertising
on her radio program, according to a report in The New York Times.
 &HT;    Proctor &AMP; Gamble, which sells household staples, such as
Charmin, Crest,Bounty, Pampers and Tide, is considered to be a
trend setter in mass-market advertising. So other advertisers are
expected to follow suit as the Stop Dr. Laura campaign intensifies.
 &HT;    Some already have. United Airlines has also announced that it
will no longer run ads for Schlessinger's radio show in its
in-flight magazine.
 &HT;    ``Other advertisers, such as More.com, Toysrus.com and Xerox,
have either withdrawn from her radio program, announced they would
not sponsor her TV program or both,'' writes Stuart Elliot of The
Times.
 &HT;    The protest rally in Boston also comes on the heels of a
full-page ad, sponsored by NOW, the National Conference for
Community and Justice, the National Mental Health Association,
GLAAD and People for the American Way, in the May 24th editions of
The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. The headline reads,
``Ad time with `Dr. Laura' is for sale. Here's what you're
buying.''
 &HT;    What follows is a sampling from the ad of Dr. Laura thoughts
about gay men and lesbians:
 &HT;    ``I've always told people who opposed homosexuality that they
were homophobic, bad, bigoted and idiotic. I was wrong. It is
destructive.
 &HT;    ``The debate over gay rights _ Rights. Rights! Rights? For
sexual deviant, sexual behavior that are now rights? That's what I
am worried about with the pedophilia and the bestiality and the
sadomasochism and the cross-dressing. It's all going to be `rights'
too, to deviant sexual behavior? It's deviant sexual behavior. Why
does deviant sexual behavior get rights?''
 &HT;    If that's not enough insolence, here's what Dr. Laura said about
women: ``There is little reason left for society to respect women
as it once did. Women get knocked up. They don't marry. They have
abortions. They go to bars. They get knocked up again.''
 &HT;    The ad goes on to document more of Dr. Laura's hurtful comments.
Schlessinger thinks, for instance, that affirmative action for
women in the workplace ``has resulted in jamming many people into
roles that are unnatural for them and undesirable for the rest of
us.''
 &HT;    She's also said, ``It's downright criminal and immoral for any
woman to decideno matter how loving or nurturing she isthat she is
going to intentionally bring a child into the world with no father.
It's wrong ... It's like having a pet.''
 &HT;    Dr. Laura is a gas bag full of crude insults and hot air,
blowing directly on gay Americans and deriding matters of
importance to our community, including AIDS funding, gay and
lesbian parenting, gay civil rights, same-sex marriage, gay pride
and tolerance in the schools for gay youth.
 &HT;    ``It's just trash,'' said Wendy Kaminer, author of the book
``I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional'' and a fellow at the
Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, in an article in The Boston
Globe. ``It's the ravings of a highly prejudiced woman. She's not a
`doctor.' She's a pop psychologist. And as far as I am concerned,
not a very responsible one.''
 &HT;    It's time for responsible advertisers and television producers,
as well as radio-station managers nationwide, to put out the
garbageand along with it the ttrash-talking``Dr. Laura Program.''

 By VINCENT CINISOMO  
 &HT;    When Scott Gomez first laced up a pair of skates, he didn't
think that one day he would be blazing a trail for
Hispanic-Americans in the National Hockey League.
 &HT;    In fact, he didn't even want to play hockey.
 &HT;    But Gomez has helped make the New Jersey Devils a title
contender this year, leading all first-year NHL players in scoring
and helping his team compile one of the league's best records.
 &HT;    Earlier this season, he also became the first rookie to play in
the NHL's All-Star Game since 1996. And he's the leading candidate
for the Calder Trophy, the NHL's rookie of the year award.
 &HT;    Gomez, an Alaska-born Mexican-American, is the first native
Alaskan to score a point in the NHL. More significantly, he is the
first Hispanic-American to make it to the NHL.
 &HT;    As a kid, Gomez says, he didn't enjoy playing hockey much,
mostly because he wasn't very good at it.
 &HT;    ``I was always the one getting yelled at (by coaches and
parents),'' the 22-year-old player says.
 &HT;    But privately he fantasized about becoming great.
 &HT;    ``Playing in the NHL is something I dreamed about every day when
I was growing up,'' Gomez says.
 &HT;    At one low point, he was ready to give up the game when his dad
forced him to keep playing. Being the dutiful son, Scott did. It
wasn't that Carlos was a hockey fan or envisioned his son becoming
the Mexican Wayne Gretzky; rather, he had just bought his son a
new, expensive pair of skates and didn't want them to go unused.
 &HT;    Being Mexican-American and growing up in Alaska wasn't a big
deal, and no one focused on his ethnicity, Gomez remembers. Scott's
dad is a Mexican immigrant who moved to Anchorage to work on the
Alaska Pipeline. He met Scott's mom, Dahlia, a Colombian immigrant,
at a Hispanic dance.
 &HT;    Gomez knows some Spanish, but admits, ``I'm not really fluent
now because I haven't practiced, and I went to school in English
all the time.''
 &HT;    Plus, he says, ``My mom and dad were always fighting about which
dialect was best when we spoke at home. I couldn't decide which one
I was going to use.''
 &HT;    Today, he proudly acknowledges that he's a role model for young
Hispanics. But the very fact that he is in that position after just
one season in the NHL seems unreal to Gomez, who until last year
played Junior A hockey in British Columbia and for the Tri-City
Americans of the Western Hockey League.
 &HT;    Gomez has had success at every level of his career. He was a
two-time Alaska high school player of the year and tore up the
British Columbia junior league during his single season there. In
the Western Hockey League, an elite association made up of top NHL
draftees, Gomez had 30 goals and 78 assists in just 58 games in
1998-99.
 &HT;    At the beginning of this season, his only goal was to make the
team that he is now leading. And he hasn't stopped piling up the
points this season against the world's best hockey players. Through
48 games, Gomez led the Devils with 44 points on 13 goals and 31
assists.
 &HT;    Lou Lamoriello, the general manager for the Devils, couldn't be
happier for his Latino star. ``(Gomez) can see the ice as well as
anybody,'' Lamoriello says. ``He has a God-given ability to see
plays prior to them developing. It's not something that can be
taught.''
 &HT;    Gomez also is helping the league in its never-ending push to
``grow the game.'' Once seen as a northern, mostly Canadian sport,
hockey in recent years has successfully attracted children of
diverse ethnic backgrounds to its NHL/USA Hockey Diversity Task
Force.
 &HT;    Still, Gomez downplays his role in helping to change the game.
``I don't think of myself as being a Jackie Robinson or a Willie
O'Ree (the first African-American player in the NHL.) There's no
comparison between what those guys had to go through and how things
are for me today. I don't think of it as a racial thing. If any
kid, of any race or any color, sees me and wants to play hockey,
that's what it's all about,'' he says.
 &HT;    Kids who want to play hockey face steep price tags. It is much
more expensive to play this sport than, for example, basketball.
Skates, sticks, protective equipment and time on the ice rink all
cost money. Basketball simply requires a ball and a hoop. Hockey
also lacks the alluring presence of Latino superstars, especially
in urban areas such as New York.
 &HT;    The NHL's diversity program, which has 27 chapters in several
states, is designed to help economically disadvantaged children get
a chance to play the game _ a goal Gomez wholeheartedly supports.
 &HT;    In the meantime, he's inspiring those very kids by filling the
nets and fulfilling his dreams.

``grow the game.'' Once seen as a northern, mostly Canadian sport,
hockey in recent years has successfully attracted children of
diverse ethnic backgrounds to its NHL/USA Hockey Diversity Task
Force.
 &HT;    Still, Gomez downplays his role in helping to change the game.
``I don't think of myself as being a Jackie Robinson or a Willie
O'Ree (the first African-American player in the NHL.) There's no
comparison between what those guys had to go through and how things
are for me today. I don't think of it as a racial thing. If any
kid, of any race or any color, sees me and wants to play hockey,
that's what it's all about,'' he says.
 &HT;    Kids who want to play hockey face steep price tags. It is much
more expensive to play this sport than, for example, basketball.
Skates, sticks, protective equipment and time on the ice rink all
cost money. Basketball simply requires a ball and a hoop. Hockey
also lacks the alluring presence of Latino superstars, especially
in urban areas such as New York.
 &HT;    The NHL's diversity program, which has 27 chapters in several
states, is designed to help economically disadvantaged children get
a chance to play the game _ a goal Gomez wholeheartedly supports.
 &HT;    In the meantime, he's inspiring those very kids by filling the
nets and fulfilling his dreams.

 By DOUGLAS KIM  
 &HT;    In 1991, I wrote for KoreAm on Korean adoption. I'd been
involved in camps for Korean American youth since '76, and worked
with adoptees since '84. The article I wrote was titled ``Korean
Adoption: An Anachronism or an Expediency?'' But somehow it got
toned down to ``An Anachronism or a Necessity?'' I regretted that
because I meant ``expediency'' and wanted to convey the notion of
taking the easy way out.
 &HT;    After 10 years I'm wondering if Korea is still taking the easy
way out.
 &HT;    First a caveat: The foremost consideration approaching this
subject is that behind every statistic there is a precious,
innocent child. I admonish all who enter to remember that helpless,
tiny babies may ultimately pay the price for inquiries, criticisms
or politics brought to bear.
 &HT;    In the mid-1980s, 5,000 to 6,000 adoptees came to the United
States annually. This trend peaked in '86 at 6,275 adoptees. Then
the numbers dropped to under 2,000 a year from '91 to '98. What
happened to 4,000 children a year? Where did they go?
 &HT;    Did Korea suddenly eliminate two-thirds of its sources of
orphans? Had Korea's tolerance increased or social safety net
widened enough to account for this dramatic decline? Did Koreans
adopt those children, or were they institutionalized? Did they pay
the price for the political embarrassment that Korea's peculiar
institution drew from the Seoul 1988 Olympics?
 &HT;    Was it simply more expedient to institutionalize them rather
than face growing international scrutiny as several thousand
adoptees left each year? While I hope not (because there is no
question that any child is better off loved by an adoptive family
than a ward of the state), my suspicion is that political
expediency again won out over the best interests of the children.
 &HT;    Despite the severe downturn, Korea remains the third top
supplier of foreign adoptees. Since 1985, Koreans accounted for
30.2 percent (45,142) of all children adopted from abroad
(149,453).
 &HT;    While it's easy to dismiss these questions simply as criticisms
of Korea, we need to be cognizant of her development over the past
50 years. As Americans we tend to forget the struggles and changes
that took lifetimes in the United States: transitioning from
rural-based living to urban-based, from an agricultural to
industrial to information economy, from an extended to a nuclear
family and ongoing efforts for racial equality.
 &HT;    As Korean Americans we generally ignore that fact that much of
the access and equality we enjoy but take for granted was hard won
by Japanese Americans and African Americans. So it's not difficult
to understand why we _ myself included _ tend to judge Korea by
American standards.
 &HT;    Lack of sex education, stigma of out-of-wedlock birth,
unacceptableness of adopting outside one's bloodline and poor legal
protection for children of a divorce or separation, make adoption
the most viable option for many Korean women confronted with
unwanted pregnancy. The situation in Korean today is not unlike the
one in the United States in the '50s.
 &HT;    Korea has accomplished many dramatic changes that took
generations in the United States. Such rapid transition naturally
results in displacements. The ongoing supply of orphans shows that
change has outpaced society's ability to safeguard many of its
youngest members.
 &HT;    While we can rightly criticize Korea, we also need to know that
applying our standards to a foreign culture without understanding
the complexity of the society can be problematic. As one adoptee
explained, ``Korea can't turn on a dime.''
 &HT;    She can't change overnight attitudes that took decades to reform
in the United States. He pointed out that U.S. race relations are
still evolving _ over 135 years after America abolished its own
peculiar institution.
 &HT;    And we need to remember that for whatever other the reasons,
adoptions also continue because demand continues in the United
States _ creating beautiful, loving families. The end result _
placing a child in a family _ is far preferable to many
alternatives life in Korea would hold.
 &HT;    So where should Korean Americans come-down on this 45-year-old
practice? We need to encourage Korea to continue putting the
interests of children first _ not denying them access to loving
adoptive families abroad. We should challenge Korea to provide full
explanation why the numbers dropped in the 1990s, and to obtain
information about the whereabouts and lives of these children.
 &HT;    Promoting social change is a tall order, but somehow it doesn't
seem enough to simply acknowledge that our motherland is suffering
growing pains.
 &HT;    Recently the Korean government sponsored ``homeland'' tours for
older adoptees. While these gestures are well intentioned, I
question their worth. After 20 years working with Korean American
youth, I know identity is formed much earlier in life _ and not by
briefly being thrust into a foreign land amid strangers. Moreover,
the funds spent on tours may be better spent to help children in
the Korean system get better care, education or vocational
training. The funds could also be used for sex-education, or
protecting children's legal interests.
 &HT;    If Korea channeled her guilt and misgivings about current U.S.
adoptees into care and concern for children in their system now,
there may be less need for foreign adoption in the future.
 &HT;    It's interesting to speculate what changes may occur in 10
years. Let's hope that Korea's policy towards orphans will be
guided foremost by concern for their welfare and not on political
expediency. And that life for adopted kids in Korea will improve by
2010, but if not, that foreign adoption remains a realistic option.

THE WEIRD WORLD OF `THE BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT TRUSSELL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   They never watch television. They
never discuss politics. Books are just shelf decorations. They
rarely sit down to talk, and when they converse the subjects are
always the same _ feelings, relationships, needs and betrayals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children can grow from infancy to adulthood in eight years.
Recovery from disease and physical trauma is always fast and
complete, although those unfortunate enough to die of cancer have a
way of putting on weight as the end approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's an odd little universe that I've immersed myself in
virtually every day for 11 years. It's the world of ``The Bold and
the Beautiful,'' one of the last half-hour soaps on network
television, and it's an addiction I can't kick.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a theater critic watching a daytime soap may
strike some as mere slumming. Maybe it is, but so what? I take
solace in the great drama critic George Jean Nathan, who in 1923
wrote: ``The trivial is often the inspiration for something that is
not trivial ... A thousand trivialities are placed in the test
tubes of aesthetics that a single piece of sound criticism may
endure.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a few years ago, actor William H. Macy described
turning on his television one day and by chance seeing an actress
he had gone to school with performing in a soap. He watched with a
professional's eye and was transfixed. Her work, he recalled, was
as good as it gets, and he suddenly felt ashamed for all the times
he had walked through commercials and small parts on television
without really trying.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, daytime soaps _ or this one, anyway _ are much
like the larger world of arts and entertainment. Most of the time
it is bad (and therefore vastly entertaining); occasionally it can
be good (thanks to an individual actor or a burst of lively
writing); and once in a blue moon it stuns you with a moment of
utterly convincing drama or a bravura performance that transcends
all the ridiculous trappings of daytime television.
</P>
<P>
   A dubious attraction
</P>
<P>
   It all began innocently enough.
</P>
<P>
   One day I received a phone call at work from my wife. She
managed to speak through her laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to see this,'' she said. ``There's a woman that
looks like a man in drag! She looks like Divine.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to Darlene Conley, who has played rag-trade hustler
Sally Spectra since ``The Bold and the Beautiful'' went on the air
13 years ago. Conley, it's easy to see, was probably a convincing
glam-girl once upon a time. These days, with a red wig piled high
atop an increasingly spherical body, she inevitably brings to mind
Divine, the cross-dressing star of John Waters films in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as Divine did, Conley brings a sense of high theater
to the table. Her husky baritone, her biting enunciation, her way
of accenting a line with sharply pursed lip, all become ingredients
in an ongoing performance that seems a synthesis of grand diva
mannerisms and overbearing maternalism.
</P>
<P>
   How could I not watch? We began taping the midday broadcasts and
playing them at night. Early on I hit the fast-forward button
anytime Sally wasn't on, but inevitably I began watching complete
episodes. The long, never-ending saga of ``B&AMP;B'' began taking
shape:
</P>
<P>
   At the center is the Forrester clan, headed by Eric Forrester
(John McCook), internationally known fashion designer. He and his
wife, Stephanie (Susan Flannery), a master of devious manipulation,
reside in a Beverly Hills mansion with a curious decor that
includes marble columns and what looks like a bust of Julius
Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a Los Angeles warehouse district, Sally Spectra's
outlaw company, Spectra Fashions, often looks for ways to throw
banana peels in the path of the mighty Forresters, sometimes
enraging Eric and Stephanie by producing cheap knockoffs of
Forrester originals.
</P>
<P>
   At the time I started watching, silver-haired Eric had fallen in
love with blond-babe Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), a caterer
from the Valley who was young enough to be his daughter. She was
pregnant with Eric Jr. (now called Rick), even though she actually
was in love with Ridge (Ronn Moss), Eric and Stephanie's angular
son. Eventually Brooke would be married to Eric and Ridge, but
these days is madly in love with Ridge's younger brother, the
chisel-jawed Thorne (Winsor Harmon).
</P>
<P>
   If she and Thorne marry _ they were engaged briefly during a
location shoot in Venice _ that means Rick Forrester's stepfather
would also be his half-brother! And the whining Rick (Justin
Torkildsen), now a freshman in college (even though he was an
infant less than 10 years ago), is now pressuring Thorne to be
honest about his feelings for his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke, as a result of her divorce from Eric Forrester, owns 51
percent of the stock in the Forrester fashion house and is now the
CEO and wants vengeance on Ridge and Eric for sabotaging her
relationship with Thorne. Thorne is now miserably remarried to
Sally's daughter Macy (Bobbie Eakes), a recovering alcoholic
teetering on the brink of relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, although he still harbors feelings for Brooke, is
oh-so-happily married to Dr. Taylor Hayes Forrester (Hunter Tylo),
a willowy beauty whose medical specialty was changed from oncology
to psychiatry early on. This is their second marriage; believed
dead after a plane crash, an amnesiac Taylor spent months in the
palace of Prince Omar in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, during
which time a grieving Ridge married the available Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   The plot goes on and on, piling absurdity upon absurdity. There
was Stephanie's bout with amnesia, during which she lived homeless
on the streets. There was Eric's survival adventure in Iceland _ or
was it Greenland? _ with sexy Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman).
Brooke survived a period of ``reactive psychosis'' in which she
lived like a wild dog in Barbados. Sally stopped a gangster's
bullet but bounced back. Dr. James Warwick (Ian Buchanan) was
introduced as a renowned psychiatrist who also happened to be a
40-year-old virgin. Warwick was later held prisoner for months in a
dungeon by the psychotic Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's a singular picture of the world you get on ``B&AMP;B.''
There are no gay fashion designers, only straight men given to
macho bluffing and the occasional punch to the jaw. There's a
steady rat-a-tat-tat about physical passion and occasional
``incidents'' in photo labs or steam rooms, but rarely does anyone
get around to doing the deed. Women make all the major decisions,
while the clueless men are manipulated like pawns. Men never
discuss sports or sex, only relationships and child-rearing
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the show's surrealistic atmosphere are the occasional
guest performances _ Fabio, Carol Channing and Charlton Heston have
appeared as themselves. Phyllis Diller shows up as a wise-cracking
hairdresser. The late James Doohan (Scotty on ``Star Trek'') was
James Warwick's father. Tippi Hedren, star of Alfred Hitchcock's
``The Birds,'' was first seen as the wife of a child molester with
an aviary warbling off camera.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this silliness, a steady diet of ``The Bold and the
Beautiful'' reveals a debt to classical theater. In the mix are
vaguely incestuous relationships, internecine conflicts, ceaseless
scheming, frequent faceoffs, characters who talk (sometimes at
great length) to themselves, eavesdropping, intercepted letters,
babies switched at birth, mistaken identities, even ghosts. All of
these are found in ``B&AMP;B'' and echo the plays of the Elizabethans
and the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps because this show relies on many of the same raw
ingredients needed to make a film or produce a play, there are
moments that come close to validating the entire enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Those are usually provided by Susan Flannery, a veteran of
daytime soaps and prime-time television whose most memorable moment
in movies was leaping in flames from a penthouse suite in ``The
Towering Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   Flannery, who scooped up the outstanding actress award at the
Daytime Emmys on May 19, has a way of making the most implausible
dialogue sound reasonable. While some of her colleagues seem
challenged to say ``hello'' convincingly, Flannery throws herself
into a scene with a focused intensity that becomes a show unto
itself. When she tongue-lashes an adversary or reiterates her
hatred of Brooke, I remember why I tune in. Watching Flannery,
usually costumed in bulky pants suits, do her thing is a little
like being thrilled by a dance number in an otherwise tedious
musical.
</P>
<P>
   So tomorrow, my VCR will kick on at 12:30 p.m. and on Monday
night I'll watch the day's events in B&AMP;B World. Maybe Flannery will
be in top form. But if not _ if the wheels come off the plot, if
the writing takes a sugary turn, if actors struggle to keep
straight faces while performing with uncooperative babies, if they
stumble over dialogue _ I will be no less entertained.
</P>
<P>
   To quote Nathan once again: ``If one goes to a concert hall and
hears a bad performance or to an art exhibition and sees only bad
paintings, one's disappointment is complete. In the theatre,
contrariwise, the worst play and performance of the year may
provide the greatest hilarity.''

DIRECTOR, CAST PULL OFF SATIFYING CHALLENGE IN `TIME CODE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Director Mike Figgis shot his new
film, ``Time Code,'' 15 times, from beginning to end.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And since each version was shot simultaneously by four digital
cameras running continuously for 90 minutes, Figgis in effect made
60 90-minute movies of uninterrupted footage.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it all in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The final version _ No. 15 _ provides moviegoers with a genuine
challenge: a story told simultaneously from four vantage points
(the screen is divided into four viewing quadrants) that asks the
viewers to choose where they will focus their attentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's difficult, because you have to fight against
two completely different emotions,'' Figgis (``Leaving Las Vegas'')
said in a recent telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``You're
being told through the dialogue that something important is
happening down here in this corner of the screen, but, hey, that's
sex going on up there in the other corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are frustrated by not knowing where to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in Los Angeles and centered on the offices of Red Mullet
Productions, a film company specializing in movies of dubious
artistic merit, ``Time Code'' features a large cast of recognizable
faces who were asked to improvise around a plot outline.
</P>
<P>
   Typically four film crews, all starting at precisely the same
moment, would shoot the complete film for 90 minutes in the
morning. It would be played back in the afternoon, where cast and
crew would discuss what worked and what didn't. If time permitted
the whole enterprise would be shot a second time before breaking
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day things were going beautifully with my camera,'' Figgis
recalled, ``and then my little red warning light began flashing. I
chose to ignore it and kept filming, but had one of my assistants
call the technicians on his mobile phone. A half hour later he came
over and tapped me on the shoulder and whispered that my camera
hadn't been recording for at least 30 minutes. So we had to call up
the other three cameras and tell them to abort.
</P>
<P>
   ``And another time in the middle of filming an uptight traffic
cop tried to give the limo driver a ticket if he didn't move the
car. He was told that the limo was a prop for a film we were
shooting, but that didn't deter him. But what was great was that
all the actors around the limo stayed in character and the cop was
on camera. Jeanne Tripplehorn was in the limo, pretending to dump
her cocaine out the window. Everybody just kept acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors acting
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``Time Code'' being the movie equivalent of tightrope
walking without a net, some highly regarded actors _ Holly Hunter,
Stellan Skarsgard, Tripplehorn, Kyle McLaughlin, Julian Sands _
agreed to perform in the film for scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real opportunity to act,'' Figgis explained. ``The
situation we offered is very compelling for most actors. After all,
most film actors don't get asked to act all that often. Mostly
they're supposed to look good, and they know an 18-year-old with
better teeth or bigger biceps might replace them. Moreover, when
they do get a movie job, they're expected to maintain a synthetic
continuity between scenes which are shot out of order. The first
scene you shoot in a film could be your character's death scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for numerous reasons `Time Code' was a satisfying challenge
for the cast.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's bare budget and compressed filming schedule also
mitigated against on-set displays of power, Figgis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood cultivates ego trips,'' Figgis said. ``That's what
the industry is based on. But here was a situation where there were
no Winnebagos to retire to between takes, no dressing rooms, no
hair and makeup. The actors drove themselves to work. You got $14 a
day for wearing your own clothes. And there were no chairs with
your name on it. For group meetings you either carried in a chair
from the set or you sat on the floor. We created a temporary
equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the minute Holly Hunter turned up, the caliber of acting
in those scenes went up several notches. Same thing with Stellan,
who has an incredible reputation among actors. But neither Holly
nor Stellan behaved in a high-handed or egotistical way. They were
incredibly generous with the other actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial laughs
</P>
<P>
   Figgis chose to release version No. 15, chronologically the last
one shot, but he said several other versions were equally
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Version 14 I just adored,'' he said. ``It had things in it
which were so poignant ... it was a much sadder film. This version
we released is funnier and so probably more successful from a
commercial viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to do was release Version 14 in Los Angles and
Version 15 in New York and not tell anybody. Then after a week we'd
switch the prints and see if anybody noticed. You can just imagine
someone saying, `I don't remember this being so sad ...' ''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis admits he doesn't know if ``Time Code'' will be looked
back on as a harbinger of things to come or simply as a one-shot
oddity. He said he sees it as ``extending the menu, exposing a
wider audience to experimental work than just the people who go to
the art houses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Code,'' he said, should be seen as part of an
experimental wave that includes such movies as ``Being John
Malkovich,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and ``Three Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a war between one kind of film and another kind _
there's a huge market out there, with millions of people watching
films of all kinds. There's room for all different sorts. The key
is making those films available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of filmmakers out here making really radical
films, doing work that really pushes the boundaries. If you go to
the Sundance Film Festival you might see one of those. But if you
live in a town smaller than, say, San Francisco, you probably won't
get the chance because they won't come to you. The key issue is how
they get delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   One new delivery system is the Internet, which is upgrading so
quickly that within a year most computer users will be able watch
movies on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net has some real possibilities,'' he said. ``But at the
same time I share the sentiment of many of my peers: We don't want
a situation where you do away with the concept of a cinema, a place
where people gather to share an experience. That's crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative cheapness of digital moviemaking _ which can be
done with a minimum of equipment and which eliminates the need for
film developing _ ensures that more persons will be inspired to
pick up a camera, Figgis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that means there will be a million more bad movies
lurking about. But that's OK. There are already a million bad
movies floating around looking for an audience. I've no doubt that
we'll find a way of wading through those millions of movies so that
the good ones will emerge. They will be discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently Figgis is working on a documentary about performance
artist Laurie Anderson. After that he'd like to make another
multiple-screen, real-time movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about how I can revise these techniques and try
another genre _ perhaps a thriller or something like that. We've
just scratched the surface of what's possible.''

Chrysler's new PT Cruiser is fun, and so is driving it. It'll make

It's not that the Cruiser won't get up and go, it's just that it
somehow feels natural to not rush when you're going somewhere in
it, which is not something said about a lot of today's vehicles

 &HT;    A day without politics is like a day with sunshine
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My son has a saying: ``When Momma ain't
happy, ain't nobody happy.'' It's not original _ I think he read it
on a tee shirt in Myrtle Beach _ but it's true and right now, Momma
ain't too happy.
</P>
<P>
   The day got off to a bad start about two this morning when a
sudden north wind blasted me out of my summer sleeping habit _ a
Pawley's Island hammock on an upstairs screened porch. Blew the
comforters right off me and whipped the bamboo wind chimes into a
frenzy. Freaky weather, I grumbled as I picked up the cat and made
my way inside. She grumbled too.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets worse. I'm particularly tetchy this morning because
I have broken my own ``happy day'' rule by scanning the morning
paper before the coffee has finished perking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dueling presidential fund-raisers eclipse single-day record,''
is the first headline I see. Seems the Democrats pitched a blue
jeans, barbecue, and Bill appreciation shindig last night at a
downtown Washington sports arena, while a few blocks away
Republicans were hosting a more conventional black-tie dinner.
Between the two parties they managed to raise $40 million _ in one
evening.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of money, my friends, spent on chicken, peas, and a
whole lot of hot air, is obscene _ particularly when we know that
nary a suit there attended out of the simple desire to eat
Brunswick stew with some good ol' down-home folks, or to listen to
George W.'s daddy tell 'em how smart his kid really is _ in spite
of the dumb stuff he says when the dog eats his script.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue with Bill and Hill and Al and Tipper doesn't sound like
even five bucks worth of fun to me, much less the half-a-million
reportedly anted up by 10 unions and a few business executives for
the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many shekels would you shell out to tip a glass of
politically correct merlot with the congressional leader of your
choice? Not much, although I would like the chance to ask one of
them for a list of who's in whose pocket so I could stop wasting my
time complaining to all the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   ``China given full privileges'' is this morning's lead story,
and it's accompanied by a picture of Minority Whip David Bonior
(D., Mt. Clemens, Mich.) wearing a frown, Chinese dissident Wei
Jingsheng wearing an inscrutable look, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur of
Toledo wearing beads.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James P. Hoffa is against the bill, fearing
job losses for his members. Former Presidents Carter and Bush
strongly support the legislation, but it doesn't say exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   Then the news improves: ``Math solutions worth millions.'' This
headline makes some sense, I'm thinking, recalling high school days
when I would have offered up my entire fortune (35-cents lunch
money) for a solution to one of Verna Kimler's mind-bending
equations.
</P>
<P>
   For one New York minute I consider digging out an old college
algebra book (the one that looks like it's written in Sumerian
cuneiform) and having a go at cracking the Navier-Stokes Equations,
or solving the P versus NP Problem.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't be any worse than my monthly bout with the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   On page 16, I stumble across a headline that could go either
way. ``Hormone offers hope of reviving lost youth.'' Definitely an
eye catcher. So I read on. In Philadelphia, a 60-year-old gentleman
is smearing himself with a
</P>
<P>
   testosterone gel that he swears gives him more energy, allows
him to stay up later, and in his own words, ``do pretty well in the
sack.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the casual reader cannot know what doing ``pretty
well'' in the sack may mean to one man, this news cannot be all
bad. In fact, for the 60-something ladies who wouldn't mind being
hit on by an energetic guy their own age, it could be all good _
unless the macho guys overdose, get aggressive, and in a fit of
he-man chest pounding trigger WW3.
</P>
<P>
   So the news isn't all bad _ but naturally, the good news has
nothing to do with politics.

 &HT;    Lord, he's _ a Pibber?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Youthful rebellion takes many forms. My first
coming-of-age rebellion was to hide in the ditch when the piano
teacher came. It was the beginning of the end of lessons I
detested.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who didn't want to take swimming lessons in seventh
grade, defied her mother and got a two-piece suit to protest.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest son chose rebellion of a fashion as a middle-schooler.
He dyed his sandy hair auburn.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guaranteed, we told ourselves, that our youngest
son, now in the autumn of age 12, would ever fall to said
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he would disobey on occasion just like a kid. But he would
never make some sort of kooky symbolic statement that tossed
convention out into the slop or denounced his heritage. Not him.
</P>
<P>
   Then a few days ago he made the most jarring announcement ever
made in an ever-tranquil home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Dr Pepper. Mr Pibb.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr Pibb? This cannot be so. My son and Dr Pepper have been
linked almost since birth, sharing the same birthplace: Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could bite off ``c's'' and ``t's'' he was requesting
Dopper Pepper. Waco being the nation's per-capita Dr Pepper
consumption capital, he was contributing to the cause almost before
he consented to solid food.
</P>
<P>
   Two one-soda guys
</P>
<P>
   I loved Dr Pepper long before wings of fate delivered me to its
holy land. You can imagine how my heir's love affair with it
touched me.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot describe how his new dalliance pains me.
</P>
<P>
   We had a match for life, I assumed. My son, whose initials are
RC, would never be caught with any but DP. It was there for him in
good times and bad, for richer or poorer, for pizza party or
Amoxycillin.
</P>
<P>
   And then what happened in his sixth-grade year but a flirtatious
vending machine at school caught his eye. Based on a handsome and
blasphemous promotional contract, Waco schools vend no Dr Pepper;
Coke products exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was there that he tried this, this Mr Imposter. At first
I know it was in protest (I'd seen him turn up his nose at it in
restaurants). Then it came with less resistance. Then he was under
its spell.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who loves Dr Pepper is wise to the crafty attempts of
competitors in the industry to copycat the formula Charles Alderton
whipped up at the Old Corner Drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Dr Pepper Museum has an occasional display on these efforts,
showing all the Dr Fauxes and Dr Fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Fizzy forgeries
</P>
<P>
   Attempts at matching the Dr Pepper formula were made way before
the turn of the century. Maybe the first mass-consumed effort was
Dr Wells. Museum director Joe Cavanaugh blames Dr Wells for a
common misimpression about Dr Pepper. There's no prune juice in Dr
Pepper. None. But the imitator had it.
</P>
<P>
   Mr Pibb was Coke's venture into the field of Pepper imposters, a
field which continues to grow as super stores and grocery chains
make their own. A Dr Pepper Clone Page on the Internet lists 103
versions, from Dr A to Dr Zing. In between are such attempts as Dr
Perky, Dr Gulpster and Dr Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   And now my son has been seduced by one of them. When I sent him
away to school I figured all sorts of influences might change him.
He'd find ideas and and interests to which I'd not exposed him.
He'd find girls. But I never imagined that his schooling would lead
him into the arms of another soda.
</P>
<P>
   The indignity of it all. To think now that some of my
hard-earned cash is underwriting rank fakery of a national
treasure, here in Pepper heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Two can play this rebellion game. The next time he requests Mr
Pibb from me, I will dye my hair, wear a bikini and hide in a
ditch.

   COXNET WHEELS 0527: 2001 CHRYSLER PT CRUISER _ Looking at
Chrysler's new PT Cruiser is fun, and so is driving it. It'll make
you sit up straight, keep a grip on that billiard ball-like shift
knob and, on expressways, gravitate toward the right-hand lane.
It's not that the Cruiser won't get up and go, it's just that it
somehow feels natural to not rush when you're going somewhere in
it, which is not something said about a lot of today's vehicles
(DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes a 4-column

TIME TO SLAM THE DOOR ON SECRET EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Suppose
you were arrested and charged with a serious crime, but the
prosecutor refused to tell you or your attorney the nature of the
crime or the evidence against you. Doing so, according to the
prosecutor, would jeopardize national security. You don't know who
your accusers are; you don't even know the accusation against you.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sound crazy? Such Kafkaesque scenes are occurring in our nation
right now _ in the United States, not some South American
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act in 1996. It authorized the setting up of special Immigration
and Naturalization Service courts and the use of classified or
secret evidence against an accused that he and his attorney cannot
view. Only the special court judge can.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has used secret evidence in 75 cases against
non-citizens. There are currently 25 cases pending in INS special
courts which rely upon secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those accused using secret evidence are Arabs or Muslims
_ a kind of government-sanctioned racism.
</P>
<P>
   In any criminal trial in the United States, no matter how
serious the crime, a defendant has the right to see all the
evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Classified or secret evidence was not even permitted in the
trials of the bombers of the Oklahoma City federal building and New
York City's World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Use of secret evidence that the accused cannot confront or
dispute is against our nation's sense of justice and our
Constitution. Secret evidence, which cannot be balanced against
counter evidence, perpetuates a sham justice. It denies defendants,
who are the targets of that secret evidence, due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Amendment states unequivocally: ``No person shall be
... deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that the Fifth Amendment does not say ``No United States
citizen shall be ... .'' It says ``No person.'' That means
non-citizens also have the protection of the Fifth Amendment's due
process clause.
</P>
<P>
   But not according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
nor according to the anti-terrorism act. That act gave the agency
the power to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens on the basis of
secret evidence. Any non-citizens arrested by the INS can be denied
an opportunity to even confront the government's witnesses against
them or be told who they are.
</P>
<P>
   A few of those arrested non-citizens have spent as long as three
years in prison awaiting the final outcome of their cases. And when
their cases were finally taken out of the special INS courts and
into federal courts through appeals, the INS lost both on the
constitutional issue of denial of due process and on the flimsy
nature of the evidence presented against those accused.
</P>
<P>
   And strangely, although the INS could have appealed these cases
_ involving potential terrorists, according to the agency _ it did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even the agency could see their accusations were based
upon flimsy evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress, both the FBI and the INS claimed
that secret evidence used in all cases is ``substantive and
credible'' and ``is subjected to rigorous review.'' However,
neither the federal courts, nor even some INS special court judges,
who have the right to review the secret evidence, have found that
to be true. Most of this secret evidence turned out to be
inflammatory gossip and hearsay by those who had grudges against
the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Hany Kiareldeen was born in Gaza. He came to the United States
in 1990 to attend college. He was arrested in 1998 and accused of
terrorist activities, based upon a false accusation by his ex-wife.
He spent 19 months in prison before being released. The so-called
evidence against Kiareldeen was his former wife's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Mazen Al-Najjar, of Palestinian descent, has been in an INS
prison for three years. He taught at the University of South
Florida until he was arrested. He now faces what appears to be an
indefinite sentence. No criminal charges have been made against
him. And Al-Najjar cannot view the evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Ahmed, from Egypt, spent more than three years in an INS
prison, most of it in solitary confinement, before his release last
November when the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that he did
not pose a threat to national security. The secret evidence against
him was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., introduced the Secret
Evidence Repeal Act (HR 2121) to end this abomination against the
constitutional rule of law. The legislation now has 90 co-sponsors
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The act would strike down the use of special courts and secret
evidence against non-citizens. The proposed legislation states in
part: ``The alien shall have reasonable opportunity to examine all
the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien's
own behalf, and to cross-examine all witnesses presented by the
Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on
HR 2121. At that hearing, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., a co-sponsor
of the bill, made it clear in his testimony that HR 2121 ``would
not require the government to release dangerous terrorists. It
merely requires the government to choose whether to reveal the
evidence against a non-citizen whose liberty is in jeopardy, or
keep that information fully secret and outside immigration
proceedings and determinations.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, professor of law at Georgetown University Law
Center, testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He has had
long experience dealing with the INS and secret testimony. He
defended 13 Palestinians against INS charges that they posed a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said in his testimony: ``But it is not simply years of
human beings' lives that have been lost. More broadly, America's
image as a country that cares about fairness, openness, and due
process has been seriously tarnished. Secret evidence is a tactic
one associates with totalitarian regimes and military juntas, not
free democracies. A remedy is needed, and HR 2121 is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage, however, isn't only to our nation's image. The use
of secret evidence poses a significant threat to constitutional
constraints. If the anti-terrorism act can carve out an exception
to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, what other
exceptions will be carved out during times of perceived danger?
</P>
<P>
   Congress should pass the Secret Evidence Repeal Act.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot protect America by hacking apart our Constitution. If
we attempt to do so, we're in danger of becoming the despotic enemy
we so despise.

  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use
this article only by special arrangement. For purchase information,
see end of text. 
 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The best travel writing is about a meaningful journey, not mere
escape. In light of that, here are five great journeys to take to
the beach, the lake or the armchair this summer.
 &HT;    ``Fresh Air Fiend: Travel Writings,'' by Paul Theroux (Houghton
Mifflin, 2000; $27), shows the master in great form. Whether he's
writing about solitary cross-country skiing in the Maine woods,
cruising down the Yangtze River in China or paddling his kayak off
Cape Cod, Thoreau is a trenchant observer of people and places.
 &HT;    Most of these pieces have already appeared in magazines and have
been resurrected here. That's good, because some of Theroux's best
pieces are his shorter ones.
 &HT;    In ``Dead Reckoning to Nantucket,'' Theroux challenges the
notion that to experience adventure, it's necessary to travel great
distances. So he sets off from Cape Cod, where he lives part of the
year, and attempts to paddle his kayak to Nantucket Island, across
a stretch of open ocean that's known to be treacherous.
 &HT;    ``It was dangerous, it was unlawful, it was foolhardy, it was
forbidden. Catnip, I thought. Who wouldn't choose to paddle to
Nantucket?''
 &HT;    What makes Theroux a great read, apart from his terrific prose,
is the fact this is not mere location reportage. In an essay
entitled ``Travel Writing: The Point of It,'' Theroux notes that
``the travel book performs a unique function. A book has the
capacity to express a country's heart, as long as it stays away
from vacations, holidays, sightseeing and the half-truths in
official handouts.''
 &HT;    ``In a Sunburned Country,'' by Bill Bryson (Broadway Books,
2000; $25), is the latest work from the class clown of travel
writers. Bryson, the author of ``A Walk in the Woods,'' turns his
sharp eye to Australia this time. He writes, ``The supreme
emptiness of Australia, the galling uselessness of such a mass of
land, was something it took the country's European settlers a long
time to adjust to.''
 &HT;    It takes Bryson quite a long time to adjust as well, as he
drives, flies, takes trains and gets chased by dogs through the
suburbs of Sydney. Along the way, he examines some of the more
popular myths about Australia.
 &HT;    ``The thing about Ayers Rock,'' he writes, ``is that by the time
you finally get there you are already a little sick of it. Even
when you are a thousand miles from it, you can't go a day in
Australia without seeing it four or five times _ on postcards, on
travel agents' posters, on the cover of souvenir picture books _
and as you get nearer the rock the frequency of exposure increases.
So you are aware ... that you have driven thirteen hundred miles to
look at a large, inert, loaf-shaped object that you have seen
photographically portrayed a thousand times already.''
 &HT;    Yet despite everything, Bryson is quickly won over by the site
of the rock, as well as by Australia. This is a sharp, funny book
by one of the few travel writers who can provoke belly laughter.
 &HT;    ``Frost On My Mustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a
Loafer,'' by Tim Moore (St. Martin's Press, 2000; $23.95), is the
first book by an English writer who is very much in the
self-deprecating Bryson mold.
 &HT;    Moore sets out to retrace the explorations of one Lord Dufferin,
a Victorian explorer who traveled throughout Iceland and the more
remote island of Norway and wrote a best-selling book about his
exploits. Seasickness, the Scandinavian diet and a bicycle trip
across Iceland are what Moore encounters.
 &HT;    ``I'm going to get into trouble for saying this, but Reykjavik
is not lovely ... a hundred yards in any direction and you're in an
off-the-peg Legoland suburb, traipsing forlornly through colorful
but soulless tenements or having your holiday face blown off in a
wind-tunnel underpass.''
 &HT;    Moore is of the woe-is-me school of travel writing, where he not
only observes but experiences virtually every unusual or unpleasant
aspect of a culture. It can make for hilarious reading, even as he
strains for effect.
 &HT;    But Moore's constant references to English culture can begin to
sound like inside jokes to those who aren't clued in to English
politics, football and television.
 &HT;    Also worth noting is ``Driving Over Lemons,'' by Chris Stewart
(Pantheon, 2000; $22). At 17, Stewart was the drummer for the rock
group Genesis, before being replaced by a then-unknown Phil
Collins. He had further stints as a sheep shearer and travel writer
before moving to southern Spain and purchasing a ramshackle farm
called El Valero.
 &HT;    In the manner of ``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' he and his wife Ana
started a new life among peasants and shepherds, dealing with
drought, animal husbandry and scorpions. Others have tried to write
this kind of story, but Stewart, who is self-effacing as well as
humorous, manages to succeed.
 &HT;    Finally, ``Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings,'' by
Jonathan Raban (Pantheon, 1999; $26.50), remains one of the best
travel books of the year. Raban, who is one of the finest writers
around, sailed his ketch northward from Seattle to Juneau, giving
readers an eyeful of Northwest history, sea lore and his personal
travails. Grab it now, or wait for the paperback this fall.

 &HT;    ``In a Sunburned Country,'' by Bill Bryson (Broadway Books,
2000; $25), is the latest work from the class clown of travel
writers. Bryson, the author of ``A Walk in the Woods,'' turns his
sharp eye to Australia this time. He writes, ``The supreme
emptiness of Australia, the galling uselessness of such a mass of
land, was something it took the country's European settlers a long
time to adjust to.''
 &HT;    It takes Bryson quite a long time to adjust as well, as he
drives, flies, takes trains and gets chased by dogs through the
suburbs of Sydney. Along the way, he examines some of the more
popular myths about Australia.
 &HT;    ``The thing about Ayers Rock,'' he writes, ``is that by the time
you finally get there you are already a little sick of it. Even
when you are a thousand miles from it, you can't go a day in
Australia without seeing it four or five times _ on postcards, on
travel agents' posters, on the cover of souvenir picture books _
and as you get nearer the rock the frequency of exposure increases.
So you are aware ... that you have driven thirteen hundred miles to
look at a large, inert, loaf-shaped object that you have seen
photographically portrayed a thousand times already.''
 &HT;    Yet despite everything, Bryson is quickly won over by the site
of the rock, as well as by Australia. This is a sharp, funny book
by one of the few travel writers who can provoke belly laughter.
 &HT;    ``Frost On My Mustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a
Loafer,'' by Tim Moore (St. Martin's Press, 2000; $23.95), is the
first book by an English writer who is very much in the
self-deprecating Bryson mold.
 &HT;    Moore sets out to retrace the explorations of one Lord Dufferin,
a Victorian explorer who traveled throughout Iceland and the more
remote island of Norway and wrote a best-selling book about his
exploits. Seasickness, the Scandinavian diet and a bicycle trip
across Iceland are what Moore encounters.
 &HT;    ``I'm going to get into trouble for saying this, but Reykjavik
is not lovely ... a hundred yards in any direction and you're in an
off-the-peg Legoland suburb, traipsing forlornly through colorful
but soulless tenements or having your holiday face blown off in a
wind-tunnel underpass.''
 &HT;    Moore is of the woe-is-me school of travel writing, where he not
only observes but experiences virtually every unusual or unpleasant
aspect of a culture. It can make for hilarious reading, even as he
strains for effect.
 &HT;    But Moore's constant references to English culture can begin to
sound like inside jokes to those who aren't clued in to English
politics, football and television.
 &HT;    Also worth noting is ``Driving Over Lemons,'' by Chris Stewart
(Pantheon, 2000; $22). At 17, Stewart was the drummer for the rock
group Genesis, before being replaced by a then-unknown Phil
Collins. He had further stints as a sheep shearer and travel writer
before moving to southern Spain and purchasing a ramshackle farm
called El Valero.
 &HT;    In the manner of ``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' he and his wife Ana
started a new life among peasants and shepherds, dealing with
drought, animal husbandry and scorpions. Others have tried to write
this kind of story, but Stewart, who is self-effacing as well as
humorous, manages to succeed.
 &HT;    Finally, ``Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings,'' by
Jonathan Raban (Pantheon, 1999; $26.50), remains one of the best
travel books of the year. Raban, who is one of the finest writers
around, sailed his ketch northward from Seattle to Juneau, giving
readers an eyeful of Northwest history, sea lore and his personal
travails. Grab it now, or wait for the paperback this fall.

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    This summer, thrill-seeking mature travelers in search of some
excitement _ and a place to take their grandkids for a vacation
they'll never forget _ should head straight for Denver, where the
city's two best deals for seniors can be had at area amusement
parks.
 &HT;    Six Flags Elitch Gardens (299 Walnut) is the only theme park in
America located in the downtown area of a major city. The
$120-million attraction features more than 48 thrill rides,
including Mind Eraser, a mind-boggling inverted roller coaster that
travels up to 60 miles an hour.
 &HT;    For those who want to keep their to keep their feet planted
firmly on the ground, the park has elaborate flower gardens, a beer
garden and fun shows, including a Batman stunt show featuring
motorcycle stunts, high-speed chases and daring falls.
 &HT;    Admission is $30 for adults, $17 for seniors ages 55 to 69 and
free for those over ages 70. These prices also include entrance to
a water theme park with wave pools, tube rides, water slides and
raft float trips. For more information, call (303) 595-4386, or

exquisite schooling fish.

above sea level in the lush tropical rain forests of Sumatra and
flows to a coral reef in Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The target demographic for this column is married women in their
late 30s to early 50s. Middle-aged moms, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're reading this early in the morning, before you head
off to work. Maybe you're flipping through the paper while you're
at home waiting for another load of laundry to dry, or at the
dentist's office while one of your kids finds out if she's going to
get those braces off any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe you're not having a great day, week, month. Nothing
catastrophic going on in your life-but nothing very exciting,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Your husband is a good solid guy, but after 20 years of marriage
things are a bit tepid. When you tell each other ``I love you'' at
the end of the night, it's often said with about the same amount of
passion used to utter, ``Did you remember to walk the dog?''
</P>
<P>
   So yours has not turned out to be a particularly glamorous life,
and you're having idle fantasies about roads not traveled,
adventures not attempted ...
</P>
<P>
   Men you never kissed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if you'd actually trade your world for anybody
else's, but sometimes you wonder what it would have been like to
have a rich, sexy, wild, rollercoaster ride of a life.
</P>
<P>
   Well cheer up! I've got just the book for you, guaranteed to
make you feel eternally grateful for what you have.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not talking about one of those mystical self-help tomes
Oprah's always peddling. I'm talking about Cybill Shepard's life
story.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: by reading Cybill Disobedience, the sassy
autobiography from the fantabulously bounteous star of stage and
screen and tabloid, you'll be thrilled to have your relatively
mundane existence, I guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Shepard intended for her book to be a cheeky romp,
chronicling her controversies and conquests through a wildly uneven
career that includes not only great movies such as ``The Last
Picture Show'' and ``Taxi Driver'' and the terrific
``Moonlighting'' on TV, but also some of the stinkiest bombs ever,
e.g., ``At Long Last Love'' and the television adaptation of ``Long
Hot Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   I've always kind of liked Shepard. She's a big, brassy,
beautiful blonde who speaks her mind, even when her mind doesn't
have that much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Kudos also go to Shepard for often naming names as she punctures
the bloated egos of such male co-stars and associates as Elvis
Presley, Bruce Willis, Ryan O'Neal and even Joey Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the book is about sex _ specifically Cybill's
tireless, relentless and apparently often joyless bed-hopping. I
paper-clipped every page where Shepard names a new lover, and by
the time I was through, Shepard's 292-page book was fanned out
fatter than Frankie Yankovich's accordion.
</P>
<P>
   Among her partners, some pseudonymous, some named:
</P>
<P>
   First boyfriend, ``Mike.'' Second boyfriend, Gray _ better known
today as Gov. Gray Davis of California.
</P>
<P>
   More early boyfriends, ``Sam'' and ``Lawrence.'' John Bruno, ``a
wealthy restaurateur.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bridges, on the set of ``The Last Picture Show.'' And then,
of course, Peter Bogdanovich on the same set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Producer,'' while she was still with Bogdanovich.
(``Shuttling between two lovers did not preclude my taking a third,
or fourth, or fifth,'' adds Shepard.) ``The Director,'' described
as ``a craggy-faced man more than 25 years my senior who tended to
wear long gold chains and a thick gold ID bracelet and was married
to a famous actress.''
</P>
<P>
   A waiter at a resort where Shepard was singing. ``An agent ... a
married father of five.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Grodin.
</P>
<P>
   David Ford, who would marry Shepard. ``The Co-star'' on
Shepard's tour of the play ``Lunch Hour.'' Larry McMurtry, author
of ``The Last Picture Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Two stuntment who created a ``Cybill sandwich,'' in the author's
words.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's gynecologist. An 18-year-old, when Shepard was 35.
</P>
<P>
   Don Johnson. Another husband, Dr. Bruce Oppenheim. An Ayn
Rand-loving musician Shepard dubs ``Howard Roark.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybill even recounts her meeting with, you guessed it, then-Gov.
Bill Clinton, but she claims she told him, ``You know what? You're
entirely too attractive. You better stand on the other side of the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   No moral judgments here about Shepard's track record. If Geraldo
Rivera can write a piggish autobiography detailing his many sexual
escapades, a gal can do the same, right?
</P>
<P>
   It's just that there's something overwhelmingly desperate and
sad about nearly every encounter described by Ms. Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   So, target audience, read Cybill Disobedience, and I guarantee
you that life with Mister-Forgot-to-Put-Down-the-Toilet-Seat-Again
will suddenly seem like a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least a hell of a lot more fulfilling than one star's love
life.

   MIA-SLEUTHING (San Antonio) _ Progress in finding and
identifying missing GIs has been slow on the Korean peninsula,
where tensions remain high 47 years after a shaky armistice brought
an end to the Korean war but no official peace. So far the remains
of five Air Force veterans of the Korean War who had been listed as

The same angry conviction that spurred Wigand to blow the whistle
on the tobacco industry continues to compel him to rail against his
former bosses. By NICOLE FOY.

   CAVE-WRITING (San Antonio) _ An inscription discovered in a
Bandera County cave suggests Spaniards, possibly in search of
silver or native Americans to enslave, may have ventured through
the Hill Country years earlier than previously believed. If proven

said Thomas Hester, a University of Texas anthropology professor,

   SOC-SOCCER-FANS (San Francisco) _ It is a mystery that defies
easy explanation. Somehow, millions of soccer players have vanished
without a trace. An estimated 18 million men and women play soccer
in this country. Add to that impressive number the millions who
have participated in the sport since the soccer boom began a
quarter of a century ago. Yet professional Major League Soccer,
which is played in 12 U.S. cities is averaging only 14,000 fans a
game, well below capacity. By FRANK BLACKMAN.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The most unusual place to find
a grandmother and mother of four, nursing a broken rib, would be 25
miles out at sea, captaining a 50-foot sportfishing vessel looking

first professional female skipper on the Pacific Coast, running her

Something has to be done, or this won't be a city at all, but a
shiny theme park for the rich and the childless. By ROB MORSE.

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Maybe by next year I'll decide
if I prefer the new ballpark when the Giants are at home or on the
road. All I know now is that _ in this, Pacific Bell Park's
inaugural season _ the cozy little red-brick baseball stadium makes
me feel like a teenager with a major crush. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   NAVY-TOWN (San Francisco) _ San Francisco was once a Navy town,
but you'd never know it today. Not so long ago, tens of thousands
of bluejackets _ along with Marines, Coast Guardsmen and Merchant
Mariners _ swarmed our streets, drank our booze and hit on our
women (and our men, too, doubtlessly). White caps of sailors on
liberty were everywhere, but Market Street was the gangway into the
city and North Beach the galley. By SCOTT WINOKUR.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a lot of fun to be had in ``Mission:
Impossible 2,'' the action-packed John Woo movie.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the plot, which, unlike that of its predecessor,
actually holds up to scrutiny without the help of a Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there are the spectacular special effects and sometimes
breathtaking cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there's the trio of stars _ Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott and
Thandie Newton _ who cavort, canoodle, conquer and even collapse
while exuding at all times a staggering beauty and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years make. In the 1996 film adaptation
of the famous television series, Cruise's Ethan Hunt was a
clean-cut, close-cropped dandy who dashed about his business of
international espionage in sharp gray suits, french blue shirts and
matching ties without incurring so much as a wrinkle, a rip or a
loose button.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 version, Hunt has grown into a man _ a real man,
with a permanent three-day beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different film,'' said ``M:I-2'' costume designer Lizzy
Gardiner. ``It's much rougher, hipper, warmer and more romantic.
It's not about coldness and perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian-born Gardiner, who won an Academy Award for her work
on the 1994 film ``Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' (and gained
even more notoriety thanks to the American Express-card dress she
wore to the ceremony), spent seven months outfitting the cast of 15
main characters and 15,000 extras.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Getaway,' with Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen, was my
biggest influence,'' she said. ``I wanted it to look like there was
no costume designer. Today, things are rougher, readier and a
little more relaxed in the movies and in costume design.''
</P>
<P>
   For the character of Ethan Hunt, the farmers' son-turned-spy,
``What Tom and I discussed was a shared belief that this was a man
too busy saving the world and the girl to be vain,'' she said. ``We
never wavered from our view of the character, the heterosexual man
saving the world. That will be one of the aspects of the film that
will make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Gardiner dressed the star in unkempt, never-ironed
clothes a la Steve McQueen. ``It's difficult for a designer to step
back and let things go,'' she said. ``The film is more about the
character than about fabulous fashion, but at the same time, he had
to look fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner designed and made many of Cruise's outfits, as well as
relying heavily on Prada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I'm very reticent to get involved with fashion
designers, because fashion is dated by the time the film is out,''
she said. ``But Prada gave me complete access to its collection one
year before it was available to the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, adds Gardiner, Ethan Hunt ``is a guy who wouldn't
know who Prada was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the adrenaline-charged action scenes, Cruise wears brushed
cottons, washed moleskins and suede in muddy green, taupe and
black. His T-shirts, jackets, cargo pants and jeans are soiled and
frayed as if they had taken a beating from more than the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Dougray Scott's character, Sean Ambrose _ Hunt's strikingly
handsome former fellow agent-turned-adversary in love and war _ is
rather vain, unlike his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more conscious of his image, the way men are in L.A.,''
Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The results prove him right: In gray-and-black cropped jackets,
slim-cut pants, shirts and ties by Gardiner, Prada and Clements
Ribeiro, the 6-foot-tall, black-haired, blue-eyed villain makes
evil look very tempting, indeed _ so tempting, in fact, that one
wonders why the heroine's choice between Hunt and Ambrose (both of
whom she has, to put it delicately, dated) was not more of a
tossup.
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene, which takes up approximately one-third of
the movie, Scott packs a mean punch _ literally and figuratively _
in a highly unusual denim ensemble of Gardiner's design comprised
of a suit, shirt and diagonally striped tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough coming up with something that would protect
Dougray from the stunts, that was not flammable and that looked
fabulous for such a large amount of time,'' said Gardiner, who made
17 renditions of that particular suit. ``To be able to supply that
number of outfits for the stunts in order to protect active bodies,
you have to make the clothes yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott also wore a padded suit under his clothes to further
insulate him from bumps, bruises and burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stay away from the uptight, polished, preppie
American male,'' said Gardiner of the other male leads _ the
``rough boys'' _ whom she dressed in a mix of her designs, Prada,
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Diesel, and Australian labels Mambo and Marcs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, we call them `rough trade' _ they're dirty,
handsome and gorgeous,'' she said. ``I tried to bring my admiration
and respect for Australian men into the film.'' &QL;

 c.2000 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the summer of 1960, a young Englishwoman stood on the shores
of Lake Tanganyika looking into the hills of Gombe Stream Reserve
with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman spent the first months trying to catch up with
her subjects _ apes _ scrambling up cliffs, grabbing onto roots,
and then standing perfectly still so as not to scare them away. The
only way the chimps would tolerate her presence was if she lured
them close with bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a decades-long effort to follow around groups of
chimpanzees to figure out what they can tell us about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Her name, of course, was Jane Goodall, and in the years that
followed she would become an icon of both sober science and exotic
adventure. Before Goodall's work, chimpanzees were known mostly
from studies on animals that had been captured and imported to
indoor and outdoor laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Although psychobiologists like Robert Yerkes knew that chimps
were smart, no one was sure how they used those smarts in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Gombe nothing was known,'' Goodall said
recently. ``Chimps weren't allowed to have personalities _ no
names, no reasoning ability, no emotions. Until one recognized the
individuals, you couldn't work out the social structure, nor could
you make any sense of the communication. It was so confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodall's work changed all that. Her detailed daily records of
individual chimpanzees _ maintained these days by other
primatologists and field assistants _ resulted in the first chimp
personality portraits, as well as startling discoveries of
chimpanzee tool use, hunting practices and even murder.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning. For the past four decades an army
of researchers from Europe, Japan and the United States has
observed chimpanzees at more than 40 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, researchers from seven long-term field sites
combined their results in a landmark report in the journal Nature.
Led by primatologist Andrew Whiten of the University of St. Andrews
in Scotland, they listed 39 chimpanzee behaviors that go beyond
mere survival strategies.
</P>
<P>
   More important, those behaviors vary from group to group.
Chimpanzees, Whiten and his colleagues concluded, have culture.
</P>
<P>
   Critics wasted no time in raising objections. Culture means more
than just a set of learned behaviors that vary from place to place,
some argued; culture means history and tradition, art, philosophy
and religion _ the last barrier, together with language, that
separates humans from other species.
</P>
<P>
   Others voiced more subtle concerns: ``Are we measuring what we
really think we are measuring?'' anthropologist John Mitani of the
University of Michigan wonders. ``Just because it's different at
two different places _ is it culture?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate boils down to semantics as much as science, and it
largely misses the point. The fact that different chimps learn
different ways to act hardly makes them human _ it may not even
make them cultural. But it does raise a far more intriguing
question: What can those learned behaviors tell us about the
origins and purpose of human culture?
</P>

   The Bossou Nature Reserve in the Republic of Guinea pops up from
the West African plain like a green thumb. Today, a village sits at
the base of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   As one walks up the hillside, the hubbub of people fades away,
and the air begins to ring with hollow knocks and smacks. It's a
group of chimpanzees sitting together cracking nuts.
</P>
<P>
   An old female grabs a heavy stone and makes sure it's flat, then
wedges another stone underneath it to keep it from rocking. She
places an oil palm nut on top, into a spot worn smooth from hours
of smashing. Holding a lighter stone in her hand, she raises it
high above her head and slams it down, crushing the nut to pieces.
She then delicately picks out the nut meats and chews them
contemplatively.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this scene so interesting is not just that chimps are
smart enough to figure out how to crack hard-shelled nuts, but that
their method of doing so is specific to West Africa. In the Handle
Mountains in East Africa, chimpanzees walk right by those nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, nut-cracking takes years to master. When young chimps
at Bossou try their hand at it, primatologist Tetsuro Matsuzawa has
found, the nuts keep slipping off the flat stone. It takes years of
watching how it's done before the youngsters get anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nut-cracking has all the elements of a cultural behavior: It
only occurs at some sites and is passed down by learning and
imitation.
</P>
<P>
   But other presumed cultural differences are more subtle. For
example, John Mitani has found that male chimpanzees' pant-hoots
crescendo differently depending on where they live.
</P>
<P>
   At one site, the calls sound like a train slowly leaving the
station, gradually accelerating toward a scream. Elsewhere the
buildup is faster, higher-pitched and more frantic.
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing still, males at each site seem to modulate their
voices so that their calls sound alike. By doing so, they are
presumably announcing their joint presence and confirming that they
belong to the same group.
</P>
<P>
   Mitani tentatively calls these different pant-hoots
``dialects,'' but he acknowledges that what he hears may be a
product of differences in body size, genes or habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be fair to compare the calls produced by West
African chimps, who are larger and have deeper voices, with small
East African chimps,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the calls don't seem to be tailored to their habitats
either. In the Mahale Mountains, 90 miles south of Gombe,
low-pitched calls would carry farthest, yet the chimps have
relatively high voices. In Gombe's open woodland, high-pitched
calls would travel best, but the chimps have low voices.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the differences in calls are learned, some linguists
might question Mitani's terms. When people are said to speak a
dialect, the term means more than just distinctive sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialects are two versions of a language that are still
mutually comprehensible,'' says Robbins Burling, a linguist at the
University of Michigan. Or as Massachusetts Institute of Technology
psychologist Steven Pinker puts it: ``The standard definition is
that a language is a dialect with an army and a navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinker is quick to add that Mitani's use of the term is
``innocuous.'' But even the most open-minded linguist or
primatologist wouldn't say that chimpanzees speak a language.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? Do chimpanzees have to be so much like humans to
have culture? The answer depends on your definition of culture _
and a dozen anthropologists will give you a dozen different
definitions.
</P>
<P>
   If, as some say, culture is any learned behavior that is shared
by a collective, chimpanzees easily make the grade. As Barbara
Miller, a cultural anthropologist at the George Washington
University, puts it: ``If we take a broader approach to culture, as
I do, and include foraging behavior and sex, much of what
chimpanzees do would be considered culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But other anthropologists are more discriminating. Culture, they
argue, is what people say and think, not what they do; it deals
with symbols and meaning rather than behavior. Practicing a
religion is cultural, according to this definition; plowing a field
is not. If that's the case, chimpanzees will never join the culture
club.
</P>
<P>
   To deepen our concept of their culture, primatologists will have
to learn more about chimps' interpersonal relationships. Do chimps
from various sites treat each other differently? Are the customs
and manners of East African chimps as different from those of West
African chimps as, say, Samoans' are from Icelanders'?
</P>
<P>
   ``I now regard chimpanzees as a very big mystery,'' says
anthropologist Vernon Reynolds, who works in Uganda's Budongo
Forest. ``The more we find out, the less we understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the fall, Goodall took some time away from her most
recent book tour _ and plans for yet another African safari _ to
talk about the chimp culture studies. The new findings hardly come
as a surprise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote an article in 1973 saying that the big challenge now
is to learn about cultural variation.'' As for the definition of
culture, she still uses the one she has always used: ``It's simple.
You just have to prove that the behavior is passed down through
observational learning, rather than instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps chimpanzees are more guided by cultural rules in their
day-to-day interactions than we realize. Or perhaps some of the
activities that we consider patently cultural _ in humans as well
as chimps _ are really shaped by the environment.

<P>
   In the summer of 1960, a young Englishwoman stood on the shores
of Lake Tanganyika looking into the hills of Gombe Stream Reserve
with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman spent the first months trying to catch up with
her subjects _ apes _ scrambling up cliffs, grabbing onto roots,
and then standing perfectly still so as not to scare them away. The
only way the chimps would tolerate her presence was if she lured
them close with bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a decades-long effort to follow around groups of
chimpanzees to figure out what they can tell us about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Her name, of course, was Jane Goodall, and in the years that
followed she would become an icon of both sober science and exotic
adventure. Before Goodall's work, chimpanzees were known mostly
from studies on animals that had been captured and imported to
indoor and outdoor laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Although psychobiologists like Robert Yerkes knew that chimps
were smart, no one was sure how they used those smarts in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Gombe nothing was known,'' Goodall said
recently. ``Chimps weren't allowed to have personalities _ no
names, no reasoning ability, no emotions. Until one recognized the
individuals, you couldn't work out the social structure, nor could
you make any sense of the communication. It was so confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodall's work changed all that. Her detailed daily records of
individual chimpanzees _ maintained these days by other
primatologists and field assistants _ resulted in the first chimp
personality portraits, as well as startling discoveries of
chimpanzee tool use, hunting practices and even murder.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning. For the past four decades an army
of researchers from Europe, Japan and the United States has
observed chimpanzees at more than 40 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, researchers from seven long-term field sites
combined their results in a landmark report in the journal Nature.
Led by primatologist Andrew Whiten of the University of St. Andrews
in Scotland, they listed 39 chimpanzee behaviors that go beyond
mere survival strategies.
</P>
<P>
   More important, those behaviors vary from group to group.
Chimpanzees, Whiten and his colleagues concluded, have culture.
</P>
<P>
   Critics wasted no time in raising objections. Culture means more
than just a set of learned behaviors that vary from place to place,
some argued; culture means history and tradition, art, philosophy
and religion _ the last barrier, together with language, that
separates humans from other species.
</P>
<P>
   Others voiced more subtle concerns: ``Are we measuring what we
really think we are measuring?'' anthropologist John Mitani of the
University of Michigan wonders. ``Just because it's different at
two different places _ is it culture?''
</P>
<P>
   The debate boils down to semantics as much as science, and it
largely misses the point. The fact that different chimps learn
different ways to act hardly makes them human _ it may not even
make them cultural. But it does raise a far more intriguing
question: What can those learned behaviors tell us about the
origins and purpose of human culture?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Bossou Nature Reserve in the Republic of Guinea pops up from
the West African plain like a green thumb. Today, a village sits at
the base of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   As one walks up the hillside, the hubbub of people fades away,
and the air begins to ring with hollow knocks and smacks. It's a
group of chimpanzees sitting together cracking nuts.
</P>

<P>
   Four pounds doesn't feel like a lot when it's a bag of groceries
you're schlepping out to the parking lot. But if you're lugging it
up to the top of Mount Everest, four extra pounds in your pack can
feel like a ton.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers who took a four-pound GPS receiver to the summit of
the world's highest mountain last year were convinced nonetheless
that the extra weight would be worth the effort. That's because GPS
_ short for ``global positioning system,'' a satellite-based
network that uses radio signals to determine location _ can gauge a
mountain's height with an accuracy unequaled by standard surveying
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Mapmakers hope the new technology will bring some finality to a
field long plagued by fuzzy numbers. But like most alpine pursuits,
the urge to quantify Everest is largely metaphysical: They measure
it because it's there.
</P>
<P>
   Mountains don't have ``official'' elevations, since there's no
officially designated international body to sort out competing
claims. And the claims do compete: Estimates of Everest's height,
for example, have differed by more than 100 feet since British
surveyors spied `Peak 15' in the mid-1800s. Those geographers
instantly suspected that they were looking at the highest mountain
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their calculations, made from six sites on the low and distant
plains of India, put its altitude at 29,002 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, a second survey, which added several
stations in the mountains to the east, gave an elevation of 29,141
feet.
</P>
<P>
   When Nepal opened its borders in the 1950s, Indian surveyors
were able to get closer to the mountain than ever before, and the
average of their 12 readings resulted in the elevation most widely
cited today: 29,028 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cartographers now have many reasons to doubt this number.
Although the Indian survey was meticulous, it preceded the
discovery of movements in the Earth's crust, called plate
tectonics, that revolutionized studies of geological features.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, for example, that the entire Himalayan range is
creeping toward China at a rate of about five centimeters a year,
shifting Mount Everest's latitude ever northward.
</P>
<P>
   And geophysicists have since devised an improved model of the
shape of the Earth, called the geoid, that is crucial for
determining sea level at any specified location. Given that exact
measurements of both latitude and sea level are required to
calculate altitude, the Indian figure has become suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GPS technology has turned into the darling of
cartographers and geophysicists alike, because its accuracy is far
less dependent on unpredictable variables such as human eyesight
and hazy skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The precision of GPS means that, if you visit a place once,
you can measure where it is for the cartographer, and if you visit
it several times, you can find out how fast it's moving for the
geophysicist,'' says Charles Corfield, science manager for the last
two years of the Everest expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional surveying, however, GPS requires that you
visit the place itself _ no mean feat, when that place is higher
than some jet flight paths.
</P>
<P>
   The Everest project was born of a collaboration between one of
America's preeminent cartographers, Bradford Washburn of the Boston
Museum of Science, and geophysicist Roger Bilham of the University
of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his definitive maps of Mount McKinley and the Grand
Canyon, Washburn _ who turns 90 in June _ had crowned his career in
the late 1980s with a detailed Everest topographical map.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, as GPS receivers started to shrink,
Washburn's hankering to use the new technology to remeasure the
grand mountain grew. He contacted Bilham, who was setting up GPS
stations in India, Tibet and Nepal to monitor earthquake hazards
caused by the ongoing collision of crustal plates that had created
the Himalayan range. The two secured funding, and by 1995 the first
crew was crawling up the glacial sheets above base camp.
</P>
<P>
   Only one GPS receiver is necessary for determining location, but
pinpointing altitude is a bit trickier. To get a good, fast fix on
the summit position, the Everest climbers had to coordinate their
GPS readings with those of two other receivers: one running near
base camp at 18,000 feet, and one perched on a 26,000-foot saddle
called the South Col, a mile from the top.
</P>
<P>
   Determined teams of scientists, guides and Sherpas would make
five attempts in five consecutive years. But bad weather and the
misfortunes of other climbers foiled their efforts until the
morning of May 5, 1999, when two guides and five Sherpas reached
the top after a five-day climb and ran their receiver for 56
minutes _ about half an hour longer than was strictly required.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had wonderful conditions _ there was very little wind,
and it was 16 degrees below zero, which is absolutely torrid for
the top of Everest,'' Washburn says.
</P>
<P>
   The reading gives the distance from the top of the mountain to
the Earth's center, which GPS has helped to locate with
unprecedented precision.
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest version of the geoid, Bilham and his colleagues
then translated that number into a height above sea level. The
figure they arrived at was announced in November at the annual
meeting of the American Alpine Club: 29,035 feet. The margin of
error is plus or minus seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have questioned the payoff of such herculean
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us still don't really agree with this number,'' says
Fred Blume, a colleague of Bilham's at the University of Colorado.
``We're claiming that it's better, but it's only accurate to seven
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is due to the geoid. Finding sea level in the
Himalayan range is notoriously difficult, because it requires
gravity measurements taken on location in a dense grid _ an
endeavor that the precipitous terrain virtually prohibits.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the snow problem. All estimates of Everest's
elevation, including the latest one, have measured the height of
the snowpack on the summit, not the summit itself. No one knows how
deep the snowpack goes.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Corfield, it's thought to vary by at least three feet
during the course of each year, as monsoons dump the white stuff in
summer and wind scours it down all winter.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters even more, each year the Himalaya are
being pushed upward about five to eight millimeters as the Indian
subcontinent dives under Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this uncertainty, the GPS measurement of
Everest illustrates the difficulty of deploying a precise
technology in an imprecise world _ a world full of seasonally
variable snowpacks and sketchy gravity profiles and tectonic
pirouettes.
</P>
<P>
   For cartographers and geophysicists alike, it represents a
baseline of a sort that has never been available before, one that
can serve as a point of departure for future calculations as other
parameters of geophysics and cartography are refined.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do know now, without a doubt, how far the snow on top
of the world's highest mountain is from the center of the Earth.
It's up to posterity to conquer the other obstacles of altitude:
what sea level is, how deep the snow goes, where the continents are
drifting, and how fast a really big mountain is reaching up to the
sky.

   At the turn of the century, a second survey, which added several
stations in the mountains to the east, gave an elevation of 29,141
feet.
</P>
<P>
   When Nepal opened its borders in the 1950s, Indian surveyors
were able to get closer to the mountain than ever before, and the
average of their 12 readings resulted in the elevation most widely
cited today: 29,028 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cartographers now have many reasons to doubt this number.
Although the Indian survey was meticulous, it preceded the
discovery of movements in the Earth's crust, called plate
tectonics, that revolutionized studies of geological features.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, for example, that the entire Himalayan range is
creeping toward China at a rate of about five centimeters a year,
shifting Mount Everest's latitude ever northward.
</P>
<P>
   And geophysicists have since devised an improved model of the
shape of the Earth, called the geoid, that is crucial for
determining sea level at any specified location. Given that exact
measurements of both latitude and sea level are required to
calculate altitude, the Indian figure has become suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GPS technology has turned into the darling of
cartographers and geophysicists alike, because its accuracy is far
less dependent on unpredictable variables such as human eyesight
and hazy skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The precision of GPS means that, if you visit a place once,
you can measure where it is for the cartographer, and if you visit
it several times, you can find out how fast it's moving for the
geophysicist,'' says Charles Corfield, science manager for the last
two years of the Everest expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional surveying, however, GPS requires that you
visit the place itself _ no mean feat, when that place is higher
than some jet flight paths.
</P>
<P>
   The Everest project was born of a collaboration between one of
America's preeminent cartographers, Bradford Washburn of the Boston
Museum of Science, and geophysicist Roger Bilham of the University
of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his definitive maps of Mount McKinley and the Grand
Canyon, Washburn _ who turns 90 in June _ had crowned his career in
the late 1980s with a detailed Everest topographical map.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, as GPS receivers started to shrink,
Washburn's hankering to use the new technology to remeasure the
grand mountain grew. He contacted Bilham, who was setting up GPS
stations in India, Tibet and Nepal to monitor earthquake hazards
caused by the ongoing collision of crustal plates that had created
the Himalayan range. The two secured funding, and by 1995 the first
crew was crawling up the glacial sheets above base camp.
</P>
<P>
   Only one GPS receiver is necessary for determining location, but
pinpointing altitude is a bit trickier. To get a good, fast fix on
the summit position, the Everest climbers had to coordinate their
GPS readings with those of two other receivers: one running near
base camp at 18,000 feet, and one perched on a 26,000-foot saddle
called the South Col, a mile from the top.
</P>
<P>
   Determined teams of scientists, guides and Sherpas would make
five attempts in five consecutive years. But bad weather and the
misfortunes of other climbers foiled their efforts until the
morning of May 5, 1999, when two guides and five Sherpas reached
the top after a five-day climb and ran their receiver for 56
minutes _ about half an hour longer than was strictly required.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had wonderful conditions _ there was very little wind,
and it was 16 degrees below zero, which is absolutely torrid for
the top of Everest,'' Washburn says.
</P>
<P>
   The reading gives the distance from the top of the mountain to
the Earth's center, which GPS has helped to locate with
unprecedented precision.
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest version of the geoid, Bilham and his colleagues
then translated that number into a height above sea level. The
figure they arrived at was announced in November at the annual
meeting of the American Alpine Club: 29,035 feet. The margin of
error is plus or minus seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have questioned the payoff of such herculean
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us still don't really agree with this number,'' says
Fred Blume, a colleague of Bilham's at the University of Colorado.
``We're claiming that it's better, but it's only accurate to seven
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is due to the geoid. Finding sea level in the
Himalayan range is notoriously difficult, because it requires
gravity measurements taken on location in a dense grid _ an
endeavor that the precipitous terrain virtually prohibits.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the snow problem. All estimates of Everest's
elevation, including the latest one, have measured the height of
the snowpack on the summit, not the summit itself. No one knows how
deep the snowpack goes.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Corfield, it's thought to vary by at least three feet
during the course of each year, as monsoons dump the white stuff in
summer and wind scours it down all winter.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters even more, each year the Himalaya are
being pushed upward about five to eight millimeters as the Indian
subcontinent dives under Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this uncertainty, the GPS measurement of
Everest illustrates the difficulty of deploying a precise
technology in an imprecise world _ a world full of seasonally
variable snowpacks and sketchy gravity profiles and tectonic
pirouettes.
</P>
<P>
   For cartographers and geophysicists alike, it represents a
baseline of a sort that has never been available before, one that
can serve as a point of departure for future calculations as other
parameters of geophysics and cartography are refined.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do know now, without a doubt, how far the snow on top
of the world's highest mountain is from the center of the Earth.
It's up to posterity to conquer the other obstacles of altitude:
what sea level is, how deep the snow goes, where the continents are
drifting, and how fast a really big mountain is reaching up to the
sky.

   MAGAZINE REVIEWS -------
</P>
<P>
   ``ATLANTIC MONTHLY''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating cover story suggests that the Unabomber was actually
born at Harvard, which gave Ted Kaczynski his first taste of higher
education. Story notes that Kaczynski, who was 16 when he arrived
in Cambridge, Mass., was the subject of a brutal series of
psychological tests that may have started him down the road to
mental illness. His anti-technology bent also may have formed there
as a reaction to curriculum that preached that science was the one
true belief and faith and morality were just window dressing. It's
interesting to note that the piece is written by Alston Chase, a
Harvard graduate and mathematician who, like Kaczynski, moved to
the Montana wilderness in the early 1970s. Another story calls
White working class males the ``forgotten majority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NEW YORKER''
</P>
<P>
   Long piece questions the actions of Desert Storm Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, noting that his 24th Infantry Division attacked a line
of retreating Iraqi vehicles and troops for several hours with
hardly any response from the Iraqis. The attack came two days after
the cease-fire, and officers and enlisted men interviewed later
said there was little or no Iraqi fire at all. Piece also notes
that McCaffrey's troops also opened fire on unarmed prisoners near
a hospital bus, though McCaffrey, who is now President Clinton's
drug czar, was not on the scene. The story was written by Seymour
M. Hersh, who conducted hundreds of interviews. In a fun read,
Edward Hoagland writes a memoir of the time he literally ran away
and joined the circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``TYCOON''
</P>
<P>
   We have to admit we were hoping for a how-to guide with this
one, but instead we got a dopey feature on Greg Norman. ``Greg
Norman is his name, and golf is his game,'' the story opines. Wow.
Point of the story seems to be that Norman has made a lot of money
selling his shark clothes and building golf courses hither and yon.
He also gets around in style, owning a Gulfstream jet, a
helicopter, a boat, three Harleys, two Jet Skis and a partridge in
a pear tree. OK, we made that last one up. They also pin down
filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola for a Q-and-A and quiz him about
wine. This is the guy who directed The Godfather(beginitalic),
(enditalic)and we're asking him about grapes? Yee-ipes. The
magazine also advises that ``buying a private isle can be hard
work, but the rewards are well worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``VANITY FAIR''
</P>
<P>
   In kind of a neat feature, writer/director Cameron Crowe
interviews Tom Cruise, whom Crowe directed in the smash hit ``Jerry
Maguire.'' The magazine is a little overwrought about this, calling
the Q-and-A style piece ``two days of soul-searching interviews.''
If you say so. Cruise searches his soul and reveals that it was
really fun flying those airplanes in ``Top Gun.'' He also says
these words, about the kabillion of dollars he's making, with a
straight face, ``I get paid because I'm worth it and they should
pay me that much. But I've never worked for money, ever.'' The
piece offers a nice bit of retrospective on Cruise's career.
There's also an interesting excerpt from a new book by cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who beat cancer to win the 1999 Tour de France .

&HT;     HONDA TO ACCELERATE PRODUCTION OF MINIVAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honda has heard from consumers hot for its new Odyssey minivan,
and is taking steps to beef-up production to satisfy a U.S. market
that can't seem to get enough of these cars.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting until April 2002 to open its new plant in
Alabama to build the Odyssey, Honda has moved start-up to late
2001, officials of American Honda said. The site, in Lincoln, Ala.,
will be Honda's second assembly plant for the Odyssey in North
America; the vehicles already are being built at Alliston, Ontario.
Honda builds cars in Marysville, Ohio, too, but has no plans to
build minivans there.
</P>
<P>
   Honda will spend about $800 million to build the Alabama plant,
which will be able to produce about 120,000 of the minivans yearly.
Combined with the Canadian plant, North American production
capacity for the Odyssey will be about 280,000 units a year, Honda
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that will cut the long wait for new Odyssey vans that
many consumers are experiencing now. Some customers reportedly are
waiting up to four months to get the vehicle they want.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Honda's first midsize sport-utility vehicle for
the U.S. market will go on sale this fall, branded as the Acura
MDX.
</P>
<P>
   The MDX will replace the Acura SLX, which is basically a
rebadged, high-end version of the Isuzu Trooper. There also could
be a Honda-branded version of the MDX to replace the Passport,
which is a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo. The only sport-utility that Honda
makes for itself now is the CR-V, a mini-SUV based on the Civic
chassis.
</P>
<P>
   The MDX that will appear this fall as a 2001 model will be
positioned to compete against the Lexus RX 300, Mercedes-Benz
M-class and Land Rover Discovery II, and will have a full-time
four-wheel-drive system. The vehicle, which debuted in April at the
New York Auto Show, will carry up to seven people.
</P>
<P>
   It will be powered by a 240-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and
five-speed automatic transmission.

   FORD WON'T BUILD 2000-MODEL COBRA
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has decided not to build a 2000 model Mustang SVT
Cobra, even though the company has about 900 orders for the cars,
company officials said. The company is still dealing with
complaints from buyers of the 1999 model Cobras that the cars don't
get the 320 horsepower that specifications call for.
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost for those expecting new Cobras, however. Ford
says it plans to begin production of the 2001 model in early fall,
and will offer the first of those to customers who have orders on
file. Those customers will get the vehicles at the prices set for
the 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   Production for 2001 will be limited to 8,000 units. The Cobra
was designed by Ford's special vehicle team, which is given a free
hand to take regular Ford products and soup them up into special
high-performance models.

   LEXUS PLANS SPORTS SEDAN
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, Toyota's premium-car division, will roll out its all-new
IS 300 sports sedan on June 23 priced at $30,995, the company has
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The new sedan, expected to be more of a driver's car than other
Lexus models in the low $30,000s, will be equipped with a 3.0-liter
inline six-cylinder engine making 215 horsepower. It is expected to
compete against models such as the BMW 328i, which costs about
$34,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus expects to sell about 25,000 of the new model in the first
year. Standard equipment will include automatic climate control,
cruise control, traction control, power windows/mirrors/door locks,
17-inch sport wheels, and compact-disc changer.

&HT;     HAUTE CUISINE: TRY WASHING IT DOWN WITH BEER INSTEAD OF WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Note optional trim)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GRIFFIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Much has been made of pairing the right wine with
certain dishes. Oenologists and chefs alike love to wax rhapsodic
about how, say, the elusive hints of tangy star fruit on a certain
chardonnay's finish would make it the perfect partner for a
cilantro-lobster flan on a golden tomato coulis. Or they gush over
a fruity old vines' zinfandel poured alongside a ginger-berry
compote with creme anglaise.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a beer drinker choke on his Frito pie.
</P>
<P>
   If that's your impression of wine drinkers vs. beer drinkers,
you probably should modify your stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   More beer drinkers than ever are beginning to learn that, given
the wealth of beers available nowadays, different styles of their
favorite beverage can be just as good with food as wine _ and, in
some cases, even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 400 to 1,000 identified compounds in beer which
affect the flavor and how it's perceived,'' says Dan Hermes, food
and beverage director of the Faust Restaurant and Brewery in New
Braunfels, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right partnership will make both your beer and your
meal taste better. And that's what it's all about, anyway, isn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   This goes beyond having Budweiser after Budweiser throughout
dinner, regardless of what's being served. It involves some thought
about the flavor of the beer, its texture and overall nature and
how those characteristics match up with the food that's being
served.
</P>
<P>
   The vocabulary employed is akin to that of food and wine
pairings, and there are similarities. Both a pilsner and a
chardonnay are noted for their dryness, for example. In fact,
Michael Jackson, an author and authority on beer, says, ``A good
dry pilsner is like the chardonnay of the beer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, extend that comparison to what food you'd serve with
chardonnay _ fish, for example _ and you're off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Some pairings are easy. Yeasty beers of any sort go well with
bread. Tart Belgian ales, with undertones of citrus zest and
coriander, would be a natural with a salad sporting an oil and
vinegar dressing. Now, think of a dish of warm berry cobbler with a
raspberry ale on the side or a chocolate stout with a dense slice
of flourless chocolate cake. A rauchbier has, as the style's name
implies in German, a smokiness that makes it perfect for smoked
oysters or bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The next steps involve finding pairings that complement each
other but not in so obvious a manner. What, for example, goes with
a thick, juicy steak?
</P>
<P>
   As with wine, the final word is that what appeals to you most is
what works best. ``To each his own,'' says Joey Villareal, owner
and brewer at the Blue Star Brewing Co. in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to steak, Hermes prefers a brown ale, with its
host of roasted flavors. ``You're extending the same flavors,'' he
says. But don't order something too dark. ``An Irish stout would
dominate the steak.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson prefers pale ales with steak; in his authoritative
``Ultimate Beer'' (DK Publishing), he compares that style to ``the
fresh, fruit cabernets of the New World.''
</P>
<P>
   Villareal also likes a pale ale with steak, and he might have
the same with a spicy dish. ``I'd like a pilsner or a pale ale with
Mexican food,'' he says. ``Some spicy Chinese food is great with a
lager,'' especially a Sapporo.
</P>
<P>
   But with a hamburger, Villareal prefers a pilsner, because the
bread is so filling ``you want something lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of giving the subject some thought beforehand
and being aware of what's happening. ``Once you become aware of
this fluid going across your tongue,'' you start tasting it
differently and begin to think of how it will work with certain
foods, Hermes says. ``That's not just food and wine _ or beer _ but
food to food, how everything on the plate goes together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's also the wealth of beers to consider. Since the
microbrewery explosion of the late 1970s and an increase in
imported beers, American beer drinkers have been faced with
hundreds of options and styles. Back in the 1960s, who but world
travelers and beer nuts had ever heard of a Belgian abbey beer,
much less thought of matching one with Stilton or Roquefort cheese?
</P>
<P>
   Not all beer drinkers structure their beer and food pairings
analytically, but some have instinctively made choices about what
they like together. Paul Kahl, a real estate agent and beer
aficionado, hadn't given the concept much thought before being
asked about it, but he knows he loves ``a Heineken with fish and
shrimp, some of the foreign beers, like Pilsner Urquell.'' And with
``lighter foods, I want some lighter kind of cool to wash it down
with,'' he says, citing Bud Lite or Miller Lite as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most people will readily admit that they enjoy pairings that
complement each other. Jackson is quick to point out that ``I like
similar flavors because they extend the experience. I just enjoy
that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that some contrasts can be beneficial, such as
a peppery porter or dry stout served up with salty oysters, long a
tradition in Jackson's home country, England. A hefeweizen, with
its residual sugars, is an exciting partner for a salty Caesar
salad or spicy Asian food.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take the contrast too far, Hermes warns, or you'll end
up with a combination that brings out the worst of both, much like
``toothpaste and orange juice.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a danger in too much discussion of pairings, Villareal
warns. Taking the topic too far gives beer the wrong image. ``The
wine industry ran into a snob problem,'' he says. ``I don't want
craft beer to face the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson feels the same way. ``It's not that I feel that whenever
you eat, you must have beer,'' says the self-proclaimed Beer
Hunter, who also has written extensively about single malt
scotches. ``But you don't always have to have wine.''

<P>
   ``THE SPECIAL PRISONER''
</P>
<P>
   By JIM LEHRER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 previous books by Lehrer listed before the title
page of this one, all written while he wasn't busy anchoring ``The
Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. We think he should slow down.
There's a hurried feel to this novel, the story of Methodist bishop
John Quincy Watson, who in a crowded airport catches a glimpse of a
man he believes to be the Japanese officer who brutalized him in a
prison camp during World War II. Watson follows ``the Hyena,'' as
prisoners called him, to San Diego, where he corners him in his
hotel and proceeds to have a remarkably civilized talk with him, in
between bouts of tussling that go mysteriously unheard by guests in
surrounding rooms. These chapters, alternated with Watson's
memories of the camp, are tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately,
Lehrer places his real climax in the middle of the book, and
follows it with a section involving a murder trial, lots of moral
pondering and a ludicrous ending.

   ``THE SECRET LIVES OF WORDS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By PAUL WEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable falls hard for books like this. Novelist West
(''The Dry Danube,'' ``Life With Swan'') has assembled a list of
words he has kept over the years that are notable for no other
reason than that he was curious about them. They are here
alphabetically, with information on their etymologies and remarks
from the bemused author on their modern usage. The only
disappointment is that our own favorite words (discombobulate,
melancholy, spellbinding) are not here. Among those that are:
dunderhead, bungalow, grievous, italics, sad, blizzard, gremlin,
escape, serendipity and a few obscenities that are treated with the
same affectionate civility as all the rest. West describes his
delightful book as ``a short homage to words, and the devious route
they have taken in coming usefully to us - some 400 in particular,
most of whom I propose to treat as honored guests, invited in (or
out) for a drink, a handshake, and, in some cases, an exchange of
blue movies.''

   ``SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By FRANK KERMODE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $30)
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Kermode throws out the welcome mat in his preface when
he addresses this book not to scholars but ``to a non-professional
audience with an interest in Shakespeare that has not, I believe,
been well served by modern critics, who on the whole seem to have
little time for his language; they tend to talk past it in
technicalities or down to it in arcanely expressed platitudes.
Every other aspect of Shakespeare is studied almost to death, but
the fact that he was a poet has somehow dropped out of
consideration.'' There you have it: Poetic language is the focus
here, and if you have always wanted to be more interested in
Shakespeare than you are, if you've needed permission to be
discriminating rather than reverential toward his most famous
works, Kermode is here to light your way. His book is literary
criticism, to be sure, and not for the faint of heart. But it is
also unabashedly inviting and invigorating - you will want to
revisit the plays armed with all that you have learned. Enjoy.

   RED MAFIYA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ROBERT FRIEDMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   Friedman begins his book by offering his most impressive
credential, the news that Russian mobsters have threatened several
times to kill him, slowly and in as grisly a fashion as possible.
The Russians, it seems, make the Italian Mafia look like pikers. To
the Russians, murder is blood sport - they will shoot you, a cop
told Friedman, ``just to see if the gun works.'' Now that we've
mentioned this, you'll be pleased to know that these people have
global reach, vast financial assets and an ever-growing presence in
the United States. Friedman has written about them for Vanity Fair
and other magazines (hence the death threats) and now offers this
energetic book, in which he tells anecdote after anecdote in his
effort to portray the Russian mob as the most savage and vicious
bunch of thugs ever to reach American shores. He includes photos,
and judging from the look of these guys (they appear both alive and
lying in pools of blood) a Russian version of The Sopranos can't be
far behind.

   ``THE FEAST OF LOVE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By CHARLES BAXTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pantheon, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Its title doesn't begin to describe all of the things this novel
is, or hint at the skill and daring Baxter shows in writing it. He
is, in fact, his own character - the book begins with an insomniac
writer named Charlie taking an after-midnight walk on a summer
night. On a park bench he sees Bradley, his neighbor and fellow
member of ``the insomnia army.'' They talk aimlessly at first,
about Bradley's history in love and marriage, but suddenly Bradley
has an idea: Charlie should talk to real people, listen to the
human beings around him as inspiration for his fiction.
``Everybody's got a story,'' he says, ``and we'll just start
telling you the stories we have.'' So begins a chorus of voices,
all connected somehow to Bradley, and all of them talking about
love, longing and loss. As the best of them, a streetwise girl
named Chloe, says, ``You can't figure out love without figuring out
death, too, but the effort it takes can knock the wind out of
you.'' This funny, wistful novel is a stage for Baxter's
virtuosity, and a reader's feast indeed.

   ``IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BILL BRYSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broadway, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that this perfectly charming book about Australia
has to follow A Walk in the Woods, Bryson's hilarious chronicle of
his hike on the Appalachian Trail. That book afforded him a comic
foil in his none-too-refined hiking partner, Katz. Here he has only
himself, and the laughs are not as frequent or as incapacitating.
Still, he seems to feel an obligation to be funny, as in a lengthy
description of himself napping (he is not, he says, ``a discreet
and fetching sleeper''). The book is best when he does not push the
limits of his persona - that of a curious, witty, friendly,
informative and very British (he is American, actually, but lived
in England for years, as is evident in his writing style and his
accent) tourist set loose in one of the most underpublicized
countries in the world. Bryson's travels include Sydney, Canberra,
the forbidding and huge Nullarbor Plain (its name is a corruption
of the Latin for ``no trees'') and the odd and unfathomable
outback. It's not hilarious, but it's a great trip anyway.

   GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS: A TALE MODERNE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By STEVEM GUARNACCIA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $15.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the three bears had lived as Guarnaccia imagines, Goldilocks
would have bolted before she crossed the threshold, driven off by
the embarrassing surfeit of style. These bears have far-flung
tastes. In addition to a Charles Ennie Mackintosh ``Ladderback''
chair (1902), they own a George Nelson ``Asterisk'' clock (1950),
an Alvar Aalto ``Savoy'' vase (1936), an Isamu Noguchi chess table
(1947), an Arne Jacobsen ``Egg'' chair (1957), a Marianne Westman
``Picknick'' casserole (1956), a Charles and Ray Eames ``LCW''
chair (1946) and many other dysfunctional-looking objects. Our
favorite is a blow-up bed, designed by an Italian whose name we do
not know. Goldilocks makes short work of it, and leaves its carcass
for Mama Bear to find. Goldilocks, by the way, looks like a refugee
from ``The Jetsons,'' and Mama Bear's mouth is on the side of her
face, under her right eye. We found that to be disconcerting, but
there's no accounting for taste.

   ``HIDE YOUR ASSETS AND DISAPPEAR''
</P>
<P>
   By EDMUND J. PANKAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Regan, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone had sent us this when it came out in hardcover, we'd
be gone by now. Ah, but we jest - Pankau's book, new in paperback,
is actually quite depressing, because it is based on the premise
that you hate everyone you know including your spouse and children
(how they feel about you is another book, maybe two). First, we
must tell you that he advises leaving the country if you want to
disappear, although he does give guidelines for remaining in the
United States incognito. Second, he likes to say unnerving things
like ``Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead,'' just to
scare you into silence. He suggests that you consider faking your
own death and erasing your tattoos. He also names countries that
make choice settings for a new life, and rates them (Costa Rica is
a winner) on things like weather, legal systems and extradition
policies. Even if you're not a felon, there's a certain
entertainment value to all of this, and you never know when
something will come in handy.

&HT;     GUITARIST PROUD OF HIS ROCKABILLY BAND'S TEXAS SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM BEAL Jr.  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life on the road with a rock `n' roll band is nothing but
glamour. Just ask Jim Heath, guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and
front man with the Reverend Horton Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to wash my clothes,'' Heath yelled over the roar of
a clothes dryer somewhere in North Carolina. ``And this is a crummy
laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heath wasn't really complaining. After all, he's on the road
making his high-energy, revved-up, all-out rockabilly-based music
with Jimbo Wallace thumping the upright bass and Scott Churilla
pounding the drums.
</P>
<P>
   The trio is touring with a new album, ``Spend a Night in the
Box,'' on the Time Bomb label.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Horton Heat is based in Dallas. Heath spent the
first six years of his life in San Antonio and grew up in Corpus
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived around the corner from this record store,'' he said.
``I could go over there and get blues stuff. I had some cousins who
liked to play music. That made me want to play. Then I started
seeing the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and Johnny Cash on
television and I really wanted to play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Reverend started recording in the early 1990s on
labels ranging from Sub Pop to Interscope to Time Bomb, the group
has played stripped-down music that bears more than a passing
resemblance to real-deal rockabilly but because of its energy and
attitude, also has attracted a large punk contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Reverend Horton Heat started, it was a solo thing,''
Heath said. ``It was rockabilly and bluesy, but the main audience
was punk/rock kids. I could have made some money playing blues, but
the alternative scene was more fun. It was nothing conscious. We
tried to be more authentic, but we decided that's been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this music have come from anywhere but Texas? Heath
laughed for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm pretty proud of the fact we do sound like we come
from Texas,'' he said. ``There are some pretty great players from
all over the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath describes the Reverend Horton Heat as a rockabilly band
that plays original music. The tunes on ``Spend a Night in the
Box'' were all penned by Heath save for one number that's a
Heath/Churilla effort. Heath loves the writing part of his gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my deal,'' he said. ``I write a lot of songs. Sometimes
I have to slow down because it confuses things. If I write 30 songs
and demo them, record labels like the ones that least sound like us
and that can change the whole theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath and those involved in the business end of music have not
always seen eye-to-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at labels are always saying, `I love what you do. Let
me change you.' They try too hard to control the artist. But what
can you expect when all radio stations are owned by one person? We
just want to do our best and make our music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides releasing a string of albums and living on the tour
road, Heath and the band have turned in an acting stint on ``The
Drew Carey Show.'' Heath also has appeared on the television show
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and in the movie ``Love and a
.45.''

 &HT;    INVITING TOURISTS TO BORDER ``HUNTS'' FOR HUMANS IS NOTHING
NEW(a) 
 &HT;    (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS)(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DANIEL GONZALEZ(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tourists as soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of an anonymous appeal that surfaced last
month: Fun in the Arizona sun. The great outdoors. The chance to
help ranchers hunt illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the first time the idea of hunting humans for
sport has cropped up in Douglas, a border town known for mining,
ranching - and now, illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, a similar proposal to tourists was pitched in
this same corner of Arizona. But rather than Mexicans, it was
Apache Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Fimbres Apache Expedition is not only a
reminder of the long-standing racial hostilities along the
Arizona-Mexico border, but it's also a tragic lesson about
vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1930 and Douglas, the hub of the nation's copper-smelting
industry, was in an economic slump. The Great Depression was
underway and all the economic indicators pointed downward.
</P>
<P>
   The town's merchants, however, were pioneering people. If
ranching was slow and copper mining on the wane, they would find
some other way to generate money.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any kind. A.C. Karger, then mayor of Douglas, and
the shrewd chiefs of the local Chamber of Commerce were going to
sell a special brand of tourism, one that capitalized on every
attribute Douglas had to offer: a magnificent railroad station,
excellent rail connections, a world-class hotel, a warm, dry
climate with blue skies and breathtaking scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And the chance to kill Apaches, although that was never overtly
stated in the fliers and newspaper ads promoting the expedition
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the expedition was the attempted rescue of
a 7-year-old boy who had been kidnapped by a band of Apaches three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the underlying message was not lost on the outpouring of
men who wrote letters hoping to join the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never fought Indians, but I have chased Spics all
around Haiti and Nicaragua,'' wrote one adventure-seeker. ``I guess
I'll have the guts to chase these birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled all over the globe. I have seen a bit of life
and have fought men of all colors, so I would like to become a
member of your expedition, for I love action,'' wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition stemmed from years of hostilities
between a Mexican rancher named Francisco Fimbres and a band of
Apaches based in the rugged Sierra Madres.
</P>
<P>
   Although warfare between the Indians and the United States
officially ended with Geronimo's surrender on Sept. 6, 1886,
hostilities with his band of Apaches - the Bronco group of the
Chiricahua - continued on both sides of the Mexican border for
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities exploded into open warfare on Oct. 26, 1926 when
the Apaches ambushed Fimbres and his family. The Apaches killed
Fimbres' wife and kidnapped his son, Geraldo. The Apaches were
seeking revenge for an earlier kidnapping of Geronimo's
great-granddaughter by Fimbres.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition captured nationwide attention, but
in the end the expedition never got off the ground. Officials on
both sides of the border realized the idea of armed gringos roaming
around in Mexico could spell disaster and they quashed the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Fimbres. When he learned help from the gringos
was not coming, he reverted to his old tactics. With the help of
vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) and expatriate American mercenaries,
Fimbres hunted down the Apaches himself. A March 13, 1931, photo
captured Fimbres with the scalps of three Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Fimbres finally found his son in an Apache
camp, hanging from a tree. In revenge for the three Apaches killed
earlier by Fimbres and his men, the Apaches had swung the boy by
his heels and smashed his skull against an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres and his men retaliated yet again, until the last of the
Apaches were hunted down and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition was chronicled in a 1993 book,
``They Never Surrendered: Bronco Apaches of the Sierra Madres,
1890-1935,'' by Texas author Douglas Meed.
</P>
<P>
   Meed sees a parallel between the Fimbres expedition and a
``Neighborhood Ranch Watch'' flier distributed in April that hoped
to convert tourists into soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there, because what you are doing is
asking people to come down and hunt people as sport,'' Meed said.
``The difference is that the ranchers are trying to protect their
land rather than make money off this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meed also thinks the most recent episode could spark a new round
of violence along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix writer John Alba came across accounts of the Fimbres
Apache Expedition while researching a novel set during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a link between the two calls for vigilantism along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there as to how some Anglo people view
dark-skinned people as less than human,'' Alba said. ``At that
time, in the 1930s, it was the Apaches who were viewed as animals
to be hunted down and exterminated. Now it's common to hear in
various places along the border these expressions that the illegals
are a plague, a vermin, an invasion that has to be stopped.''

&HT;     KEYBOARD-LOVING CATS MAY FACE SOME GENTLE PURRRSUASION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet moneybags and Silicon Valley kingpins
may be concerned about the recent tumult on the stock market, but
cat-lovers may have another worry: How to keep kitty off the
computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   A software designer says he has a solution, a program that is
designed to detect when a cat is walking on the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The software, called PawSense, automatically ignores anything
the cat types. The software also instructs the computer to emit
scary, cat-repelling sounds _ for example, the sound of a
harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that for a lot of cats, the most annoying sound is the
harmonica,'' said Chris Niswander, 30, of Tucson, Ariz. Niswander
designed the program.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone really need PawSense, which costs $19.99 a pop? To
date, no large computer networks are known to have crashed because
a feline traipsed across someone's keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet kitty-triggered crashes are no joke to the individual who
tries to maintain a cat and a computer under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   For such people, there is no outrage like the outrage of
returning from the coffee pot to discover that Fluffy is snoozing
atop the keyboard _ one big bundle of fur, sprawled from QWERT to
ENTER _ and that the computer screen has turned ominously dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats see people playing with keyboards, so cats want to play
with them, too. That's why we talk about `copycats,''' said
Niswander, who runs BitBoost, a small software company in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   How does PawSense know a cat is crossing the keyboard? Cats
don't know what they are typing, so their little paws tend to fall
on several adjacent keys at once.
</P>
<P>
   So Niswander programmed the software to recognize when several
adjacent keys are being struck simultaneously (except for specified
functions such as hitting CAPS LOCK and SHIFT simultaneously in
order to upper-case a letter).
</P>
<P>
   How many keys can a cat hit at once? To find out, Niswander used
a ruler to measure the paw sizes of several neighborhood cats.
</P>
<P>
   When a cat walks across the keyboard, the computer screen
displays a slightly tongue-in-cheek warning: ``Catlike Typing
Detected.''
</P>
<P>
   Niswander doesn't have cats himself, not officially, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm between cats. There is a neighborhood cat who's trying to
persuade me that she lives with me, although I claim she doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Further details on PawSense appear at Niswander's Web site:

<P>
   RUSK, Texas _ Blair Lavell has been working on the railroad, in
one capacity or another, for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   He has bought, sold and traded freight and passenger cars. He
once made a $1 deal for a 224-ton locomotive to save it from the
scrap-iron heap. He has built an inventory of old railroad cars and
a network of informants who keep him posted on the disposition of
others on their way to salvage yards. He saves what he can and
stores them here in his train maintenance yard.
</P>
<P>
   As a mechanical superintendent with the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department, Lavell oversees 18 staffers and the collection of
nearly four dozen cars and operating steam locomotives that
comprise the Texas State Railroad, which operates between this
sleepy town and Palestine, 25 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   The Rusk and Palestine depots, as well as the miles of track and
low bridges that join them, comprise the Texas State Railroad State
Historical Park, 150 miles north of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The park, under manager Curtis Pruett, accommodates more than
200,000 visitors a year. Most of them come to admire and be a part
of the living legacy of railway history that Lavell has assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned railroad has operated since the original tracks
were laid in 1896. The first five miles linked the town of North
Rusk to an iron foundry operated by the state prison.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, iron ore and wood rolled to the penitentiary
smelter, and iron rolled out. In 1907, the Legislature authorized
extending the tracks to Palestine, and the Texas State Railroad
reached its present length.
</P>
<P>
   The prison foundry closed in 1913. The railroad operated for a
few years before deficits began to mount and the state was forced
to lease the line to forest-products haulers as part of the Texas
and New Orleans Railroad in late 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Private operators kept the short line leased until the early
1970s. When no new tenants took the railroad, the Legislature in
1972 turned the facility over to the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department for conversion to a hike-and-bike trail. The 76-year-old
railroad itself was headed for the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad buffs, however, had different ideas. They stepped in
and persuaded the state to rehabilitate the line and run it as a
recreational passenger service, complete with vintage cars and
turn-of-the-century steam locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   The call went out for old cars and locomotives. The good old
days were about to return.
</P>
<P>
   The state historical park opened in 1977, with depots at each
end. Today, the railroad carries paying passengers on the
three-hour round trip between the two stations.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad has gained wider attention, too, as the bright
lights of Hollywood have come to visit often. Lavell's efforts to
assemble a collection of authentic steam railroad artifacts,
coupled with the area's rustic setting, has resulted in more than
20 movies, television programs and commercials being filmed on the
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the parks in the state park system, the Texas State
Railroad park is unusual in the way it presents itself to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   While most historical exhibits are, by necessity, of the ``look,
don't touch'' variety, the state railroad is a ``climb aboard, move
around, bring the family and a picnic lunch'' kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   Because only steam engines run on the railroad, Lavell and his
crew work full time keeping the century-old iron horses ready to
run. Most of the time, they do it without instruction manuals.
</P>
<P>
   The four active locomotives undergo constant inspections.
Because of the age of the machinery, Lavell's machinists,
pipefitters and carpenters use their experiences to stay ahead of
most problems and maintain the engines and cars to federal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The four locomotives date from the 1910s and earlier, when they
served to pull troop trains, heavy freight and passengers around
the United States. Lavell cares for a fifth locomotive, the Lima
No. 610, known as the Amon Carter Jr.
</P>
<P>
   At 224 tons, the engine is too large for use on the state
railroad. The cab stands more than 15 feet off the ground, and the
drivers _ the big wheels that push the engine along _ are nearly 4
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Through Lavell's efforts and the help of railroad enthusiasts,
the magnificent No. 610 was bought at auction for $1 and moved to a
specially prepared shed at the Palestine Depot.
</P>
<P>
   As grand as the Lima locomotive is, engine No. 400 is more
typical of the railroad's efforts to represent the golden days of
steam locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   Made in 1917, the Baldwin No. 400 locomotive weighs 87 tons,
with a wheel configuration known as 2-8-2. The ``8'' refers to the
number of driver wheels, with two support wheels forward of the
drivers near the cow catcher and two others behind the drivers
supporting the cab. By comparison, the massive Lima No. 610 is a
2-10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Under the skilled handling of engineer Roger Graham and fireman
Martin Lazcano, Engine No. 400 can pull 300 tons of passengers and
cars from a dead stop to 25 mph and back to a stop, with barely a
bump in between.
</P>
<P>
   Although they keep a close eye on the gauges, a lot of what the
two men do in the locomotive cab is done by feel, letting off
steam, pouring on the fuel and fine-tuning the throttle in
anticipation of an incline or a stop.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Lazcano worked their way up through the railroad
ranks from helpers to hostlers, to life in the cab where the action
is. Now they watch the track ahead through narrow-slat windows and
roll with the rhythm of the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is in charge. He controls the throttle, sounds the
whistle and constantly balances the engine's needs with gentle taps
from a gloved hand on a half-dozen knobs and handles.
</P>
<P>
   Lazcano fuels the diesel fire to keep the boiler steaming at
peak performance. He rings the bell, turns valves and, at one
point, has to climb out on the catwalk, nine-pound hammer in hand,
to adjust a disagreeable fitting.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team, using nods, hand signals and one-word sentences
to keep order in the smoky, noisy chaos of the cab and deliver a
smooth ride to the passengers behind them.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, the ride is much more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger cars have slide-open windows. On warm days, riders
experience the feel of the Piney Woods as the train rumbles along,
the cadence of the rails mixing with smoke from the boiler fire and
the clang of the big brass bell.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle screams at every crossing, and anyone standing near
the track gets a thousand waves from passengers as the train rolls
by.
</P>
<P>
   Trains roll from each end of the line at 11 a.m. and meet
half-way at the Mewshaw Siding. From June 1-July 30, the trains run
Thursday through Sunday. In the spring and fall, the trains run
weekends only.
</P>
<P>
   There are special runs for school groups in October and April.
The park also offers a nighttime run on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular time to make the trip is during the cool
months, when the East Texas humidity and temperatures are more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The park also offers special-event days, such as the recent
presentation by the Texas Military Historical Society's of military
paraphernalia from colonial Texas through the Korean War.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some commonly used terms in railroading:
</P>
<P>
   Ballast: The fist-sized rocks that support and surround the ties
and rails to keep them from shifting and to keep them off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Cow-catcher: The low-set grill at the front end of the
locomotive. Positioned just inches off the rail, it clears minor
debris off the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers: The large wheels under the locomotive. They are linked
by drive rods to the steam pistons and are what actually set the
train in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Engineer: The person in charge of the locomotive. He sets train
speed by use of a hand throttle and sounds the whistle to warn of
train movement.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman: The person in charge of tending the fire and keeping
the pressure up in the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   High ball: When the passengers, baggage and mail are loaded, the
train is ready to high ball, or leave the station, thus the old
phrase, ``Let's high ball it out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostler: The person who tends the locomotive between runs, such
as when it's in the train yard.
</P>
<P>
   Sand dome: Atop the long boiler in front of the engineer's cabin
sit two domes. The forward dome is the sand dome. It contains
fine-grit sand that can be released directly onto the rails in
front of the driver wheels to increase traction.
</P>
<P>
   Steam dome: The other dome atop the boiler is the steam dome. It
contains a valve that the engineer adjusts to release more or less
steam and set the train's speed.

&HT;     AT 71, SHE IS THE MATRIARCH OF THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The most unusual place to find a grandmother and
mother of four, nursing a broken rib, would be 25 miles out at sea,
captaining a 50-foot sportfishing vessel looking for salmon.
</P>
<P>
   That is where you will find Jacqueline Douglas, the first
professional female skipper on the Pacific Coast, running her boat
seven days a week from Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps even more unusual is where you can find her
daughter, Diana Fischer. Married and a mom as well, she was
recently elected the first female commodore in the 114-year history
of the once all-male Corinthian Yacht Club of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This mother-daughter team _ Douglas, 71, of San Francisco,
skipper of the party boat Wacky Jacky, and her daughter, Fisher,
51, the new Corinthian commodore _ are about as far removed from
being crusty salts as the North Pole is from the South Pole. They
are refined, intelligent, accomplished at their crafts, and have
not only won the respect of their peers, but their friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't believe I'm doing this,'' Douglas said while at
sea recently, still recovering from a rib broken in a fall. ``I get
on the ocean and I don't believe I'm me.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, married 52 years to George Douglas, first got the idea
of buying a party boat in the early 1970s when she was in her 40s.
By that time, she had already attracted considerable attention by
being Queen of the San Francisco 49ers on opening day in 1946 at
Kezar Stadium. After that she took time off, got married and raised
her four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a customer on the old Carrie in the 1950s, going salmon
fishing, and never did I think about doing this, running a party
boat,'' Douglas said. She bought a boat, the New Florie S, in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   She took the Coast Guard operator tests, finagled a business
loan, and then opened business at Fisherman's Wharf. She was not an
overnight success. In fact, Douglas was initially spurned by many
old-timers in the Golden Gate Fleet, and many longtime fishermen
were suspicious of her intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't understand why a woman was doing this,'' Douglas
said. ``But I didn't care what anybody thought. I was so thrilled
by my job that I was blind to the friction about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband remembers how he was even confronted several times
at the dock and asked, ``What the hell does she think she's
doing?''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next few years, a funny thing happened. People who
went fishing with her found they were having a great time, and were
going home with salmon as well. It turns out that Douglas is a
great angler who has mastered her craft _ captains call the ocean
``an open book,'' and Douglas ``knows how to read the book'' _ and
her scores over the years have ranked high among all boats on the
Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, for instance, she did it yet again, guiding a
group of 13 aboard her boat to southwest of Half Moon Bay. The
fishermen caught 26 salmon, limits for all aboard, with retired
skipper Taylor McGee, 81, catching a 17-pounder. Douglas runs one
of the most popular and successful operations in the Golden Gate
Fleet, supported by a wide-ranging clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they board my boat, I want them to feel like they are
walking into my living room,'' Douglas said. ``And I love the
ocean, all the rhythms and experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas has become an excellent naturalist, often finding and
describing seabirds, marine mammals and many ocean anomalies to her
customers. Her popularity is documented in the numbers: In the past
27 years, Douglas has taken an estimated 120,000 people from all
over the world fishing out the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   When Douglas started, her oldest daughter, Diana, was paying
close attention. She went fishing as a teen-ager. She seemed to
have a natural attraction to the sea, just like her mom. As time
passed _ after she married, became Diana Fischer and had a child _
she found herself always around the water. She and her husband, Ed
Fischer, eventually bought a sailboat, a 27-foot Catalina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started at a very young age with my parents taking us to
Santa Cruz for the summer, living on the beach, going down and
swimming in the Pacific every day,'' Fischer said. ``This past
Sunday, I was just out on the Bay again, and just being on the
water, there's something energizing about it. I feel it at the
yacht club all the time, the vistas of the Bay, my love of San
Francisco, and it fills me up.''

&HT;     SOCCER HAS NO SHORTAGE OF PLAYERS, BUT WHITHER THE FANS? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is a mystery that defies easy explanation.
Somehow, millions of soccer players have vanished without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 18 million men and women play soccer in this
country. Add to that impressive number the millions who have
participated in the sport since the soccer boom began 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet professional Major League Soccer (MLS), which is played in
12 U.S. cities, is averaging only 14,000 fans a game, well below
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you the reason, because I've thought the same
thing: Where the hell are they?'' Steve Negoesco, coach of the
University of San Francisco soccer team, said of the fans. ``For
the last 20 years, you've had youth soccer. In Northern California,
you've got 150,000 kids playing every year. And they get older and
older. And every year you get 20,000 to 30,000 graduating from
youth soccer. We should have no room in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, there were bold predictions that it would take one
generation for the United States to embrace the most popular sport
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence supposedly was there for anyone to see: Johnny and
Judy, driven to and from practice by their soccer moms, happily
kicked a ball instead of hitting, passing, or shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   So when Johnny and Judy and their friends grew up, Babe Ruth
would be knocked off his pedestal. It was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Only it never happened. The three major sports in this country
still are football, baseball and basketball. Hockey is a solid
fourth. Soccer, meanwhile, is barely a blip on the national sports
radar _ save for one-time-only events like last year's Women's
World Cup, when the U.S. team won the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Woodring, who played professionally in Germany and Denmark
before returning to the United States to play in the MLS, retired
two years ago at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back in Marin County, Calif., working full-time in
financial management. He coaches youth soccer in his spare time and
remains devoted to the game. It remains a passion.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have an easy answer for why his generation played the
sport but won't pay to watch it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate question: Why aren't these stadiums full,
or at least more full?'' Woodring said. ``Part of it is all the
other things people have going on. Soccer is not a tradition in
this country. In other countries, it's a priority to watch their
teams play. We have too many other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are people who really love the game but don't find
this league attractive. It's too slow. They go once and don't
return. The avid soccer person will continue to follow the European
leagues because they are the elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys may play soccer while they are young, but as they get
older, the pressure becomes more intense for them to begin to play
traditional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, soccer wasn't in the mainstream,'' said John
Doyle, 34, an American who played soccer in Europe. ``A lot of good
athletes were lost to other sports. In high school, it's a
challenge not to play football, if only because the guys who play
football are around the cheerleaders and are more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The pool of athletes shrinks, especially in the inner city. And
the remaining players, Negoesco contends, are not being coached in
a way that is conducive to producing world-class players who could
fill stadiums in this country.
</P>
<P>
   They are, he said, under pressure to win because parents ``don't
know the game. `What did you guys do today? We lost. Again?' So the
coach has to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The top U.S. players who persevere in the sport inevitably face
a new temptation, Negoesco said. They go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle disagrees with the notion that an inferior brand of soccer
is being foisted on the public by the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's very unfair, actually,'' he said. ``I did play
in Europe at the highest level. Is the MLS as good as Bayren
Munich, Real Madrid or Manchester United? No. But those teams cost
millions upon millions of dollars to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at what DC United did. They won a tournament
involving all of Mexico and Central America. And then they won a
tournament against all of South America, including Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it's not good soccer, that's someone who's not
watching. The quality of the league is good. And the players are
getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Meterparel, the 31-year-old general manager of the
Earthquakes in San Jose, Calif., vigorously disputes that something
is wrong with the American pro league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sport that is growing,'' she said. ``We're in our
fifth year of existence now. This was not supposed to be an
overnight success. This is something that is going to build over
10, 15, 20 years.''

had not eaten beets since she was a child before she encountered
them a few weeks ago at Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. ``Some
people have phobias about bridges, some about elevators,'' she
said. ``I had a beet phobia.'' Yet when she didn't recognize her
nemesis hidden in a beet raviolo with her braised cod, she ate it
and discovered: ``It was spectacular. I may have gotten over my
phobia.'' That kind of conversion is not so unusual lately as a
vegetable generally perceived as a winter staple actually comes

DEAL MAY BE NEAR TO OPEN JAPAN'S PHONE MARKET AND COUNTER U.S.
CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Speculation is increasing among some informed Japanese
that a deal may be in the works to end a stalemate in talks between
Japan and the United States on telecommunications deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications executives and politicians have been saying
for the last week that senior members of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, notably Hiromu Nonaka _ who is nominally the
party's secretary-general but practically the reigning kingmaker in
Japanese politics _ are pressing Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. to agree to a sharp cut in fees that competing carriers must
pay to use its local network.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has dominated the deregulation talks because NTT
controls 99 percent of the lines that connect directly to Japanese
homes and offices. The price charged to use those lines is critical
to opening the telecommunications market here.
</P>
<P>
   At current rates, about 40 percent of the revenues of competing
carriers is used for fees paid to NTT, according to the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, which regulates the market.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has threatened to take the matter to the World
Trade Organization. The threat carries special weight in Japan,
which is hosting a summit meeting of world leaders in July.
Japanese officials are working to ensure that the meeting, which
President Clinton will attend, will be as uneventful as a noh
theatrical performance, in which an actor can take half an hour to
cross the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A potential trade war runs counter to that goal. Thus even
politicians sympathetic to NTT, which has tremendous political
clout thanks to its legions of employees and strong trade union,
are trying to coax the former telephone monopoly to concede some
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally conservative Fair Trade Commission is
reportedly on the brink of publishing a report saying that Nippon
Telegraph's reorganization last year failed to enhance competition
in the telecommunications market here and urging sharper cuts in
access fees, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading
business daily.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that in exchange for such a concession,
NTT would be given even more power than it already has, which could
further hamper competition in Japan. Executives at competing
carriers, Japanese businessmen and politicians suspect that Nonaka
and other senior politicians are promising the telecommunications
firm that they will push for a sweeping revision of the restrictive
law governing its activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a move afoot to drastically revise, or even abolish
the NTT law,'' said Kei Hata, a member of the upper house of
parliament who is becoming one of the most vocal critics of the
government's regulation of Nippon Telegraph. ``I myself favor an
abolishment of the law, but only after we have secured conditions
for free and fair competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hata and many others say those conditions do not yet exist in
Japan. Abolishing the NTT law would open the door for NTT East and
NTT West, the two regional fixed-line phone companies in the NTT
family, to provide long distance and international service. Many
worry that with the advantages of NTT's deep pockets and existing
technology, they would wipe out competitors that are only just
beginning to secure a toehold in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to think more about the implications of changing the
law,'' Hata said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has proposed cutting the fees the company charges
competing carriers by 22.5 percent over four years, saying further
cuts would damage NTT.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, wants immediate cuts of 41.1 percent
and contends that the telecommunications ministry is enabling NTT
to avoid a far-reaching overhaul of its business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NTT's recent financial performance, which was far better than
the company had projected, undercut its contention that it would be
crippled by cuts of the magnitude demanded by the United States.
Both NTT East and NTT West vastly outperformed the expectations of
their parent company, which has given even NTT's supporters cause
to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Junichiro Miyazu, NTT's president, has not furthered his
company's cause by saying he could not explain the markedly better
performance. His insistence that declining profitability at the two
regional carriers was a trend also rang somewhat hollow against the
backdrop of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings of the regional carriers improved,'' Eita
Yashiro, the minister of posts and telecommunications, said at a
press conference Tuesday. ``It's very different from the initial
projections.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of that, Yashiro said, his agency would consider the
reduction in interconnection fees it has proposed, as well as the
proposed timetable for achieving those reductions.

ECONOMIC HOPES ARE RAISED BY ULSTER PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland _ Standing on the tee of the par-3,
cliff-hugging 14th hole at Royal Portrush Golf Club, overlooking a
foreboding 200-yard stretch aptly named ``Calamity,'' Dennis Ryan
abruptly stepped away from his ball and turned to gaze out over a
majestic piece of the North Antrim coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ,'' he whispered, almost to himself, ``it's so beautiful
here. Why in God's name do people fight over this place?''
</P>
<P>
   As Northern Ireland and its people are gradually but inexorably
seduced by normality, it is finally becoming possible for those who
live here to realize what they have, and why the current peace
process is the only game in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people here realize just how good they have it
here,'' said Ryan, an investment banker from Tipperary who lives in
Toronto. ``There is a very high standard of living, a beautiful
countryside. Please, God, let's hope they can get it together and
really bring peace to this place, because once they do, there's no
stopping this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is not the only one with money at his disposal who believes
that Northern Ireland is poised to become known for its booming
economy rather than its booming bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Without the strong backing of the business community here, the
Ulster Unionist Party would not have decided on Saturday to resume
a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican
Army's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   George Quigley, the chairman of Ulster Bank, was among many
business leaders who worked behind the scenes, persuading unionists
to put aside their hatred and suspicions of the IRA for the sake of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   While news accounts have focused on the narrow margin of victory
that Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was able to secure on
Saturday, 53 to 47 percent, those accounts often fail to note that
the 860-member Ulster Unionist council, the party's ruling body, is
more hard-line than the middle-class Protestants who make up the
party itself, Northern Ireland's largest.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization that
stages some 3,000 parades each year, is outraged that the new
arrangements in Northern Ireland will deny it a chance to march
through Catholic neighborhoods where it is not wanted. Members say
they march to express their cultural identity. But Catholics see
the marches as bigoted triumphalism, a way for intolerant
Protestants to remind them of their place in a society described by
one prime minister as ``a Protestant state for a Protestant
people.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the places on the Ulster Unionist's ruling
council are allocated to Orange Order members, a built-in minority
opposed to the power-sharing ethos of the Good Friday Agreement of
1998, the blueprint for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, an Orangeman himself, has said he wants to sever the
official links between his party and the Orange Order, but doing so
would probably provoke a huge split.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the de facto spilt within the party was in full display
Saturday as angry delegates stormed out of the Waterfront Hall in
Belfast, denouncing Trimble as the latest traitor to Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   While proclaiming himself to be a democrat, Willie Thompson, a
British parliamentarian and a vehement opponent of the Good Friday
Agreement, said he saw no contradiction in refusing to accept the
will of the majority of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to fight,'' Thompson said, ``until Trimble
and this agreement are finished.''
</P>
<P>
   While petty politics and promising cooperation continue to
flourish simultaneously, most ordinary people simply get on with
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Murphy, a building consultant from Warrenpoint who will
give you a finger-pointing lecture if you call him by his real
first name, Seamus, went to Casement Park in Belfast on Sunday with
his old friend Dennis Moynihan, a retired banker, to take in the
soccer match between Antrim and Down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day, isn't it?'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had close friends from both sides of the divide who were
murdered. Ivan Toombes, a Protestant, was shot dead by the IRA.
Edmund Woolsey, a Catholic, was blown up.
</P>
<P>
   So, sitting in the sunshine of Casement Park was a treat, even
when, as is common here, the sky turned dark and hail and rain
poured down on the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up Down!'' Murphy yelled, cheering on County Down with the
ultimate contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   But you would hardly find a Protestant in Casement Park, where
Gaelic games are played. In Northern Ireland, Protestants and
Catholics have their own separate sports. Catholics play Irish
football and hurling, while the women play camogie, a Gaelic mix of
hurling and field hockey. Protestants play soccer and rugby. That
is changing, but slowly.
</P>
<P>
   When a Catholic soccer team in West Belfast tried to play a team
from the Royal Ulster Constabulary last year, Sinn Fein organized a
protest that led to the game being canceled.
</P>
<P>
   While sports tend to bring people of different backgrounds
together, here they are just another way for people to focus on
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a tendency here in the north of Ireland to focus on
the negative. By any measure, life has improved. As Trimble
reminded his party on Saturday, last year was the first in 30 that
no member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary or the British Army was
killed in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   That, in this place, is progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the 18th fairway of Royal Portrush, the most
stunning course on the island of Ireland, Dennis Ryan took a 5-iron
and prepared to make his approach shot. Again, he turned away, took
one last glance at the coast and said something that people might
remind themselves of in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' he said, ``to be alive.''

RUSSIAN TROOPS BOG DOWN IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TANGI-CHU, Russia _ ``If anything moves, shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   From his foxhole on a steep bluff overlooking this war-racked
village in southern Chechnya, Russian Private Vladimir Khokhlokov
aimed his antitank weapon at the dense greenery of the foothills
and repeated his orders as he waited tensely for the enemy to come.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to see anything move in this lush forest. That is
the first of many problems for Khokhlokov and his unit, 30 Russian
soldiers up here on the front lines, facing the forbidding Caucasus
mountains to the south, where separatist Islamic militants have
split into small, mobile groups that launch deadly, guerrilla-style
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Khokhlokov's unit knows when the rebels will come, or
from which direction, or even who will come _ Chechens, Arab
mercenaries, or even Taliban fighters from bases in Afghanistan,
against which Russia has threatened to launch preventive strikes.
All the Russians know is that they will come. And so they wait, and
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, we have been the hunters and they have been the
prey, but now things could turn the other way around,'' said
Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Likhachev, who is stationed at a
sprawling and well-protected military base dug into the plains
north of Tangi-chu, four miles behind Khokhlokov's front-line
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Army has captured much of Chechnya from the
militants, and some commanders even declared victory following the
fall of the separatists' last major strongholds in February. But
the military is struggling to finish off the rebels, and the
campaign is starting to look like a bloody stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Likhachev's base has multiple artillery batteries that launch
massive strikes at the first sign of trouble. The troops here have
sophisticated listening devices and optical equipment to help
detect movement in the foothills. But this impressive force is
unable to completely protect Russian troops in the mountains from
rebel ambush. The Russian military said six paratroopers were
killed Monday in fighting throughout the region. Last week, 10
Russian servicemen were killed and 83 were wounded. The week
before, 51 died.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither the Kremlin nor the Russian public has shown any
sign of weakening resolve to restore Moscow's control over
Chechnya, despite the mounting death toll. In Russia, people see
television news footage from southern Lebanon, where jubiliant
Hezbollah and Amal militia celebrate the withdrawal of Israeli
troops. That reminds many Russians of 1996, when the Chechens
launched a surprise offensive that forced federal troops to
withdraw in defeat after two years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians do not want to let that happen again. That is why
even though the Russians have lost more than 2,000 men in Chechnya
since fighting renewed here in October, exceeding the official
losses in the 1994-1996 war, no one on the Russian side is talking
about peace negotiations or withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders still talk about the eight-month campaign in
Chechnya as a well-planned success. By sending out special commando
units into rebel-controlled areas in the mountains to pursue
guerrilla groups, Colonel General Valery Manilov said, Russian
special forces have killed several leading rebel commanders in the
past week, including Abu Mosayev, chief of security for Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian fighting men on the ground, who several months ago
spoke hopefully of a quick victory, now say they realize they are
here for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is going to go on forever,'' said Private Vladimir
Kostin, on lookout duty at the front of an impressive labyrinth of
trenches. Last fall, the military was signing volunteer soldiers
like Kostin to three-month contracts; Kostin recently extended his
hitch by a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll be here longer than that,'' he spat. If he is lucky,
that is. Five of his friends have been killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops say the past week has seen some of the heaviest
fighting since February. In the ruined capital, Grozny, devastated
by the Russian assault, more corpses are dug up every day from
makeshift graves; most of the 1,200 bodies recovered so far were
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians are returning to Grozny. So is the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never know who is shooting or at whom,'' said a
paramilitary police officer manning a checkpoint in central Grozny.
He did not want his name used or his picture taken out of fear of
reprisals by Chechens against his family in central Russia. ``When
we come out in the morning, the whole place is mined and we have to
call in the bomb squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian forays into the mountains have also brought heavy
casualties. The latest ambush, which killed 19 Russian servicemen
in the neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia on May 11, was
reportedly carried out by units loyal to the Arab-born rebel
commander known as Khattab.
</P>
<P>
   Russian security officials say Khattab is connected to the
Islamic terrorist network controlled by Osama bin Laden, whom the
United States has blamed for bombing attacks on US embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was Khattab, and the senior Chechen commander Shamil Basayev,
whose incursion last summer into another Russian region, Dagestan,
prompted Moscow to send troops into Chechnya. Monday, the Russian
military reported that it had repelled an attempt by a large rebel
force to try to cross into Dagestan again.
</P>
<P>
   But that success has been overshadowed by other problems with
Russia's mission in Chechnya. Even after eight months, the army
still has trouble distinguishing civilians from the separatist
militants it has vowed to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say we're walking down the street and we meet a
Chechen,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Valery Chinovaryan. ``Is he a
rebel who has buried his gun somewhere and who will attack us
tonight? Or is he a farmer who wants a peaceful and prosperous
Chechnya? We have no way of knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Tangi-chu. The Russians rarely go into the town, but when
they do, to conduct sweeps for rebel fighters, soldiers find only
women, elderly, and children _ and men's dirty shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always wondering when the owners of the shoes will come
back, and what they'll do,'' said one paramilitary officer.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take chances, many Russian officers shoot first, and
ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get the order to fire at rebel fighters, I'm going to
shoot, and never mind who might be in the house next door,'' was
the way Likhachev put it. ``My first concern is the safety of my
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach, some Chechen civilians say, has led to numerous
crimes against innocent victims. According to the New York-based
Human Rights Watch, the whole village of Tangi-chu was surrounded
by Russian forces for three months, cut off from water or
electricity, while the military made sure there were no rebel
fighters here.
</P>
<P>
   Four witnesses who spoke to Human Rights Watch said young men
were stripped naked and beaten in public, dragged off and held
prisoner in ditches until their families paid a ransom. These
allegations, if true, highlight the ambivalent nature of Russia's
campaign: It was precisely this kind of hostage-taking for ransom
by Chechen gangs that Moscow said its soldiers were put in Chechnya
to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Tangi-chu, in March, that a Russian colonel raped and
murdered Heda Kungayeva, an 18-year-old Chechen girl, the one war
crime the military has admitted. Even though the colonel's guilt
was proclaimed on national television by the Russian chief of the
general staff, the army now insists that the colonel is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Chechens express little trust in the military or
the Russian government's representative office in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   To solve this problem, Moscow has been looking for a Russian
loyalist Chechen leader who can help it run the republic, but has
not yet found anyone who has the trust or popularity of a majority
of Chechens. The Kremlin had placed hopes on Bislan Gantamirov, a
convicted embezzler it let out of jail to help conquer Grozny. But
the military later decided it could not trust Gantamirov's
2,500-member militia enough to fight alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   For all the difficulties of their mission, Russian officers
express little doubt about the need to clear Chechnya of rebel
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But once they are out of earshot of their commanders, some
Russian soldiers tell a story of frustration and fear in dealing
with Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friendly with them by day, then at night they kill us.
It is terrible, and I'm tired of it,'' said Mikhail Larin, a
noncommissioned officer who was returning to his Siberian homeland
after three months at war. ``Even the Chechen women, even the
loyalists, they come up to us and say, `We're going to drive you
out.' If they wanted to, that's what they'd do.''

   LEBANON-PRISON _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Until she her release during
the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, Journalism student Cosette
Ibrihim spent 9 months in the notorious Al-Khaim prison, run by
Israel's allies, the South Lebanon Army. She said that as a
Christian and the objects of an international human rights cause,
she received ``lenient treatment'' a month of interrogations and
beatings, no trials or lawyers. ``Here,'' here captors told her,
``You defend yourself.'' Lebanese are debating whether to turn the
hill top prison into a museum or turn it into a prison for
collaborators. Inmates there in the '80s describe days chained to
electrical posts, sessions of dowsings with extremely hot or
extremely cold water. While her country celebrates Israel's
withdrawal, Ibrihim is suffering from stress, aggravated ulcers and
exhaustion. She's bitter and unsure of what to do with her life.

   WASHINGTON _ A week from Saturday, Bill Clinton will don a cap

Minn.

   ``Commencement speeches are one of the best chances a president
has to speak at length about a serious topic and not be guided or
constrained by the needs of an audience or the brevity you have to
have in the Rose Garden,'' said Michael Waldman, Clinton's former
chief speechwriter and an adjunct faculty member at the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president especially enjoys schools that are a little more
off the beaten path,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Carleton, where on June 10, Clinton will
address the 423 graduates. The private liberal arts school, founded
in 1866, has never had a major commencement speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a phone call from the White House telling us President
Clinton was considering places to give his speech and would we be
interested in having the president visit,'' said Marla Holt, a
spokeswoman for Carleton College.
</P>
<P>
   During that call in early April, school officials were told that
if they were interested in having Clinton speak, they should invite
him.
</P>
<P>
   They did, and he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, a spokesman said, can't claim
credit for that coup, nor could the state's senior senator, Paul D.
Wellstone, a Democrat who taught political science at Carleton for
21 years before becoming a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were informed after the fact,'' Ventura spokesman John
Wodele said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy they got him, but Wellstone wasn't involved,''
said Jim Farrell, the senator's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   One person who extolled the virtues of Carleton _ though White
House aides say it was after the school made Clinton's short list _
was Thomas Freedman, a senior adviser to the president and a 1985
graduate of Carleton.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, White House aides say, no one is sure exactly how
Clinton settled on Carleton.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cabinet officers pushing their favorite policy themes for
Clinton's State of the Union address, aides early in the year begin
promoting topics Clinton might want to explore for commencement and
schools where he might want to explore them.
</P>
<P>
   Aides sort through dozens of invitations from schools; in 1993,
the year Boston's Northeastern University was chosen, there were no
fewer that 200. Northeastern's prospects were boosted by personal
lobbying from such Bay Staters as Senator Edward M. Kennedy and
former governor Michael Dukakis. It didn't hurt that Massachusetts
handed Clinton one of the largest margins of victory over President
George Bush in the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   Geography is a factor in the selection, current and former White
House aides say, and so are Clinton's connections to a particular
school or promises he may have made to speak at a graduation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Clinton chose New Hampshire Technical College
in Stratham for the first commencement address of his presidency,
he was making good on a promise to Greg Fuller, a student he met
while campaigning in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Clinton delivers three commencement addresses,
except in 1994, when he gave two plus the convocation at the
University of California at Los Angeles. Of the three speeches each
year, one is always at a military academy, chosen on a rotating
basis. Last year, he spoke to graduates at the US Air Force Academy
in Colorado Springs. On May 17, Clinton spoke at the US Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a service academy, Clinton speaks at one private
college and one public university. ``He likes to go not just to the
Harvards and the Yales, but he will ask specifically to go to some
of the smaller schools,'' White House deputy press secretary Jake
Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clinton has never delivered a commencement address at
Harvard or Yale. But Princeton served as the backdrop in 1996 for
Clinton to summon the spirit of the post-World War II GI Bill in
proposing a $1,500 tax credit to help the impoverished, and many
from the middle class, go to college. Congress later enacted the
Hope Scholarship program into law.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the
president used a commencement speech at Michigan State University,
located near a training site for militant antigovernment groups, to
admonish militia groups. It was where he uttered one of the more
memorable lines of his presidency: ``You can't love your country
and hate your government.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in 1997, the diverse campus at the University of California
at San Diego was the site for his call for America to deal with its
racial problem, a speech given shortly after the state had passed
an antiaffirmative action ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years, he goes in with an eye toward making news . . . or
to put himself in the middle of a news event,'' Siewert said.
``Sometimes what he says might not make headlines the next day, but
will stand up very well historically.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldman said Clinton agonizes over those speeches. ``He spends a
lot of time rewriting, poring over his own words and ideas, so you
can learn a lot about what is on his mind by what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of Clinton's commencement addresses contrasts with
his two predecessors, though in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan gave only one commencement address a year, or
eight during his presidency _ four of them at military academies
and one at his alma mater, Eureka College in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a comparative chatterbox, speaking at 20 college and
military commencements in just four years, compared with Clinton's
23 speeches in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Commencement speeches are a ``big showcase'' for presidents,
Waldman said. And for Clinton, whose speechwriters look for
thematic threads each year to link the addresses, that's especially
true. ``If you look at all the commencement speeches throughout his
term,'' Waldman said, ``they really do tell a story of his
presidency.''

KENNEDY IS QUIETLY SETTING NEW AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Here are some numbers you are unlikely to hear
discussed in the current mad dash to the ``center'' in national
politics. They come courtesy of Senator Edward M. Kennedy and form
the ingredients for what needs to become a national preoccupation
once the desultory presidential campaign is history.
</P>
<P>
   Between the end of the 1970s, when double-digit inflation had
the economy in a vise, and the mid-1990s, just before the current,
unprecedented expansion began to accelerate significantly, the
earnings of typical 25- to 34-year-olds who had never finished high
school fell by nearly a third.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period the earnings of people who had graduated
from four-year colleges shot up by a 133 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Working full time, year-round, at the minimum wage with not a
single day of vacation is a guarantee of abject poverty. You would
earn just under $11,000, or $3,500 below the poverty line for a
family of three, $6,300 below it for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Women continue to take in just 73 cents for every dollar earned
by a man. In terms of women of color, the figures are 63 percent
for an African-American, 53 cents for a Latina.
</P>
<P>
   The wage gap in terms of jobs of comparable worth is large and
growing. It deprives the average women $4,200 in income annually,
and the figure swells to $420,000 over a career. Wage inequality
costs the US economy as well as victimized females some $200
billion a year. If pay equity existed, poverty rates in the United
States would drop by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers exist after a record-setting economic expansion.
The fact is that the expansion hasn't begun to have an impact on
the earnings of average working families, much less the poor. When
Bill Clinton ran for president eight years ago, he declared
full-time employment at poverty wages an enemy, but it has proved a
durable one.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy in just the last week has twice zeroed in on what ought
to be the outrage of low-wage employment, meaning that
progressivism's most reliable leading indicator is once again
moving to define what should be on the country's next page. The
first instance was at his commencement appearance at Bentley
College; the second was at a meeting here that brought together
organizations as disparate as the Ford and Rockefeller foundations,
the AFL-CIO, and the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's agenda is not radical. It starts with raising the
minimum wage, a goal that still eludes a gridlocked Congress. It
may be a familiar fight, but the fact remains that it is the
quickest way to lift 10 million workers stuck at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Investment in education and training is another way. Kennedy is
backing the front lines of this struggle _ the country's community
colleges _ as well as business-city partnerships and the public
schools themselves. Anyone who can manage at least a couple of
years schooling beyond high school is almost certain to end up
above the median in income. And no progress will be made in these
critical areas if precious resources are wasted on cutting the top
rates of income tax; we can either indulge ourselves or address the
country's unmet needs in a time of plenty. The fiscal resources do
not exist to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that the best economic stimulus program would be to
put a fair wage in the pockets of the women currently being denied
one, Kennedy is pushing a long-overdue toughening of existing law
to ban wage discrimination affecting workers in equivalent jobs in
the same workplace and a toughening of remedies for women denied
equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also asserts that the landmark Family and Medical Leave
Act of seven years ago needs to be nudged beyond its present
guarantees of unpaid leave. He thinks it's time for responsibly
managed paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy notes that several states are already studying or
acting, including New Hampshire and Vermont, where the state Senate
recently passed legislation allowing its citizens to collect
unemployment compensation during parental leave; a similar
initiative has been introduced in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The monster gap that remains is health insurance. As Kennedy has
noted, lack of it is now the seventh-ranking ``and most
preventable'' of all causes of death in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Like Al Gore, Kennedy is a committed incrementalist, but there
are signs that he is beginning to think about a blueprint for
national health insurance that would include all the interim steps
that need to be taken to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Massachusetts political world is focused on the
ballot access soap opera of a possible opponent to Kennedy this
fall or on elevating the state's Libertarian Party to a status it
has never earned from the voters.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it's more interesting to focus on what Kennedy himself
is thinking and doing, because it always has far more relevance to
the state's working families.

<P>
   BREWSTER, Mass. _ She waits on tables eight hours a day. She is
a soccer mom and a softball mom, proud of children who get A's in
school and she's usually there to help a mother who is ill. She
drives a station wagon and has the confident, sporty features of a
woman who probably turns a few heads when she drives through town.
</P>
<P>
   And she is homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Susan O'Donnell, more than four years without a permanent
residence, is living at a campsite in Nickerson State Park with her
three daughters. O'Donnell doesn't drink, she doesn't smoke, and
says she's too proud to accept public assistance. She earns $21,000
a year and much praise from managers at the Homeport Restaurant in
Orleans, where she has worked, with only a few days off, for the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear? Yes, sometimes the darkness scares me,'' the 39-year-old
mother explained the other night, seated in a lawn chair she had
salvaged from a dumpster and repaired. Only a hint of Thursday's
light remained on the western horizon, the kerosene lantern was not
yet lit. ``Mostly I fear that this won't end. I try so hard to be
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Donnells and, by one homeless agency count last year, 67
other families _ including 122 children _ on quaint old Cape Cod
are caught in an affordable housing vacuum. Cape officials say
they've never seen it so severe. The homeless are doubled up with
other families, or living in cars or tents. This year, the
caseloads are running about 30 ahead of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Skyrocketing real estate prices have dramatically reduced the
number of homes available for year-round rental. Houses that were
once rented to members of the labor force on which the Cape tourism
industry depends are being sold at an unprededented rate, the
owners cashing in on investments that appreciated more than 20
percent just last year.
</P>
<P>
   New owners with money to spare are demolishing those houses,
building what around here are known as ``starter castles,'' then
leaving them vacant during the off season. Meanwhile, a seasonal
rental for less than $1,500 a week is considered a steal.``What
we've got here is a classic case of the rich getting richer, while
the poor suck air,'' said Todd Holland, treasurer of the Orleans
Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet today, a single adult with no children on Cape
Cod must earn an annual salary of approximately $40,000, according
to William Zammer Jr., owner of the Coonamessett Inn and two other
restaurants in Falmouth. The starting salary down the street at the
White Hen Pantry is $7 an hour, which amounts to less than $15,000
a year. The ``Help Wanted'' sign has been in the convenience store
window for two years, according to owner Lois Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   She sometimes has to work all three shifts without a break,
``which was not what I envisioned when I moved to this paradise,''
said Kendall, 54.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's hard to find a restaurant, inn, or gas station on
the Cape without a ``Help Wanted'' sign in the window. Four weeks
ago, Zammer purchased the old Hotel Falmouth so he could rent
accommodations to 70 employees to help him survive the summer
season. Cape employers have guaranteed the US government jobs for
3,122 people from other countries this summer if work visas are
granted. Last summer, 2,800 workers from 30 countries filled the
jobs. Some resort owners are busing help in daily from New Bedford.
Peter Hall, owner of Van Rensselaer's Restaurant in Wellfleet, just
added a fifth mobile home to his employee camp to accommodate a
host of Eastern European waiters.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, the shortage of housing for summer help is
so acute that plans are underway to build 200-bed dormitory at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's a drop in the bucket. It could be 2,000 beds, and
it still would not be enough,'' said Herbert Putnam, a business
owner who is spearheading the project.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cape, about 5 percent of the housing stock is classified
affordable, according to the Cape Cod Commission; that's half the
state's recommended minimum. Many units are occupied by the elderly
or persons with disabilities. As one fisherman put it, drawing on
an image of his trade, ``the Cape is being gutted of the middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who grew up here, work here, and make the Cape what it
is, simply can't live here anymore,'' said Roger Cahoon, owner of
the 7 Cs Fish Market in West Yarmouth. ``So what? So you're losing
the soul of the place, not to mention the hands that feed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan O'Donnell is struggling to make sure her soul is not among
the lost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell lives in an old camper that broke down four times on
its way into Nickerson. Melissa, 14, Lindsay, 11, and Emily, 4,
live in a tent under a large tarp that Melissa takes pride in
helping erect because she had to climb 15 feet up one tree to
fasten an end.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell estimates at least a half-dozen homeless are legally
camped at Nickerson _ people shower in campsite washrooms, cook on
barbecue grills, sleep in brightly colored tents, wash clothes in
the laundromat, and laugh with their children like the vacationers
staying at the 418-site campground that is fully booked this
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum camping stay at Nickerson is two weeks, for $12 a
night. O'Donnell will get a six-week camping permit at no charge
when the season's official meter starts ticking June 15 because she
has agreed to clean the campground toilets. There will be no more
extensions; she does not know what she will do when her permit
expires.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, one woman caught camping illegally became the stuff
of local homeless legend when she subsequently slipped into a
bank-possessed house in Eastham. She convinced the cable company
and utilities to resume service, but got caught a month later only
because she kept mowing the lawn. The place looked conspicuously
tidy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell moved to Nickerson last week because the house she had
been renting off season for $680 a month will be sold June 1. The
same thing happened with a different house the year before, and the
year before that in yet another house. Each summer began at
Nickerson, then continued in the driveways of friends or relatives
until she could find an affordable off-season rental. But, as real
estate agents point out, fewer homeowners are renting homes after
they leave in the fall because in this economy, the rental money is
not worth the trouble of packing up. She fears that this year her
camper existence may extend beyond the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 989 people applied for housing help at the Interfaith
Council for the Homeless, an Orleans-based advocacy organization
serving eight communites on the Lower Cape. Almost 400 people
applied for help in the first quarter of this year. A few get
housing, many get shelter help. The agency did not have placement
figures available.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this community, a lot of people don't understand that you
don't have to be pushing a shopping cart of belongings to be
homeless. For the most part, they're invisible,'' said Christine
Austin, the program director at Interfaith. It irks her that the
wealthy destroy cottages to make way for bigger homes, when those
cottages could be relocated for affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who is divorced, moved to the Cape 11 years ago from
Medfield to be with her brother, two sisters, and mother. ``We all
have support systems. I could never leave the Cape, because I could
never leave my mother, brother, and sisters,'' O'Donnell said. But
she said her siblings have too many children to share a house with
four more people.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day: She's up to clean toilets at dawn, then gets the
children ready for school. Melissa goes to Nauset Middle School,
where she is in the honors program. Lindsay is ``on the verge'' of
honors at the Cape Cod Lighthouse Charter School in Orleans. Emily
stays with her grandmother, who has not been well. O'Donnell goes
to work until about 3 p.m., then she picks up the children to
attend the various after-school sporting events. Often she also
helps her mother with chores. She is home by 6 p.m. to cook supper
either on the grill or a Coleman stove. The kerosene lights go out
around 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, the children go to their grandmother's early so
O'Donnell can get to work by 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Off season, the camper sits in a friend's driveway.
</P>
<P>
   And what will she do when her six-week permit expires? ``I don't
know,'' she replied. In the near darkness, Melissa has been
assembling the myriad pieces of a geodesic dome from a kit. It will
become the children's play area. The directions are the kind that
might ruin Christmas morning for a parent. Her cocked head as she
worked suggested she was listening.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has friends in the construction business, some of them
also living at campsites. ``How strange it is,'' she remarked,
``that so many houses sit empty all winter, and so many people
can't find a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a hard day. Most of the previous week had been
rainy, and she spent the afternoon at the doctor's office. Three of
the four O'Donnells had been diagnosed with strep throat. The smoke
from the campfire could not have been helping sore throats, but its
glow was warming.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell was asked if she had any heroes. She thought for a
moment, then melted into tears, apologizing profusely for letting
down the facade of strength that gets her from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids,'' she sobbed. ``They are my heroes. I don't know how
they put up with this, but they do. I try to never let them see me
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the geodesic dome erected, Melissa came over and
put her arm around her mother.

   VIRTUAL WAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo and Beyond &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Ignatieff &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 246 pp., $23 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When NATO bombs started falling on Yugoslavia last spring,
debate over the campaign to oust Serb troops and paramilitaries
from Kosovo fell mainly into two schools of thought.
</P>
<P>
   Those who supported the intervention, the Western alliance's
first serious war effort, argued on humanitarian grounds that force
was required to halt Serbian atrocities and to end the forced
emigration of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, nearly a million of whom
had been driven from their homes, often at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The other position went something like this: No matter how
terrible the violence on the ground, it was wrong and hypocritical
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to employ means just as
violent in defense of its principles. To this camp, negotiations
and diplomatic pressure were the only justifiable responses.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Virtual War,'' Michael Ignatieff, a journalist who has
written extensively about the Balkans, lays siege to the latter
school of thought. Still, despite his vigorous support of NATO's
forcing the Serbs to withdraw from Kosovo, he highlights the
potential pitfalls and abuses of such a precedent. While Ignatieff
sketches the conflict's history and comes to (often dubious)
conclusions about its political and military consequences, his book
is essentially an essay in justification of using force to prevent
mass crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting part comes in the fourth chapter, a
transcript of a heated exchange of e-mail between Ignatieff and
Robert Skidelsky, an author, liberal philosopher, and independent
member of Britain's House of Lords. Unlike many partisans, who give
short shrift to or distort opposing views, Ignatieff allows
Skidelsky to present his dissent elaborately and, more important,
in his own words. And their dispute is far more nuanced than a
black-or-white disagreement; it's more a matter of moral, legal,
and political shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Although Skidelsky recognized Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic's savage history of ethnic cleansing, he argued that NATO
violated international law by acting without authorization from the
United Nations. ``Operation Allied Force,'' as NATO dubbed the
bombing, served only to increase tensions with Russia and China, he
said, making the world more prone to war. The alliance, in his
view, sent a lamentable message around the world: Force, not law,
governs international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ignatieff defends NATO's bypassing of the United
Nations, citing the inevitable prospect of Russian and Chinese
vetoes and the UN's failure to prevent massacres in the previous
Balkan war in Bosnia. He then defines the crux of his ``just war''
philosophy: ``Armed intervention can only be justified in two
instances: First, when human rights abuses rise to the level of a
systematic attempt to expel or exterminate large numbers of people
who have no means of defending themselves; second, when these
abuses threaten the peace and security of neighboring states.''
Ignatieff also adds this caveat: All diplomatic alternatives must
be exhausted first, and force should be used only in a credible
way, as a means to a political end, and not simply as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of his philosophy derive from NATO's much maligned
dithering over the war in Bosnia. Ignatieff and many other
witnesses of the Serbs' barbaric shelling of Sarajevo in the early
'90s called on the West to do something to blunt the violence. And
after NATO ultimately did bomb the Serbs _ which pushed the warring
parties to sign the 1995 Dayton peace accord _ the lesson for
Ignatieff was clear: Used properly, force can be humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   So when the sparks started flames in the tinderbox of Kosovo
last year, history informed such observers as Ignatieff that NATO
should not wait around for the violence to escalate, as it did in
Bosnia _ that the West should act earlier rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   To those against the air campaign, however, NATO seemed all too
eager to use force. The alliance's open threat to bomb the
recalcitrant Serbs during the prewar peace talks in Rambouillet,
France, made the negotiations seem like a ruse. And if anything,
the lesson they say the bombing in Bosnia taught was that force is
the only way to settle a conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ignatieff points out that his intervention strategy
is vulnerable to manipulation. A savvy despot might easily pervert
the terms ``human rights'' or ``crimes against humanity'' to
justify invading another country or squelching his own people. And
Ignatieff is well aware that a modern democracy is also open to
such deceit. Indeed, he notes, manipulation of the public is ever
easier when such nations can intervene in wars with impunity,
leaders bypass congresses and parliaments by not calling their wars
``war,'' and when the upheld values are more rhetorical than real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who support military intervention in defense of human
rights,'' Ignatieff warns at the end of the book, ``need to back up
their abstract commitments with devout attention to the question of
whether, by intervening, we end up destroying what we tried to
save.''

ON THE TRAIL OF ST. ANTHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUA, &UR;  &LR; Italy _ You can't really get lost in Padua.
</P>
<P>
   The place isn't all that big, for one thing, and the main sites
of interest are concentrated in the compact heart of the old town,
within easy walking distance of the railroad station and one
another. Most important, Padua's patron saint _ and most famous
resident _ is St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most beloved of Italian saints, St. Anthony is
credited with many miracles, but his particular saintly specialty
is finding lost things of all sorts. Since this presumably also
includes disoriented tourists, visitors can feel free to relax and
wander unworried through the streets of old Padua.
</P>
<P>
   A humble man who modeled himself after St. Francis of Assisi,
St. Anthony died in 1231. He was canonized within 18 months of his
death, and work began immediately on a church to hold his venerated
remains. Over the centuries the building was rebuilt, enlarged, and
beautified many times but almost always in a different style.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an enormous and imposing but rather bizarre
looking multidomed basilica that blends Byzantine, Gothic, and
Romanesque elements. From some angles it looks like St. Mark's in
Venice, from others a Turkish mosque. There's no other building in
Italy quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to accommodate throngs of pilgrims, the interior of the
church is vast and echoing. The main altar at the end of the long
nave has fine 15th-century reliefs by Donatello depicting St.
Anthony curing the sick and performing other miracles. The saint's
tomb is in a candlelit side chapel, the walls of which are covered
with votive photos and tokens put there by people who credit him
with keeping them from harm or answering their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the traditional formal prayer to invoke St.
Anthony's aid in finding anything gone astray is:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear St.Anthony, please come 'round.
</P>
<P>
   Something's lost and can't be found.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a less reverent version, long favored by parochial
school kids, that goes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, Tony. Listen', listen!
</P>
<P>
   Tony, Tony. Somethin's missin'!''
</P>
<P>
   The large square in front of the basilica, Piazza del Santo, is
one of Padua's principal gathering places. On St. Anthony's feast
day, June 13, pilgrim's from all over Europe and the world fill the
church and pack the piazza with the overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Even on an ordinary sunny Sunday, the square is a lively place.
Dozens of small stalls selling a variety of religious goods (St.
Anthony key chains are a popular item) circle the basilica, and the
piazza's perimeter is rimmed with busy outdoor cafes.There is no
statue of St. Anthony in the square named for him but there is an
impressive equestrian one by Donatello of the mercenary soldier
Gattamelata, the first large work in bronze of the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Padua also attracts a lot of artistic pilgrims. In fact, the
only reason some visitors come here is to see the marvelous
frescoes by Giotto in the Capella degli Scrovegni. The chapel was
commissioned in 1303 by Enrico Scrovegni to atone for the sins of
his father, a money lender so rapacious and vicious that he was
denied Christian burial and is one of the damned mentioned in
Dante's `` Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   The frescoes _ depicting the life of Mary, the life of Jesus,
the Passion and the Last Judgment _ are considered by art
historians and scholars (Sister Wendy among them, of course) as
masterpieces that mark the beginning of Western art. In contrast to
the rigid, stylized painting of the early Middle Ages, Giotto's
approach is relaxed and humanistic: The people he represents, from
shepherds to saint,s are three-dimensional, have feelings, and show
them.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel walls are covered with the Giotto frescoes, arranged
in three tiers of successive panels like a sort of medieval comic
book. The colors are mostly warm, glowing pastels that contrast
with a rich blue background. The frescoes are lovely to look at but
getting to look can take a while: The chapel is small, the number
of visitors allowed in is limited, and there can be a wait to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   The Capella Scrovegni is in a pleasant public garden, next to
the ruins of the Roman arena. It's part of a complex that includes
the Civic Museum, housed in the former Monastery of the Eremitani.
</P>
<P>
   While not in the same class as the Uffizi in Florence or the
Accademia in Venice, the Eremitani is a superb and relatively
undervisited museum. It has an archeological section and one of the
world's largest coin collections, but the main attraction is the
Pinoteca, a wonderful art gallery with a particularly good
selection of paintings by noted artists of the local Veneto school,
including Giotto, Bellini, and Tintoretto.
</P>
<P>
   The museum complex also includes the monastic church of the
Eremitani, which was almost destroyed in an air raid in 1944.The
church has been rebuilt but only sad fragments of the renowned
15th-century frescoes by Mantegna depicting the lives of St. James
and St. Christopher remain.
</P>
<P>
   It's only about a mile from the Civic Museum to Piazza del
Santo, a pleasant walk that takes you through Padua's medieval
core, which is dominated by its ancient university. Founded in
1221, the University of Padua is the second oldest in Italy.
Consistently progressive, in the 16th century Padua built Europe's
first permanent anatomy theater for its medical school and in the
17th century became the first university in the world to admit
women.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the medieval inn that once stood on the site, the main
university block is known as the Bo, or the Ox. Attesting to its
antiquity, the Bo's gateways, lecture halls, and inner courtyard
are encrusted with four centuries' accumulation of coats of arms of
illustrious graduates and patrons. Guided tours of the Bo are
available on weekdays, and highlights include the lectern Galileo
used when he taught physics here from 1592 to 1610, and the proudly
preserved anatomy theater.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Bo are the two central squares of Padua, Piazza
della Fruta and Piazza della Erbes, the sites of the daily fruit
and vegetable markets. Separating the two squares is the remarkable
Palazzo Ragione, commonly referred to as the Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the early 13th century as law courts and a meeting
place for the city council, the salon was one of the architectural
triumphs of its day. The grand second story assembly room is more
than 260 feet long and is the largest undivided medieval hall in
Europe. The walls of the hall are covered with colorful
15th-century frescoes depicting the signs of the zodiac, the months
of the year, and seasonal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Salon is the much smaller but also pretty grand
Caffe Pedrocchi. Built in 1831 to resemble a classical temple, it
has been a favorite meeting place of Padua's intellectual and
social elite ever since. The building contains a concert hall and
exhibition space but the cafe still provides an elegant place to
take a break and relax over a cappuccino.

A HANDY GUIDE FOR TRAVELS   TO CAPE COD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heading for Cape Cod? Then look to the Smart Guide for ways to
get to and around the Cape and the islands without driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Smart Guide shows how to get around by boat, plane, bus, and
train. For example, from downtown Boston there is daily boat
service to Provincetown. Bay State Cruise Co. offers both a fast
ferry and a classic ferry experience. Boston Harbor Cruises has a
fast ferry. And from Plymouth Harbor, Capt. John Boats travels to
Provincetown.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-page Smart Guide is free at state information centers on
Route 3 and 25 on the way to the Cape and other locations or by
calling 508-862-0700. It's now available online at
www.smartguide.org. By clicking on the site's Travel Planner, users
can link directly to each service provider's Web site for
schedules, fares, and tickets. Information is provided for travel
from Boston, New Bedford, New York, and Providence.
</P>

   The information covers the 15 Cape towns as well as Nantucket
and Martha's Vineyard. There are also hints on using bicycles,
rental vehicles, park-and-ride lots, and walking trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of seasonal traffic congestion, taking one or more
cars to Cape Cod and the islands is no longer the smartest travel
choice,'' said Dan Wolf, chairman of the Cape Cod Chamber's
transportation committee.
</P>
<P>
   The guide also includes information on how to avoid road delays
caused by repairs to the Bourne and Sagamore bridges.

London, Rome, India, and Pakistan, and runs through Nov. 1. Among
other items on view is an Oleg Cassini gown she wore to a state
dinner in Paris on May 31, 1961 at which time President Kennedy
remarked, ``I do not think it altogether inappropriate to introduce
myself. I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris,
and I have enjoyed it.''

Dickinson weekend
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of America's most enigmatic poet are invited to immerse
themselves in her work and life this autumn, as part of the Seventh
Annual Emily Dickinson's World bed-and-breakfast weekend. An
in-depth look at the 19th-century poet will be featured through
private tours, talks, readings, and other activities at the height
of the foliage season, a time when, in Dickinson's words, ``The
maple wears a gayer scarf _ The field a scarlet gown.'' The Oct.
6-8 weekend is a fund-raiser for the Amherst Unitarian Universalist
Society, whose members turn their homes into bed-and-breakfasts for
the event. The weekend is $275 a person and includes two nights'
lodging, five meals, and all tours and events. For a brochure or

   Lyme warning
</P>
<P>
   Vacationers headed to wooded, bushy, or overgrown grassy areas
might consider the new vaccine for Lyme disease, an infection
caused by bacteria transmitted via the bite of ticks that live on
deer or white-footed mice. ``But, the new vaccine might prove
tricky for travelers who do not plan their trips far in advance,''
said Dr. Cliff Dacso with the Travel Medicine Service at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston. ``Recommendations call for vaccine
doses to be given in three injections over the course of a year.
Booster shots may be needed over time.'' Dacso noted that no
vaccine offers perfect protection so he encourages nature
enthusiasts to practice standard preventive measures such as
wearing protective clothing, using tick repellent, and removing
attached ticks as quickly as possible. Caught early, Lyme disease
is highly treatable. Left untreated, in rare cases the illness can
lead to a disabling arthritis and neurological problems.
Individuals who are at high risk are those who live or play in the
Northeast or Mid-Atlantic states, particularly along the coastal
areas from Maine to Virginia.

INDUSTRY FIGHTS FOR $20 BILLION VIEDO GAME MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A graphic is being sent to NYTNS clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling
888-346-9867 or 888-603-1036.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The video game industry, purveyor of graphic fight
games, is headed for its own real-life carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Girding for the battle are four Titans lined up in a bid for the
next-generation game console market: Sony Computer Entertainment,
Sega Enterprises Ltd., Nintendo Co., and the industry's newest
entrant, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The prize: a $20 billion annual market worldwide that analysts
say is growing more rapidly than the film or music industries.
</P>
<P>
   With two in every five US households owning game consoles, the
video game business has turned into a high-stakes business that's
no longer just about fun and games. For companies such as Sony and
Microsoft, it has become a deadly serious quest to be the dominant
entertainment hub for the world's living rooms, positioning the
survivors to sell movies, music, and other forms of digital
entertainment over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind their cheerful mascots is a brutal economic calculus
where billions are invested in each generation of consoles for a
market that has room for only one or two winners. In a race to
penetrate as many households as quickly as possible, most console
makers lose money for each machine they sell in the hopes that they
can make up for the losses in future software sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ugly business,'' said Peter Moore, president of Sega
of America Dreamcast Inc., a subsidiary of the Japanese company.
``Hardware is sold at cost or below to get a large installed base.
There is tremendous carnage involved in getting to that installed
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all is dire in the video game business. The good news is
that gaming is no longer just a pastime for adolescent boys. Women
and older consumers are increasingly embracing video games, drawn
by their hyper-realistic graphics and a growing genre of programs,
from puzzle games to ``edutainment'' software.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, US video game sales now rival Hollywood box-office
revenues. More people than ever are playing video games and
spending more time doing it. More than 40 percent of US households
now have at least one game console, according to estimates from
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is also converging with the Internet. Aside from
e-mail, game playing is rapidly becoming one of the Web's most
popular uses. The gaming industry is exploiting that popularity by
making a built-in modem a standard feature for next-generation
consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers eventually will be able to download games, movies and
music via their consoles, opening up a whole new source of revenue.
And many consumers will pay monthly fees to participate in
``massively multiplayer'' games, such as Ultima, a popular online
fantasy game that can accommodate thousands of players at once.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, however, console makers must win the race for
getting the most number of machines into consumers' hands over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been this riveting,'' said Matt Gravett, game
analyst at PC Data, a market research firm in Reston, Va. ``The
market is larger than it's even been, so the stakes are a lot
higher than they've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Each round in the console game wars has lasted about five years,
and the business is now poised to enter a new round. The four
contestants are pursuing distinct console strategies and
introducing markedly different products.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Computer Entertainment. After making its debut with the
PlayStation console in 1995, Sony emerged as the undisputed winner
of the last round. Last year, Sony captured 54 percent of the US
game hardware market and 68 percent of the software gaming market,
according to the NPD Group Inc., an industry tracking firm in Port
Washington, N.Y. One in four US households currently has a
PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is hoping to repeat its success with PlayStation 2, which
is set to hit store shelves in late October. The new console, which
doubles as a digital video disk (or DVD) player, is wildly popular
in Japan, where Sony has sold nearly 2 million units since
launching PlayStation 2 there in March.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also has the most ambitious plans for its console. The
entertainment giant is looking to use the machines as a potential
platform for distributing other products over the Internet,
including its own movies and music and those of other companies,
according to Molly Smith, spokeswoman for Sony's American division.
</P>
<P>
   But success is not a foregone conclusion for Sony. For one
thing, PlayStation 2, at $299 each, is relatively costly. Rival
machines cost between $99 and $199. Another potential drawback is
the relatively sparse number of new games available for PlayStation
2, said Charles Gray, publisher of Happy Puppy, an online gaming
site based in New York. Game developers say that is partly because
the new machine is so complex that it's tough to write games for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that what sells consoles are games,'' said Gray.
Referring to the Sony booth at the annual trade show in Los Angeles
earlier this month, he said, ``Sony had a pretty underwhelming show
on the software side.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega Enterprises Ltd. The comeback kid of the video game
business, Sega crashed to earth in the mid-1990s with its Saturn
console, a dismal failure that followed its popular Genesis system.
But Sega surprised many in the industry with its Dreamcast machine,
rolled out last fall. Sega has sold more than 2 million Dreamcasts
and snagged a 14 percent share of the US game hardware market in
1999, according to NPD figures.
</P>
<P>
   Sega has shrewdly nurtured Dreamcast sales by courting outside
software developers who help keep the pipeline full of new games,
including Crazy Taxi, Resident Evil, and Quake III Arena. Moore,
the San Francisco-based president of Sega of America, estimates
another 170 games for the coming holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   With Sega.com set to launch this fall, Sega will be the first
company to actually have a live online gaming site for its
consoles. But the strategy is risky, analysts say, because it asks
consumers to fork over $21.95 a month for Internet access to the
Sega site. To make the pill go down more smoothly, Sega is offering
a $200 rebate to anyone who signs up for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``it's a bit steep,'' said Gravett of PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Also working against Sega is the impending introduction of more
powerful machines, such as the PlayStation 2. Moore dismisses the
threat, saying, ``Power is relative. It's not what you've got; it's
how you use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo Co. The grandfather of the video game business,
Nintendo has built an empire from inexpensive machines and games
that feature well-known characters from Pokemon to Mario. The
company dominates the list of best-selling games in spite of the
fact that its current machine, the Nintendo 64, is based on old,
costly cartridge technology rather than CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nintendo took 33 percent of the hardware market and
28 percent of the software market, according to the NPD Group.
(Those figures don't include sales of Game Boy, Nintendo's wildly
popular portable gaming device, which controls the lion's share of
the hand-held market category.)
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's next-generation console _ code-named Dolphin _ is due
out some time next year. The console will use DVD technology and
sport a 400-megahertz IBM copper microprocessor twice as fast as
the Dreamcast and one-third faster than the PlayStation 2. But
aside from the chip, Nintendo isn't revealing much about its new
console.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that so little is known about it,''
said Schelley Olhava, analyst with IDC in Mountain View, Calif.
``The longer they hold out information, the more the window of
opportunity closes for them. People are evaluating their purchasing
options now, and Nintendo needs to give these consumers more to go
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. The newest kid on the block and the sole US
challenger to three Japanese players, Microsoft is working hard to
break into the console market. It's part of the Redmond, Wash.,
company's overall strategy to expand beyond the realm of desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Though not scheduled to hit store shelves until fall 2001, the
company's prototype _ the X-Box _ was unveiled in March by
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. The X-Box towers above its
competitors in sheer computing power. It will have a 733-megahertz
Pentium III processor, a built-in broadband modem, 64 megabytes of
memory, and an internal hard disk drive, something no other console
has to date.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft knows that its success hinges upon games, and that
means winning the loyalty of game developers. Right now, the
company is busy touting the X-Box's developer-friendly platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a console based on PC technology that is very
familiar to developers and artists,'' said Ed Fries, vice president
of games publishing at Microsoft. ``This will allow developers to
focus on making great games, instead of struggling to figure out
how the machine works.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft isn't exactly new to games. The company is the world's
fifth-largest publisher of PC games and has operated an online
gaming site, called Zone.com, for four years. Nor is Microsoft new
to hardware; its joysticks and game pads outsell all other brands.
</P>
<P>
   But console gaming is an entirely different beast. PC games tend
to sell poorly in the console market, and Microsoft knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be developing a completely different set of games for
the X-Box,'' Fries said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Microsoft and its rivals know that consoles are
empty vessels that must be filled with compelling games in order to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just boxes,'' said Moore. ``The bottom line is that
it's all about the software inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the games begin.

SEEKING JUSTICE, NOT REVENGE IN ESTONIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia _ On a summer morning just before dawn, Lennart
Meri, 12, woke to the sound of stomping jackboots and strangers
shouting in Russian. When he opened his eyes, he saw two
bayonet-wielding Red Army soldiers standing over his bed.
</P>
<P>
   They ordered Meri, his parents, and his younger brother to dress
quickly and pack a suitcase. They then drove the family to a
railway depot where cargo trains waited, bound for Siberian labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The date was June 14, 1941, less than a year after Soviet forces
had invaded Estonia, a small country on the Baltic sea roughly the
size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined.
</P>
<P>
   Today that boy is president of Estonia, less than a decade after
the country regained its freedom from Moscow. His story is very
much Estonia's story, one of invasion, occupation and repression _
and a belated attempt to come to terms with a painful past. It is a
past whose details many Estonians have sought in the now-opened
files of the KGB, the former Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   On the same June day, in what some here call the start of a
1940s version of ethnic cleansing, Soviet authorities deported
10,000 Estonians to Siberia. Three-fourths of them died in the
harsh Russian winter.
</P>
<P>
   This history is very much a part of Estonia's present. As most
of Europe was celebrating the 55th anniversary of the end of World
War II earlier this month, Estonia was subdued. Here, the war was a
lose-lose affair.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia was overrun three times by two of the past century's
most nefarious regimes, once by Hitler's Germany and twice by
Stalin's Russia _ and was forcibly absorbed into the Soviet Union
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Soviets deported more than 30,000 Estonians to
Siberian labor camps in the 1940s. Nearly every family in the
country was affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were cattle carriages with small windows and iron bars.
Behind these bars I saw human faces, children weeping, women
weeping,'' Meri said in an interview at his home. A Soviet officer
told Meri's father, Georg, a prominent Estonian diplomat, that he
would be taken on a separate train.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father clasped my shoulder and said to me, `From now on you
are the eldest man in the family, so take care of your mother,' ''
Meri said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 71, Meri said that ``to build a free democratic future''
Estonia must ``shed the bright light of truth'' on its tragic past,
no matter how painful. ``We must do this for ourselves. We are
building a state based on the rule of law, and our citizens are
interested in addressing this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the Nazi and Soviet occupations equally odious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compare two evils. Evil is like love, either it
exists or it does not exist,'' Meri said.
</P>
<P>
   But while thousands of Nazi war criminals were prosecuted after
the war, those responsible for Soviet repression in Estonia had
gone unpunished _ until recently. Last year, law-enforcement
officials began prosecuting former Estonian and ethnic Russian
officials for ordering the arrests, deportations, and executions
that became the hallmark of Soviet rule here.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1999, meanwhile, a presidential commission has
been investigating crimes against humanity committed in Estonia
under Nazi and Soviet rule. The commission, whose members come from
the United States, Germany, Russia, Finland, and Denmark, is
expected to report in December.
</P>
<P>
   Meri and other officials said that in reckoning with its past,
Estonia must take extra care not to be vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being dogmatic always results in a terrible tragedy for any
nation,'' Meri said. ``We are very much aware that in such a
situation, one wrong step can lead to a horrible dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Mart Laar, 40, Estonia's prime minister, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very easy for us to decide that this one or that
one is guilty. But if we did that, we would be acting just like the
Nazi and the communist dictatorships. We are interested in being
different,'' said Laar, who lost relatives to both the Nazis and
the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Most deportees tell stories similar to Meri's.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests of those suspected of not being loyal enough to
Moscow usually were made in the small hours of the morning. Soviet
officers gave people minutes to pack before marching them to
waiting trains. Fathers were often separated from their families.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the deportations and immigration of Russians
loyal to Moscow, Estonia's ethnic mix changed dramatically. Before
the war, 95 percent of the population was Estonian; today, 65
percent are.
</P>
<P>
   While Meri and his family survived and were united after the
war, many others were not so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of Estonia's State Archive building, rows of
neatly stacked KGB files tell the stories of thousands of destroyed
lives. A deportation order for an entire family, including a
3-year-old girl. A 78-year-old man deported for owning a farm. A
21-year-old man executed for once belonging to the Young Eagles, an
organization similar to the Boy Scouts. A 17-year-old boy
imprisoned for wearing a ``forbidden'' high school pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, this is history, but it is also evidence _ evidence of
criminal deportations and executions,'' said an archive historian,
Indrek Jurjo, as he pointed at the stack of manila folders on his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   One file told the story of Leo Oispuu's family, like Meri's,
deported on June 14, 1941. Oispuu, now 69, was 10 years old at the
time. His father Magnus, his mother Kersti, and his brother Felix
all died in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB archives have been open to the public since 1994, and
every year hundreds of people come to investigate the fate of their
loved ones. They are also one of the main sources of evidence for
Estonian law-enforcement officials as they prepare cases against
Soviet-era officials.
</P>
<P>
   The process, according to Hannes Kont, a spokesman for Estonia's
Security Police, is tedious. Investigators pore through archives,
matching Soviet officials' signatures on deportation and execution
orders with death certificates to see who is still alive to face
trial. Since both the victims and the perpetrators are elderly,
finding living witnesses is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only convict a person if you have real evidence, not
just somebody making a speech saying he is guilty,'' Kont said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Estonian courts have convicted four former secret police
officials for organizing deportations and politically motivated
executions. All received suspended sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea is to get the courts to prove that the Soviet
regime committed crimes against humanity,'' Kont said. ``This is
not a question of revenge, but a question of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to neighboring Latvia, where trials of former Soviet
officials have sparked angry protests from the Russian minority,
the process is proceeding quietly in Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Estonians are going about this very wisely,'' said Sergei
Ivanov, an ethnic Russian who sits in Estonia's parliament. ``It is
necessary to evaluate what happened. There are people alive who saw
and experienced injustice.''

GORE FALLS INTO A `MARRIAGE GAP '
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Jeffrey Lloyd drives schoolchildren by the
busload to George Washington's home here, hoping that hearing the
story of a man who exemplified strong character, patriotism, and
self-discipline will teach them the virtues of presidential
leadership and stiffen their own moral fiber.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, a retired police officer, and the father of a
teenager, Lloyd says Al Gore is ``a decent man'' who sadly did not
have the strength to distance himself from President Clinton's weak
character. Come November, he plans to vote for Texas Governor
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Gerheiser last week chaperoned several dozen
middle-schoolers on a pre-Memorial Day field trip to the Founding
Fathers Potomac River plantation. She called the last four years
``a black spot on our country,'' and said that for the sake of her
family, she will do her part to guarantee that the blemish is not
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some things George Bush and I disagree on.
But no way will I vote for Al Gore, who stood there in Clinton's
shadow, not if you paid me! It's time for a change,'' said
Gerheiser of Crofton, Md., a stay-at-home parent of two
adolescents. She voted for Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Something odd is happening to Gore, by all accounts a happily
married and faithful husband, a devoted father and doting
grandfather, and a conscientious advocate for families. He has
fallen into a yawning ``marriage gap'' that is mostly about
morality, somewhat about his masculinity, minimally about issues,
and, if not reversed, could doom him on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates typically get a larger share of the vote
from married people, whose worries about mortgages and tuition
bills and the security of their offspring tend to make them more
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But what pollsters have seen this month is something new. Bush
leads Gore by 26 points among married men and 14 points among
married women in a Los Angeles Times poll, and Bush is ahead of
Gore by 30 points among white, married mothers in the Voter.com
Battleground poll. The results are unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gender gap is closing,'' said Celinda Lake, the
Battleground pollster who has studied the decided preference of
women for the Democratic ticket in the last two presidential
elections. ``The marriage gap now rivals the gender gap as a
hallmark feature of Americans' voting patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's people are not panicking, despite the polls and the
anecdotal warnings from married voters, including many parents like
Lloyd and Gerheiser. It is early, they say, adding that they
believe a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz stressing Gore's
good-guy biography and a clearer definition in presidential debates
of his positions on family issues will narrow the gap and give the
vice president the advantage he must regain with married women to
beat Bush. Gore now leads among unmarried men and women, polls
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a reflection of what the president went
through last year. There is no reason why marriage alone should
have this effect, except that the president wasn't an ideal married
man,'' said a senior Gore adviser who did not want to be
identified. ``The fact that married people are appalled doesn't
have anything to do with Gore per se, but there is this sort of pox
on both your houses, a leftover `yuck' factor.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal family values and the country's prosperity
notwithstanding, Gore is apparently being found guilty by
association with a president who, while he retains broad national
popularity, is viewed by many parents in particular as a man who
coarsened a culture that already assaults their children, and set a
tawdry moral example. It is not that married people expect magic
from Bush, but many hope a new broom will sweep clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the good economic news and general social optimism,
the one thing people remain pessimistic about is how things are
going with children,'' said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, an Amherst
author who studies marriage trends. ``Baby boomers, no matter how
libertarian they once were, have a sense that with the sex, drugs,
violence, and lack of strong adult role models, this is not a very
good environment for raising children.''
</P>
<P>
   By portraying GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole as a bit of an
old crank out of touch with soccer moms and dads, Clinton and Gore
kept the marriage gap small in 1996. But Bush, who talks the
modern-man talk of nurturing his twin daughters, respecting his
wife, and inheriting his parents' values, has baby-boomer
credentials that rival Gore's, plus a nonthreatening
``compassionate conservative'' approach and an agenda crafted to be
family-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a week goes by that Bush does not attend at least one
education-related event (at a private, religious school in Detroit
last week, he talked for an hour about character education), and
his plan to let younger workers manage and invest a portion of
their Social Security taxes is aimed, he says, at building wealth
that parents can pass on to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is eating into the Democrats' usual advantage with women
by talking about issues they care about,'' said Anna Greenberg, a
visiting scholar at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who
analyzes gender and voting. ``It's smart. He gets it, like other
Republican candidates haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing the gender card can be tricky because positions a
candidate might take to woo a woman voter, such as favoring gun
control, could well alienate a man. Many analysts, including
Greenberg, say the gender gap is the consequence of the Democrats'
success, since the 1960s, in appealing to women's concerns, an
effort that helped send many men fleeing to the GOP. Dole beat
Clinton by 11 points among white men in 1996. A Washington Post-ABC
News poll this month showed Bush leading Gore 58 percent to 35
percent among white men.
</P>
<P>
   But a candidate's personality counts, too, and that is another
problem for Gore, particularly among men. In a recent Pew Research
Center poll, men called Bush funnier and more interesting, honest,
inspiring, and charismatic than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of men see Gore as the kid who always had his hand up in
school, sort of the Eddie Haskell `I want to please' image,'' said
Pew poll director Andrew Kohut, referring to the unctuous teenager
on ``Leave It To Beaver.'' ``Those things really rub men the wrong
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brown, interviewed while touring Mount Vernon with his
wife, Susan, is a little put off by Bush's ``born with the silver
spoon in his mouth'' breeding. But, said the Kansas farmer and
father of three, ``Bush is still the kind of guy you could walk up
to and have a nice visit with.'' He thinks Gore is a ``phony'' who
hedged ``when he should have stood up and said flat out that the
things Clinton did weren't right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore looks soft, like a pushover,'' added Jeffrey Lloyd,
the Odenton, Md., bus driver. ``Now, there are a lot of people who
are attracted to the soft approach in politics, but it's not what's
best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions can become reality in politics, and Gore's
earth-toned wardrobe (recommended by his feminist adviser, Naomi
Wolf), the way he wears a Palm Pilot minicomputer on the basketball
court, and casting himself (erroneously) as the hero of the book
``Love Story'' have not helped counter Bush's more macho image as a
onetime, hard-drinking frat man who has a ranch in west Texas and
used to own a piece of a baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia sociologist Steven L. Nock, who has
written about the relationship between marriage and masculinity,
said he is not surprised that Gore is unpopular with many married
men. ``Less forceful, less aggressive, less assertive _ that would
not appeal to married men,'' Nock said. ``Gore comes across as sort
of a wuss, someone who doesn't take strong positions and basically
is not a very masculine guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an effort underway in the Gore campaign to highlight
Gore's record as a veteran who served in Vietnam (unlike Bush) and
as a tough-minded investigative reporter. The Wall Street Journal
reported last week that Gore's advisers recently convened a focus
group of women to determine which candidate they would prefer to
date. (Gore won, because he would be a better listener and less
likely than Bush to chew gum and honk the horn.) GOP pollster Frank
Luntz recently asked women which candidate they would prefer to
marry, and Bush got the nod for being less robotic.
</P>
<P>
   Karen McSweeney, sipping coffee as she nursed her 4-month-old
baby, said she finds the vice president's awkwardness attractive _
compared to Bush being ``slippery and canned'' _ and she thinks
Gore is a ``good family guy.'' But her faith in him was shaken when
Gore switched positions and said Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy, should not necessarily be returned to his father's
custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed. I expected more from Gore,'' said
McSweeney, who grew up in Melrose and now lives with her husband
and two children in Arlington, Va. ``It seemed like something
Clinton would do.''
</P>
<P>
   McSweeney said she won't vote for Bush, but she might support
Ralph Nader, who got her vote in 1996 because, she said, ``I didn't
think Clinton's values were in the right place.''

NARROWLY NAVIGATING THE STRAITS OF USAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
life,'' according to Matthew in the King James Bible. But the path
of strait through the centuries has been a long and winding road;
hence the puzzlement of several readers at my use of strait and
narrow a few weeks ago. ``I always thought it was straight,'' wrote
Dorothy Teehan of Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   Not always, but it is today. The accepted idiom has become
straight and narrow, meaning the path of rectitude, or sometimes
the path of small-minded conventionality. That's the version
dictionaries endorse, and you can use it without fear of reproach
even from straitlaced usage cops.
</P>
<P>
   But straight and narrow is a condensation of the biblical
caution, and writers who remember that _ and who fear the loss of
straitjacket and straitened and straitlaced to the encroaching
straight variations _ still sometimes use the original form. More
than one country music reviewer has found it handy when dealing
with singer George Strait. (Don't ask why more than one takes a
singular verb; our language soars above mere literalism.) Strait
and narrow is fairly frequent in the English press, and even in
America, it gets pretty good play in the South _ the Sun-Sentinel
in Fort Lauderdale, the Times-Picayune in New Orleans, the Houston
Chronicle, and especially the Dallas Morning News all have writers
(or editors) who remember their New Testament and stick with
strait.
</P>
<P>
   Where did it all start? With two entirely different words:
Strait, from the Latin for ``tighten, bind,'' is related to strict
and stringent. It's been an English word since the 1200s, with
various meanings related to limitation: Straitlaced means squinched
into a laced corset, like Scarlett O'Hara, or as stiff as if you
were; straitjacketed means tightly restrained, whether literally or
figuratively. And the person in straitened circumstances has
nowhere to turn, financially speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Straight, on the other hand, derives from the Middle English for
stretched, and in the 1300s is being used to mean both ``direct''
and ``not crooked'' _ the meanings that have migrated to our
contemporary straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see how such an evolution would proceed; straight
in the sense of ``righteous'' overlaps with the sense of strait,
``confined,'' and in less orthographically correct centuries, the
spellings were often interchanged even when the senses were clearly
distinct. There's even a logical rationale for straight and narrow:
Once we've condensed the quotation from Matthew to strait and
narrow, it's redundant. Strait means constricted, and so does
narrow, but nothing about the original image suggests directness;
the path may well be full of twists and turns. Change it to
straight and narrow, and your image of the way to salvation _ or
merely to avoiding jail _ is more like a tightrope than a dark and
tortuous trail. Not as poetic, perhaps, as what Matthew had in
mind, but the straight and narrow, whether you use it to mean
conventional dullness or effortful virtue, is a useful
modification.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it's officially the idiom now, despite the
sentimental attachment of some word watchers to the older form. So
go ahead and use straight and narrow; just keep those other
expressions strait, if you please.
</P>
<P>
   Dialectally challenged
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I wrote that berm was ``dialectically''
used in New England as a term for the curbside planting strip.
Philip Sawyer of New York e-mailed to point out that I'd been swept
up from the sidewalk into the realm of philosophy: What I should
have written was dialectally. ``The former term refers to the
dialectic (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) rather than to matters
related to speech,'' he notes. And it's true; Hegelian logic and
Marxist dialectical materialism have nothing to do with our names
for that streetside plot. Dialectally may not have the same snap,
but for a word maven sticking to the straight and narrow, it's the
only adverbial form on the books.

ATTACKING THE ROOT OF CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laura B. Smith had one of the bad breast cancers, the ones that
recur and spread and defy even the harshest chemotherapy drugs
reserved for desperate cases.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, after the disease spread to her neck, ``the doctor
said I had three to five years,'' said Smith, a 38-year-old mother
of three who lives near Indianapolis. ``I told her I needed another
15 or 20 years, so she better find a way to get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Smith, who is a registered nurse, entered a clinical
trial of anti-VEGF, one of the new cancer drugs known as
angiogenesis inhibitors that are supposed to strangle tumors' blood
supply lifelines and cause fewer punishing side effects than
traditional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, the cancer in her neck is undetectable, and she
has suffered minimal side effects from the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Smith, whose religious faith earned her
the nickname ``Miracle Child'' among the staff, adding, ``I`m so
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is among five of 59 patients with advanced breast cancer
whose tumors have responded to the drug, made by Genentech Inc., in
toxicity testing, according to a sobering report at last week's
meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology. And no one
knows whether the drug will continue to keep her tumor in check.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hopeful anecdotes such as Smith's are beginning to emerge
from early testing of some angiogenesis inhibitors, which many
specialists (and patients) believe is the most exciting front in
the war against cancer. Perhaps $4 billion has been spent in
research on this new class of cancer treatments, and about 6,500
cancer patients have received some sort of therapy, according to
the Boston-based Angiogenesis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's far too soon to write an overall report card on
the drugs, dozens of which are now undergoing human trials. And
many of the trials are still in Phase I, in which the drugs are
pitted against out-of-control cancers in very sick patients,
creating a formidable challenge for any new drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we have some good leads. We have some drugs that
are clearly not producing side effects in patients,'' said David
Cheresh, an angiogenesis researcher at the Scripps Clinic and
Research Foundation in California.
</P>
<P>
   Moreoever, he said, cancers are being slowed or halted in some
patients, ``and I see that as a remarkable success in drugs that
have no side effects. If we can simply hold tumors at bay, we've
accomplished a major, major goal,'' Cheresh said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that some terminally ill patients who received
anti-angiogenesis drugs are still alive between one and two years
later, when they otherwise would have died long ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, the drugs haven't even slowed some types of cancer. For
example, when the drug thalidomide, a sedative that has some
anti-angiogenic traits) was given to 17 patients with metastatic
head and neck cancer, one patient soon died and the tumors
continued to grow in the other 16.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the drugs have caused serious, even lethal, side
effects in other patients. Most alarming, in a trial of 99 patients
with advanced lung cancer given the same anti-VEGF drug taken by
Smith, six patients suddenly began coughing up blood and four died.
The drug also apparently caused strokes in a few patients with
colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The angiogenesis field, pioneered by Dr. Judah Folkman at
Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital in Boston, has been
awash in high expectations since some of the drugs have obliterated
huge tumors in animals at little cost in side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes have been particularly high for endostatin, discovered in
Folkman's lab, because it proved so powerful and nontoxic in animal
experiments. But a senior official at the National Cancer
Institute, which is overseeing two endostatin trials, recently said
he has seen no dramatic benefits from endostatin after seven months
of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman countered at last week's conference in New Orleans that
he was ``very pleased'' by the initial tests _ which show the drug
seems free of toxicity _ and suggested it is too early to judge
endostatin's effects on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But, while researchers spar publicly over extremely preliminary
results on endostatin, other angiogenesis inhibitors such as
anti-VEGF and a few others provide a better reality check, since
they are well into the second phase of the three-stage human
testing process. However, these drugs are less potent than
endostatin is in animals.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Phase I studies, which concentrate on safety, in
Phase II, researchers look for signs that the drug works.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Li, who heads the Angiogenesis Foundation that
promotes research and application of the drugs, said that this
year's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting was the first
to have a large number of reports from human trials of angiogenesis
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   While encouraged by some of the results, Li noted that ``many
people have believed that all solid tumors are dependent on
angiogenesis (recruiting a new blood supply) and therefore that
they would all respond'' to inhibitors. ``However, in human
clinical studies we've generally not seen the consistent
spectacular results that we've seen in mice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind these drugs is elegantly simple. Instead of
trying to pulverize cancer cells, the way standard chemotherapy and
radiation do, angiogenesis inhibitors aim to shut off tumors' blood
supply. If tumors can't attract new blood vessels to fuel them,
they can't grow or spread.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, angiogenesis _ the formation of new blood vessels _
isn't always harmful. The body needs to turn on blood vessel growth
to repair wounds and to form the blood-rich lining of the uterus
during menstruation and pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The antiangiogenic drugs work by blocking the many chemical
signals that tumors send out to nearby blood vessels, which may
respond by sending out tiny blood vessels that grow toward the
tumor. Tumor cells attacked by conventional chemotherapy drugs
eventually mutate into resistant cells, thwarting the treatment.
Angiogenesis blockers don't have the problem because they bypass
tumors and focus just on the blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors may not kill tumors, but there are good
reasons to think they could hold cancer in check for years _ as
long as they are free of side-effects. Natural anti-angiogenesis
substances in the body, such as endostatin, probably keep many tiny
tumors from ever becoming troublesome, Folkman believes.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans meeting included reports on other new
``targeted'' therapies, drugs designed to attack weak points in
cancer cells by focusing on specific molecules. Some of those are
showing similar encouraging progress.
</P>
<P>
   As for anti-angiogenesis drugs, there were about 40 reports
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Genentech's anti-VEGF, combined with a standard chemotherapy
drug, stalled the disease in advanced colon cancer patients and
extended survival to an average of at least 17 months, compared to
13.8 months in those who got only the chemo. Side effects included
strokes, high blood pressure, fever and chills.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 99 patients with the most common form of lung cancer,
anti-VEGF along with chemo slowed the disease enough to add a few
months of survival. ``That may not seem like a long time, but it's
as big an improvement as we've ever seen,'' said Dr. Russell DeVore
of Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lung bleeding that killed four patients was a total
surprise, DeVore said, noting that they all occurred among patients
with a specific type of the disease, squamous cell lung cancer. One
possible explanation advanced by other researchers is that the
anti-VEGF drug destroyed weakened blood vessels in and around the
tumor that had been supporting lung tissue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thalidomide, the once-banned sedative that caused tragic birth
defects, yielded ``stunning'' results in treating multiple myeloma,
a form of bone marrow cancer, reported Dr. Bart Barlogie of the
Arkansas Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide also showed some activity in patients with recurring
brain tumors, stabilized disease in inoperable liver cancer.
However, it was ineffective in patients with head and neck cancers
and in lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ An antiogenic drug named SU5416, made by Sugen, Inc., combined
with standard chemo, showed promise in patients with advanced colon
cancer, and was tolerated by patients at every dosage level. In 28
patients the drug shrank just one tumor completely, partially
shrank tumors in five others, and held the disease in check in 9
patients. It had no effect in four others.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin, made by EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md., is in Phase
I trials in Boston; Madison, Wisc.; and Houston. At one point, the
researchers thought they might report some data at the oncology
conference, but then said they hadn't analyzed enough results yet.
Despite unanswered questions about its effectiveness, the company
plans to go on to Phase II trials.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joanna Horobin, an EntreMed vice president, said last week
that a new trial is planned to begin in Europe using portable pumps
to administer endostatin continuously at low doses, instead of the
once-daily infusions patients have been getting thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Horobin said researchers are rapidly analyzing ``an
enormous amount'' of data from the Phase I trials in Boston, being
carried out by Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care. The material
includes blood and urine samples, biopsy tissues and different
kinds of imaging scans.
</P>
<P>
   When all the data is sifted, she said, it will be possible to
draw some conclusions about the drug's Phase 1 performance. At
present, said Horobin, ``It's like a puzzle: we have a lot of
pieces but, we don't quite know what the picture on the front of
the box looks like.''

THE SHAPES OF GALAXIES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What causes galaxies to form into different shapes such as
the elliptical or spiral shape?
</P>
<P>
   N.D., Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that nobody really knows. In general, when
you have a lot of bodies with not much overall rotation, galaxies
tend to get pulled into a spherical shape by gravity, much as the
stars and planets all got pulled into roughly spherical shapes by
their own gravity. It's easy to see that if mountains weren't so
stiff, they'd just collapse into puddles, and if you start off with
a sphere with lots of lumps on the surface, they will eventually
collapse under the action of gravity and leave you with a perfect
sphere.
</P>
<P>
   If there's some rotation, the galaxy tends to flatten out, just
like a disk of pizza dough thrown in the air spinning: The middle
gets pushed out by centrifugal force.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with understanding the details is that we've
looked at rotating galaxies and, if we assume that we know how
gravity works on very large distance scales (and most people think
this is the case) and we measure the speed with which stars go
about the center of the galaxy, we should be able to calculate how
much matter is in the galaxy. But when we count up what we can see
directly with telescopes, we find we only get about 10 percent of
what we calculated.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, 90 percent of the matter in galaxies seems to be
invisible ``dark matter.'' We don't know what it is, and since we
don't know what 90 percent of the matter in galaxies is, we're not
really in a very good position to understand in detail why they
take the shapes they do. There are lots of ideas about what the
dark matter may be, and lots of experiments underway to find it,
but so far it's all very mysterious.

USING INSECTS TO SOLVE CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worms go in.
</P>
<P>
   The worms go out.
</P>
<P>
   The worms play pinochle on your snout.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the old children's rhyme about death claimed,
anyway. But, it turns out, it's not just the worms.
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of forensic scientists has discovered that they can
actually solve crimes by studying the insect demolition crew that
dismantles the human body after death.
</P>
<P>
   Maggots, the eggs of flies that can infest a corpse within
minutes, are prolific snitches, revealing the time of death, if the
body has been moved, whether a victim had been taking drugs, and
sometimes, even, who did it.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the wrong impression, the maggots aren't the only
stool pigeons. A veritable Cosa Nostra of creepy crawlies gather at
the scene of the crime, from hide beetles to wasps to ants, each
with a special role to play as the body decomposes.
</P>
<P>
   And their life cycles are so predictable that those who
understand them can provide police with clues beyond the reach of
conventional methods _ especially if the victim has been dead for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of forensic entolomogy is constantly growing,'' said
William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist with the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology in Washington D.C. ``The percentage of cases
may not be that large, but after 20 to 42 hours, insects are the
best scientific method we have for determining the post mortem
interval.''
</P>
<P>
   These new crime investigators remain a tiny fraternity _ there
are just 15 members of the American Board of Forensic Entomology _
but their often-grisly work is about to become a good deal better
known thanks to the deliciously disgusting new book, ``A Fly for
the Prosecution'' (Harvard University Press, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   Author M. Lee Goff, professor of entomology at the University of
Hawaii, believes that his field will always represent a relatively
small percentage of cases. Since most bodies are recovered quickly,
the medical examiner can estimate time of death without assistance.
Goff, for instance, handles only about 15 to 20 cases a year, and,
with Hawaii's low homicide rate, much of the work comes from other
places _ Florida, Tennessee, Nevada, even Europe and Central and
South America.
</P>
<P>
   But when forensic entomology is needed _ when bodies have been
lying out in the elements and tissues are degraded _ the results
can be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case on New Year's Eve, 1998, when police called Goff
to a murder scene in Oahu, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The swashbuckling bug man hopped on his Harley Davidson
motorcycle and motored to an area of scrub and brush near the ocean
and a golf course. There, behind yellow crime scene tape was a
corpse bundled up tightly in blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Before disturbing the body, Goff swept the area with an insect
net to collect samples. Once these had been placed in containers,
the body was unwrapped from the brown blanket, which had been
sealed shut at both ends by Ace elastic bandages. Another layer was
discovered: the body was also wrapped in a white blanket. There
were no obvious signs of trauma.
</P>
<P>
   But there were plenty of signs that the elaborate choreography
of decomposition was underway. Goff found blow fly eggs as well as
pupae _ the casings from which mature flies emerge _ on the outer
and inner blankets. He found predatory hister beetles feeding on
the blow fly maggots, who already had fed and were moving away from
the corpse. On the body itself, there were more maggots and pupae.
</P>
<P>
   Then, armed with insect and soils samples, Goff raced off to
start processing samples and to clean up for a New Year's Eve
party.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out there were four species of blow fly in different
stages of development. Because there were no empty pupal cases, it
appeared that Goff was working with the first generation of flies
to hit the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Goff reared pupae in the lab for identification _ it's hard to
tell one species from another when in maggot form, but raised to
adulthood, they can be named _ and used weather information from
that area to formulate the onset of insect activity.
</P>
<P>
   Goff determined that insects started their work 10 and a half
days before the body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But the victim had last been seen alive 13 days earlier, in the
company of her estranged husband. And, at that time, neighbors had
heard some gasping and thumping noises.
</P>
<P>
   Goff reasoned that the insect activity on the corpse was delayed
by two and a half days due to the blanket barrier. And his report
was accepted by the authorities. But the defense attorney for the
husband pressed Goff to be more conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Goff went further, conducting an experiment with a 50-pound pig
(considered the best simulation of human remains) and two blankets.
Setting the decomposing pig in a blanket out in his own backyeard,
Goff discovered that it did, indeed, take 2.5 days for the flies to
penetrate the wrapping. With that detailed evidence, the husband
was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, the job can be far less difficult. In one odd case
from Texas in 1985, Goff reports that a mangled grasshopper was
found on a female victim. Later, the missing leg from the
grasshopper was discovered in the cuff of a suspect's pants. He was
convicted, partially from that evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the insects can harbor traces of drugs long gone
from degraded tissue. And bugs particular to one area can give
clues to movement _ the body's or the perpetrator's. In one
instance Goff cites, tiny scabs on the suspect's legs helped
establish that he had been at the chigger-infested scene where the
murder victim was found.
</P>
<P>
   Goff's meticulous work ``has been real important in certain
cases,'' said Dr. Alvin Omori, the chief medical examiner in
Honolulu, who has worked on about four or five cases a year with
Goff for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic entomology emerged as a science in the 1980s, but the
concept has been around a lot longer. In 13th-century China, after
a man was slashed to death by a sickle in a rural village, the
local magistrate ordered farmers with sickles to appear before him.
In the hot summer sun, flies swarmed to the one that had blood and
tissue residue on it. And the farmer confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the entire field of forensics is enjoying a popular
renaissance in the wake of the O.J. Simpson case, as well as movies
such as ``The Bone Collector,'' and the wildly popular novels of
Patricia Cornwell featuring the sleuthing medical examiner, Kay
Scarpetta.
</P>
<P>
   Like the autopsies performed by Cornwell's protagonist, however,
the work of Goff and his colleagues is not for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Goff said that at a lecture he attended early in his career, an
expert presented slides of some of the decomposition studies he had
done with pigs. After a few images clicked by, the man next to Goff
whispered, ``that's one funny looking pig.''
</P>
<P>
   And Goff corrected him, ``That's a human.''
</P>
<P>
   The colleague and about a quarter of the room, stampeded out of
the lecture hall, some headed for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goff is respectful of the dead, he doesn't allow those
feelings to interfere with his science. And his book is filled with
medical details that aren't everyone's cup of tea. He tells about
grisly subjects such as the drip zone and skin slippage, as well as
the five stages of decomposition _ fresh, bloated, decay,
post-decay, and skeletal. And Goff encounters skulls polished by
the scraping mandibles of beetle larvae as well as a cranial vault
that housed an ant colony.
</P>
<P>
   For Goff, bugs and bodies are a perfect professional fit. He is
an entomologist who did a stint in the army in a military morgue.
But he laughs at the romantic way most forensic work is portrayed
in TV shows and films. There are many tedious hours, Goff said,
spent counting eyes, wing veins, and hairs or bristles on various
parts of the insects bodies.
</P>
<P>
   And the forensic entomologists are so specialized that there is
no one to help them answer important questions. In one case from
1984, Goff submitted specimens of rove beetles for identification
to the USDA. A full 12 years later, he received the report: no one
at the lab could identify them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the film noir aspects of what he does, Goff pointed out
that forensic entomology is really about hard science. And, as with
any science, it still holds more unsolved mysteries than Hollywood
could ever plot.

EULOGIZING THE LATE, GREAT SMASHING PUMPKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With summer almost upon us, I thought it might be a fine time to
finish up my spring cleaning:
</P>
<P>
   That grating, bratty whine of a voice. That Uncle Festus chrome
dome. Those shredded screams. Those pretentious Big Rock
pronouncements. Those endlessly ambitious songs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm really going to miss Smashing Pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   There was a discernible pang of loss last week when fearless
Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan announced that his band will call it
quits at year's end. After 12 years, Corgan said the band _
guitarist James Iha, drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, and bassist Melissa
Auf Der Maur (who replaced original Pumpkins bassist D'Arcy Wretzky
last year) _ had reached the ``end of our road emotionally,
spiritually, and musically,'' and deep down ``our fans knew that
this was the end.'' Perhaps Billy's right. Their latest CD,
``Machina/The Machines of God,'' never caught fire, probably
because it wasn't a particularly interesting record.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, there was ``The Everlasting Gaze'' _ which was really
just a rip-off of their own superior ``Zero'' _ but what else was
there? The album has sold only 500,000 copies, a pittance for a
major band, since its late February release, and it's nowhere to be
found on the charts. None of this, of course, takes away from the
fact that the Pumpkins were one of the best bands of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In such offerings as 1991's ``Gish,'' their 1993 breakthrough
``Siamese Dream,'' and their creative highpoint, 1995's double-CD
``Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,'' the Pumpkins,
especially Corgan, understood the healing and redemptive powers of
rock perhaps better than just about any artist of his generation.
It was his manna, and he believed in its potential to salve
society's wounds even when he was railing at the gods. From
``Crush,'' ``Disarm,'' and ``Tonight, Tonight'' to ``Cherub Rock''
to ``Bullet With Butterfly Wings'' to ``Today'' to ``1979,'' at
their best, the Pumpkins could make you feel whole and mighty. Such
songs were baptisms of fire to make you thrash, cry, dance, or
laugh with abandon. Carrying out Billy's vision, the Pumpkins were
annoying and amazing, beautiful and bombastic, cliched and so damn
daring, sometimes it was like they invented this whole rock thing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There will be solo albums and such, of course. But it won't
quite be the same. There was just something soothing in knowing
that, even though we were rats in that cage Billy once sang about,
we had the Pumpkins' music to illuminate all our rage.

SOUPED-UP SURVEILLANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Mass. _ From supermarkets to banks to office parks, the
world is full of thousands of surveillance cameras. But generally
speaking, they're only as good as the sometimes glassy-eyed
security officers watching them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, however, you had a surveillance camera that would
automatically detect suspicious behavior, sound an alarm, and begin
recording an incident for later review by security officials.
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept behind a new system being developed here by
TASC Inc., a unit of defense and intelligence contractor Litton
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting technology used for battlefields and counterespionage,
TASC engineers have developed a system that will be installed later
this year to improve video surveillance at a retail chain and a
casino. Elements of the system are also being used by TASC to
upgrade security on Capitol Hill, under a $5 million contract with
the federal government.

Inc. of Durango, Colo., TASC's system could flash and sound an
alert at a guard's computer screen if someone is running rather
than walking to the exit, or a clerk leaves a cash register drawer
open, or a casino croupier seems to have his hands under the table
too often.
</P>
<P>
   Based on staggering amounts of math, the technology, simply put,
tries to figure out when an object being monitored is a human
being, and when the human being is acting in ways that can be
defined as suspicious or worth being taped for later review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closed-circuit TV is just an extension of people's eyes,''
says Bradley C. Lynch, security systems account manager for TASC,
which traces its roots to a Pentagon contractor founded in
Winchester 34 years ago. ``We looked at this and said, `Let's make
this an extension of people's minds.' With our system, video is
more than just a picture. It's information.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether a souped-up camera can determine when people are
doing bad things, of course, depends on how precisely operators can
define for the camera what bad behavior is _ and on little things
such as keeping the cameras clean.
</P>
<P>
   TASC officials acknowledge the system has the potential for
spurring false alarms. When a warning flashes at a security TV
monitor, it merely alerts the guards to pay attention to something
on the screen. The guards must use discretion in determining
whether the alert was prompted by a fleeing grocery thief or a
toddler sprinting in the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some TASC officials think their biggest markets in the
near term could be monitoring for problems other than shoplifters
or crooked employees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Insurance Information Institute estimates that
American businesses lose $30 billion a year in slip-and-fall
accidents, including some number of phony spills staged by willing
``victims'' looking to sue.
</P>
<P>
   TASC's technology can identify a spill by the way it looks on
the floor and the way it slowly grows irregularly in shape. With a
camera trained on the detergent and cooking-oil aisles, the system
could send an alarm to supermarket managers that there's a puddle
that needs to be cleaned up. Meanwhile, it would begin making a
digital video archive that could help a supermarket defend itself
against an accident suit _ or prove the plaintiff dumped the pool
of Tide that made him sprain his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Or, by identifying and counting carts, the system could detect
that five or more shoppers are backed up in a checkout line. It
could then send an alert by pager to the overworked store manager
telling her she needs to open up another register.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond preventing problems, the system might be used to gather
valuable information for store owners: How many people come into
the store each hour? Where do they go first? How long do they spend
in each department? What aisle displays catch their eyes?
</P>
<P>
   A system that prevented a multimillion-dollar slip-and-fall tort
claim might pay for itself. Officials expect the system would cost
around $75,000 for the digital cameras needed in an average-size
supermarket, plus $5,000 per ``module,'' or monitoring add-on
dedicated to looking for a specific problem, such as spills or
people running or checkout line backups.
</P>
<P>
   While TASC executives admit it may sound Big Brother-y, they
gamely suggest some people might be more comfortable knowing they
are being watched by an objective piece of software rather than
another person who could be fascinated by their efforts to readjust
their underwear in the pasta aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer just doesn't care that Joe Customer is scratching
himself in aisle 6,'' said Stuart E. Peskoe, TASC's director of
transportation systems.

 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second in an occasional series on millennial London.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go into the belly of The Body. Watch out _ the gastric
juices are flowing and a whole lot more is going on!
</P>
<P>
   The Body is a shimmering seven-story structure inside London's
Millennium Dome. The structure, worthy of an art museum, depicts a
male and female figure in a gentle, reclining embrace. Visitors
walk through enclosed spaces, up an escalator, and then down and
out, visiting arms, legs, a pumping heart, and even a wisecracking,
fez-wearing brain along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Body is one of 14 exhibit-filled ``zones'' within the Dome,
which will be open this year only. The multimillion-dollar
attraction was greeted with withering reviews from the British
press, but word of mouth has been kinder. Every attraction may not
be a stunner, but at the Dome you can explore the future,
experience visual tricks such as watching yourself grow older, gaze
at a 21-karat blue diamond, and _ in the center of all the activity
_ see a live show with 200 performers that includes fireworks,
bungee jumpers on stilts, and a graceful ballet high in the sky.
Here are a few fab facts:
</P>
<P>
   --The Dome has the world's biggest roof, measuring some 25
acres. It is, in fact, the largest domed structure in the world _
twice the size of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   --The inside volume of more than 6 million square feet would
hold 12.8 million barrels of beer, or 18,000 double-decker buses.
If inverted under Niagara Falls, the Dome would take more than 10
minutes to fill with water.
</P>
<P>
   --Its futuristic masts lean at three times the angle of the
Tower of Pisa and are 131 feet taller.
</P>
<P>
   --With 1 million square feet of fabric, it is the largest fabric
structure in the world. It is also the strongest fabric building,
able to support a jumbo jet _ or the force of James Bond plummeting
from the sky onto the Dome roof in the movie ``The World Is Not
Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   (Dome tickets are about $32 for adults and $26 for children
5-15; children younger than 5 are free. Tickets are sold in a
number of places and are part of many travel packages. There are
various ways to get to the Dome, which is in Greenwich, but one of
the most pleasant is a 45-minute riverboat ride down the Thames,
beginning near the London Eye, passing by Big Ben and the Tower of
London, and going under the Tower Bridge. Round-trip tickets are
about $13 for adults and $9 for children. For more information
about the Dome or all of London, call the British Tourist Authority
at 800-462-2748 or visit www.LondonTown.com.)

   Who knew? When celebrities are publicizing a movie or play in
London, they want to be recognized and stay in a high-profile
hotel. But when they want to escape from it all, some stay at the
Cliveden Town House, a lushly landscaped 35-room hotel at Cadogen
Gardens. Sometimes the stars are recognizable, but at other times,
we're told, the celebs look so different that few would know them.
(And, no, the hotel won't tell you who stays there.) For more

MONTOYA CROSSES BRIDGE BETWEEN RIVAL FACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For a moment Sunday, it seemed the hostilities
between Championship Auto Racing Teams and the Indy Racing League
had been put aside.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the squabble between open-wheel series
came together and recognized the extraordinary talent of Juan
Montoya after the 24-year-old Colombian, the reigning CART FedEx
Series champion, won the 84th Indianapolis 500 in his first
appearance at the fabled Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Montoya won over his IRL peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's a hell of a race driver,'' said car owner A.J. Foyt,
a four-time Indy 500 winner who has long been a proponent of the
IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to him, because he's a really, really, really
good race car driver,'' said runner-up Buddy Lazier, the 1996 Indy
500 winner who subjected Montoya to a hot pursuit only to get
caught in traffic. ``This was one of the hardest races in my eight
starts here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have compared him to Ayrton Senna, and maybe he
will be,'' said Chilean Eliseo Salazar, who finished third. ``But
he's an awesome race car driver.''
</P>
<P>
   And for one unforgettable race, Montoya was one of them.
Although Lazier said IRL drivers had joked among themselves that
``we can't let these CART guys win,'' Montoya clearly shared their
desire to win the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here just like any other IRL team, believe me,'' said
Montoya, who became the first rookie since Graham Hill in 1996 and
seventh overall to win the 500. ``We're not here with any CART
flags or anything like that. Right now, in my position, (team
owner) Chip (Ganassi) decided to have an IRL team for the 500 and
that's the way we took it. I look at myself like any other driver
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work submitted by Montoya and members of the
Target/Chip Ganassi Racing crew, which has won the last four CART
championships, was as impressive as it was expansive. From the time
they took possession of their G-Force chassis and
Comp-Tech-prepared Oldsmobile Aurora engines three months ago, Team
Target began its two-car assault on the Indy 500, all the while
struggling to win its first CART race of the season.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Montoya, Vasser, and their respective
crews were subjected to difficult working conditions by Mother
Nature. A race in Motegi, Japan, was rained out, causing a delay in
their arrival at Indy for the time trials. A CART race at Nazareth,
Pa., that was snowed out April 9 and rescheduled for the day before
the Indy 500 added to Team Target's workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked an awful lot of our teams in the last two months,''
said Ganassi, who visited Victory Lane at Indy for the first time
as a car owner. ``Whether it was testing an IRL car, jumping past a
lot of the drivers, jumping back and forth between IRL to CART,
CART to IRL . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, that's a lot of work, and when you're in a
position of management sometimes you ask yourself, `Are you asking
too much of your people?' The rewards like this, I guess, taste
that much sweeter to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Will this be the first trickle in a flood of CART teams
returning to Indy? Will Ganassi even come back next year? Or, for
that matter, Montoya, who is rumored to be on his way to Formula
One?
</P>
<P>
   ``All week everybody was always interested in the political side
of things and I was not into that, and I'm still not,'' Ganassi
said. ``This is still a big race. When we walked out this morning
through Gasoline Alley with Jimmy and Juan, I was keyed up. This is
still the biggest race in the world and it's the biggest win in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now that's what it means to me and it's obviously going
to mean a lot more as time passes.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it mean enough to want to do it all over again as
defending champion next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that our team is going to be able to do the right
thing, whatever that entails as the future comes,'' said Ganassi.
``Certainly, I'm going to run here. So, I just hope we can do the
right thing.''

RESPECT? NIXON GOES AND GETS IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He saw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else at Fenway Park last Wednesday night saw the
broader tableau: a foul fly by Blue Jays designated hitter Marty
Cordova drifting obviously out of play, behind the concrete
right-field grandstand, into the bank of cast-iron seats and the
vista of fans occupying them, out of reach except to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon saw only the ball, only a potentially vital out, only
a chance to stem a Toronto rally with a runner on first base,
preserve a 2-0 lead, and halt a three-game Red Sox losing streak.
There were no bonebreaking obstacles in his line of vision; there
was only one course of action in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   So for a moment, he would recall, he was no longer the Sox'
second-year right fielder, he was again a blood-and-guts
quarterback at New Hanover High in Wilmington, N.C. He hurtled the
wall and the first few rows as if they constituted a goal-line
defense. He vanished into the mass of flesh and concrete and
cast-iron, out of sight for almost a minute.
</P>
<P>
   When he reemerged, he had two red welts atop his chest. He did
not have the ball, which had glanced off his glove as he crashed
into a seat, and he was fortunate he still had all his body parts.
But he did not have a choice on the play, either, he would say
after his second single following his near self-destruction had set
the stage for a winning, 11th-inning home run by Brian Daubach and
resuscitation for the Red Sox. Perhaps it had looked foolhardy, he
acknowledged, ``but I really thought I had a bead on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was no alternative but to ignore the hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Just the way his father taught him.
</P>
<P>
   His ninth-inning home run Sunday night made him an instant part
of Red Sox lore. The two-run shot into the right-field seats at
Yankee Stadium settled an epochal pitching duel between Boston aces
past (Roger Clemens) and present (Pedro Martinez). It provided the
Sox with a 2-0 victory, gave them the rubber game in the three-game
summit with the two-time defending world champions, and restored
Boston's one-game American League East edge on New York. And it
enabled the Sox to savor their Memorial Day respite before their
Fenway series against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it served as an emphatic riposte to what Nixon
perceived as trash talking by Clemens, who shouted at him
scornfully when the Boston batter cast a dubious glance after being
called out on strikes in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he respects me or not, that's fine,'' Nixon said. ``I
have to earn my respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned fame with his prime-time blast. But the respect he
craves _ and which Clemens ignored at his own peril _ had been
achieved with plays like his mosh pit dive against Toronto, not to
mention his seventh-inning one-hopper to the 399-foot sign against
Clemens, an easy double that Nixon turned into an unlikely triple
with a nonstop dash around second and a headfirst slide into third.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the calling cards of Nixon the player. The flashy
statistics _ his .323 average, 6 homers, and 29 RBIs _ are window
dressing. He conducts himself with the intensity of an inferno, as
if he were back running the New Hanover Veer offense as a
quarterback who, in his words, ``would find a way to win, who
wouldn't put up the greatest numbers in the world, but `W' is the
greatest letter of them all.''
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Nixon realizes that once-a-week gridiron fury must be
tempered somewhat in the daily grind of baseball, because ``you
can't go up to the plate mad at the world. I want to be an intense
player but not play out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an approach that certainly has impressed his manager, Jimy
Williams, who saw enough fire in Nixon that he declined to send the
rookie back to the minors last season even after he got off to an
.061 start at the plate in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough kid,'' says Williams. ``Whether he played
football or whatever, I think it's how you're raised that has a lot
to do with it: a parent or coach (instilling) that mental
toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams may not be a child psychologist, but he has pinpointed
the source of his right fielder's development. In Nixon's case, the
compelling force was his father.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Nixon was a North Carolina farmboy ``who learned through
trials and tribulations, I'm sure,'' says Trot. The elder Nixon
grew up hard and turned himself into a success. He played football
and baseball at Atlantic Christian (now Barton) College in
Greenville, N.C., received offers to play minor league baseball,
but opted to attend medical school and became a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   His passion for sports never abated, and Trot, the third of his
four children, became his instrument of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's always pushed me to the limit and maybe a little
bit further all the time,'' says Trot. ``He knew what buttons to
push, how to get me fired up. That's probably what made me into the
player I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That player became a first-round Red Sox draft choice, the
seventh pick overall in 1993, and a quarterback who attracted many
scholarship offers. In fact, he was on campus at North Carolina
State, ready to begin his college football tutorial, when the Red
Sox signed him at the deadline in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While he loved football, and still does, Nixon saw limited
horizons in the sport: ``Maybe if I had progressed over the years,
I could have a chance to do something. Maybe all-conference . . .
maybe All-America.'' But the NFL was not viable; major league
baseball was.
</P>
<P>
   And his father drove him. William Nixon was a taskmaster, with a
farmhand's work ethic and demand for devotion to the cause. He
would throw endless batting practice to his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me (with pitches) a few times because I didn't have my
mind set the way I should have,'' says Trot. ``I'd turn the corner
and then, all of a sudden, I was concentrating on what I was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no letting up. ``If I played poorly or it looked like
I was a little intimidated,'' says Trot, his father would preach
``just a relentless type of attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The apprenticeship occasionally became a battleground _ ``We had
our bad times; we had our good times,'' says Trot _ and his mother,
Sandy, would play peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But William Nixon was not the stereotypical autocratic athletic
parent. When Trot was 11 or 12, he remembers, his father called him
into his office and said, ``Either I can push you or I can let you
go down your own path.''
</P>
<P>
   The option was Trot's, and ``I decided to be pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was no retreating, even if he occasionally bristled
at his father's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, he wasn't looking for escape, anyway. ``I think that
was just (his father's) way of molding me,'' Nixon says. ``It was
tough. But it all paid off in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the son progressed, the occasionally prickly relationship
thawed. ``I think it's gotten closer over the years,'' says Nixon.
``Probably when I was younger, it was probably more competitive.
The older I got, I got a little better. He started enjoying it
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon credits his success in part to his high school coaches,
Dave Brewster in baseball and Joe Miller in football, who picked up
where his father left off; Williams for working with him during his
bleak beginning after five years in the minors; his Boston
teammates for encouraging and guiding him in the midst of his
struggles; and hitting coach Jim Rice, third base coach Wendell
Kim, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, and bullpen catcher Dana LeVangie
for their tireless instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing they didn't have to teach was a will to endure.
His abandon, Nixon believes, stems from ``just the fact that I want
to win so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now where in the world could that have come from?

(Eds: Fact box and cast list below; ``tonight'' refers to Wed., May
31.) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For ``Survivor,'' which debuts tonight on CBS, 16 contestants
were unceremoniously dumped on the remote, virtually deserted
island Pulau Tiga in the South China Sea back in March. There, they
spent 39 days building crude huts, scrapping for food, bickering
with one another and engaging in contests for meager amenities (a
map to fresh water, waterproof matches, a cell-phone call home).
</P>
<P>
   Rats nibbled their dried skin while they slept (and lured
rat-eating snakes near the compounds); contestants reciprocated by
feasting on the vermin when other food supplies dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Cordy, a 38-year-old mother of two and former Air Force
survival instructor who was one of the show's participants, reports
that not only is rat as a delicacy pretty much as unpleasant as it
sounds _ ``They smell really gamy, like something you would not
want to put in your mouth, but after they're cooked, when you're
really hungry, they're not so bad'' _ but it was scarcely worth the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``A buffalo wing has 10 times more meat on it,'' she says.
``When you consider all the calories it takes catching and cleaning
them, they're not really that nourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, however, in Mark Burnett's estimation, his
rough-and- ready game show/reality series _ ``dramality'' is the
term his crew devised for it _ turned out to be more Campaign 2000
than ``Lord of the Flies.''
</P>
<P>
   The final contestant left on the island won $1 million (CBS is
trying to keep the winner's identity a secret) _ but competitors
weren't whittled away through attrition or cannibalism. Every three
days, the group assembled for a ``tribal council'' and voted to
bounce one of the castaways. Ousters could occur because someone
wasn't contributing meaningfully, or because someone didn't like
his or her looks. Forget the pythons and the venomous sea snakes _
the tribal councils were where the real cutthroat activity
occurred. Burnett was amazed by the venal politics at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven weeks in a row, my jaw dropped; I was dumbfounded at who
got voted off,'' Burnett says. ``There was a lot at stake, and it
involved the best or worst of office politics. People were
duplicitous, but very few people win anything or rise in their job
by being 100 percent on the straight and narrow. I gained an
enormous respect for their duplicity. These people are playing
against one another and some people forgot that. It was fascinating
to watch how clever some of them were at playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' based on a European TV series (like CBS' other
upcoming orgy of voyeurism, ``Big Brother''), will run 13 weeks.
Burnett says the participants underwent intense psychological and
physical scrutiny to ascertain whether they had the mettle to
endure not only the island's unforgiving primitivism, but also the
potential for being embarrassed on national television through
getting voted out of the contest. (One contestant in the European
version, whom Burnett claims had psychological problems before
appearing on the series, committed suicide after leaving the
island.)
</P>
<P>
   Burnett says that even though contestant arguments account for a
lot of the show's drama, he didn't cast the survivors with an eye
towards skirmishes. ``I did the opposite of that,'' he says. ``I
knew I would get conflicts without turning it into a `Jerry
Springer' kind of show that nobody would want to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   His cast of castaways turned out to be tougher than he expected.
``I was afraid they'd find the island offered too much suffering
and there'd be mass quitting,'' he says. ``One time, after five or
six days of nonstop rain, I got soft and gave them a map for fruit
_ and they were offended. They said, `Screw you, keep your map.'
They had crossed that line, they were taking it very seriously.''
When contestants were voted off, he reports, they merely shrugged,
laughed and asked for a beer.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem: ``Some people thought it was cool to be
nude all the time,'' Burnett says. ``When people wanted to walk
around nude to an annoying level, I heard a producer told them to
put their clothes on, and I yelled at him. Our only rules were: No
violence, and no colluding to split the million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll see tonight: A mile off the coast of Pulau
Tiga, the contestants were abruptly given two minutes to abandon
the fishing boat transporting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some jumped off in one second, and didn't take anything;
others spent a little time gathering things like fruit or an extra
knife,'' Burnett _ or, as the contestants called him, the Marquis
de Sade _ recalls. ``There were two rafts behind the boat, and some
large boxes of provisions, which were enormous trouble to bring to
shore. It was the first test of group dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordy says the abandon-ship edict was virtually the only time
she really wondered what she had gotten herself into.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked someone to hold the raft so people could throw
things off,'' Cordy remembers. ``When we threw the mandatory box
onto the raft, it broke open, and a couple of us jumped into the
water to retrieve the stuff. It was sinking, and it was all
disorganized and chaotic, as if it was a real sinking ship. It was
very realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordy was in the water, pulling a chest toward the raft. ``Then
I saw this big black thing in the water coming toward me, and I was
hoping to God it was just a shadow. I got to thinking of the
Discovery Channel's Shark Week, and wondered, `Is this gonna end
right here?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so embarrassed _ as it got closer and closer and closer,
I realized it was a cameraman underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordy admits that although her stint in the Air Force came in
handy _ she was able to start fires using a team member's
eyeglasses _ it also ``overprepared me a bit. When we first got
there, we took inventory of what we had _ we had thrown cans of
food onto the raft, and rice. My big thing was, `We're not eating
this stuff. We don't need to. We need to save the food for as long
as can. That was kind of a battle between us, and we ended up with
more food than I thought we would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramona (one of the survivors) wanted to open a can of beans,
and I said, `We need to save this.' She and I were unhappy with
each other. When we got back home, I sent her a 10-pound can of
beans.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first couple of weeks, some of the competitions Burnett
staged were ``immunity challenges'' _ the prize was an ``immunity
idol,'' a token declaring that no one from the winning team could
be voted off the island during the tribal council. Later, when the
teams consolidated, individuals won the right to immunity,
symbolized by an immunity necklace.
</P>
<P>
   For Cordy, the tribal councils were some of the most trying
times. ``I thought I wouldn't bond with people, but I really liked
everybody,'' she says. ``Everyone had something to offer. I was
never concerned with the physical challenges or lack of food. For
me, that was easy part. What I hadn't prepared for was to put
someone's life or reputation in my own hands. It got ludicrous _ I
would hope someone ticked me off just before the council meeting so
I'd have someone to vote off.''
</P>
<P>
   A contest airing on tonight's episode involves a race to set a
giant burning-man statue afire, while keeping a string of tiki
torches lit on a raft in the ocean and on the land. In another
competition, the survivors had to retrieve treasure chests filled
with useful items from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   But Burnett says what viewers will most remember are the
colorful characters populating Pulau Tiga. ``There are a couple of
people you'll never forget,'' he says. ``I can imagine a couple of
them coming on David Letterman regularly, offering their views on
life. A couple should be turned into little dolls _ when you press
it, it comes out with its sayings.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Cordy's favorites was Gervase, a Philadelphia basketball
coach who had never roughed it before _ except, of course, in
Philadelphia, which is no picnic. ``He impressed me very much,''
she says. ``Right off, when we were jumping off the ship and our
box broke and things were falling in the water, he jumped in after
them, even though he had only had four weeks of swimming lessons.
Right off the bat, he was really ready to give this a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supplies we had _ for Gervase, they were nothing, but I'd
think, `Wow, we have a machete'; I knew what we could do with it.
Every time I thought that something would throw him, he'd work
harder. The heat was oppressive to him, so he'd get up earlier in
morning and work harder. He hadn't been camping before, and there
he was, sleeping under the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only would Cordy return for another round of ``Survivor'' _
in a ``heartbeat'' _ but she thinks Burnett could franchise the
series as a sort of amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it could become one of those things that rich people pay
big bucks for,'' she suggests. ``They'll pay Mark well to treat
them badly.'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
BOSTON'S MARCH TO THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a famous inside-Boston story: how developers in the late
1960s, intent on building the city's first downtown skyscraper
since the 1920s, trooped from lender to lender with their plans.
</P>
<P>
   The local money men all said no. They knew Boston had been
declining for 75 years, that its central business district was
complete, the Custom House Tower its single tall centerpiece. The
Prudential building, which had gone up on an empty rail yard in the
early 1960s, was an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The only prosperous businesses left to speak of in the city were
its law firms and money managers. They would never leave their
tradition-bound offices along State Street, the city's
pre-Revolutionary thoroughfare, for a sterile tower.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Edinburgh, a money-management center quite like Boston
in many respects, did the developers find lenders willing to defy
the local conventional wisdom. The canny Scots put up the money for
225 Franklin Street.
</P>
<P>
   And when construction finally did begin on the the eastern side
of Post Office Square, across the street from what was then the
Federal Reserve Bank, tenants flocked to sign long-term leases at
lofty prices. Boston's staid First National Bank soon would follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The city's downtown has been moving toward the waterfront ever
since. But too little attention has been paid to how Boston will
change once its new South Boston Waterfront district is built.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to recognize is that the neigborhood across Fort
Point Channel already has its anchor tenant. It is the new federal
courthouse, an enormous building of H.H. Richardsonian proportions
that perches at the Fan Pier's edge.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the city's prosperous law firms remain scattered in a
270-degree arc around the old WPA-style courthouse in Post Office
Square, half a mile away. In all likelihood, they'll begin moving
to the vicinity of the new federal building, singly or in groups,
as soon as new office towers around the waterfront are ready to
accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   Across the wasteland of present-day parking lots to the west are
the dot-com lofts and artists' studios of the old Leather District.
Around the corner will be the new convention center in due course.
But the law firms will provide a solid commercial organizing
principle for the new district.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing to recognize about the South Boston Waterfront
is that it will be at the foot of the newly extended Massachusetts
Turnpike _ a straight shot to the office towers' underground
parking garage, especially from the suburban west. The weak link is
the MBTA's ``Silver Line,'' which so far is little more than a bus
route. The problem of mass transit doesn't have to be solved at
once, but it remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The third thing is to understand that the new district has
virtually nothing to do with South Boston, aside from the current
jockeying over legislative clout. Another 10 years and the
waterfront will be a second little city nestled next to the first,
presumably with its own representation on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the waterfront will grow out to the Reserve Channel
on the east and to West Broadway on the south. Clever Edward C.
``Ned'' Johnson of Fidelity Investments already has nailed down the
middle of the district, with his World Trade Center, a hotel, and
an office building. There's plenty of room for housing away from
the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   What will grow up in the rest of the thousand acres, where a
miscellany of fish-packing plants, bakeries, steel fabrication
facilities, and health clubs now nestle cheek by jowl, is anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   It is important that it not somehow become a gated community in
an urban setting, as critics fear; important, too, to recognize the
pressure it will put on South Boston to gentrify. But this much is
clear already: Boston's glorious urban mansion is about to add a
grand new wing.

   APOLLO-HIP-HOP (New York) _ When a group of rap legends and
Harlem-based artists announced last month that they would be
mounting a Broadway-style musical in the landmark Apollo Theater,
the show was presented not only as an indicator of Harlem's
economic and cultural renewal, but as the birth of a virtually new
theatrical genre: the hip-hop musical. But nothing is ever simple
when it comes to exploring an embryonic artistic form, or, for that
matter, stretching the borders of artistic expression in Harlem. By

<P>
   President Clinton began the last scheduled European trip of his
presidency Tuesday in Portugal, the first visit there by a U.S.
president in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio formally welcomed Clinton
before the two leaders sat down for discussions at the Belem
Palace, on the outskirts of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   In his welcoming speech, Sampaio said: ``Globalization requires
the international community to take responsibility for the future
of our planet. The United States of America has a decisive role in
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the 16th-century Tower of Belem, at the mouth of
Lisbon's harbor, Clinton said that Portuguese explorers had sailed
past the monument on their voyages to discover the New World. He
described Portugal as leading the way to ``a new voyage of
discovery'' over horizons ranging from the Internet to world
poverty and the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted at the airport by about 150 U.S. and
Portuguese schoolchildren. He also reviewed an honor guard of
Portuguese soldiers, some of whom will be taking up peacekeeping
duties in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony claimed by
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The president was scheduled to meet Portugal's prime minister,
Antonio Guterrez, later Tuesday to discuss political and trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton is expected to again take up trade
differences when meeting with Sampaio and senior officials of the
European Union. Portugal currently holds the rotating presidency of
the 15-member body.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was the last U.S. president to visit Portugal, in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   After Portugal, Clinton's weeklong tour of four countries will
take him to Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will consist primarily of bilateral meetings on trade
and other issues, with no breakthrough expected with Russia on arms
control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and U.S. officials announced Tuesday that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak would fly to Berlin Thursday to meet with
Clinton and discuss the latest developments in the Middle East.
Barak planned to meet Clinton in Washington last week but postponed
the trip because of the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon
and outbreaks of violence in Palestinian territories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A statement issued by Barak's office in Jerusalem said, ``The
two men will discuss the Middle East peace process in general and
the implications of the withdrawal from Lebanon and ways to advance
the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in particular.'' The closed
negotiations broke off in Stockholm earlier this month, and the
Palestinian side, complaining of lack of progress, wants them to be
relocated closer to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Portugal, Clinton is scheduled to fly to Germany,
where he will give a foreign policy speech in Aachen on Europe's
future and receive a prize for contributing to world peace and
European unity.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, Clinton will attend a conference in
Berlin on so-called ``third way'' politics that offer alternatives
to free market capitalism and welfare-state liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of Clinton's trip is expected to be his address
to the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. He is also
scheduled to meet with President Vladimir Putin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to stop in Kiev on Monday to see the president of
Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, and urge the former Soviet republic to push
ahead with economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is being accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Commerce Secretary William Daley and the White House
national security adviser, Sandy Berger.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO MEET WITH BARAK, BEGINS WEEK OF POLITICAL TALKS,
SUMMITRY IN EUROPE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   LISBON _ Hoping to rescue the Middle East peace process amid a
series of fast-moving events, President Clinton will meet Thursday
in Berlin with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the White House
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders will assess how the prospects for peace have
been affected by Israel's surprise pull-out from southern Lebanon
and a spate of renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the president and the prime minister believe that it is
important for them to meet at this time,'' White House spokesman
Joseph Lockhart said in a statement released Tuesday to reporters
traveling here with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Lisbon Tuesday, where he was greeted with a
21-gun salute from one of three Portuguese navy ships lying at
anchor off the white stone Tower of Belem.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Century fortress is a symbol of Portugal's past glory
as an imperial seafaring power. It stands near the launch site of
dozens of 15th Century Portuguese explorations, including those of
such adventurers as Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our increasingly globalized world owes a lot to their deeds,''
said President Jorge Sampaio, as Clinton stood at his side beneath
cloudless skies on a spectacular spring morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed Portugal's mariners for leading ``an entire
continent to see beyond the horizon,'' and called for all of Europe
to join a 21st Century age of medical discovery and search for
affordable ways to rid the developing world of AIDS, tuberculosis
and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intends to build on that theme on Wednesday, when he
meets here with his counterparts from the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has asked Congress for $325 million to combat AIDS
overseas and another $1 billion in tax credits to promote private
AIDS-related research, will propose that the EU adopt similar
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we'll come out of that meeting with a common approach
to the health crisis,'' Clinton told a group of scientists and
researchers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a solemn responsibility,'' he said, ``to take the
benefits of the information economy, of the explosion in biomedical
discoveries, and use them to give every young person in the world
the chance to live up to their God-given potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, in particular, has long experience working on the AIDS
problem in Africa through its five former colonies there, Angola,
Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration recently announced it now regards the
world AIDS epidemic, which is particularly acute in Africa, as a
threat to U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces EU resistance, however, over a number of issues
dividing the United States and Europe, including trade flaps over
U.S. beef exports _ the EU is resisting meat treated with hormone
additives _ European subsidies for the Airbus airliner
manufacturing company and European policies that discriminate
against Caribbean bananas.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Clinton whether he will solve long-running
US-European Union trade disputes over beef and bananas, Clinton
replied: ``I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton travels on Thursday to Germany, where he is to meet with
a host of international leaders at a governance conference. Barak,
who will also attend the conference, will meet separately with
Clinton before the conference begins Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Palestinian and Israeli negotiators set to return to
Stockholm Thursday to resume talks on developing a road map toward
a final peace accord, Clinton hopes to pull together a summer
summit among himself, Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had been scheduled to meet with Clinton last week in
Washington. The visit was called off, however, in the wake of the
worst clashes in more than three years between Israelis and
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Barak stunned regional actors by pulling out of
southern Lebanon, ordering his troops to end, in an overnight
withdrawal, Israel's 18-year occupation of a swath of Lebanese
land.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat have set a September 13 deadline for resolving
the tough issues that stand between them and a permanent peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes a Barak-Arafat summit in the weeks ahead will nail
down a framework agreement, or blueprint, outlining the issues
remaining to be resolved. Among those are the future of Jerusalem,
the question of Palestinian statehood and the right of Palestinian
refugees to return to Israeli-occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to convene a meeting with the president, Prime
Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat when the time is right,'' said
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley. ``Between now and September 13,
we hope to move the process along with a framework agreement, and
that's what we are working on now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Portugal begins a weeklong swing through
Europe that will also take him to Russia and Ukraine.

said. ``I had a beet phobia.'' Yet when she didn't recognize her
nemesis hidden in a beet raviolo with her braised cod, she ate it
and discovered: ``It was spectacular. I may have gotten over my
phobia.'' That kind of conversion is not so unusual lately as a
vegetable generally perceived as a winter staple actually comes

reared on the canned kind could never imagine. By Marian Burros.

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE BEATS EXPECTATIONS, RISING TO 144.4 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Higher interest rates and a rout in technology stocks have yet
to take a bite out of the immense confidence that has helped U.S.
consumers drive the economy to new heights, a report showed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board, a private trade group, said its consumer
confidence index jumped almost seven points in May, to a four-month
high of 144.4 after declining for three months. The May consumer
confidence number is near its high of 144.7 reached in January.
Economists had been expecting a decline in May to 136, according to
a Reuters poll.
</P>
<P>
   April's consumer confidence figure was also revised upward to
137.7 from a previously reported 136.9.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also painted a rosier picture of their current
condition, as an index measuring their present situation rose to
183.1 from 179.8 in April. Their forecast for the future also
appear brighter, as the expectations index rose to 118.7 from 109.7
in April.
</P>
<P>
   The data appeared to indicate that most American consumers,
enjoying a 30-year low in unemployment and rising wages, have not
been significantly affected by the sting of higher interest rates
or the recent pullback in most Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volatile financial markets and interest-rate hikes are not
expected to have a significant impact on consumers' spirits,'' said
Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research
center.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have been a major driver of the record U.S. economic
expansion, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the nation's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy has surged in recent years, unemployment has
dropped as confidence has risen. Many economists have also
attributed strong confidence to the wealth created by rising stock
markets. But recent readings on confidence levels may indicate that
stocks may be less of a factor in the morale of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The data echoed other recent indicators that have shown consumer
confidence on the rise. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's
consumer sentiment survey rose to 110.7 from 109.2 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index is
based on a sample of 5,000 U.S. households, and is measured
relative a 1985 level of 100.

CIBA VISION TO BUY WESLEY JESSEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than two months of dueling with Bausch &AMP; Lomb
(BOL:NYSE), specialty contact lens maker Wesley Jessen VisionCare
(WJCO:Nasdaq) rebuffed the takeover bid of the No. 1 maker of soft
contact lenses by market share, signing on Tuesday to be bought by
Ciba Vision for about $785 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The move will form the second-largest contact lens company in
the world by revenue behind Johnson &AMP; Johnson (JNJ:NYSE).
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition cancels the March 20 all-stock merger agreement
between Wesley Jessen and Ocular Sciences (OCLR:Nasdaq), which was
valued at $552 million on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ciba Vision, the eye care unit of Novartis (NVS:NYSE ADR), the
fourth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world, based in Basel,
Switzerland, trumped Bausch &AMP; Lomb by agreeing to pay $38.50 a
share for Wesley Jessen, based in Des Plaines, Ill., a premium of 8
percent to Bausch &AMP; Lomb's final bid. The offer is also a 16
percent premium to Wesley Jessen's closing price Friday of 33 3/16
and a 55 percent premium to its closing price on March 22, the day
before Bausch &AMP; Lomb made its first offer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Wesley Jessen agreed to buy Ocular Sciences, Bausch &AMP;
Lomb swooped in with an offer of $34 a share in cash for Wesley
Jessen. Wesley Jessen rejected both that offer and the subsequent
offer of $35.55 a share in cash, at the same time that it announced
discussions with a third party that would conceivably consider
buying Wesley Jessen as well as Ocular Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Ocular Sciences, though left in the cold, is $25 million richer
after collecting the breakup fee from Wesley Jessen.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen is the largest maker of cosmetic lenses that
change or enhance a wearer's eye color, the second-largest growth
segment for contact lenses. Meanwhile, Ciba Vision makes contact
lenses, lens care products and drugs for the eyes. The two
companies had pro forma sales of $1.4 billion in 1999.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO LOSING ITS FAMILY FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is a city that eats grilled radicchio and
miso-glazed cod, but spits out its small businesses, old people and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Attention Mayor Willie Brown and the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors _ your city is disappearing. Something has to be done,
or this won't be a city at all, but a shiny theme park for the rich
and the childless.
</P>
<P>
   Families can't make the rent or buy homes. Just on Friday, the
Pani-E-Dolci bakery, in the once-obscure San Francisco neighborhood
of Dogpatch, and the Garden Juice Bar, near the heart of the
Tenderloin, closed because the owners couldn't pay huge rent
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Now a preschool and 50 kids are being evicted.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, the Montessori Children's Center received a notice of
eviction saying the school has until June 30 to be out of the
building it has occupied for 24 years on the grounds of the huge
Parkmerced housing development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if this is something like a hairdresser's shop and
you can pack up your things and go,'' said Judith Flynn, the
director of the school. ``You can't just go to a storefront and
open a school. We're licensed by the Department of Social Services,
and it would take at least two years. You're dealing with children
here. You're dealing with human lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four years, and the school gets 50 days notice it has
to move,'' said Kathy Jones, whose 41/2-year-old daughter, Jessica,
was scheduled to be promoted to kindergarten at the school in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 50 children with nowhere to go,'' said Jones. ``It's
past the deadline to apply to another school. I'll have to
home-school her, but I'm not a teacher. She's about to start
reading, and she needs to be around other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even over the phone, it was clear Jones was shaking with anger,
but she stayed level and understated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is unfriendly to families,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkmerced was bought last July by Carmel Companies, a real
estate firm with offices in Denver and San Francisco, for a figure
that was reported to be more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bert Polacci, the chief operating officer in
California for Carmel, told The Examiner, ``We're proud to have
this storied piece of San Francisco history.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous ownership of that storied piece of San
Francisco history, the little school on the grounds was listed in
brochures as one of the pluses of living at Parkmerced.
</P>
<P>
   Polacci said the sole reason Carmel is evicting the Montessori
Children's Center is because it's an insurance liability. ``If
someone sues them, you know who they're coming after,'' Polacci
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said that in the 24 years of the school's history, no one
has ever sued. She offered to raise the insurance coverage to $15
million, but Carmel still wants them gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them how long an extension they wanted, but they came
back with two years, and that seemed like an incredible request,''
said Polacci.
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, the kids will be out on the street, in the home, or
wherever little kids go when they don't have a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if this is a private school, that's 50
places for kids gone,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Polacci said he's a native San Franciscan who knows how tough
the real estate market is, and how hard it is to put kids through
school. But he's adamant that liability is a problem for the
school, which pays $500 a month for a building originally designed
as a rec center.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd love to build a real state-of-the-art school at
Parkmerced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they come say that to us?'' said Flynn. ``It would
be my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   A school is a little world within a world, and the Montessori
Children's Center is a little world of 50 kids from 14 different
ethnic groups, a small mirror of the city outside. Now the kids
suffer the economic problems of the city outside, and something new
in San Francisco _ school-lessness.
</P>
<P>
   Young Rebecca Wright, daughter of Kathy Jones and her husband
David Wright, faces involuntary home-schooling in a home her
parents have to rent because they can't afford to buy. And Rebecca
is one of the lucky ones, because her mom is able to stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just one small period in the big picture,'' said Flynn
of the Montessori school, ``a picture that encompasses Carmel and
Parkmerced, as well as San Francisco. We need to really look at
what's happening in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this going to be a city that's a real community? Or is it
going to be friendly only to dot-commers and those with big
money?'' Flynn asked.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night at 7 p.m., the parents and staff of the
Montessori Children's Center will meet at the school to discuss
what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent invitations to city officials and officers of the
Carmel Company, but we haven't heard back,'' said Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be there, and I think a few city officials may show up.

   &UR; SHE LOVES THE NEW SAN FRANCISCO BASEBALL STADIUM &LR;  &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.2000 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe by next year I'll decide if I prefer the
new ballpark when the Giants are at home or on the road.
</P>
<P>
   All I know now is that _ in this, Pacific Bell Park's inaugural
season _ the cozy little red-brick baseball stadium makes me feel
like a teenager with a major crush:
</P>
<P>
   Rain, shine, game days or no, I just wanna be near the object of
my affection.
</P>
<P>
   Not even two months into the Giants' first season at Pac Bell,
sets of encyclopedia already have been written about the
40,000-seat park. Even the most jaded sports writers and no-growth
environmentalists seem to love the place.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all of the reviews have come from people who actually
go into the park to watch baseball. Although I've been to one game,
I'm in love with Pacific Bell Park from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   I like everything about it. The way it occupies space, casts
shadows, reflects light and somehow excites the eye as it soothes.
</P>
<P>
   I like looking at it from blocks away, south on China Basin
Street, or from close up, beside the deep-green steel supports of
its scoreboard and light banks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, I like the life that now emanates from the
junction of Third and King streets, even when there's no game going
on.
</P>
<P>
   People come down to Pac Bell just to hang around. Alone or in
family clusters, they walk along its wide bayside promenade,
rollerblade or bike among its instant groves of giant palm trees,
peer through the ``knothole'' section at the grounds crews, or just
stand and stare up at the marvelous statue of Willie Mays _ about
to take the first steps of an exuberant home-run trot around the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   I know about people hanging out at Pac Bell because the park has
become the centerpiece of a running route I have been pounding (off
and on) for close to two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I began _ when a downtown baseball stadium was but a
gleam in the eye of former Giants owner Bob Lurie _ the whole China
Basin area was remote, rundown and not a little spooky.
</P>
<P>
   My kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   The streets were wide and griddle flat, car and truck traffic
was minimal, and parking was an embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Starting off somewhere around Mariposa and Illinois streets, I'd
head north for as long a loop as my legs and lungs would take me _
Pier 23 on a good day, South Beach Marina on a normal one.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the run was always when I'd thump across the
wooden pedestrian sidewalk of Lefty O'Doul Bridge at Third Street.
</P>
<P>
   A long look to the right was rewarded with the ever-changing
color of San Francisco Bay, then the Oakland skyline and hills
beyond. Just past the bridge, as I rounded the corner of King
Street, I'd brace for the smell of vinegar that seeped from an old
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on game days anyway, I brace myself for the olfactory jolt
of Gilroy Garlic Fries.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard that a major league baseball stadium was going to
be built in the middle of my beloved, spooky China Basin, I was
positive I would hate it. The haunting, timeless quiet of the old
waterside area would be wrecked forever, I knew.
</P>
<P>
   So, for more than a year, I just stopped going down there. I
wanted to remember everything the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   Silly me.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how the architects and builders did it, but Pacific
Bell Park hasn't taken anything away from China Basin. (Multi-media
Gulch and the dot-com invasion already took the parking.) It has
only enhanced it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether I drive by, roll up on Muni or _ best of all _ run
around it on my own two legs _ I always do the same thing: Offer up
a great big ``Thank you!'' to every pair of hands that helped make
this fabulous little baseball park a reality.

&HT;     S.F. TO HONOR ITS HERITAGE AS A NAVY TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco was once a Navy town, but you'd
never know it today. Not so long ago, tens of thousands of
bluejackets _ along with Marines, Coast Guardsmen and Merchant
Mariners _ swarmed our streets, drank our booze and hit on our
women (and our men, too, doubtlessly).
</P>
<P>
   White caps of sailors on liberty were everywhere, but Market
Street was the gangway into the city and North Beach the galley.
</P>
<P>
   There were naval air stations in Alameda and Mountain View,
naval shipyards in Hunters Point and at Mare Island, a Navy supply
center in Oakland, a Coast Guard training station in Alameda, a
major Navy base at Treasure Island and other outposts of the four
sea services around the Golden Gate.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, artifacts of the fleet were everywhere. In the
`70s, you could buy old pea coats at Rosalie's on Columbus for $5,
and genuine woolen bell bottoms for $3 in the Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you find anything that's genuine old Navy, it's made in
Sri Lanka and sold in a store on Market Street, or available on
eBay, with bids starting at $50.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about these bygone seafarers was that they didn't
look militaristic. They looked like people doing their duty without
enthusiasm, maybe, but with a sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   One of them may have been my uncle, Sidney, who saw action in
the Mediterranean and the Far East, and told stories about what
he'd seen and done in North Africa, the Bay of Naples and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Sid was about 5 foot 7, 150 pounds, a terrific baseball player
and very unwarlike. He was a Navy swabbie, maybe the quintessential
citizen-sailor. I have crystalline half-century-old Kodak slides of
him in his white cap and pea coat, hands thrust into his pockets,
smiling shyly.
</P>
<P>
   You can read his mind. He's thinking, ``I guess I have to deal
with this.'' That, I imagine, is the way millions of men and women
in uniform felt.
</P>
<P>
   And yet they managed to defeat our enemies in World War II,
these befuddled, frightened, skeptical Cincinnatuses of the city
and the country, these ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't have known it, hiking around the Bay Area on
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Trione of Santa Rosa, Calif., and Jackson Schultz of
Hillsborough, Calif., are about to change that.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $2 million in private funds, they plan to erect by
Memorial Day 2001 a 7-foot bronze statue of a sailor with his
duffel bag, standing at a dock. It will be placed at Vista Point,
at the northern (Marin County) end of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, created by artist Stanley Bleifeld, will be a
replica of Bleifeld's U.S. Navy Memorial statue on Pennsylvania
Avenue in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Washington memorial and others elsewhere in the
nation, the San Francisco Lone Sailor Memorial will be the first
dedicated to all four sea services. Vista Point, overlooking the
Gate, the city and the Bay, is the perfect site.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate is more than a symbol of the Bay Area. It's a
symbol of our nation. It was a portal to and from their homeland
for millions of Americans sent overseas. During World War II alone,
more than 1.5 million men and women in uniform shipped out from
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave here to go overseas and you go under the bridge and
get your last view of the city and it's a sinking feeling; you're
leaving home behind. That's the last you'll see of the U.S.,'' said
Schultz, a retired Navy captain and former bank executive
co-chairing the project with Trione, a World War II Navy lieutenant
turned mortgage broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bridge is so unique,'' Schultz added. ``Then when you
come back, waiting for the first sight of home after two weeks at
sea, you finally see land, then the bridge, then you know: That's
home! That's San Francisco! And the whole city unfolds . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Trione, a member of the United States Navy
Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C., pitched the idea to
Schultz of having a similar monument here. Both men also fed the
kitty from the start _ Trione to the extent of $100,000 (all
contributions are tax deductible).
</P>
<P>
   The best place for the statue, they knew right away, was Vista
Point. The problem: It's part of the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area, and the National Park Service has a policy against
memorials. Trione and Schultz went to work on Brian O'Neill,
superintendent of the GGNRA, and then on Robert Stanton, head of
the Park Service. Both decided to make an exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if any anti-military opposition had emerged yet,
remembering the fierce resistance to then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein's
plan to homeport the USS Missouri in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   None at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Vietnam,'' Schultz said. ``This is a timeless
statue, a sailor over the last century in San Francisco; it is
recognizing the role of the sea services.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Trione: ``I think people regret the fact that the Missouri
isn't in San Francisco.''
</P>

   The San Francisco office of the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation is

&HT;     TEXAS DISCOVERY POINTS TO EARLY VISITS BY SPANISH EXPLORERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZEKE MacCORMACK

<P>
   BANDERA, Texas _ An inscription discovered in a cave suggests
that Spaniards, possibly in search of silver or American Indians to
enslave, may have ventured through the Texas Hill Country years
earlier than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   The notation ``1577 JH'' was found chiseled into the wall of a
cave near Tarpley, a Bandera County community northwest of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance would be, if it could be proven (to be
authentic), is that it is the earliest written inscription in
Texas,'' said Thomas Hester, a University of Texas anthropology
professor, who noted that the previously known Spanish records in
Texas date from the 1580s.
</P>
<P>
   Hester, director of the Texas Archaeological Research Lab in
Austin, was alerted last fall to the markings in what he described
as ``a little shelter or cave.''
</P>
<P>
   What he saw at the site sparked his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely different from any other carvings I've
seen,'' he said Thursday. ``The way it is carved, too, is
important; it has beveled edges.''
</P>
<P>
   The location of the cave, which is on private property, is being
kept confidential to protect it from vandals and artifact
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the ``JH'' superscript was a mystery to
Hester until he mentioned it to Maria Wade, a fellow
anthropologist, who told him 16th-century Jesuits used the letters
as an abbreviation for ``Jesus Jehovah,'' much in the way AD is
short for anno Domini (in the year of our Lord).
</P>
<P>
   That would be consistent with the theory that the marks were
left by associates of Luis De Carvajal, a Portuguese-born Spanish
explorer who attended Jesuit schools as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   Carvajal sailed for ``New Spain'' (Mexico) in 1567 and was
awarded a vast land grant that reached across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carvajal's jurisdiction extended north to the site of San
Antonio, Texas, and west to include almost all of the Mexican
states of Zacatecas and Durango,'' according to ``Spanish Texas
1519-1821,'' a book by Dr. Donald E. Chipman, a history professor
at the University of North Texas in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   Carvajal is recognized as the first European to cross the Lower
Rio Grande into Texas, according to ``The New Handbook of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what he was after, we have the words of other people
that he was out-and-out slave-raiding,'' said Robert S. Weddle, who
wrote the handbook entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date is certainly compatible with his exploits,'' the
79-year-old historian and author said Friday. ``We know of nobody
else who might have done it at that date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``LaSalle claims to have found in 1685 the date of 1588 carved
in a post at an Indian village near the lower Guadalupe River, but
nobody in modern times ever saw that,'' he said. ``So far as we
know, that's the earliest recorded mention of a European
inscription on rocks or trees in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Carvajal's activities inside Texas are not well documented
because he apparently did more than ``pacify'' the Indians and
establish new settlements, as ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Wade, any people he sent out would not have filed
any reports because they were doing silver exploration in an area
where the king of Spain had prohibited it,'' Hester said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that what appears to be an abandoned mine is only a
mile from the cave in Tarpley.
</P>
<P>
   Carvajal was recalled to Mexico in 1578 to answer accusations
that he had concentrated on slave-trading and silver prospecting
rather than his assigned duties.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquitted, but convicted of heresy a decade later and
died in 1590 in a prison in Mexico.

SKIRT STEAK WITH SHALLOT-THYME BUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Johnson, the chef at the Blue Room in Cambridge, Mass.,
has been cooking skirt steak for years, long before it became
wildly popular. But never before has he served a better _ or
simpler _ rendition of this long, thin band of wonderfully marbled
beef.
</P>
<P>
   His secret: a slice of compound butter, flavored with shallots,
chives and thyme, that melts over the meat.
</P>
<P>
   It had been so long since I had seen flavored butter on steak
that this version came as something of a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Until butter became a forbidden food, it was common as a flavor
booster. In classic cooking, compound butters were kept on hand and
often used to enhance rich sauces. But more recently, they have
become more common on their own, topping not only steak, but also
leaner meats like veal and chicken, and even fish. (And their side
dishes, too: place a little flavored butter on plain rice or
steamed carrots and you'll be considered brilliant.)
</P>
<P>
   Compound butters are easy to make, and as Johnson pointed out,
they can be frozen and used as needed, allowing a home cook to
develop and execute signature dishes on the spot. Just form the
butter into a log, wrap it well, freeze it and cut slices for
anything grilled, broiled or even steamed.
</P>
<P>
   Start with unsalted butter (any good brand will do fine, as long
as it is fresh). Compound butters can be made with various
seasonings: at this time of the year, fresh herbs are a good
candidate _ chervil, dill and parsley are all nice _ and roasted
garlic puree can be sensational. Mustard, ginger, vinegar, chilies
or citrus juice and zest work well, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonings can also be combined. A teaspoon each of horseradish
or wasabi, ginger and soy sauce can be mixed into a stick of butter
(add salt and pepper sparingly). Or add a teaspoon each of minced
garlic, fresh oregano and lemon juice (add salt and plenty of
ground black pepper, and if you are using roasted garlic, increase
the quantity to a tablespoon). Other combinations include
chili-cilantro: for each stick of butter add one small stemmed,
seeded and minced chili, a tablespoon of minced cilantro and a
teaspoon of lime juice, along with salt and ground pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to make a compound butter is to mince the
flavorings and cream them with the butter, using a fork. Butter
that is slightly soft is best, but if it is cold (or frozen), use a
small food processor. You'll never get all the butter out of the
container and blade, but the process will take just seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As for skirt steak, it has become almost ubiquitous. The price
ranges as high as $10 a pound, but it can often be found in
supermarkets for well under half that.
</P>
<P>
   Cut from the cow's diaphragm, skirt steak is juicy and flavorful
but not exactly tender; it's chewier than good strip steak and does
not respond well to overcooking.
</P>
<P>
   If someone at the table insists on having it cooked beyond
medium-rare, even the compound butter won't save it.
</P>
<P>
   SKIRT STEAK WITH SHALLOT-THYME BUTTER
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   \ pound unsalted butter, softened slightly
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   10 chives, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon red wine vinegar or lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   About 24 ounces skirt steak, cut into 4 portions
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill; the fire should be so hot
you can hold your hand over it for only a couple of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, cream the butter with a fork, adding thyme,
chives, shallot, { teaspoon each salt and pepper and the vinegar or
juice.
</P>
<P>
   3. Grill the steak, 2 minutes a side for rare, about a minute
longer per side for medium-rare. As it cooks, season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Spread each steak with about a tablespoon of the flavored
butter, and serve. Remaining butter can be wrapped and refrigerated
or frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it's called real Beaujolais; sometimes Beaujolais for
adults. What it means is not Duboeuf.
</P>
<P>
   So powerful a force are Duboeuf wines in the Beaujolais market,
and so distinctive is their style, that most wine drinkers assume
that all Beaujolais tastes like Georges Duboeuf's
Beaujolais-Villages. And this assumption is not far from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Most Beaujolais is produced by shippers, or negociants, who buy
from growers and cooperatives, and turn out a refreshing, fruity
wine, which can be served chilled or not, one that goes with just
about everything but the most elegant meals.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 million gallons of Beaujolais are produced each year.
Half of that is simple Beaujolais; 25 percent, Beaujolais-Villages;
and 25 percent, crus. About 55 percent is exported, some 12 percent
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The critic Stephen Tanzer, commenting on the Beaujolais market
some years ago in International Wine Cellar, his newsletter, said
that the wines had taken on ``an overly perfumed, candied-fruit
character,'' thanks to ``widespread use of a commercial yeast
strain originally popularized by Duboeuf but now in vogue
throughout the region, as well as high yields and heavy
chaptilization.'' Chaptilization is the addition of sugar to the
fermentation, not for sweetness but to raise the alcohol content of
wines from what might be 10 percent or less to 12 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The immense popularity of Beaujolais, fueled by the nouveau
Beaujolais craze, made it inevitable that serious wine drinkers
would begin to look for something different. And it isn't difficult
to find. Quantities are small, but the wines are out there.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens, perhaps many dozens, of small producers are intent on
pushing the gamay grape, from which all Beaujolais must be made, as
far as it will go. The result is a fascinating selection of
Beaujolais wines that are richer, darker, more intense and drier
than what most of us have come to expect from the Beaujolais region
of southern Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these small producers continue to supply the big
negociants. But then they hold back a portion of what they make to
produce a more complex wine.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered some of these wines, particularly those of Guy
Breton and Jacky Janodet, in the early 1990s in Paris restaurants
like the St.-Amarante, near the Bastille, and A la Courtille in the
20th Arrondissement, where small-batch Beaujolais were a feature. I
say ``were'' because A la Courtille closed, and the St.-Amarante
was sold to a couple less committed to these wines.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, many Paris bistros now offer this kind of
Beaujolais. And it can be found in the United States if you know
where to look. In New York, Al Hotchkin, at the Burgundy Wine Co.
in Greenwich Village, specializes in expensive Burgundies, but has
a soft spot for good Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   He offers small quantities of Beaujolais from Patrick and
Elizabeth Giloux, Brouilly from Alain Michaud, Morgon from the
Domaine Savoye and Moulin-a-Vent from the Domaine du Granit. How
small? The Gilouxes sell off their wines from younger vines. They
hold back the wine from their 45-year-old vines, which rarely
comes, even in good years, to more than 600 cases, and not all of
those travel to our shores. Alain Michaud is lucky to make a few
hundred cases of his Cuvee Prestige Brouilly from 90-year-old
vines. Hotchkin advises laying down the 1998 vintage for five
years. These are not mass-market wines.
</P>
<P>
   Burgundy Wine Co. even has wines from Georges Duboeuf. Though
Duboeuf buys from 400 growers, he also makes some special
Beaujolais as well, often for top restaurants in his region like
Georges Blanc, Paul Bocuse and Leon de Lyons and, most likely, for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that Beaujolais doesn't age should try a
couple of Duboeuf Moulin-a-Vents, the 1993 GDF Cuvee or the
aged-in-oak 1995 in magnum. I have had Beaujolais from the '50s
with Duboeuf.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all Beaujolais goes into simple Beaujolais and
Beaujolais-Villages. But the region has areas where the wine is
good enough and distinct enough to carry its own geographic name.
These are the ``cru'' Beaujolais: Brouilly, Cotes de Brouilly,
Chenas, Chiroubles, Fleurie, Julienas, Regnie, St.-Amour, Morgon
and Moulin-a-Vent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big Beaujolais shippers are in the Beaujolais
region, but most of the prominent Burgundy shippers like Louis
Latour, Louis Jadot and Joseph Drouhin also sell Beaujolais. In
1966, Jadot bought a 66-acre estate in Moulin-a-Vent called Chateau
de Jacques and is now offering five Moulin-a-Vents from separate
vineyard parcels within the estate. These are traditional
Beaujolais, full and rich, aged in oak and capable of improving
even more with bottle age.
</P>
<P>
   Because these wines are imported in small quantities, it is not
always easy to learn which are available in this country. But a few
great traditional Beaujolais should be snapped up if you find them
anywhere: Fleurie, from Yves Metras; Morgon, from Jean Foillard;
and Moulin-a-Vent, from Paul Janin.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these special Beaujolais attractive is the same thing
that has always made Beaujolais attractive: the price. Given the
insane prices of so many wines right now, Beaujolais and the
delicious wines pouring in from southern Italy and Sicily keep many
wine drinkers from switching to iced tea. Even now, fresh, fruity
Beaujolais is widely available at less than $10, and most of these
old-style small-batch cru Beaujolais still sell for $15 to $20 a
bottle. The relationship between price and quality is hard to match
in wine from any other region.

WARM SPICED PINEAPPLE TART 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the sixth of eight columns by Wylie Dufresne, the chef of
71 Clinton Fresh Food. They are written with Jack Bishop.) 
 By JACK BISHOP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I don't have an extensive background in pastry, so I
knew that dessert would be the toughest course to develop on my
menu. My shoe-box-size kitchen ruled out any complicated
last-minute preparations. I needed basic recipes.
</P>
<P>
   My warm spiced pineapple tart is a streamlined version of tarte
Tatin. I've kept the caramelized fruit and pastry but simplified
the preparation and improved the presentation. It's good enough to
serve at a restaurant and easy to make at home.
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons this recipe succeeds. First, pineapple
(especially the golden-skinned variety) is almost always a good
fruit. Second, any tart that starts with puff pastry is a breeze to
assemble. Commercial puff pastry saves a tremendous amount of time
and effort without any sacrifice in quality. (Like many chefs, I
use Dufour, an all-butter brand sold in specialty markets.)
</P>
<P>
   I cut the puff pastry into four-inch circles with a ring mold
and then punch out a hole from the center of each to make the
pastry look like a pineapple ring. Pineapple pieces poached in a
spiced orange syrup are laid over the pastry. Then I bake the tarts
and serve them with coconut ice cream and a drizzle of sauce, made
by reducing the poaching liquid until it has the consistency of a
thin caramel sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like overly sweet desserts, and a sauce made from a
concentrated poaching liquid can become cloying. That's why I cook
four spices with the orange syrup. Cinnamon and vanilla beans add
depth of flavor, while cracked black peppercorns and grated ginger
provide heat. The sauce tastes sweet at first but burns a bit at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Pineapple can stand up to these strong flavors, but this tart
could be made with other fruits, especially apricots or plums. Cut
each peeled and pitted fruit into six or eight wedges, then poach
them until tender. Sliced bananas are another possibility and are
even easier: they need no poaching. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WARM SPICED PINEAPPLE TART
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   2 vanilla beans
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons finely grated ginger
</P>
<P>
   Generous pinch cracked black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 medium ripe pineapple
</P>
<P>
   Flour for dusting
</P>
<P>
   1 sheet puff pastry (about 14 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   Coconut, vanilla or ginger ice cream
</P>
<P>
   1. Wrap cinnamon in towel and crack with mallet into rough
pieces. Place in dry skillet over medium heat, and toast, shaking
occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Transfer cinnamon to medium saucepan. With paring knife,
split vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape out seeds. Place beans
and seeds in pan; add butter, ginger, pepper, sugar and juice.
Bring to boil over high heat, whisking to dissolve sugar. Remove
from heat, cover and steep 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trim top and bottom from pineapple. Cut in half lengthwise;
reserve half for another use. Peel remainder, and cut in half again
lengthwise. Cut away core, and cut each piece crosswise into
\-inch-thick pieces.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add pineapple to syrup, and return to a boil. Reduce heat,
and simmer gently until tender, 5 minutes. (Don't overcook.) Remove
from heat; cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   5. Unfold puff pastry, and roll on floured surface into
13-by-9-inch rectangle. Punch out six 4-inch disks, then cut out a
1-inch circle from center of each. Prick pastry with tines of fork.
Place on parchment-lined baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   6. Use slotted spoon to lift pineapple onto paper towels to blot
dry. (Reserve syrup in saucepan.) Discard any large cinnamon bits.
Arrange pineapple pieces over pastry, 6 or 7 pieces on each ring,
with narrow end of pieces pointing inward. If necessary, trim
pineapple so that pieces fit on pastry rings. Refrigerate baking
sheet until tarts are well chilled, 2 to 6 hours.
</P>

   CAHORS TURNS `SENSITIVE' FOR ITS ARTS FESTIVAL
</P>
<P>
   From June 16 through July 2, the medieval city of Cahors in the
Lot region of France, north of Toulouse, swings into summer with
its annual Printemps de Cahors arts festival. This avant-garde
event attracted 100,000 visitors in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for the 2000 festival is ``Sensitive,'' but Cahors,
famed for its rough-edged black wine, has inspired 32 international
artists to import a defiantly earthy vintage of videos, photo
exhibits, installations and performance art to this quiet town. On
June 16, 17, 23 and 24, the exhibitions _ emphasizing sensation and
emotion rather than reason _ will be open till 1 a.m., with music
and dance events integrated with lighting displays and special
effects.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the historic sites of Cahors transformed into impromptu
indoor and outdoor galleries, visitors will encounter fanciful
egg-tipped cacti created by the Belgian sculptor Michel Francois
and an imaginary hockey match installed by Roderick Buchanan of
Scotland. The French artist Fabrice Hybert will introduce ``Arbres
Fruitiers dans la Ville,'' which replaces the city's existing flora
with fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Leonard, a New York photographer, is presenting pictures
where tree foliage has been replaced by plastic shopping bags,
while Via Lewandowsky of Germany showcases his ``Never Been There''
series of computer-generated photographs suggesting idealized
African landscapes. The composer Simon Fisher Turner, the
choreographer Olivia Granville and the Compagnie EDNA dance
ensemble will perform.
</P>
<P>
   All events are free. Information: (33-5) 65.53.94.75 and

CONSIDER THE NEGLECTED ANCHOVY ... 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While strong flavors are in vogue, anchovies seem to have been
left behind. Aside from their role in Caesar salad and pizzas, they
usually go unbilled and often undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, these little fillets are among the original convenience
foods. Just a few in a pasta sauce or a vinaigrette can add an
intense shot of complex brininess, more like Parmesan than canned
tuna.
</P>
<P>
   That easy flavor has a timeless appeal. Anchovies have been a
vital ingredient since Roman days, and their fermented juice has
been the base of condiments in many countries, from the fish sauce
of Southeast Asia to Worcestershire sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their reputation, anchovies are not overpowering, at
least once cooked. Used with garlic as the start of a fast pasta
sauce, they dissolve almost instantly and add a mysteriously meaty
complexity that makes the sauce seem as if it had simmered for
hours. Tossed with linguine and arugula, they make a simple dish
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies come in three forms: canned, salted and as a paste.
The canned are most familiar. The first choice are those packed in
olive oil, never soy or cottonseed oil. The ingredients list should
read ``anchovies, olive oil, salt'' _ nothing more. The olive oil
should be used with the anchovies in most dishes. The best canned
anchovies come from Italy and are sold in Italian or specialty
markets in large cans or jars. For $15 or so you should be able to
buy half a kilo, about a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Once opened, they will keep refrigerated for a long time. Just
top up the olive oil if it fails to cover the fish. If you open a
tiny tin, store the leftovers in oil in a sealed plastic container
or glass jar.
</P>
<P>
   Salted anchovies, sold in bulk in Italian markets from a large
can or bucket, are the kind preferred by ``true'' Italians, at
least so say cookbook writers. But they are a hassle: each fillet
has to be rinsed and peeled off the tiny bones. And I don't think
they are much better than the canned kind, which is probably why
you don't see them used by many home cooks, including those in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovy paste is the most convenient form of the fish. You
squeeze it out of a tube like toothpaste, with no grease or fishy
smell on the fingers. But it costs more than twice as much by
weight as canned anchovies, often with cream, butter, preservatives
and other unnecessary ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies can be used in almost as many ways as garlic. They are
traditional in Jansson's Temptation, a Swedish dish, which is
essentially creamy scalloped potatoes with layers of anchovies.
Melted with butter, and with garlic, they form a powerful dipping
sauce for raw vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   They can be stirred into a red-wine reduction to make a great
sauce for grilled foods. Or with pine nuts and raisins, they can be
sauteed with spinach, broccoli or other vegetables for a classic
northern Mediterranean side dish. Minced or blended into a
vinaigrette, they give any salad a Caesarlike quality, with no eggs
or Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   And there are even simpler uses for good anchovies. Layer them
with roasted red or piquillo peppers and drizzle with olive oil. Or
just lay them on good buttered bread.
</P>
<P>
   FAST TOMATO SAUCE WITH ANCHOVIES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 anchovy fillets, with some of their oil
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can tomatoes, crushed or chopped and drained of their
juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and fresh-ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1. Put the olive oil in a deep skillet, and turn the heat to
medium. A minute later, add the garlic and the anchovies, and stir.
When the garlic sizzles and the anchovies break up, add the
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Turn heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until mixture becomes saucy, about 15 minutes. Season
to taste, and serve with spaghetti or other long pasta. Grated
pecorino Romano cheese goes well with this sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: enough for 1 pound of pasta, about 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   ANCHOVY VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   { cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons or more good red or white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and fresh-ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, or more to taste, with some of their oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot (about 1 ounce), peeled and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine all ingredients except shallot in a blender, and turn
the machine on. A creamy emulsion will form within 30 seconds.
Taste, and add more vinegar if necessary, about a teaspoon at a
time, until the balance tastes right.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add shallot, and turn machine on and off a few times, until
shallot is minced within the dressing. Taste, adjust seasoning and
serve. (This vinaigrette is best made fresh but will keep
refrigerated for a few days. Before using, bring it back to room
temperature, and whisk briefly.) Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   PASTA WITH ANCHOVIES AND ARUGULA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and fresh-ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 large cloves garlic, peeled and slivered
</P>
<P>
   8 anchovy fillets, or more to taste, with some of their oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound linguine or other long pasta
</P>
<P>
   2 cups arugula, washed, dried and chopped
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon or more crushed red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1. Set a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put half of the olive oil in a deep skillet, and turn the
heat to medium. A minute later, add the garlic and the anchovies.
When the garlic sizzles and the anchovies break up, turn the heat
to its lowest setting.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook the pasta until it is tender but not mushy. Reserve 1
cup of the cooking liquid, and drain. Add pasta and arugula to
skillet, along with enough of the reserved cooking water to make a
sauce. Turn heat to medium, and stir for a minute. Add salt and
pepper to taste, plus a pinch or more of red pepper flakes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn pasta and sauce into a bowl, toss with remaining olive
oil and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

WHO TURNED ON THE NOISE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curt Peoples, of Toronto, went to Myrtle Beach, S.C., with a
friend for a weekend of golf last month. He was taken aback to
discover they had arrived in the midst of a huge convergence called
Harley-Davidson Week. Peoples said that from his hotel, the
Caribbean Resort on Ocean Boulevard, he could hear the parade of
bikes making its way around the Route 17 loop until 1 a.m. nightly.
Sleep was elusive, Peoples said, and the drive back to the
Charlotte, N.C., airport, a trip that normally takes three hours,
took four and a half because of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The local Harley-Davidson shop estimates that 250,000 machines
were in town for the week. The Myrtle Beach Grand Strand area has
60,000 rooms for rent, including condominiums for six or eight
people, according to Jennifer Coons at the Chamber of Commerce, and
she considers the figure of a quarter of a million motorcycles
quite plausible. Last year, it was 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples said he does not consider himself anti-biker, but he and
his golfing friend would plan their trip differently next year.
</P>
<P>
   The experience brings up the question: What steps can the
leisure traveler seeking a quiet getaway take to avoid sleepless
nights and choked highways that may develop around unanticipated
conventions? Here are some thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   First, avoid large numbers of internal combustion engines. The
bikers' week that Peoples' encountered is actually considered a
tranquil respite in the biking community. ``They mostly come to
ride around and admire each other's bikes,'' said Dale Coyner of
Communicast, a producer of live Web events in Herndon, Va., and
author of ``Motorcycle Journeys Through the Appalachians''
(Whitehorse Press).
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said that the Myrtle Beach week had a family quality
because it has been fostered by the Blue Knights, an organization
of bikers who are current or retired law officers. He said this was
unlike a week in Sturgis, S.D., which he said was ``notorious''
(this year's rally is scheduled for Aug. 7 to 13).
</P>
<P>
   For Myrtle Beach, he said, the carefully maintained bikes are
brought in on trailers lest they get scratched or dirty on the
highway. This was part of the congestion on the route to Charlotte.
Moreover, the Myrtle Beach week, he said, is a tiny shadow of the
Daytona Beach week, which in March was reported to have attracted
600,000 motorcycles. The Daytona 200 race is run then.
</P>
<P>
   Asking a hotel or convention and visitors bureau what events are
scheduled for the week in the area you plan a visit is one step
travelers can take. Really big events, like Daytona, soak up the
available rooms a year in advance and drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who covers auto races said that the sound of a drag
race can be heard five miles off. Reber said this was perfectly
likely, and that, worse, because the sound is not steady, it would
be much more irritating than, say, the hum of an air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Again, to participants, the racket is part of the attraction.
The National Hot Rod Association recently reiterated that an upper
limit of 95 decibels, as measured 50 feet from the engine, was set
on Jan. 1 for all stock and superstock vehicles competing in
organization events, but the ``vast majority'' had chosen to ignore
the rule. Moreover, these vehicles are quieter than the
5,000-horsepower top fuel dragsters that are part of the mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The hot rod association and two other groups have about 50
events scheduled between now and October.In the cold weather, these
are in the South, but by August they are in Norwalk, Ohio, and
Indianapolis. The schedule is maintained at www.bmracing.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are other noises that can wreck a vacation. Unless you
face on a courtyard, a room in the French Quarter of New Orleans is
not likely to be restful any night of the year, particularly
holidays. But most people who want quiet in Louisiana do not pick
the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Events designed to bring in tourists to celebrate in the streets
_ Fiesta in San Antonio, for example _ also have their own distant
early warnings in high hotel prices and limited availability. In
addition, there are holidays unique to some states, traffic-halting
marathon races and nationality parades across the country. Local
hotel clerks and tourist bureaus know about these, and they should
be asked for a schedule. Holidays overseas may bring noise in the
street, or the opposite: shuttered banks, museums, stores and
information bureaus. It is worthwhile to check guidebooks for these
lists, especially if they are religious holidays that may shift
with a lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms just above the disco are an awful problem, and if
the room is rented early in the day, the situation may not be
apparent. When making reservations, ask about the location of any
late-night clubs. Other hazards are the swimming pool, the parking
lot and the place where trash is picked up early in the morning.
Lately the Travel section has received a rash of letters
complaining of hotel construction, a byproduct of a booming
economy, or reconstruction in the Caribbean after hurricane damage.
This is less of a late evening problem than one for early in the
morning. If there are dropcloths and Dumpsters about, ask for
another floor. When renting a vacation house, ask the agent if the
view from the porch is likely to include a construction crew during
your stay.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, it is nearly impossible to avoid
graduation parties and wedding receptions. Samuel F. Pryor III, a
partner at Davis, Polk &AMP; Wardwell in New York, related that he
arrived in Durango, Colo., at the time of a major bikers' gathering
last year. ``They were parked head-in as far as you could see,'' he
said. But the noise was not such a problem, ``We were attending a
wedding,'' he said, ``making some of our own.''

THABO MBEKI HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL, BUT DON'T WRITE HIM OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thabo Mbeki demonstrated political savvy by
making a stop here during his first official visit to the United
States as president of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, San Francisco, even Atlanta are expected stops on
the itinerary of a new president looking to forge investment
partnerships with American corporations. But this capital in the
Hill Country is a double whammy: Mbeki meets with the CEOs of
Fortune 500 companies and the Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old head of state denied mingling in American
politics during his six-day visit here, but his meeting with Gov.
George W. Bush served a twofold purpose: establish ties with a
governor whose state represents tremendous economic opportunity for
Mbeki's struggling sub-Saharan nation, and meet with the man who
might be sitting in the White House come January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we must come to Texas, to pay a courtesy call on
the governor and to interact certainly with the business
community,'' Mbeki said Thursday during a 40-minute meeting with
editorial writers from the state's five largest newspapers. ``Texas
is an important economic and power center. We wanted to expose our
sizable business delegation to your companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizable, indeed. Mbeki's entourage took up 120 rooms at the Four
Seasons Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the president, few of the questions asked by
the Texas journalists had anything to do with economics or trade.
Mbeki's controversial and widely reported fascination with two U.S.
scientists who reject the idea that the HIV virus causes AIDS
begged clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most frequently asked question in the United
States,'' Mbeki said. ``There is a serious AIDS problem in South
Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. And the view of the South African
government is that we indeed have to deal with this matter with the
greatest possible vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Mbeki went on to reiterate his statements that the
entire scientific community _ including those researchers labeled
dissidents by the mainstream _ must continue to study the specifics
of how the disease is transmitted, and how best to get actual
results in fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth of South Africa's adult population is estimated to be
HIV-positive, according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have different views about the elements of HIV/AIDS
_ we're not just talking about evidence of HIV/AIDS,'' he said.
``Why is there heterosexual transmission of HIV in some parts of
the world and homosexual transmission in others? If we can get an
answer to that, you are then able to make the kind of focused,
specific response to whatever might be the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A question about ongoing conflicts in Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and
between Eritrea and Ethiopia and their impacts on South Africa
elicited a quick geography lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bad moment,'' Mbeki admitted, ``but it is also
necessary to somewhat disaggregate the African continent. If you do
that, it becomes possible to see that these negative things in,
say, Eritrea do not in reality define altogether what is happening
on the African continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, is a five-hour plane ride
from Johannesburg, Mbeki said. Although the two nations are on the
same continent, what is occurring that far away has little to no
impact on the economic opportunities that exist for American
companies interested in investing in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like saying that conflict in Yugoslavia between
the Serbs and the Muslims, the Albanians and the Kosovars sent
ripples through the Irish and the Scots and the Brits,'' he said.
``It didn't happen, but for some strange reason when that conflict
breaks out in Africa .... You must look at Africa in the
disaggregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of former President Nelson Mandela
would not be an easy job for anyone, but it has fallen to Mbeki to
deliver on the promises made six years ago when a government led by
the African National Congress took power. Those promises included
housing, water and electricity for all South Africans. Yet when
asked about a report issued last week by his own officials
indicating that 3 million families still lack proper housing, Mbeki
was unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that it is so few, the 3 million, given where
we've come from,'' Mbeki said. ``What happened in '94 is that we
said that we would aim to have something in the order of 1 million
houses in a period of five years. We didn't quite get to that
million, but as far as I can remember _ I'm trying to remember the
exact statistics _ it was in the upper 800,000s by the end of that
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be big backlogs, if you will understand where we
came from. There will be big backlogs in housing, electrification,
rural roads, water supply _ in anything. But it is the goal to
sustain that housing program and obviously try and speed it up. I
think a lot of progress has been made. But the backlog is big _
very big.''
</P>
<P>
   The president will have been in office only a year as of June
16, but he's learned the art of the dodge well. When asked what he
would consider to be the highlight of his administration thus far,
Mbeki exhibited a decidedly un-American political trait: He
deflected the chance to blow his own horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is unfair,'' he said to a nervous giggle from the
writer. (Even seasoned journalists can get flustered.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. No, because I mean, if I praise myself, if I say to you
I am a spectacular president (laughter from the room), you would
say: `What's wrong with that silly fellow?' I couldn't answer that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I would ask you that question. And you would answer me
honestly and say, `Well, to tell you the truth, nothing. I haven't
seen anything worth considering an achievement.' And it's probably
true. But I could not answer that question, could I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You choose not to, so it's all right, sir,'' the writer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it would be impossible to answer,'' Mbeki continued.
``Well, I submit that it is not impossible. I can answer. I can say
that I've demonstrated that I'm much better than the United States
president. (Laughter from the room.) Ask another question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, what is the ... well ... I guess I'm so used to United
States presidents answering that question that I'm taken aback.''
(Laughter from the room.)
</P>
<P>
   Politically savvy and a sense of humor. Another double whammy.

OLD DISPUTE REKINDLED OVER CONTENT OF MINE'S TALC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 With ASBESTOS-WITNESS  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The talc used by Crayola and most of America's other
crayon makers comes from a century-old mine long embroiled in
battles over whether its dusty product contains cancer-causing
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The mine in upstate New York, owned by R.T. Vanderbilt Co., has
been the center of a contentious 30-year-long fight pitting the
asbestos and talc industries against physicians and public health
experts over just what, precisely, constitutes asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's disclosure by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
followed by ABC News and others, that crayons are contaminated with
asbestos fibers has moved the debate back into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Vanderbilt and other stone-product companies
successfully fought off efforts to regulate sand for children's
sandboxes after doctors said it contained asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over crayons is eerily similar.
</P>
<P>
   `THAT'S THE PROOF'
</P>
<P>
   John Kelse, Vanderbilt's corporate risk manager, says there is
no asbestos in its talc ``to the best of our knowledge'' and there
has never been any asbestos-related disease among the company's
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians who treat the miners and their families
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof of it is Vanderbilt's own workers,'' says Dr. Philip
Landrigan, director of the Center for Children's Health and the
Environment at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. ``They have been
shown to have excess lung cancer, excess asbestosis and excess
rates of malignant mesothelioma. That's the proof of the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good conscience I don't know how Vanderbilt can say that
their talc doesn't contain asbestiform fibers,'' Landrigan adds.
``They're dancing around with legal definitions. While they're
dancing, people are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerrold Abraham, a professor of pathology at New York's
Upstate Medical University, not only has studied the Vanderbilt
talc, but also the lungs of the people who mine it in biopsies and
autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our medical center is the referral center for people from the
area where the mines are. We found several cases of mesothelioma in
the miners, and we've done studies on what we've found in lungs of
the sick miners,'' says Abraham, who is director of occupational
and environmental pathology at State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we find lots of talc, but there are also significant
amounts of asbestiform tremolite. There is no doubt in my mind that
the Vanderbilt mines are contaminated with asbestos. It just
co-exists with the talc they are mining.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``It's unconscionable for Vanderbilt to sell its talc
to Crayola and say it's free of asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite is one of six types of asbestos regulated by the
federal government. Industry and health officials have argued for
years over definitions of the mineral. The industry maintains that
some forms of tremolite, which they call ``non-asbestiform,'' don't
form true fibers and therefore shouldn't be regulated as asbestos.
Some doctors argue that all forms of tremolite can break down into
fiberlike particles of a length and width that cause
asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of asbestos found in the crayons analyzed for the P-I
and other organizations are lower by a huge magnitude than the
levels to which workers treated by Landrigan and Abraham were
exposed. Nevertheless, all the medical and public health experts
interviewed said there shouldn't be any asbestos in products that
children play with.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN VANDERBILT'S TALC?
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt put up a statement on its Web site last Thursday that
said the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, the Mine Safety and Health
Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission ``have
all confirmed that the industrial talc mined in upstate New York
does not contain asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was immediately disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not give Vanderbilt a clean bill of health,'' says Russ
Rader, CPSC's director of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at the issue of tremolite in play sand being
purchased by consumers and we did not find any asbestiform
tremolite in the sand. CPSC did not do anything like inspecting
Vanderbilt's plant, its talc or anything like giving the plant a
clean bill of health.''
</P>
<P>
   The mine safety agency says its responsibility is to test the
air the workers breathe for asbestos, not the ore.
</P>
<P>
   Two EPA inspectors in the New York regional office said last
Thursday that they could think of no reason why EPA would examine
the ore from Vanderbilt and suggested that the agency's Washington
headquarters be contacted.
</P>
<P>
   A senior EPA spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., said she would
``check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Vanderbilt removed the specific references
from its statement, which was changed to read that the absence of
asbestos in its talc had been confirmed by ``relevant regulatory
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Government-backed analysis of the Vanderbilt mines found
asbestos as far back as the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCrone Associates of Chicago examined seven different
talc samples from Vanderbilt mines for the federal government in
1975 and reported tremolite asbestos in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The asbestos mineral present ... is definitely asbestiform by
any definition of the word,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A report released in 1977 by the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health, which examined an increase in
asbestos-related disease among Vanderbilt's miners, reported
finding tremolite and anthophyllite, the identical fibers found in
the P-I's tests of crayons.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt says the government reports mean little.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a responsible analysis that showed
asbestos in this talc. There have been numerous irresponsible
analyses, just numerous,'' says Vanderbilt's Kelse. ''The NIOSH
report is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelse said he had proof that the scientists doing the government
studies changed their minds later and said Vanderbilt talc is
asbestos-free. The P-I asked to see the documents, but they were
not provided.
</P>
<P>
   `PEOPLE CAN FILE ANY SUIT'
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't it strike you as odd that a little company like
Vanderbilt probably would have been sued into oblivion if we really
had asbestos the way it was originally presented?'' Kelse asks.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt is far from a mom-and-pop operation. Named after its
founder, Robert Thurlow Vanderbilt, the company has 620 employees
as well as seven wholly-owned subsidiaries operating chemical
manufacturing plants in Connecticut and Kentucky, and mining and
mineral processing facilities in six states.
</P>
<P>
   And the debate over the dangers of Vanderbilt talc has been
fought in courtrooms throughout the country for years, in lawsuits
brought on behalf of workers who mined and milled the talc and
those in other industries where the talc was used in manufacturing.
Some of the lawsuits are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Some suits allege that the asbestos in the Vanderbilt's talc
have caused a variety of diseases _ non-malignant scarring of the
lungs, or asbestosis; lung cancer; and mesothelioma, a rare and
deadly cancer of the pleural lining closely identified with
exposure to asbestos, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can file any suit. The issue is, is it real or not?''
Kelse says.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas attorney Mark Iola was one of several lawyers handling
claims from 1988 to 1992 that workers in tire making plants in
California, Oklahoma, Iowa and other states had become ill after
working with Vanderbilt talc.
</P>
<P>
   Iola recalls a 1990 case in which he represented four workers
with asbestosis from a Los Angeles tire plant where large amounts
of talc were used to keep layers of rubber from sticking together
as the tires were being manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate in those cases centered on two points,'' says Iola.
``First, whether the talc from the R.T. Vanderbilt mines contained
tremolite and two, whether the tremolite was asbestiform and
cancer-causing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury heard a tremendous amount of technical information on
the characterization of the talc and asbestos and rejected the
company's claim that it was not asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   Iola said the jury found for the plaintiffs. He added that two
of the four plaintiffs later developed mesothelioma and died.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt did not return phone calls about the case and other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS ASBESTOS?
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos, a word which has been around since Roman times, means
a fiber that won't burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbestos is not a scientific term at all. It has to do with
the commercial use of the product and has nothing to do with health
effects. You have to talk about the individual fiber,'' says Dr.
Bruce Case, director of environmental pathology at Montreal's
McGill University and one of North America's top researchers in the
health effects of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ruled that exposure to six different types of
asbestos must be regulated because of their potential to cause
disease. Two of the six _ tremolite and anthophyllite _ were found
in many of the crayons analyzed for the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists arguing the dangers of asbestos say there are harmful
and harmless _ asbestiform and non-asbestiform _ types of each
mineral, and they toss words like ``shards,'' ``fragments,''
``bundles,'' ``fibrous'' and ``non-fibrous'' into the debate on
whether certain fibers can harm humans.
</P>
<P>
   The argument boils down to a classic fight between form and
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Industry geologists argue it's the form _ the original structure
of a mineral, like the tremolite in Vanderbilt's ore _ that matters
in determining whether to call it asbestos. Physicians and others
says it's substance _ the chemical composition, length and width of
the fibers _ that matters, because that's what determines what
causes disease.
</P>
<P>
   Case and other physicians say the health issues should not get
bogged down in semantics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing magic about this. It's very straightforward,''
says Case. ``You can call it asbestiform. You can call it
non-asbestiform. You can call it the man on the moon. I don't care
what you call it, it's what (the fiber) looks like, how much of it
there is, and whether it remains in the lung that determines
whether or not it's later going to cause disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Robbins, the director of NIOSH during some of the
government's hottest battles to regulate asbestos, doesn't think
the government has done enough to eliminate asbestos hazards when
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that there is a variety of things that constitute
asbestos and we were never convinced that any of them were shown to
be safe,'' Robbins says. ``If you have a fiber of a certain length
and of a certain diameter get in a certain place in the lung, then
one should probably presume that it's dangerous, rather then assume
that it's safe until proven dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, talc,
the fine powder from crushed rock, is processed from 19 mines in
six states. The powder is used in hundreds of consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its continuing examination of the hazards of asbestos
and the government's spotty record of regulating the lethal fiber,
the P-I contracted with two laboratories to analyze 22
off-the-shelf products containing talc. Asbestos was detected in
none of the products, except crayons. But physician and geologist
Germine says that in repeated testing, he found tremolite asbestos
in two consumer items and in the coating of a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe that there is a government ban in the United
States against the manufacture, importation, use and sale of
asbestos, as there is in most of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. In 1989, the EPA instituted such a ban, but two years
later it was overturned by the courts after a challenge by the U.S.
and Canadian asbestos industries.
</P>
<P>
   Once asbestos again became legal, the job of making sure it was
used properly was left largely to the industry itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of crayons, a federal labeling law defines what
hazardous material can be in the products. But actual testing and
certification that crayons are ``non-toxic'' is done by a trade
group whose budget comes from the industry it is hired to examine.
Government regulators do not double-check the industry's claims of
safety.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Vanderbilt provides the crayon makers and other
talc customers with a government-required Material Safety Data
Sheet listing all potential hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The information that came with its talc ``said nothing about any
asbestos in it,'' a Crayola official told the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   The safety data sheets that Crayola issues in turn on the
assembled crayons goes further, stating simply that the company
uses talc ``containing no asbestos fiber.''
</P>
<P>
   So, at least in the case of Crayola, the company relied on the
word of its talc supplier, Vanderbilt, that the product was safe.
The Art and Creative Materials Institute, the trade association
which issues the government-required ``non-toxic'' seal on crayons,
says it relied on tests done by its toxicologist. But the
toxicologist says he doesn't test the talc for asbestos because the
talc supplier says there isn't any.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan offered his opinion on what crayon makers should do
until the debate over their products is resolved:
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to the companies that have done this is admit you
were hoodwinked by a producer, pull the product off the market, get
points with the public and do the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A SKIRMISH IN A SANDBOX
</P>
<P>
   Crayons are not the first product aimed at children that the
Consumer Product Safety Commission has had to investigate for
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over contamination of talc was tossed into CPSC's
arena in 1987 when Abraham, a New York occupational pathologist,
and Germine, then a third-year medical student from New Jersey,
found tremolite fibers in play sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought this nice, white play sand for my son,'' Abraham
recalls, ``and when I poured it into his sand box I noticed this
cloud of dust came up. I wasn't at all thinking of asbestos, but I
thought that it was just too much dust for him to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who at the time did analytic work on asbestos and other
dust, analyzed the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found, to my surprise, when I looked through the microscope.
long thin tremolite asbestos fibers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Germine and Abraham asked CPSC to recall play sand.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC responded by having outside consultants check the sand
for tremolite. From there, the battle got messy. Although the labs
agreed there was tremolite in the sand, they argued about
mineralogical definitions. Some said it met the criteria for
cancer-causing fibers. Others said it was so-called
``non-asbestiform tremolite,'' a type that talc producers argue
does not cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the CPSC sided with industry, maintaining there was
no clear-cut evidence that non-asbestiform tremolite particles have
been demonstrated to cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CPSC decided not to take any action because they believed
the same industry experts that the tremolite fibers that were found
were not harmful,'' Abraham said. ``Now they're running into the
same thing again with the crayon makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's Kelse says the concerns on crayon safety may be the
same thing as play sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was tremolite asbestos, but it turned out to be
tremolite cleavage fragments, which may be the problem (with
crayons.)''
</P>
<P>
   The National Stone Association, a trade group for the crushed
stone, sand and gravel industry, is still handing out a Vanderbilt
brochure produced in the 1980s which says that the talc from its
New York mine ``contains approximately 50 percent tremolite, all of
which is the non-asbestiform variety.''
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT SLUGS IT OUT
</P>
<P>
   The sand box issue was only a minor skirmish in Vanderbilt's
three-decade-long battle to keep tremolite in its talc from being
regulated as asbestos. As a result, non-fibrous tremolite, which
was originally covered under OSHA's initial asbestos standards in
the 1970s, is now specifically excluded from OSHA's rules. It
happened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt had one big reason to fight _ money.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 31, 1977, letter to Ray Marshall, then secretary of
labor, Vanderbilt wrote that OSHA's action ``will in all likelihood
result in staggering business loss to the R.T. Vanderbilt Co. and
directly jeopardize a $30 million manufacturing facility where 175
employees are employed.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle began in the summer of 1973, when NIOSH issued a
Health Hazard Evaluation of Fortune Industries in Chelsea, Mich.,
one of Vanderbilt's customers. The report, according to Public
Citizen, a consumer watchdog group, said concentrations of
tremolite from Vanderbilt talc used by Fortune exceeded OSHA
standards and advised the company to find a replacement for the
talc.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed that its customers would begin looking for substitutes,
Vanderbilt waged a campaign to get the tremolite in its talc
excluded from the standards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, it managed to get a temporary stay of OSHA standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the reprieve didn't last long. Three years later, OSHA
reversed itself after a preliminary finding of increased
asbestos-related diseases among Vanderbilt miners.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt kept fighting. A decade later, the company again
asked for relief from OSHA's newest asbestos standard.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Vanderbilt brought in political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Republicans Sen. Lowell Weicker Jr. and Rep. Stewart
McKinney fired off a letter to Secretary of Labor William Brock on
behalf of Vanderbilt, which is based in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these regulations are permitted to go into effect on July
21, 1986, R.T. Vanderbilt Co. Inc., which we have written on behalf
of for over ten years, will be forced to shut down,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 18, 1986, OSHA again reversed its position, granting
Vanderbilt a new temporary stay.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was argued for eight more years. More hearings were
held, more testimony taken, more pressure from the industry and
lawmakers who support it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1994, OSHA instituted a final asbestos standard that
eliminated non-asbestiform tremolite from government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, frustrating battle for regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed tremolite should be regulated, provided it meets
the definition (of a fiber whose length is at least three times its
width),'' said John Martonik, then deputy director of health
standards for OSHA, in an interview with the P-I in December. ``We
thought the biological properties were more important in setting
the standard than the mineralogical ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's risk manager, Kelse, says the battle was vital to
his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three decades we've been through more grief and
aggravation than you'd want to know on all fronts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely, extremely important issue for us because
it deals with the very definition of asbestos.''
</P>
<P>
   NIOSH's Robbins said, ``OSHA and CPSC get challenged by an army
of lawyers, scientists and experts from industry every time they go
forward with one of these things, and, I say with some sympathy,
that they probably couldn't take on everyone at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one, the talc, probably should have been done.''

ASBESTOS INDUSTRY PAYS CRAYOLA'S EXPERT MILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``independent'' expert that Crayola hired to check its
crayons for asbestos has been paid millions of dollars by the
asbestos industry for testimony on its behalf in personal-injury
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lee, president of the RJ Lee Group in Pittsburgh,
testified under oath in March in a personal-injury asbestos trial
in Abbeville, La., that he had been a witness more that 250 times
for asbestos companies like W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., United States
Mineral, Owens Corning and others.
</P>
<P>
   For his services, he testified, he has billed asbestos companies
about $7 million, often at $350 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published a story last week
disclosing that tests had found asbestos in its tests of Crayola
and two other crayon brands, Binney &AMP; Smith, makers of Crayola,
hired Lee to do another test.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lee and the crayon company announced his tests showed
no asbestos in the two Crayolas he tested.
</P>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith was asked Friday if Lee's involvement with the
asbestos and talc industries met its definition of independent. The
company has not answered that question.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he examined the crayons and the raw talc using
polarized light microscopy (PLM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of those techniques, which definitely
determine whether or not asbestos is present, confirmed that the
talc used in Crayola crayons and the finished products do not
contain asbestos,'' said Lee in a statement issued by Crayola.
</P>
<P>
   The three tests that Lee mentioned were the same methods used by
the two Seattle labs that did the analysis for the P-I _ Lab/Cor
Inc, and Pacific Rim Environmental Inc. Those tests detected
asbestos _ tremolite and anthophyllite _ in 32 of 40 Crayola, Prang
and Rose Art crayons tested. Other tests of crayons commissioned by
ABC News found tremolite fibers at concentrations which exceeded 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee suggested last week that the labs used by the P-I
misidentified the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been common in the past for labs to misidentify talc
fibers and cleavage minerals as asbestos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both labs that examined the crayons for the P-I stand by their
analyses, which showed tremolite and anthophyllite fibers with a
length and width and chemical composition that meets the definition
of asbestos used by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This laboratory, under the supervision of John Harris, uses
analytical protocols for asbestos analysis as set down by the EPA.
We have been doing this for years,'' said Dr. Robert Fisher,
Lab/Cor's president and chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proficiency for this work is evaluated regularly through
round-robin analysis of blind samples and on-site monitoring by
highly qualified scientists under a program administered by the
National Institutes of Science and Technology. We have always
passed,'' said Fisher, who is also a research professor of
materials science and engineering at the University of Washington
and a past president of the Microscopy Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is unmistakably some asbestos at low levels in some of
the crayons we tested,'' said Fred Golloway, director at Pacific
Rim Environmental Labs. ``The PLM method that we use here can
differentiate between fibrous and non-fibrous tremolite. We do it
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, Harris and Golloway _ the three scientists who analyzed
samples for the P-I _ all said they have never testified in
asbestos litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Crayola, the P-I and ABC News all have provided some test
results to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is
conducting its own tests. The agency expects initial results this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Germine examined a microscope photograph of one of the
crayon samples Lab/Cor had analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a typical fiber of tremolite asbestos,'' the
California physician said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open-air markets where farmers sell freshly dug
potatoes, fragrant herbs and dewy berries enrich the fabric of many
cities. Paris has 62 outdoor markets, which have long been anchors
of their neighborhoods. In New York, the 28 Greenmarkets, a network
begun in 1976, have changed the city's food scene.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two new lavishly photographed books celebrate these
cornucopias: ``Paris in a Basket: Markets _ The Food and the
People'' by Nicolle Aimee Meyer and Amanda Pilar Smith (Konemann,
$19.95) and ``The Greenmarket Cookbook: Recipes, Tips and Lore From
the World Famous Urban Farmer's Market'' by Joel Patraker (the
markets' assistant director) and Joan Schwartz (Viking, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   The French book is the more focused and rewarding. The authors
spent a year walking in Paris, and their book tours the markets by
arrondissement. It puts personalities behind the farmers,
fishermen, butchers, cheese mongers, bakers and other food
producers who set up shop in stalls. They are people like Daniel
and Monique Letard, who sell poultry and game in the Joinville
market and who recommend putting some farmer cheese in the cavity
of a pheasant before roasting to keep it from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Greenmarkets in New York, not all the vendors in
Paris produce their own wares. Some gather cheeses, for example,
from sources in Normandy, or seafood from fishermen in Brittany.
The markets operate year round and offer foods that can include,
depending on the neighborhood, Chinese teas, Spanish oranges and
Indian spices. They represent a tradition that predates grocery
stores and supermarkets, and they often serve as colorful
substitutes for the more antiseptic stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris in a Basket'' sketches the surroundings of each market,
including food shops, a few restaurants and historic sights, making
it worthwhile for the food-loving tourist. Throughout the book
appear brief excursions on subjects like oysters, olives, organic
farming and butchers. Unfortunately, there is no index, so finding
any of these nuggets easily is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Each section of the book includes a few fairly classic recipes,
like moules marinieres, vinaigrette salads, onion soup, potato
gratin, apple cake and duck breast with port, most of which can be
found in many other books. I loved the silky, cumin-scented avocado
vichyssoise, a more unusual recipe. But even it needed a spritz of
lemon juice to bring up the flavor, and I found it impossible to
cram all the ingredients into my blender at once. As good as the
recipes may be, they are basically beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenmarket book, by contrast, is filled with recipes. But
it is more valuable for listing produce and other foods by season,
along with helpful charts describing the varieties of apples,
squashes, potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, herbs and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   The book tells how Barry Benepe, a Hudson Valley urban planner,
conceived of the Greenmarkets as a way for growers in the region to
sell their produce in the city and keep their farms alive. It
profiles farmers, fishermen and cheesemakers who sell their wares
today. Unfortunately, it is not clear where a shopper can find
those sellers among the markets. The book also lacks a guide to
market sites and schedules, but that may be because they often
change.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes come from chefs, farmers, food writers and
Greenmarket shoppers. Some are quick to make, like baked Jerusalem
artichoke chips, green beans with savory and bacon, and tomato
salad with chilies and feta. Others, like duck salad with fresh
peas and radishes, are complex.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes I tried needed fine-tuning, and a fellow reporter
had the same problem. That duck salad recipe does not say how long
it takes to roast the legs, and there was too much oil in a beet,
pear and Gorgonzola salad. A roasted strawberry clafoutis was heavy
and dense, no match for the custardy cherry clafoutis in the French
book.
</P>
<P>
   As in the French book, all the ingredients for a cool soup, this
time made with cucumbers, did not fit into my blender. But unlike
the recipes in the French book, which is more a Baedeker, the
Greenmarket recipes are the main feature. That's the problem.

   INDONESIA-ASSESS (Jakarta) _ A news analysis: Investigators who
are struggling to break through a mental fog as they question
former President Suharto are searching for something that is
perhaps more valuable than the billions of dollars he is said to
have stolen from his country. They are fighting to reclaim a piece
of their nation's history. The fitful interrogations of the ailing
78-year-old former president, who was placed under house arrest on
Monday, are one part of a broad campaign by President Abdurrahman
Wahid to dig into a past that is filled with hidden abuses. By Seth
Mydans.

</P>

   HAITI-POLITICS (Miami) _ Former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's party has won control of Haiti's Senate, according to
partial returns from last week's election. The first results,
released Monday by Electoral Council spokesman Jean-Gardy Lorcy,
showed the Lavalas Family Party winning 14 of the 27 seats in the
Senate. The results of the May 21 vote suggested strong support for
the former priest who is expected to run for president again this
fall. (Summary from wires) By David Gonzalez.

   CUBA-U.S.-SPY (Miami) _ A U.S. immigration official was found
guilty of espionage Tuesday after getting caught in a government
sting passing secret information to a friend with ties to Cuba.
Mariano Faget, 54, a naturalized U.S. citizen who came from Cuba as
a teen-ager, showed no reaction when the federal jury convicted him
of all four counts, including violating the Espionage Act. The
charges carry a possible prison term of five to six years. (Summary

   GEOGRAPHY-GENDER-GAP (New York) _ There were no girl finalists

   MARKET (New York) _ Stock prices surged Tuesday, a move some

market indexes, were achieved on light, post-holiday trading
volume. The Dow Jones industrial average was up nearly 220 points;
the S&AMP;P 500 index was up more than 40 points; and the Nasdaq

<P>
   Q: Which major leaguer is the all-time leader in striking out?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.S., Templeton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Reggie Jackson tops the list, with 2,597 strikeouts in 9,864
career at-bats, a .263 average. By comparison, his lifetime batting
average was .262.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Hall of Fame inductee played for five teams in a
21-year career, winning five World Series championships. He's No. 6
on the lifetime home run list with 563 and No. 17 in RBIs with
1,702.
</P>
<P>
   Among active players, Jose Canseco of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
leads with 1,802 strikeouts through May 16. That puts the 16-year

plays through the 2001 season, passing Willie Stargell at 1,936
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What poem includes the words ``If I had loved you less or
played you slyly,/I might have held you for a summer more''?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.S.N., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a sonnet by Edna St. Vincent Millay from her 1931 book
``Fatal Interview,'' a 52-poem collection inspired by a love
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The poem is sometimes reprinted under the titles ``Loss'' or
``Well, I Have Lost You, and Lost You Fairly,'' which is its first
line.
</P>
<P>
   Millay, who lived from 1892 to 1950, was one of the most popular
American poets of the 1920s. She won the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for
her collection ``The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver.''

SIGNS OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION COULD BE NEARER THAN YOU THINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archaeologists from the University of Chicago have discovered a
6,000-year-old city in Syria. It appears to have been a full-blown
city and not just a small town or village. They've uncovered huge
cooking ovens, which for me is only evidence that there were
growing boys in the area; however, they found some other things
which indicate that this was a settlement of sophisticated people.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about this discovery is that scholars had
previously believed that the development of cities began around
3100 B.C. This finding pushes that date back about 900 years to
4000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that got me to thinking. It's just a vague recollection
but I kind of think that I had my own life before these children
arrived. It may have been a primitive existence, but there is
evidence that I haven't always avoided buying clothing that says
``dry clean only.''
</P>
<P>
   I began my search for self in my wallet but there was nothing in
there except pictures of my family, insurance cards, library cards
and faded credit cards. I looked in my closet but there was no
evidence of my past life there, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then I remembered the attic. I rushed to the hall, pulled the
ladder down and climbed up to the entrance. The single light bulb
failed to illuminate much of the room so I went and got a
flashlight and a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Inside that dim, hot room I found some incredible things. Buried
underneath a mountain of old, broken furniture, sleeping bags and
Christmas decorations were three boxes of artifacts from my life
before I discovered elastic waistbands.
</P>
<P>
   In one box, I found a calendar from 15 years ago. I was amazed
to see page after page of completely blank dates! It was as if I
had nothing to do beyond the usual tasks of my daily routine. My
organizer is so full now that by the middle of the month, I have to
use a sticky note if I want to add anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I found an old photo album. Inside were pictures of my
husband and me. In several of the pictures, we were just lying on a
beach or sitting on the patio of a restaurant doing nothing. There
were always a bunch of empty glasses and bottles near us, as if
we'd been doing nothing for a while.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a caricature of us at Six Flags. I cannot believe
that I went to Six Flags and sat still long enough for someone to
actually draw a picture of the two of us. Now, when we take the
kids to the amusement park, we barely pause at the entry gate long
enough to take a snapshot. After that, we sprint through the park
like it's going to close at any minute. If I want to eat, I have to
start on my hot dog 10 minutes before the boys start theirs. They
don't chew; they simply inhale their food and say, ``Let's go, Mom.
We want to ride the roller coaster again.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing I unearthed was proof positive that I had a life
of my own before my darling babies took it over. In a far corner of
the attic, partially hidden underneath the insulation, I found a
very, very small purse.
</P>
<P>
   It was barely big enough to hold a tube of lipstick, one car key
and a folded dollar bill. For years, that was my purse of choice.
It held everything I needed to get through the day. My current
wallet is larger than that purse. I could never get mints and
bandages and the schedules for 16 sporting events in that teeny
purse.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that did it for me. I got my bat and headed for the exit.
Suddenly, I saw a shadow and heard an eerie noise. I took a Ken
Griffey Jr. swing at what turned out to be my husband's head
peeking through the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck are you doing?'' he yelled, ducking his head in
the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops. Sorry. I was looking for the beginnings of
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well hurry up and find it and come on. The kids are ready to
go to Six Flags.''
</P>
<P>
   With one last backward glance, I started to leave the attic.
Then I went back to that corner and retrieved that teeny purse. If
I cut off the strap, the boys can keep their marbles in it. Hey,
life goes on.

</P>
<P>
   ``THE SPECIAL PRISONER''
</P>
<P>
   By JIM LEHRER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 previous books by Lehrer listed before the title
page of this one, all written while he wasn't busy anchoring ``The
Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. We think he should slow down.
There's a hurried feel to this novel, the story of Methodist bishop
John Quincy Watson, who in a crowded airport catches a glimpse of a
man he believes to be the Japanese officer who brutalized him in a
prison camp during World War II. Watson follows ``the Hyena,'' as
prisoners called him, to San Diego, where he corners him in his
hotel and proceeds to have a remarkably civilized talk with him, in
between bouts of tussling that go mysteriously unheard by guests in
surrounding rooms. These chapters, alternated with Watson's
memories of the camp, are tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately,
Lehrer places his real climax in the middle of the book, and
follows it with a section involving a murder trial, lots of moral
pondering and a ludicrous ending.

<P>
   ``THE SECRET LIVES OF WORDS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By PAUL WEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable falls hard for books like this. Novelist West
(''The Dry Danube,'' ``Life With Swan'') has assembled a list of
words he has kept over the years that are notable for no other
reason than that he was curious about them. They are here
alphabetically, with information on their etymologies and remarks
from the bemused author on their modern usage. The only
disappointment is that our own favorite words (discombobulate,
melancholy, spellbinding) are not here. Among those that are:
dunderhead, bungalow, grievous, italics, sad, blizzard, gremlin,
escape, serendipity and a few obscenities that are treated with the
same affectionate civility as all the rest. West describes his
delightful book as ``a short homage to words, and the devious route
they have taken in coming usefully to us - some 400 in particular,
most of whom I propose to treat as honored guests, invited in (or
out) for a drink, a handshake, and, in some cases, an exchange of
blue movies.''

<P>
   ``SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By FRANK KERMODE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $30)
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Kermode throws out the welcome mat in his preface when
he addresses this book not to scholars but ``to a non-professional
audience with an interest in Shakespeare that has not, I believe,
been well served by modern critics, who on the whole seem to have
little time for his language; they tend to talk past it in
technicalities or down to it in arcanely expressed platitudes.
Every other aspect of Shakespeare is studied almost to death, but
the fact that he was a poet has somehow dropped out of
consideration.'' There you have it: Poetic language is the focus
here, and if you have always wanted to be more interested in
Shakespeare than you are, if you've needed permission to be
discriminating rather than reverential toward his most famous
works, Kermode is here to light your way. His book is literary
criticism, to be sure, and not for the faint of heart. But it is
also unabashedly inviting and invigorating - you will want to
revisit the plays armed with all that you have learned. Enjoy.

<P>
   RED MAFIYA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ROBERT FRIEDMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   Friedman begins his book by offering his most impressive
credential, the news that Russian mobsters have threatened several
times to kill him, slowly and in as grisly a fashion as possible.
The Russians, it seems, make the Italian Mafia look like pikers. To
the Russians, murder is blood sport - they will shoot you, a cop
told Friedman, ``just to see if the gun works.'' Now that we've
mentioned this, you'll be pleased to know that these people have
global reach, vast financial assets and an ever-growing presence in
the United States. Friedman has written about them for Vanity Fair
and other magazines (hence the death threats) and now offers this
energetic book, in which he tells anecdote after anecdote in his
effort to portray the Russian mob as the most savage and vicious
bunch of thugs ever to reach American shores. He includes photos,
and judging from the look of these guys (they appear both alive and
lying in pools of blood) a Russian version of The Sopranos can't be
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FEAST OF LOVE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By CHARLES BAXTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pantheon, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Its title doesn't begin to describe all of the things this novel
is, or hint at the skill and daring Baxter shows in writing it. He
is, in fact, his own character - the book begins with an insomniac
writer named Charlie taking an after-midnight walk on a summer
night. On a park bench he sees Bradley, his neighbor and fellow
member of ``the insomnia army.'' They talk aimlessly at first,
about Bradley's history in love and marriage, but suddenly Bradley
has an idea: Charlie should talk to real people, listen to the
human beings around him as inspiration for his fiction.
``Everybody's got a story,'' he says, ``and we'll just start
telling you the stories we have.'' So begins a chorus of voices,
all connected somehow to Bradley, and all of them talking about
love, longing and loss. As the best of them, a streetwise girl
named Chloe, says, ``You can't figure out love without figuring out
death, too, but the effort it takes can knock the wind out of
you.'' This funny, wistful novel is a stage for Baxter's
virtuosity, and a reader's feast indeed.

<P>
   ``IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BILL BRYSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broadway, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that this perfectly charming book about Australia
has to follow A Walk in the Woods, Bryson's hilarious chronicle of
his hike on the Appalachian Trail. That book afforded him a comic
foil in his none-too-refined hiking partner, Katz. Here he has only
himself, and the laughs are not as frequent or as incapacitating.
Still, he seems to feel an obligation to be funny, as in a lengthy
description of himself napping (he is not, he says, ``a discreet
and fetching sleeper''). The book is best when he does not push the
limits of his persona - that of a curious, witty, friendly,
informative and very British (he is American, actually, but lived
in England for years, as is evident in his writing style and his
accent) tourist set loose in one of the most underpublicized
countries in the world. Bryson's travels include Sydney, Canberra,
the forbidding and huge Nullarbor Plain (its name is a corruption
of the Latin for ``no trees'') and the odd and unfathomable
outback. It's not hilarious, but it's a great trip anyway.

   GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS: A TALE MODERNE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By STEVEM GUARNACCIA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $15.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the three bears had lived as Guarnaccia imagines, Goldilocks
would have bolted before she crossed the threshold, driven off by
the embarrassing surfeit of style. These bears have far-flung
tastes. In addition to a Charles Ennie Mackintosh ``Ladderback''
chair (1902), they own a George Nelson ``Asterisk'' clock (1950),
an Alvar Aalto ``Savoy'' vase (1936), an Isamu Noguchi chess table
(1947), an Arne Jacobsen ``Egg'' chair (1957), a Marianne Westman
``Picknick'' casserole (1956), a Charles and Ray Eames ``LCW''
chair (1946) and many other dysfunctional-looking objects. Our
favorite is a blow-up bed, designed by an Italian whose name we do
not know. Goldilocks makes short work of it, and leaves its carcass
for Mama Bear to find. Goldilocks, by the way, looks like a refugee
from ``The Jetsons,'' and Mama Bear's mouth is on the side of her
face, under her right eye. We found that to be disconcerting, but
there's no accounting for taste.

   ``HIDE YOUR ASSETS AND DISAPPEAR''
</P>
<P>
   By EDMUND J. PANKAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Regan, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone had sent us this when it came out in hardcover, we'd
be gone by now. Ah, but we jest - Pankau's book, new in paperback,
is actually quite depressing, because it is based on the premise
that you hate everyone you know including your spouse and children
(how they feel about you is another book, maybe two). First, we
must tell you that he advises leaving the country if you want to
disappear, although he does give guidelines for remaining in the
United States incognito. Second, he likes to say unnerving things
like ``Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead,'' just to
scare you into silence. He suggests that you consider faking your
own death and erasing your tattoos. He also names countries that
make choice settings for a new life, and rates them (Costa Rica is
a winner) on things like weather, legal systems and extradition
policies. Even if you're not a felon, there's a certain
entertainment value to all of this, and you never know when
something will come in handy.

CHRONIC HEARTBURN MAY INDICATE MORE SERIOUS DISORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Chronic heartburn was not a great concern for Baseball
Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   He says he self-medicated with Tums or Rolaids and got enough
symptom relief to win the Cy Young Award three times.
</P>
<P>
   But, after 21 years with the Baltimore Orioles, when he retired
from baseball to become a television sports commentator and
celebrity spokesman, the ``heartburn'' became a real problem. It
began affecting his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had frequent and persistent heartburn for many years during
my baseball career,'' Palmer said during a recent visit to Dallas.
``I thought it was normal _ from eating late at night after a game,
the stress of the game itself, or the kind of stuff I was eating.
There are no health-food restaurants open when the game's over at
11 at night.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 10 years after retiring from baseball, Palmer was on a
media tour to promote ``Together We Were 11 Foot 9 Inches,'' the
book he wrote with his Baltimore Orioles manager, Earl Weaver _ a
major cause of heartburn, Palmer jokes _ when he totally lost his
voice.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it could mean an end to his career as a play-by-play
sports announcer and baseball analyst for ABC and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, my livelihood was at stake,,' recalls Palmer.
``No voice. No job.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw an ear, nose and throat specialist who diagnosed acid
reflux and referred him to a gastroenterologist, who used an
endoscope through the nose to examine his vocal cords and agreed
that gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, was the cause of
Palmer's heartburn and hoarseness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoarseness and irritation and was clearing my throat all
the time,'' Palmer recalls. His doctor prescribed medication to
block the production of stomach acid and recommended lifestyle
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer elevated the head of his bed, began exercise to speed up
his metabolism, stopped eating within three hours of going to sleep
and cut back on high-fat, spicy food and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   More than 21 million Americans suffer from GERD. Surveys among
older people show that diabetes, hypertension, depression and GERD
are their biggest health problems, Palmer says.
</P>
<P>
   He now takes Prilosec, the first of a new class of drugs known
as ``proton pump inhibitors,'' to prevent the symptoms of GERD and
is traveling under sponsorship of the pharmaceutical company that
makes the drug, talking primarily with groups of doctors about the
seriousness of the disease and medications available to deal with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gastrointestinal drugs are the biggest category in the
prescription drug market. Prilosec, which now has two competitors,
had more than $5.9 billion in sales worldwide last year, more than
any other prescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   GERD occurs when the sphincter between the esophagus, or
swallowing tube, is not strong enough to prevent strong acid from
the stomach from escaping back up into the delicate tissue of the
esophagus. The only cure for GERD is surgery in which the top of
the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus, creating an envelope
that acts as a valve to keep the acid in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is visiting 25 cities as spokesman for a campaign, ``Two
strikes and you're in ... the doctor's office,'' sponsored by the
International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, if you have frequent and persistent heartburn _
as often as twice a week _ you should be talking with your
doctor,'' Palmer says. ``You really need to think control.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal
Disorders is offering a free diary to help patients keep track of
their symptoms to facilitate discussions with their doctors. To
order a diary, call the foundation's hot line at (888) 964-2001.

HIGH COURT TO CONSIDER CLEAN AIR ACT AND ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday expanded its ongoing
review of the Clean Air Act by agreeing to decide whether the
statute requires looking beyond the public health benefits of
reducing air pollution to considering the economic costs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The court's action raised the stakes even higher in a case to be
argued next fall that already promised to be one of the most
important environmental and administrative law cases in years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the justices agreed to hear the Clinton
administration's appeal of a ruling by the federal appeals court in
Washington that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the
Environmental Protection Agency, handed such broad,
legislative-like authority to the administrative agency as to
amount to an unconstitutional ``delegation'' by Congress of its
lawmaking power.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Tuesday in the same case, the court granted a separate
appeal filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group of
regulated industries that asked the justices to examine the Clean
Air Act from a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   If the court were to read a broad cost-benefit requirement into
the agency's rule-making authority, the business groups said, the
whole delegation question could be avoided because the cost-benefit
requirement ``could functionally serve as the necessary
intelligible principle'' to preserve the Clean Air Act's
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had argued against granting the
business groups' appeal, characterizing it as an invitation to a
judicial override of a choice that Congress had already made. In
enacting the Clean Air Act, the administration told the court,
Congress ``reasonably concluded'' that pollution standards ``should
be based on health and welfare considerations alone so that
Congress and the public know that EPA's judgments on the health and
welfare threats posed by particular criteria pollutants are not
compromised by considerations of economic and technical
feasibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case are new standards for ozone and small
airborne particles that the agency issued in 1997.

THE FEAR OF TAKING PATERNITY LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Md., N.Y.)   By MELINDA LIGOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James M. Strauss does not consider himself a wimp.
But Strauss, a Manhattan lawyer, was not going to take an extended
leave of absence when his son Evan was born last June. One of the
reasons: He feared that his co-workers would question his machismo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had said that I was planning to take more than two weeks
off, people would have looked at me askance,'' said Strauss, an
associate at Putney, Twombly, Hall &AMP; Hirson. Instead, he took just
three days of vacation to help his wife with their newborn.
``There's definitely a perception out there that child care is a
burden that's still expected to fall on women,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been seven years since the enactment of the
Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires companies with more
than 50 employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for new
parents, most men do not take advantage of this legal right. Some
decline for economic reasons, but for others, it is fear that keeps
them in the workplace _ fear of being ridiculed, fear of being
discriminated against, even fear of losing their jobs _ some
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are terrified to take parental leave,'' said Suzanne Braun
Levine, a former editor of Ms. Magazine and author of ``Father
Courage: What Happens When Men Put Family First'' (Harcourt, 2000).
``While their organizations may profess to be family-friendly,
their bosses are giving them the message that men who take leave
are not very manly, or are somehow letting down the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the message that a former South Carolina state trooper,
David Roberts, says he got when he asked for six weeks off to care
for his newborn daughter, Cindy, in 1996. Roberts, who at the time
had been with the state police for nine years, says he made the
request because his wife was still in nursing school. He says his
superiors responded by telling him that ``a man's job was to work,
not stay home with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my bosses told me this long story about how he had
never let his wife work _ even though they had so little money that
they had to eat beanie weenies to make ends meet,'' Roberts said.
``Basically, he said I was less of a man for wanting to care for my
child.'' Roberts said he was intimidated into withdrawing his
request and was later dismissed in retaliation for making it in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit
against the South Carolina Department of Public Safety on his
behalf. The department's lawyer, Vance J. Bettis, has filed a
motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and said that Roberts' accusations
``just aren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   The former trooper, Bettis said, ``was terminated for reasons
unrelated to his requesting leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strikingly similar case, also brought by the ACLU, a jury
awarded a former Maryland state trooper, Kevin Knussman, $375,000
in February 1999 for the first-ever sex-discrimination verdict in
conjunction with the 1993 federal family leave law. Knussman
contends that his supervisors told him that ``God made women to
breast-feed babies, and men can't fulfill that role.'' That case is
being appealed, and Betty Stemley Sconion, principal counsel for
the Maryland State Police, says that Knussman was not discriminated
against. ``He made a mountain out of a molehill,'' Stemley Sconion
said. ``His superiors made an attempt to accommodate his request
for leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Mandelbaum, a Manhattan lawyer who represents both Roberts
and Knussman for the ACLU, says accusations of bias against
family-oriented fathers is not confined to blue-collar male
bastions like law enforcement. ``We hear about situations like this
all the time in the white-collar world, although sometimes the
message is more subtle,'' Mandelbaum said. `I often hear from men
on Wall Street, or from lawyers, who say their bosses have hinted
that they wouldn't get promoted if they took an extended leave for
nurturing purposes.`
</P>
<P>
   Paula Rayman, director of the Radcliffe Public Policy Center,
which studies workplace issues, says a Harvard professor recently
confided that his boss told him he would never get tenure if he
took time out from work to care for a new baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies like to put on a family-friendly front,'' Rayman
said, ``but behind the scenes, managers are sending out a totally
different message.''
</P>
<P>
   In researching her book, Braun Levine says she interviewed a
human-resources manager for a major company who said he advised
male colleagues to take a combination of sick leave and vacation
time to avoid having the words ``parental leave'' emblazoned in
their employee records. ``He seemed to feel that taking paternity
leave would be a strike against you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at some companies where parental leave is encouraged,
human-resources managers say they see few male takers. ``Very few
men here take more than a week off for the birth of a baby, and
usually, they just use vacation time,'' said Donna Klein, a vice
president at Marriott International in Bethesda, Md. ``If you're a
man, there's still somewhat of a stigma attached to taking
paternity leave per se.''
</P>
<P>
   The only companies that see larger numbers of men taking
parental leave are the ones that offer paid leave _ and even there,
senior executives have to set an example first, according to
workplace experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference if you've got a manager to lead the
way,'' said Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president for research and
information services for Catalyst, a New York-based research group
that studies women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Such a manager may have made the difference for Joseph J.
Kelleher, an associate at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, a
Manhattan law firm that offers both male and female employees a
full month of paid leave after the birth of a child. Kelleher took
advantage of the firm's policy after both of his daughters, now 3
and 5, were born. ``I didn't feel funny about it, mainly because
there are several folks here who have children and have done the
same thing,'' Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Christine Wagner, director of legal personnel for
the firm, more than 80 percent of eligible men have taken advantage
of the policy since its inception in 1993, including several
partners. But Wagner knows her firm is in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of firms offer some kind of leave policy, but their
managers don't walk the talk,'' she said. ``Here, our male partners
did _ and it's really opened the floodgates.''

AN ITALIAN RED BUILDS MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ISAAC ASIMOV    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Valpolicella, the light-bodied red wine made in
northeastern Italy, is blessed with a name that easily rolls off
the tongue. All too often, though, the wine fell flat, to the point
where the word Valpolicella no longer signified a supple,
inexpensive, easy-to-enjoy wine but became synonymous with thin,
mass-produced wine of little character.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find those insipid Valpolicellas in wine shops,
but in the last two decades, small winemakers in the region have
taken great strides toward rehabilitating the Valpolicella name,
producing fruity wines that range from lightly likable to elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Valpolicellas are blends, primarily of three grapes unfamiliar
to Americans: rondinella, molinara and corvina. By law, wines made
on a wide swath of land in the Veneto region, including terraced
hillsides and large flat expanses, are permitted to be called
Valpolicella, but the best wines generally come from the hillside
vineyards in the oldest part of the Valpolicella zone and are
labeled ``classico.'' Those wines called superiore are aged for at
least a year and usually have a slightly higher alcohol level.
</P>
<P>
   Valpolicella's big appeal continues to be its light-bodied
friendliness, which makes it a perfect summer red, served a tad
chilled with anything from burgers to fish to pizza. Good examples
of these fragrant wines can be found for $10 to $15 from producers
like Masi and Allegrini.
</P>
<P>
   Even more exciting are Valpolicellas that have reached new
levels of richness (and price) and muscularity but are not
overbearing. Giuseppe Quintarelli continues to turn out
idiosyncratic wines that are aged at least six years before they
are bottled. Quintarelli's son-in-law, Celentino Gaspari, seems to
be poised to carry on the family tradition, having made the
excellent Valpolicella Superiore 1996 for Marion. &QL;

HOW TO HELP YOUR CHILD COPE WITH THE `MONSTER' LURKING UNDER THE
BED
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by NIGHTMARES-INFO BOX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keisha Culp knows the fear all too well. While watching
television one night last December, she was startled by her
3-year-old daughter's screams and cries. Moving frantically through
the halls, the Royse City, Texas, mother finally reached her
daughter Briana's room and found her tossing and turning in bed,
yelling the name of her 3-year-old cousin.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shook her and finally woke her up,'' Culp says. ``She was
trying to tell me what he was doing (in the dream), but I didn't
understand what she was saying. I think he was chasing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares and children are like peanut butter and jelly; you
can't have one without the other. According to Bruce A. Epstein, a
pediatrician in St. Petersburg, Fla., 70 percent of children suffer
from nightmares, and they are most common between the ages of 3 and
6.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is a nightmare, and how should parents handle
them? Simply defined, a nightmare is a scary dream that frightens
and usually wakes us. Nightmares occur during the rapid eye
movement (R.E.M.) cycle of sleep, the point in which we dream. Like
dreams, nightmares tend to correspond to personal distress. They
may manifest as a real representation of a troubling issue, or as a
symbol. Generally, nightmares are a combination of both, helping a
child to work out issues that carry over from his waking hours.
</P>
<P>
   While most children's nightmares are nothing to lose sleep over,
Ferber says that after age 5 or 6, recurring nightmares could
signal a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of his age, if your child's nightmares continue to
be frequent and persist for more than one or two months, and if you
can't identify and help him resolve the stress he is feeling, then
you should seek professional help,'' he says. ``This is especially
true if your child also has unreasonable fears during the
daytime.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``unreasonable fears'' might include an unwillingness to
separate from you, refusal to be in his bedroom alone, reluctance
to go to school and other phobias.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, including Richard Ferber, M.D., author of ``Solve Your
Child's Sleep Problems,'' also advise parents to determine whether
their child is suffering from nightmares or night terrors, a
hereditary sleep disorder.
</P>
<P>
   For children suffering from the more garden-variety sort of bad
dreams, getting nightmares to go away is relatively simple _ but
involves some time.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Mona Satterfield of Denton, Texas, has been awakened in
the middle of the night by her 5-year-old son, Luke, plenty of
times. ``I let Luke get in bed with us because it makes him feel
safe and, once he's asleep, I'll take him back upstairs,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists say that comforting should be just the first
step. In his book ``Dreamcatching: Every Parent's Guide to
Exploring and Understanding Children's Dreams and Nightmares''
(Three Rivers Press, 1998, $14.95), Dr. Alan Siegel explains his
remedy for recurring nightmares. It consists of what he calls the
four R's: reassurance, rescripting, rehearsal and resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Reassurance is the most important of the four. It calls for
comforting your child after he wakes up from a nightmare. You'll
want to hold him and calm him until he is able to give you, if he's
old enough, the details of his scary encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetically, that breaks the spell of the nightmare,'' says
Siegel, assistant clinical professor at the University of
California at Berkeley's school of professional psychology. ``From
there, you use more playful, artistic, creative approaches to kind
of play with the dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the rescripting phase. This involves creating a new ending
for the nightmare. It can also involve writing a happy ending or
drawing one.
</P>
<P>
   ``For younger kids up through elementary-school age, drawing the
dream is very helpful because dreams are an incredible source of
creativity,'' says Siegel, who is also president of the Association
for the Study of Dreams. ``When you draw the dream, it breaks the
spell, because you see it from a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another suggested part of rescription is the use of magical
tools, says Siegel. For younger kids, helping them create an
arsenal of magical weapons gives them a feeling of power. The tools
can be anything from a magic wand to a superhero who saves the day
at just the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel cautions against the use of violence in rescripting. He
cites Ann Sayre Wismen, author of ``Nightmare Help'' (Ten Speed
Press, 1990, $9.95), who says that suggesting the murder of a dream
foe may also encourage violent solutions to life problems.
</P>
<P>
   He also warns against simply inventing a new ending to the dream
without discovering the underlying problem that caused the dream.
This is where the last two R's, rehearsal and resolution, come in.
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsal involves putting rescripting to the test. Your child
needs to review his new, happy ending and practice using his
magical tools until he feels completely competent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stage parallels the stage of psychotherapy called
`working through,' where for adults, the insights they have gained
need to be put to the test _ at first in the relationship with
their therapist, and gradually by practicing new forms of relating
with others and experiencing themselves in new ways,'' Siegel says.
</P>
<P>
   In the last stage, resolution, parents work with their child to
discover the source of the nightmare. By combining the three
previous R's and deciphering the dream through exploration and
brainstorming, parents and children can feel confident in
overcoming emotional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel says the most important thing is never to dismiss your
child's nightmare fears. ``You don't want to say, `It's just a
dream,' because that dismisses a fundamental, very powerful
experience a child has had,'' he says. ``You also don't want to
say, `Let's just create a new ending and that's the end of it,'
because the problem that caused the dream may still be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents should look at recent changes in their child's life that
may be causing tension and distress, like a death in the family or
a new school. After listening to the child's description of the
dream, look at possible metaphors and symbolism and work with him
to create a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the nightmare tells the parents something that the
child may or may not understand,'' he said. ``It alerts the parents
to something that's distressing the child.''
</P>
<P>
   For Keisha Culp, 3-year-old Briana's nightmare alerted her to
the real daytime terror that her daughter was experiencing because
she was afraid of her cousin. While Briana was too young to
verbalize her feelings, the dream got an important message across
to her mother, who could then take steps to help Briana.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare, like most, was temporary and terrifying. But the
long-term effects of the bad dream would be good.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAY, England _ Brillat-Savarin admonished chefs 175 years ago
that ``certain things which you do without thinking, and only
because you have seen others do them, derive nonetheless from the
highest scientific principles.''
</P>
<P>
   He should have met Heston Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   An exuberant, crew-cut 33-year-old chef, Blumenthal runs the Fat
Duck, a restaurant in this idyllic village on the Thames, 35 miles
west of London, where science joins art in the endless search for
better flavor. He has allied himself with Peter Barham, a
49-year-old physicist at the University of Bristol, with remarkable
results. In only a few years, the Duck has waddled to the top of
several lists of England's best restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   As described on the menu, many of Blumenthal's dishes sound
preposterously complicated, just too rococo for words. Perfecting
the recipes has, in fact, required endless experimentation, and the
actual preparation is unusually exacting and exhausting. But what
finally emerges from Blumenthal's kitchen-cum-laboratory looks
beautiful and tastes perfectly balanced and integrated _ almost
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, what he calls ``cuttlefish cannelloni of duck
and maple syrup, parsley broth.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it, Blumenthal first cuts cuttlefish bodies into
rectangles and then freezes them, which, he told me, breaks down
molecules and makes them more tender. These are then cut into small
squares, which are filled with a stuffing of preserved duck, duck
ham, foie gras, cuttlefish and just a touch of maple syrup; rolled;
steamed slightly; and served on a soupy, spectacularly herbal and
intensely green puree of parsley. Wowee! Who would have thought
those disparate ingredients could unite in such flavor fireworks?
</P>
<P>
   The cuttlefish dish is typical of the Fat Duck's food in several
ways. It involves a scientific insight: the tenderizing effects of
freezing. It balances salty and sweet ingredients, as does
Blumenthal's bavarois of butternut squash with goat's milk ice
cream. It matches fish with meat, like his dishes of sweetbreads
with cockles and langoustine with pig's trotter.
</P>
<P>
   My wife Betsey and I ate our Easter dinner at the Fat Duck this
year, and in keeping with the season, Blumenthal suggested that we
order some lamb as a main course. As it turned out, we were the
designated guinea pigs for one of his latest experiments, an
innovative way of cooking lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, ``doneness'' in meat, the point at which it ceases to
be raw, is related to temperature, and browning it first is an
almost universal technique. But Blumenthal wanted to see what would
happen if fillets cut from a lamb T-bone were cooked for 45 or 50
minutes over very low heat _ say, 80 to 85 degrees _ in a pan
barely slicked with oil, and turned every minute or two, so they
never ``seized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't sizzle or anything,'' he reported. ``It sat there
and soaked up the heat. It never got that shock that ties the
fibers up.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think it would make me give up my rosemary-scented
gigot, with its rich roasting juices, any more than ceviche made me
abandon garlic-scented scallops bathed in beurre blanc. I'm too
piggy for that.
</P>
<P>
   But this new technique was a revelation. The lamb had an
exquisite tenderness, and something of the texture of carpaccio. It
was incredibly moist. The rosy color was uniform right through,
with no pink center or crusty exterior. And to my surprise, the
absence of browning had in no way robbed the meat of flavor; we
felt as if we were tasting the very essence of lamb, with no
gaminess, a taste of fresh air and spring pastures.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no culinary shibboleth that Blumenthal will
not challenge, and no limit to his search for a better way.
Convinced that salting the water in which vegetables are cooked,
which has been standard procedure since the Stone Age, only
toughens them, he has stopped doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've experimented, with and without salt,'' he said. ``It
makes no visible difference. It certainly doesn't keep the beans
greener.''
</P>
<P>
   What does make a difference, Blumenthal found, is the quantity
of calcium in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Tap water in Bray is rich in calcium, which makes it good to
drink but bad for cooking, he said. Cooked with Evian, which has
little calcium, Blumenthal's beans stayed green; cooked in vodka,
which has none, they stayed greener. But simmering them in booze
was no better for beans than for humans, the chef said: ``One, it
costs too much, and two, the vodka tends to ignite.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be a water filtration system or, until that
can be installed, distilled water. But the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   So does the hunt for some way to keep dry white beans from
cracking when boiled _ a result, Blumenthal thinks, of a hardening
of the beans' skins by chemicals in the water. And so does the foie
gras inquiry. Blumenthal finds that cutting foie gras in different
directions affects its texture, but until now he has been unable to
discover why, even with the help of scientists at the Royal
Veterinary College.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they saw no difference when they looked at the stuff
under a microscope,'' the chef said. ``They thought I was quite
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of Barham, Blumenthal has finally succeeded in
making a sweet-sharp pineapple and chili jelly to serve with his
spice-cake ice cream _ no mean feat, since the enzymes in pineapple
fight the jelling agent, as almost every chef knows. Only a cook as
cerebral and as obsessive as this one would even try to attack such
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jellies have preoccupied the Barham-Blumenthal team of late,
partly because of their use by Ferran Adria at El Bulli, the
Michelin three-star restaurant in Catalonia. He and Michel Bras at
Laguiole in southwestern France, which also has three stars, are
two of Europe's most original chefs, both fervently admired by
Blumenthal. A jelly of mead, an old English fermented drink that is
made from honey, gave a big lift to a ballottine of foie gras and
smoked eel that was my favorite dish on a previous visit to the
Duck.
</P>
<P>
   A manic, energetic man whose interests spill over the boundaries
of his academic specialty, polymer physics, Barham has traveled
twice to Antarctica because, he confessed, ``my wife and I are
basically obsessed by penguins.'' You can hear that same wacky
passion as he tries to explain that jelly need not be limited to
what we put on our toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``there's no reason you couldn't take two
glasses of liquid, one containing a red, alkaline liquid, with the
juice of red cabbage and fruit pectin in it, and the other a clear
liquid, basically citric acid, and put them on the table. The guest
could pour them together and over a dish of ice cream. In a flash,
the liquid would turn blue and form a gel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All great fun. But of course Heston would have to figure out
some way to make it taste good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The two meet fairly regularly, either in Bristol, an hour or so
west of here by train or motorway, or at the restaurant. Some of
the things they talk about, like a Brie souffle or that jellied
blue sauce for ice cream, will probably never make their way onto
the Fat Duck's menu. But they also do specific research on things
like the feuillantine of crab that Blumenthal now uses in his
best-known appetizer, paired with marinated salmon, roasted foie
gras, crystallized seaweed and oyster vinaigrette _ another of
those dishes that sound a little like a woman wearing one too many
pieces of jewelry but astound almost everybody bold enough to order
them.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the success of the dish is the tuilelike texture of
the feuillantine, which is based on crab essence. The chef said he
wanted ``something like a brandy snap, thin and shiny and
crackling,'' but when he first made it, the feuillantine came out
too biscuity, and he couldn't figure out how to add crunch. He
tried increasing the oven temperature, reducing the moisture,
adding gelatin and fiddling with the pH factor, all to little
avail.
</P>
<P>
   What finally did the trick was maple syrup, again. Blumenthal
says it worked because it introduced a different kind of
carbohydrate to the equation. Barham says, ``I don't really
understand the science here.'' But the result tastes great and
crackles to a fare-thee-well.
</P>
<P>
   Barham takes part in a conference held every two years at Erice,
in western Sicily, where like-minded spirits gather to discuss
``The Molecular and Physical Aspects of Gastronomy.'' Among other
regular participants are Alan Davidson, the Oxford food scholar,
and Harold McGee, whose book ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner,
1984) helped set Blumenthal on his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get chefs to pose questions that we can answer,''
Barham said. ``Heston is the perfect chef from our point of view.
He has an open mind. He actually uses the research, whereas most
chefs pick up the bits that reinforce their preconceptions and just
ignore the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal fell in love with good cooking on a trip with his
parents to the south of France in 1975, when he was a mere
teen-ager. Like a thousand and one others, he found the food and
the setting magical at Raymond Thuilier's great restaurant, the
Baumaniere. Unlike most, he knew at once that he had found his
vocation. He worked at various restaurants in London and, for a
brief time, at the Manoir aux Quat'Saisons, near Oxford, where he
met a youngster named Marco Pierre White, who went on, as the
enfant terrible of London restaurateurs, to win three Michelin
stars. They remain good friends, one sunny, the other turbulent,
and White is the godfather of one of Blumenthal's children.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to start a restaurant in Bray took a lot of nerve. The
Fat Duck is just a few blocks from the Waterside Inn, the gilded
stage on which Michel Roux, a great French classicist, has for many
years done his three-star turn. At first, Blumenthal stuck with
simple things _ rillettes of salmon, steak frites, lemon tart _ but
what a tart, and what frites! Chubby little things, fried to crisp
perfection, stacked like Lincoln Logs. They still arrive with the
veal kidney roasted in its own fat.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Blumenthal turned to new twists on old dishes and to
more exotic ingredients, and the menu is full of them now, from
pollen to chlorophyll to piquillo peppers. He makes a bastilla of
pigeon but adds cherries and unsweetened Manjari chocolate, as if
it came from Mexico, not Morocco. With his fillet of venison he
serves a traditional sauce poivrade but also a potato gratin hyped
with snappy St.-Nectaire cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The service has grown more polished with the years, and now,
under Nigel Sutcliffe (the ``sort-of manager,'' Blumenthal calls
him), waiters can explain the most complex dishes quickly and
clearly. The wine list is full of grand names these days (including
scarce items like Harlan, Turley and Araujo cabernet sauvignons
from California), but also affordable bottles from Austria, Alsace,
Australia and Italy, including off-dry whites that go very well
with Blumenthal's food.
</P>
<P>
   I had planned to start our Easter celebration with a Condrieu,
pricey but promising, but the charming, laid-back wine waiter,
Gilles Manvieu, had a far better idea. He served us an
unprepossessing vin de pays _ same region, same grape (viognier) _
that cost half as much and drank better.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Duck itself has remained unchanged _ two plain
rooms, no tablecloths, stainless-steel cutlery, beamed ceilings,
wrought-iron tables and chairs, and a long, shiny copper bar. Too
plain, some say, for the prices. Dinner can easily run $85, without
wine or tip, although there is a far from meager three-course set
lunch for $37.50.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in decor are on the way, including, to my great regret,
the elimination of the bar to make room for a place for pre- and
post-dinner drinks. That was inevitable, I guess; although this
year's Good Food Guide ranks the Fat Duck among the top dozen
country restaurants in England, and one of its inspectors reported
that the three best meals that he ate in 1999 were all at the Duck,
Michelin still gives it only one lonely star. For larger
constellations, the red M demands a certain degree of luxury.

 &HT;    INVITING TOURISTS TO BORDER ``HUNTS'' FOR HUMANS IS NOTHING
NEW(a) 
 &HT;    (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS)(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tourists as soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of an anonymous appeal that surfaced last
month: Fun in the Arizona sun. The great outdoors. The chance to
help ranchers hunt illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the first time the idea of hunting humans for
sport has cropped up in Douglas, a border town known for mining,
ranching - and now, illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, a similar proposal to tourists was pitched in
this same corner of Arizona. But rather than Mexicans, it was
Apache Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Fimbres Apache Expedition is not only a
reminder of the long-standing racial hostilities along the
Arizona-Mexico border, but it's also a tragic lesson about
vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1930 and Douglas, the hub of the nation's copper-smelting
industry, was in an economic slump. The Great Depression was
underway and all the economic indicators pointed downward.
</P>
<P>
   The town's merchants, however, were pioneering people. If
ranching was slow and copper mining on the wane, they would find
some other way to generate money.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any kind. A.C. Karger, then mayor of Douglas, and
the shrewd chiefs of the local Chamber of Commerce were going to
sell a special brand of tourism, one that capitalized on every
attribute Douglas had to offer: a magnificent railroad station,
excellent rail connections, a world-class hotel, a warm, dry
climate with blue skies and breathtaking scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And the chance to kill Apaches, although that was never overtly
stated in the fliers and newspaper ads promoting the expedition
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the expedition was the attempted rescue of
a 7-year-old boy who had been kidnapped by a band of Apaches three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the underlying message was not lost on the outpouring of
men who wrote letters hoping to join the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never fought Indians, but I have chased Spics all
around Haiti and Nicaragua,'' wrote one adventure-seeker. ``I guess
I'll have the guts to chase these birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled all over the globe. I have seen a bit of life
and have fought men of all colors, so I would like to become a
member of your expedition, for I love action,'' wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition stemmed from years of hostilities
between a Mexican rancher named Francisco Fimbres and a band of
Apaches based in the rugged Sierra Madres.
</P>
<P>
   Although warfare between the Indians and the United States
officially ended with Geronimo's surrender on Sept. 6, 1886,
hostilities with his band of Apaches - the Bronco group of the
Chiricahua - continued on both sides of the Mexican border for
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities exploded into open warfare on Oct. 26, 1926 when
the Apaches ambushed Fimbres and his family. The Apaches killed
Fimbres' wife and kidnapped his son, Geraldo. The Apaches were
seeking revenge for an earlier kidnapping of Geronimo's
great-granddaughter by Fimbres.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition captured nationwide attention, but
in the end the expedition never got off the ground. Officials on
both sides of the border realized the idea of armed gringos roaming
around in Mexico could spell disaster and they quashed the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Fimbres. When he learned help from the gringos
was not coming, he reverted to his old tactics. With the help of
vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) and expatriate American mercenaries,
Fimbres hunted down the Apaches himself. A March 13, 1931, photo
captured Fimbres with the scalps of three Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Fimbres finally found his son in an Apache
camp, hanging from a tree. In revenge for the three Apaches killed
earlier by Fimbres and his men, the Apaches had swung the boy by
his heels and smashed his skull against an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres and his men retaliated yet again, until the last of the
Apaches were hunted down and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition was chronicled in a 1993 book,
``They Never Surrendered: Bronco Apaches of the Sierra Madres,
1890-1935,'' by Texas author Douglas Meed.
</P>
<P>
   Meed sees a parallel between the Fimbres expedition and a
``Neighborhood Ranch Watch'' flier distributed in April that hoped
to convert tourists into soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there, because what you are doing is
asking people to come down and hunt people as sport,'' Meed said.
``The difference is that the ranchers are trying to protect their
land rather than make money off this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meed also thinks the most recent episode could spark a new round
of violence along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix writer John Alba came across accounts of the Fimbres
Apache Expedition while researching a novel set during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a link between the two calls for vigilantism along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there as to how some Anglo people view
dark-skinned people as less than human,'' Alba said. ``At that
time, in the 1930s, it was the Apaches who were viewed as animals
to be hunted down and exterminated. Now it's common to hear in
various places along the border these expressions that the illegals
are a plague, a vermin, an invasion that has to be stopped.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat and humidity will spread from the southern and central
Plains into the interior East on Wednesday and Thursday. Strong
high pressure extending to 30,000 feet over the Tennessee Valley
will support the summery weather by suppressing clouds over most of
the Mississippi Valley and Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Fast jet stream winds will propel a series of disturbances from
the northern Rockies to the Great Lakes states, resulting in
widespread inclement weather. Cold rain will fall in Montana as
moist low-level winds ascend the sloping terrain. Farther east,
showers and some strong thunderstorms will streak along a wavering
front from the northern Plains to the central and southern Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will turn milder than recent days. Onshore breezes
from southern New England to the Carolinas will keep coastal areas
several degrees cooler than the interior.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DERECHO
</P>
<P>
   Violent wind gusts of more than 90 mph tore across western
Nebraska on Monday afternoon. The winds resulted from a cluster of
thunderstorms that produced what meteorologists call a derecho. The
word ``derecho'' comes from the Spanish for ``straight ahead.''
Powerful straight-line wind gusts, not the twisting currents of
tornadoes, are the derecho's primary arsenal for damage. The
turbulent gusts develop as downdrafts within the thunderstorms
accelerate rapidly toward earth, spreading out in a destructive
barrage upon reaching the ground.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush, on the military
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush accused the Clinton administration today of
leaving the military unprepared and low in morale, saying the
performance ``cries out for a new sign on the Pentagon that says
`Under new management.' '' Bush, speaking in Denver at the nation's
oldest Veterans of Foreign Wars post, said the Democrats have
presided over a military in which some units are no longer at the
highest state of combat readiness, recruitment has fallen short,
and thousands of soldiers are on food stamps. He promised to honor
veterans by assuring the military is prepared.
</P>
<P>
   GORE, ON THE ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   Receiving the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters
today, Al Gore vowed in Wisconsin to protect the environment while
maintaining economic growth. He said he'd stand firm against any
rollbacks of federal protections for clean air and water, promised
to clean up air pollution from the dirtiest power plants, called
for protecting pristine roadless areas in national forests, and
restated his opposition to oil drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO'S OFFICIAL NOW
</P>
<P>
   About 400 New York Republicans gathered in Buffalo today to
nominate Rick Lazio to take over the battle to keep Hillary Clinton
out of the Senate. Rudy Giuliani's withdrawal from the race less
than two weeks ago to deal with prostate cancer opened the door for
the four-term congressman from Long Island. His candidacy was
quickly supported by Gov. George Pataki and other Republican
leaders. The open Senate seat belongs to Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   THE FALL AND RISE OF RICK LAZIO
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio tripped and fell face down onto the pavement at a
Memorial Day parade in Babylon, N.Y., splitting his lip. But the
eager Senate candidate dusted himself off and finished the route
before going to the hospital, getting eight stitches and then
marching in a second parade, in Queens County, alongside the man he
replaced in the race, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   SEND OUT FOR THE POPSICLES
</P>
<P>
   It was a Norman Rockwell scene for Hillary Clinton. She
surprised her new hometown by marching in Chappaqua, N.Y.'s
Memorial Day parade and then lingering to chat with her neighbors
and pose for pictures. Despite a few hecklers, she delighted the
crowd as she marched holding hands with two Scouts. ``Years ago, I
was a Brownie and a Girl Scout,'' Clinton told the girls. ``When we
marched, we used to end up in the park and get Popsicles at the end
of the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOTISM OVER POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   As presidential politics took a back seat to patriotism on
Memorial Day, Al Gore, in Elizabeth, Pa., recalled his Army tour in
Vietnam with nostalgia and some humility while George W. Bush
looked ahead to the future without mentioning his own military
service. ``I know that my service doesn't in any way match that of
the heroes that we honor on this day,'' Gore said. Bush stayed
closer to home, telling people in Killeen, Texas, next to Fort
Hood, that veterans' sacrifices must be honored always.
</P>
<P>
   THAT PART OF THE STRAIGHT TALK?
</P>
<P>
   John McCain made ending big political donations a centerpiece of
his White House bid. But now he's campaigning for several
Republicans who oppose his plan and trying to defeat Democrats who
support it. Eight of the 17 congressional candidates McCain has
endorsed or campaigned for do not support his legislation to end
``soft money'' donations. Two of them, Reps. Clay Shaw of Florida
and Jim Rogan of California, actually voted against the House
version of his bill. On the other hand, 16 of 17 Democrats in those
races support McCain's position on a soft money ban.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAME DANFORTH COMES FORTH
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine reported over the weekend that ex-Sen. John
Danforth of Missouri figures heavily in George W. Bush's
calculations about whom to tap for the Republican vice presidential
nomination. At least on paper, Danforth, a 63-year-old ordained
Episcopal priest, fits several of Bush's needs: He's firmly opposed
to abortion, but more moderate on the rest of his politics.
Danforth came to national prominence with his all-out defense of
Clarence Thomas during the Supreme Court nomination fight in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   UNPIERCED AT ANY SPEED
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader's anti-corporate, pro-environment message, coupled
with his consumer credentials, is fusing audiences of blue-collar
workers and young people into a ``blue-green'' alliance. At a
recent rally on Boston Common to protest controversial state
educational testing, Nader elicited lusty cheers from young people.
Surrounded by teenagers after his speech, the 66-year-old consumer
activist studied a body-pierced, leather-attired young woman with
pink hair. ``I hope,'' he said, ``the dye was at least organic.''
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICAN IN-FIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   The longest-serving woman in Congress is battling a state
lawmaker who claims she's too liberal. Rep. Marge Roukema of New
Jersey is being challenged again in the state's Republican primary
by state Assemblyman Scott Garrett, 40, who came within 1,700 votes
of defeating her in 1998. If Roukema, 70, first elected in 1980,
keeps her seat, she could become the first woman to head a major
House committee: the House Banking Committee if the GOP retains
control of the House. The winner of the Roukema-Garrett contest on
June 6 will be favored against Democrat Linda Mercurio.
</P>
<P>
   IF TEXAS IS ANY INDICATION _
</P>
<P>
   Even as George W. Bush moves ahead in opinion polls with health
care one of his big campaign issues, the large number of Texans
without health insurance is emerging as an issue that could become
a political liability for him. Texas ranks No. 1 in the nation in
terms of the percentage of its population _ 24.5 percent, or nearly
5 million people _ lacking health insurance. With 1.4 million
children uninsured _ one out of every four _ the state is at the
bottom of the heap nationally, second only to Arizona.

`BODIES IN MOTION AND AT REST': A POET OF REALITY PRIES OPEN THE
LID 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funerals and poetry are very similar, says Thomas Lynch,
possibly the only person on the planet who combines the two,
vocationally speaking. ``Whenever funeral directors get together
they talk about the fact that no one likes funerals,'' Lynch writes
in ``Bodies in Motion and at Rest,'' his richly idiosyncratic new
book of essays. ``Whenever poets get together they talk about the
fact that no one likes poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to say that Lynch likes both funerals and poetry and
that he is good at both. His first book of essays, ``The
Undertaking: Life Studies From the Dismal Trade,'' introduced this
unusual writer to a public mostly unaware of the lyrical reflection
that can be involved in the necessary and wholesome task of burying
your fellow citizens. Lynch extends some of the themes that he
introduced in that book, adding, for example, that ``good poems and
good funerals are stories well told.'' In so doing he demonstrates
once again his quizzical, gently cantankerous, free-minded Yeatsean
charm. As he comments on the big and the small things of life Lynch
engages the reader with a mixture of poetic and funerary elements,
of ephemera and durables both.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book Lynch fills in some painful personal detail that
was missing from the first, like the battle with alcoholism he
fought for many years, a wrenching divorce, and the mostly
pleasurable tribulations he experienced in raising four children
largely by himself. ``Bodies in Motion and at Rest'' is less
thematically focused than ``The Undertaking'' and it is angrier in
places, as if Lynch has now decided to relax his hold on avuncular
bemusement and confide to us his private agony. His description of
alcoholism and the alcoholism of one of his sons makes for some
searing and powerfully affecting passages. But those of Lynch's
readers who are hoping for some striking new departures, some
entirely new themes, will not find them in this book. They will
find the pungent compassion, the unabashed lyricism and the
homespun repudiation of vanity and banality that bathed Lynch's
earlier writings in their considerable glow.
</P>
<P>
   The essays here are on a considerable variety of subjects, many
of them prompted by some item in the news, which leads Lynch to a
recollection of bygone days or to some meditation on what he sees
as the spiritual flatness of the end of the millennium. (The essays
were all written before the year 2000). In one of the longer
sections of a book of generally brief and pithy chapters, for
example, Lynch uses his hatred of a particular house cat to bring
him into a reminiscence of the collapse of his first marriage.
There, he freely reveals the fury and hurt that he experienced _ he
describes a poem he wrote about the experience as ``venom done up
as carefully off-rhymed birthday greetings.'' But as with all these
essays, there is a moral foundation, a probing for some lesson
about the essential condition of things, in this case the
uselessness of pretending that divorce does not harm children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most divorces are difficult choices in a world that applauds
the exercise of choice, even the bad ones,'' Lynch writes. ``And to
have good reasons for divorce _ as I did, as my former spouse
would, no doubt, say she did, as we always do _ does not make
divorcing good. It is the children who pay, for the two sets of
parents and households, holidays and disciplines. However equal and
amicable they might be, they are always separate, covertly at odds,
subtly competing, quietly instructing in the separate and
subversive dialects of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch discourses, often with a kind of sulfuric humor, on the
possibility that human life spans might soon be doubled by science;
on the similarities, as he sees it, of coffins and condoms; on
writer's block; on abortion; and on the contemporary value placed
on having choices, options, endless possibilities. But an
underlying philosophy is not difficult to detect. Lynch is an
eloquent but old-fashioned moralist. He has a capacious
understanding of human foibles and great tolerance for them. But he
knows that it is easy to be distracted from the verities _ by
rampant materialism, by fake piety, by all the cant that can be
produced in an age of electronic reproduction. That our humanity
can be diluted as a consequence is Lynch's underlying message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the networks offer us,'' he declares at one point, ``is
the therapy of spectacle, excess and sedation _ our humanity dulled
by megadoses, like too much pornography dulls real sex, too much
volume eventually deafens, and too much information dulls the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm not sure about the phrase about information. It
seems to me that we suffer not from too much information but from
not enough. One can argue with Lynch as he rambles eloquently and
judgmentally through his life and ours. But it is impossible not to
take him seriously, since he is deeply thoughtful and his thoughts
have been hammered out on the anvil of experience. It is also
impossible not to like him, because his voice is rich and generous.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR is usually considered a company of metal and
machines, not Cheddar Mac Salad and Petite Apple Tarts. Local
historian Curt Dalton has put together a book that probably won't
change that, but Delicious Recipes and Food for Thought goes far to
shed light on the character of John H. Patterson, NCR's founder, a
socially conscious businessman whose activism found outlets in some
unusual but effective ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton is a historian and assistant archivist at the Montgomery
County Historical Society with several publications under his belt:
Breweries of Dayton, Greater Dayton Drive-In Theatres and When
Dayton Went to the Movies, to name three.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary job right now is going through the 1.5 million
negatives from the NCR Archives,'' Dalton said. ``Whenever
(Patterson) sold a cash register, he took a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Those images offer a wealth of information about Dayton:
Patterson kept detailed records about the pictures, making a
relatively easy job for folks such as Dalton. Dalton's interest was
piqued by several pictures of beautiful dining rooms and kitchens.
A little digging revealed that Patterson, in an effort to improve
the working conditions for the women at NCR, began a lunch program
of hot soup and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   That program soon grew into a full-fledged daily
company-sponsored hot luncheon, with the first women's dining room
opened in 1896 on the fourth floor of Building No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Patterson) had seen that the women who worked for him seemed
to get ill often,'' Dalton said, ``and he attributed it partially
to food, diet and the conditions they lived in. He noticed the hot
lunches helped curb the illnesses, and the women came to work more
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's insistence on keeping records of nearly everything
he did made it easy for Dalton to piece together the story of the
NCR dining rooms and the food served there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept a copy of everything they printed, so all the books
and pamphlets were available. He put out a lot of books _ one, from
1913, was called Human Efficiency Hints for Busy People.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1890s he began a publication for his workers. It
would include recipes and things going on in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton pulled the recipes for his new book from this publication
_ all the photos and text were taken from NCR publications spanning
100 years. They offer an insight to the times, such as the cook's
comment prefacing the He-Man Beef Stew: ``If `your man' is looking
for some recipes to try his hand, turn him loose with the
following.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some really fattening recipes _ some, like the Ham
Toastwich, call for a quarter-cup of butter, eggs, shortening ...''
Dalton said. ``But there are some health-conscious ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things people are buying it for is the
not-so-secret secret recipe for coconut macaroons that NCR has
served since 1903,'' he added. ``People have told me they'd lost
the recipe. That's the most popular recipe in there. I've made
them, and they're pretty darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   Delicious Recipes &AMP; Food for Thought also offers a tantalizing
preview of what the NCR Archives will offer to the public when it
opens next spring.

 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Air Force 1st Lt. Grady L. Hinson was attacking a
railroad tunnel May 16, 1953, when a wing on his F-84 Thunderjet
sheared off under intense ground fire, causing the craft to explode
and spin into the earth east of Pyongyang, North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Hinson didn't bail out.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow pilots heard nothing but static on their radios as they
called for him. They circled the wreckage, but they never saw him
again.
</P>
<P>
   Days later in Little Rock, Ark., World War I veteran Bedford
Grady Hinson and his wife, Virginia Louise, recoiled in shock as
they got word of their son's apparent death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was on sick leave at the time from his job and he never
went back to work,'' recalled Hinson's sister, Mary Burrow of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He retired immediately. We called him (Grady) Bud, and he had
sent Dad a (bamboo) fishing pole. And his response was, `He sent
this to me and I'm going to use it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Hinson was listed as killed in action by an Air Force
casualty report. But his body was never found, and the elder
Hinsons went to their graves without ever having said goodbye to
their only son.
</P>
<P>
   For them the world stopped the moment Hinson vanished from the
radar screen. But Burrow, 74, may yet find closure _ thanks to
science, a Pentagon program and a thawing of relations between the
United States and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel
Office has fielded teams in Korea and Vietnam to find the remains
of more than 10,400 troops listed as unaccounted for _ those killed
in action in those countries and other Cold War clashes but never
found.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a $12 million annual budget, the Washington-based
office actively negotiates with the governments of Vietnam and
North Korea to gain access to excavation sites and state records
and to meet witnesses. Over the past decade the office has
coordinated the efforts of 500 Defense Department military and
civilian workers worldwide who have searched for the remains of
troops killed in action since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A staggering 88,000 American soldiers, sailors, airmen and
Marines are now classified as missing in action and presumed dead.
More than 78,000 of those troops were lost in World War II, said
Larry Greer, a spokesman for the POW/Missing Personnel Office.
</P>
<P>
   Each service has offices that help search for lost soldiers and
continue contact with their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At Randolph Air Force Base near New Braunfels, Texas., the Air
Force Personnel Center's Personnel Accountability Directorate
tracks 1,651 airmen lost in the Korean War, Vietnam War and Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   It works with forensic anthropologists in the field, a Honolulu
lab that identifies remains, a Brooks AFB life sciences office here
that evaluates such items as ejection seats found at crash scenes
and a DNA laboratory in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has been slow on the Korean peninsula, where tensions
remain high 47 years after a shaky armistice brought an end to the
war but no official peace.
</P>
<P>
   So far the remains of five Air Force veterans of the Korean War
who had been listed as unaccounted for have been recovered and
returned to the United States for burial, while 324 of 674 airmen
killed in Southeast Asia have come home. Four of 57 airmen lost in
Cold War incidents, most of them reconnaissance missions behind the
Iron Curtain, also have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is the enemy, physics is the enemy,'' Greer said. ``And
there's another factor in the Vietnam cases: Most of the ones that
we are searching for now (were involved in) high-speed jet crashes.
Oftentimes the skeletal fragments have been eroded so badly or are
nonexistent due to erosion that sometimes it makes identification
extremely difficult to confirm. Time is the enemy in the case of
Korea because family lineage is often gone, and that's important
for DNA testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Randolph directorate's missing persons branch chief, Jim
Russell, concurred, noting that 50 years after the war's start on
June 25, 1950, ``it would be difficult from an investigatory
standpoint to try to find people who are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   That difficulty has been compounded by seesaw relations between
Washington and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung agreed in 1994 to the joint
recovery of remains, a major breakthrough. But his government also
demanded $4 million for 162 sets of remains returned in 1993-94.
The United States refused, but it later agreed to pay North Korean
workers involved with recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1996, the Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii
has led 12 recovery operations in North Korea that have turned up
42 sets of remains. While strained relations have been a hallmark
of relations between the United States and North Korea, slowing
progress, Greer said the communist government of Kim Jong Il has
agreed to resume negotiations early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a cooperative North Korea, some cases, among them the
losses of Capt. James Arch Foulks Jr., may well defy any simple
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Foulks guided a B-29 Superfortress badly damaged by fighter and
ground fire toward the coast after a daylight bombing mission over
an enemy base on the Yalu River.
</P>
<P>
   Then he gave the order to bail out.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 13-member crew apparently escaped the crippled
bomber, six of the men were never seen again, perhaps lost at sea,
taken alive by the enemy or falling into the hands of fishermen or
villagers. A gunner whom Foulks found frozen with fear in his
turret bailed out and was rescued by a British destroyer. Another
man was killed, and five others were taken prisoner. Foulks, 30,
was the last to bail out that day in October 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, but I've gotten over that sad feeling,'' said his
widow, Alma Fields, 79, of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral isn't likely so many years after the death of her
husband, who trained in the B-29 at Randolph AFB. But Fields, who
later married a Houston neurologist, believes there is still hope.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago Air Force officials went to the home of one of Foulks'
sisters and took a DNA sample.
</P>
<P>
   If a future search team finds remains of American airmen in the
area, the case may be resolved by the Hawaii lab, using tests
conducted by the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in
Maryland. The Hawaii lab matches samples taken from the maternal
bloodline of soldiers with the mitochondrial DNA taken from the
remains. Such DNA is found in teeth and bone, typically the only
remains that are recovered by U.S. teams.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, blood samples have been taken from 2,000 family
members of the 8,100-plus who served in the Korean War and are
unaccounted for, Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has obtained DNA samples from 48 percent of the
920 airmen who remain unaccounted for in Korea, said Col. Roger
Corbin, who heads the Personnel Accountability Directorate. It's
also in the second year of a six-year contract with an El Paso firm
to put more than 5 million Air Force documents about the 1,651
airmen still unaccounted for into a database.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Reserve Col. Ronald Tipton, one of three
contract workers at Randolph scanning in the documents, envisions
the day when relatives of the airmen can log onto the Internet,
punch in a secret code and get access to official service records.
That, he said, will reduce the demand for copies that must now be
mailed.

&HT;     EX-FEDERAL DRUG ENFORCEMENT CHIEF EXPECTED TO GET NORTHERN
IRELAND POLICE JOB
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARV CERMAK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Thomas Constantine, who retired last year as
head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to spend more time
with his family, apparently will resume his police career.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Police Federation is expected to announce
soon that Constantine, 60, will be appointed oversight commissioner
for the province's new police service, sources said. They confirmed
that Constantine has agreed to serve in the position for three
years, but he will not be involved in day-to-day police operations.
Rather than being headquartered in Northern Ireland, he will be
going there a frequent basis.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, sources said, Constantine has been back and
forth to Ireland to discuss the new assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The London Times reported that Constantine, ``an Irish-American
Catholic,'' will be supervising the transition of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary to the new police service of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the report last Friday night, Constantine, a former
State Police superintendent who lives in Schenectady, said: ``I'm
not at liberty to comment on issues related to Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Burnside, a spokesman for the Northern Ireland Police
Federation, said his members were encouraged by Constantine's depth
of experience with the DEA and the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to working with such a qualified
candidate,'' Burnside told the London Times. ``It does not matter
at all to us whether he is a Catholic or a Protestant. What is far
more important is the policing experience he brings with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine was appointed a professor at the University at
Albany and has been operating a private law enforcement consulting
firm since his retirement from the DEA last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in further full-time work and endless hours
on a job, but I want to return to Schenectady where my roots are so
I can spend time at home and with my family,'' Constantine told the
Albany Times Union a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, a native of Buffalo, moved to Schenectady in 1970.
He and his wife, Ruth Ann, have six children, including Sgt. Thomas
Constantine of the Niskayuna, N.Y., Police Department and Kevin
Constantine, an FBI agent in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine was head of the DEA for five years. Prior to that he
was a member of the Erie County Sheriff's Department for two years
and put in 30 years with the State Police. He rose through the
ranks from uniformed trooper to superintendent, a position he held
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   James McMahon, who succeeded Constantine as superintendent, said
he has the background, integrity and commitment to make a
difference in the Ireland situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, Constantine declined an offer from
Schenectady Democratic Party officials to run for mayor against
Republican Albert Jurczynski.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired from the DEA, he also declined an offer from
Jurczynski to become the city's public safety commissioner.
Jurczynski said he was prepared to create the position as head of
the city police and fire departments for Constantine.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said when he retired he turned down full-time job
offers in New York City and Washington, D.C.

ETHIOPIA SAYS IT WILL WITHDRAW FROM RECENTLY CAPTURED TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGALI, Eritrea _ Even as artillery shells plopped into dusty
fields here Tuesday, Ethiopia took a big step toward ending the war
with its neighbor Eritrea by saying it would withdraw troops from
territory it has captured in western Eritrea over the last 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia made the announcement as peace talks, aimed at ending
the two-year-long war between the nations, opened Tuesday in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department weighed in on the conflict Tuesday,
saying it had verified that Eritrea had also pulled back from
territory that Ethiopia claims as its own. ``We have confirmed that
Eritrea has done so,'' the State Department said in a statement
issued in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare situation since the conflict began, each nation has
now made what appears to be a public concession to the other. And
while there is no guarantee the war will be over soon, it would be
far harder to end without the announced withdrawal of troops on
each side.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bitterness and distrust that has characterized this
war, which began as a border dispute in May 1998, was on full
display Tuesday. The Eritrean government denied that Ethiopia had
pulled back its troops from areas it has captured in the west since
it began a major, and largely successful, offensive on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Yemane Ghebremeskel, a spokesman for the Eritrean government,
said the Ethiopians had in fact taken another Eritrean town,
Teseney, near the border with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange way of withdrawing,'' Ghebremeskel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Selome Taddesse, an Ethiopian spokeswoman, insisted that the
withdrawal was real, although she denied that it was a gesture
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we have said all along,'' Taddesse said, denying
also that Ethiopians had captured any new towns. ``The only reason
we were in Eritrea was toward our main objective, and that is to
regain our territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The land Ethiopia said it has left was captured only since the
offensive began this month, reaching north from the Eritrean border
to the town of Barentu.
</P>
<P>
   The land that Eritrea says it has now abandoned was taken in
1998, when border skirmishes between the two countries became full
warfare that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in sporadic
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia only in 1993, and
many of the problems have stemmed from the fact that the nations'
620-mile border was never officially marked. What is still
unsettled is the territory here along the central front, about 60
miles south of the Eritrean capital, Asmara, and the main target of
the Ethiopian offensive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ethiopia has pushed its way into Eritrean territory, it says,
only as a temporary strategic position. Both sides have reported
major battles in the last week, though the fighting has been less

   Eritrean soldiers hidden in crevices along the mountains here
Tuesday watched as shells landed from the Ethiopian front, near the
town of Senafe, and blasted out from positions here.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia says it pushed the Eritreans back by military force,
though the Eritreans here say they have moved rearward waiting for
a good place to fight. Whether the war goes on, even as their
leaders discuss peace, is ``their choice,'' said Col. Habtu
Gebrendras, a local commander.

don't withdraw from our country we will continue to defend it and
return our territories to ourselves.''

 &HT;    Tech visa debate raises number of workplace issues
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the pell mell push to pass pending legislation to enlarge the
supply of visas for technical workers, many experts believe that
there is an urgent side issue.
</P>
<P>
   That is the need to protect the employees _ both Americans
subject to being replaced by overseas talent, as well as the
foreign workers lured here for new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong view among many technology specialists that
the need for more foreign workers is exaggerated. Others think the
campaign for more technology workers is nothing more or less than a
quest for cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   But many respected sources, ranging from science policy-makers
to the Labor Department, hold that we cannot fill the need for
technology talent domestically, and have no choice but to recruit
overseas talent _ at least for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   One study, funded by the National Science Foundation and the
Computing Research Association, found that the shortage exists, and
published a paper found at the following Web site:
www.cra.org/reports/wits
</P>
<P>
   /execsummary.html
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the authors make the point that the term
``technology workers'' is too vague, and that any examination of
the talent supply needs to differentiate information technology
workers, with little more than a two-year degree, from the likes of
advanced computer engineers.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, the study said, ``the preponderance of
evidence suggests that there is a shortage of IT workers, or at
least a tight labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the issue is more complicated than that, and that
there is abuse of American workers by some companies or
institutions who shove older, more expensive talent aside in favor
of eager young foreign workers who get paid less.
</P>
<P>
   And to get around laws that prohibit such abuse, foreign workers
are often retained by third-party firms, which then are contracted
by companies to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Often companies or research labs will simply push aside the
people who give them problems and hire younger, more compliant
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Computing Research Association study concluded that many of
the problems of talent supply revolve around the uniqueness of
technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has its own constraints,'' the study said. ``For
example, companies are forced by short product life and short
product development cycles to hire new employees or reassign
existing workers in ways that do not require a lot of break-in
training before they can be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   And in another passage, the study said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It may also be true that older workers are underrepresented in
the IT work force. There is certainly a widespread perception that
programming is an activity for the young, and that IT workers tend
to get burned out and leave the field by the age of 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics would hold that these ``older'' workers don't flee, they
get pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of areas of non-technical work are renewed on the fly, with
younger folks replacing older, less agile workers.
</P>
<P>
   But a difference where high technology is concerned is that
foreign workers are well prepared for the work at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the United States must, by whatever
means necessary, increase the production of smart, qualified
performers in the technology area.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State University's Paula Stephan, who has done work in
labor issues as they relate to science, said her studies show that
at the Ph.D. level, foreign scientists have made contributions
beyond their numbers in our society.
</P>
<P>
   And their presence and force within academia and research
probably has displaced Americans, because of the value of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their work has displaced Americans, and may be a
discouragement factor, preventing some Americans from going into
science fields,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And so while there are good arguments to consider protection
provisions in any long-term authorization to extend and increase
tech visas, there is an even more urgent need to emphasize more
rapid training of scientists and technologists at home.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of talent must be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Research study emphasized that if women,
African-American, Hispanic and Native American technology workers
were fully represented in the industry, ``this country would have
more than an adequate supply of workers to fill even the most dire
estimates of a shortage.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the decades since it was banned, absinthe, a spirit
flavored with anise and wormwood, has been inflated with tremendous
allure. It was said to make people wickedly drunk and to unleash
the creativity in their souls. It was hedonism distilled into a
liqueur the color of a pea leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Absinthe was also supposed to be hallucinogenic and was blamed
for causing insanity, which is why it was banned in most of Western
Europe and the United States. Then in 1998, a group of curious
Londoners uncovered a surprising detail: absinthe was never legally
banned in Britain. They soon began importing it. It was an instant
hit among the young bar crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Until I went to London last week, it was still legend for me. I
went to soak up the absinthe scene, which, as it turned out, was
already fading. But I wondered, What is absinthe really like, this
spirit that mesmerized Rimbaud, Verlaine, van Gogh and
Toulouse-Lautrec. Oscar Wilde described it: ``After the first
glass, you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you
see things as they are not. Finally you see things as they really
are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   I started at Pharmacy in Notting Hill, one of the first bars to
carry absinthe. I went at 6, post-work, pre-dinner, l'heure verte,
the green hour as it was called a century ago, when Parisians could
be found at cafes smoking, staring, sipping absinthe.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the tradition was lost. The place was empty, save for a
man hunched over a newspaper and a beer. When I ordered, the
bartender raised his brow. ``You know it's very strong, right?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me a small taste of it straight. I swirled the liquid,
green as mouthwash, in the glass. It shimmered in a soft eddy. I
had intended to taste it like wine, breathing it in and letting it
sit and roll around my mouth. But somehow, it shot down my throat
like a bullet. I seem to recall it went something like this: first,
there was a scream of anise and herbs, then what felt like a
steaming hot cotton swab spread over my tongue, and a flash of heat
raced to my stomach. My tongue was numb, and within a minute my
limbs were leaden.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the power of a legend, or just that of a spirit that's
140 proof?
</P>
<P>
   The bartender then made the traditional drink, a measured
procedure that looks a lot like a drug ritual. He poured a finger
of the spirit into a tumbler, then dipped a spoon with a sugar cube
into it until it was soaked. He lighted the spoon, making a great
blue flame. He let it burn over the glass, then swirled the
bubbling sugar into the absinthe and topped it with water, stirring
it into a pale green, milky liquid.
</P>
<P>
   This was tamer, creamier and softer, like pastis, but much
sweeter. I became numb from my eyebrows down.
</P>
<P>
   I moved on to a few more bars, including Woody's, a new bar in
northwest London with tall vermilion banquettes, moss green walls
and an enormous glossy Mario Testino photo of people standing
around in their underwear. There, I was told I could have absinthe
the traditional way, but that very few people ordered it like that.
Puzzled, I ordered one of the house's absinthe cocktails, a
Dragon's Breath, made with cherry liqueur, vodka and lime juice.
</P>
<P>
   It came in a shot glass with a frosty liquid on the bottom and a
viscous layer of pale green absinthe on top. Where the two met,
they curdled. If it did that in the glass, what would happen once
it hit my stomach? Unfortunately, I can tell you: it was like
drinking tomato sauce after eating ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   No one else had ordered absinthe that night, which was a good
thing, since I got the last shot that was left. They had run out of
it over the weekend, Tony Rweyemamu, the bartender, told me. That's
when people drink it, he said, usually a quick shot between beers
or other mixed drinks, to speed up the lubrication process.
</P>
<P>
   Jans Ende, a bartender at the Met, a private club, said he
wasn't serving it as much anymore. ``It's not that good,'' he said.
``It's not the legend that absinthe was.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you happen upon a bottle that has been preserved, it is
impossible to know exactly how it is different, or even whether it
was good in its day. Before the general ban early in the 20th
century, absinthe had been produced for more than a century. As
Barnaby Conrad III states in ``Absinthe: History in a Bottle''
(Chronicle, 1988), it was created in Switzerland and originally
issued as a tonic for French soldiers to fight fevers. It was so
popular that it became an everyday drink for soldiers and
civilians. Which isn't to say that it was good, but it was cheap _
as cheap as wine, at least, and with much more bang for the franc.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 20th century, though, absinthe became the scapegoat
for many social problems. The French government's anti-absinthe
campaign included claims that it caused impotence. When people died
of syphilis, doctors would name absinthe abuse as the cause of
death to save them the embarrassment of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, Belgium and the United States were the first to ban
absinthe. Eventually, the French government prohibited absinthe in
1914, and the Pernod company developed pastis to replace it. Pastis
was still flavored with anise but not wormwood, but it is much
different from absinthe in subtle but significant ways. Its alcohol
content is much lower, and it has a less complex flavor. It can't
be substituted for absinthe in cocktails. Its greatest similarity,
really, is that it is affordable, as absinthe once was.
</P>
<P>
   Today's absinthe, however, is the wealthy urbanite's drink.
Classic absinthe, with sugar and water, averages $9; cocktails cost
more. When I ordered it at Three Three Three in Shoreditch, where
many young artists live, the bartender made sure I knew it was
expensive before she poured.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the price is partly intentional, partly
unavoidable. In Britain, import taxes are based on alcohol content,
absinthe's primary component. And Green Bohemia, the first
distributor of absinthe, had the marketing tactics of Absolut Vodka
in mind. The distributor wanted it to be expensive and difficult to
get, as Absolut was early on, knowing that the difficulty would
make Londoners want it even more.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to import absinthe began with an article in an
underground literary magazine called The Idler: Those Who Live to
Loaf. The writer, John Moore, is a musician whose band, Black Box
Recorder, was traveling through Eastern Europe, where absinthe is
legal. The two men behind The Idler, Gavin Pretor-Pinney and Tom
Hodgkinson, were intrigued. ``We, like most people, had sort of
heard of this drink, that it was this kind of naughty drink,''
Pretor-Pinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Over several meetings with Moore in a pub, they explored the
idea of importing it. After many letters to agencies dealing with
health and with agriculture and fisheries, they confirmed that it
was, in fact, legal. They sought out an importer of spirits in the
Czech Republic, where absinthe has always been available, and they
formed an alliance with Hill's Absinthe.
</P>
<P>
   They called the new importing company Green Bohemia and
introduced absinthe in Britain in November 1998. In less than a
year, it took London by storm, beginning in Soho bars, then
spreading to private clubs and bars throughout the city. Now, even
the staid, formal Library Bar in the Lanesborough Hotel serves it,
and so do many ordinary pubs.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bohemia is run out of The Idler office, a loft in
Clerkenwell strewn with music magazines, coffee cups, skateboards
and computer equipment. Pretor-Pinney and Hodgkinson said that
selling absinthe is a kind of pleasant distraction for them. They
try to promote it as an artists' drink but realize that it has
taken on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than eight brands, all made in Europe, from
Spain to Bulgaria. Some are sweeter than others, but all contain
scant amounts of wormwood, the ingredient responsible for
absinthe's supposed hallucinogenic effects. Even the original had
very little, and modern studies have concluded that whatever
extreme effects people had from absinthe were most likely caused by
the high alcohol content, not the wormwood. Today, the European
Union limits thujone, the drug in wormwood, to 10 milligrams a
kilogram of the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of Hill's is the most austere, resembling vodka, with
a milder licorice flavor. Salvatore Calabrese, the bar manager at
the Library Bar, has tasted an old bottle of the original, and he
said Hill's is the closest in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense. Hill's tends toward the bitter more than the
sweet, which is why the ritual of adding sugar to the drink
evolved. Many of the other absinthes are so sweet that by the time
the sugar is added, it is like drinking syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Making my way around London in search of the absinthe scene was
like chasing an elusive criminal. It was easy to find people who
had drunk absinthe but difficult to find anyone drinking it. Ben
Hoyle, Nick Chapman and Sebastian Boyd, all young professionals in
jeans and sneakers, were at the Bluu Cafe on Hoxton Square having
beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first flush of novelty has definitely gone out,'' Chapman
said. It has been around for a whole year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   But they knew absinthe and all of its effects, having drunk it
often during the last year. ``It's a really good laugh,'' said
Hoyle, a management consultant. ``But it has a kind of depth-charge
effect, because after two or three, you don't think it's working,
then later, one and a half hours after, you feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   None of them has hallucinated, but it has made them, they said,
do things out of the ordinary. Hoyle, who rarely dances, danced
salsa for three hours straight after an absinthe binge. One took a
chicken from the refrigerator and beat it with a hammer. Another
set a table on fire.
</P>
<P>
   They don't drink it to savor it. ``It gets the job done,'' said
Boyd, a journalist. And they try not to drink it during the week.
``They were obviously more hard core in the 19th century,'' Hoyle
added, ``Now we have jobs to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   I also stopped in at the Long Bar in the Sanderson Hotel, a more
self-conscious scene in a new hotel designed by Ian Schrager. They
didn't have absinthe, as it turned out. ``I don't want people
burning things at the bar,'' said Ben Pundole, the bars executive
for Schrager's hotels. ``It's a classic bar.'' When Pundole was the
bar manager at the Met, he made sure that it was one of the first
to have absinthe on its shelf.
</P>
<P>
   More unfortunate, though, was the emerging truth that after all
these years, absinthe was being reduced to a fad.
</P>
<P>
   I still hadn't had enough to feel its effects, other than a numb
tongue. It was time. At Alphabet in Soho, I ordered three classic
absinthes and drank them within half an hour. Then _ clearly the
absinthe was working _ I decided to have a beer. At first, the back
of my head felt as if it would burn off, then the heat descended to
the ends of my limbs, making them feel as heavy as if I had just
gone swimming in a denim suit. I had no desire to beat a chicken. I
did not see green fairies. But I was breathlessly drunk. The next
morning had that familiar haze.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the romance. It's no wonder the fashionable crowd
has turned its back on absinthe. The genie is out of the bottle,
and no one wants to think of van Gogh lying in bed with the spins. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Keep in mind that a horse has a little brain. You and
I, as the intelligent ones, we have to come down to this horse's
level. We have to try to get into this animal's head.
</P>
<P>
   When giving beginner lessons, if I sense there's some fear in
you, we're going to stop and have a five-minute chat:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you fear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I fear getting thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, some horses will never throw you, and if you're a
beginner, that's probably the kind of horse you'll be on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear getting kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can't get kicked being on top of the horse. It is
physically impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   With proper instruction, anyone can ride with confidence,
knowing what to do in case a horse is going and he moves laterally,
which can pop you out of the saddle. I mean actually getting into
this animal, actually riding this horse, toe always up, heel always
down, a nice seat you work from the waist-down to ride.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to ride in Central Park in Manhattan. I used to go
down on the weekend, and I'd clean the stables and brush the horses
and what-not. And my mother, she used to tear into me. She would
say, ``Where'd you get this money?'' and I'd say, ``Ma, I worked
for it.'' And she'd say, ``What's that smell?'' I'd come home
smelling of stables.
</P>
<P>
   How I got started riding, I was shining shoes down there. And I
saw this guy wearing beautiful paddock boots, English boots, and I
said, ``Mister, can I give you a shine?'' and he said, ``Son, all
you going to do is mess up these new boots.'' Then I said, ``What
you do?'' He said, ``I ride, I train horses.'' I said, ``Maybe
you'll take me out to ride on a horse?'' He said, ``OK, how about
tomorrow?'' I said, ``I can't go tomorrow, tomorrow's school.''
</P>
<P>
   It's different if a kid stays out of school today. Back then, if
a kid stayed out of school, the truant officer came to the house.
But that one time I played hooky, I went riding with this guy, and
he says, ``Kid, you're a natural.'' That was the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The rich at that time were different than the rich of today.
They were not as snobbish as today, they could recognize, ``That's
young Sam, he rides here, and he's a good kid.'' That wouldn't
happen today to a kid like me who just wanted to ride in Central
Park. The rich today, they're too much into protecting their turf.
</P>
<P>
   I love horses. I understand them. I don't sentimentalize them. I
don't kiss a horse. Every now and then I'll give them a little pat.
A horse has no emotions, no nothing, he's just a beast of burden
with a little brain the size of a walnut. I don't want to get
attached to that animal because I get attached I'll never sell him.
But I do keep a scrapbook with pictures of most of the horses I
have owned in it.

 &HT;    WWII generation felt every life is worth honoring
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even today, John Souther knows the desert passes of
North Africa about as well as he knows his way around Gainesville.
He can name and spell each of those historic passes _ Kasserine,
Maknassey, Sbeitla, Faid, Lassouda.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when he was 80, Souther published a book about
his World War II experiences. ``War Not Forgotten'' is in its
second printing.
</P>
<P>
   Souther, like my late father-in-law, William T. Ezzard,
commanded a platoon of about 65 men in the Army's 1st Armored
Division, which was sent to Tunisia in the winter of 1943 to help
fight the forces of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, ``the Desert Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1942, when we invaded North Africa, we were the first to go
into combat, and looking back we were just pitifully unprepared,''
Souther said. The division lost about 3,000 men near Lassouda Pass
on Feb. 14, 1943 _ which Souther calls ``the worst day of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in a scout car when American tanks all around him
starting getting picked off by German artillery. His platoon,
assigned to reconnaissance, was looking for ``camel trails'' _
places to cross the dry stream gullies in the desert _ when enemy
fire blew the motor out of his vehicle. Souther ended up stuck in
one of the deep gullies. He sent his platoon ahead with his
second-in-command and stayed behind alone in the gully, radioing
the division command of the precise location of the German
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much (fire) do you need?'' they asked.'' He chuckled at
the recollection. ``I told 'em, 'All you got.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That same day, on the other side of Lassouda Pass, about 4,000
troops were surrounded by Rommel's forces _ including my
father-in-law. In his book, Souther describes how Lt. Ezzard
escaped in the middle of the night, leading most of his men to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Souther managed to get back to his platoon after hiding several
hours in the gully and was awarded a Silver Star for bravery. Lt.
Ezzard got a Silver Star, too, for his courage behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after American troops were ``walloped by Rommel,''
as Souther puts it, Lt. Ezzard was wounded trying to disarm a land
mine near Sbeitla. He carried some of those tiny steel balls in his
chest all of his life. (My husband cherishes the flak jacket with
the burned holes in it his father wore that fateful day.)
</P>
<P>
   Souther said he originally asked to extend his ROTC commission
for just one year in 1940 when he graduated from the University of
Georgia with a degree in forestry. He did it, he said, because the
Army paid him $125 a month, compared with $75 for a forestry job.
Both Souther and my father-in-law ended up staying in the Army
after the war, mainly because it was the best way to make a living
for their children. Both retired as lieutenant colonels.
</P>
<P>
   As I talked with Souther, I was reminded of qualities he, my
father-in-law and their uncommon generation shared. Their brushes
with death made them honor life so intensely. A story about my
father-in-law speaks to the point.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral procession was passing by the farm in North Georgia
where he raised vegetables and blueberries after his retirement.
The colonel was on his tractor in the fields, but he got down, took
off his hat and held it over his heart until the procession passed.
It wasn't anyone Col. Ezzard knew. It was his way of saying every
life is worth honoring.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Souther talks proudly about his grandson, who holds a
Ph.D. in history, he worries about how to protect a new generation
of Americans from the threats of technology, nuclear terrorists and
the rest. ``We old men just sit around drinking coffee now, and we
say, `Well, we can die, but what about our grandchildren?' ''

   FBC-VOLS _ Normally, this is a time of celebration for the fans
of Tennessee football. Coach Phil Fulmer is making his annual tour
of booster clubs, known as the Big Orange Caravan, where he fires
up the Volunteers faithful and gets them excited about another
season. But this year there is an air of uncertainty and uneasiness
at the school. It was bad enough that the Vols lost nine starters,
including five underclassmen, to the NFL draft. Now there are
additional charges from an English professor of academic fraud in
the way the athletes are tutored. The charged were first raised
last fall, but were thought to have been put to rest by an internal
audit. Those results were approved by the NCAA and all thought the
matter was closed. But the same professor has released her findings
concering 39 UT athletes which she says were put through a
hodge-podge of courses to keep them eligible. Those records are
being studied by the Faculty Senate and the NCAA plans a return
visit. Tennessee could be guilty of no NCAA violations but the
negative media attention from the episode could ultimlatey have an
adverse affect on the football program. It happened at Georgia in
1985. (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 35.

 By JOHN H. SLADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week I celebrated my 92nd birthday, and I feel like the
luckiest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   My good fortune started when I came to the United States on
March 26, 1936. I was 27 years old and had had been living in
Frankfurt, where I'd been hoping to make the field hockey team for
the German Olympics. But one day, the club I played for didn't
invite me to play in one of its games. The club's president told me
the team we were playing against didn't want any Jews on our team.
I took that as a sign and decided to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I got a lucky career break. A former boss at a bank
where I'd worked as an apprentice gave me an introduction to his
nephew who worked at Bear Stearns in New York. So the first day I
came here, I got a job as a runner for the firm, making $15 a week.
</P>
<P>
   I soon realized that in order to get ahead, you have to produce
commissions, so I began meeting the boats carrying the German
refugees as they arrived into New York. I often recognized the
names of some of the passengers, and brought customers to the firm
that way. I became the foreign bond trader at the firm, and later
started the risk arbitrage department.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the war started, I was fortunate enough to be able
to save my whole family by bringing them to the United States. In
1942, I left the firm to join the Army and spent three years on the
front lines of the war, interrogating POWs.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned from Europe at the end of 1945, I rejoined Bear
Stearns. In 1948, I returned to Europe, but this time as part of
the U.S. Olympic field hockey team. While I was in Europe, the firm
gave me permission to develop an international department.
</P>
<P>
   By 1949, I ran the international department, the international
trading department, the risk arbitrage department and the
convertible bond department. In 1951, I was made a partner of Bear
Stearns. When the firm went public in 1985, I became an executive
vice president and director.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what position I've held, I've had the same management
philosophy: Every employee is a human being. I've never screamed at
anybody at work, and I've never fired anybody. I treat people as
I'd like to be treated. That's my style.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't just been lucky in my career _ I've been lucky in
love, too. In 1977, while on a train to Switzerland, I met a
Hungarian couple, and we talked. The woman said she had a sister
who lived in New York, and I asked the gentleman, ``Is you
sister-in-law as attractive as your wife?'' And he said, ``And
how!'' And I asked for her name and address. Marianne and I were
married on the Concorde two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago I decided to make room for the younger people at
the firm, so I'm now the the honorary chairman of the executive
committee, and the honorary director, which means I can attend all
the meetings but I have no vote. I'm lucky to be with a firm where
I'm permitted to work at my age.
</P>
<P>
   Though my job title has changed, I still keep busy. I wake up
every day at 5 a.m. and ride my electric bicycle for 25 minutes
while I watch the business news. Four days a week (Marianne doesn't
want me to work five days), I walk the mile from my home to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never retire because I love this job. For me, the whole
profession is a sport. Nobody can really predict what will happen
with the market. Every day, I have visitors from all over the world
come into my office and ask my opinion on various investments. And
I always tell them they can have my opinion, but it's just a guess.
I've been real lucky in the past, but who the hell knows what's
going to happen tomorrow?

 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Senior members of Japan's ruling party are pressing the
dominant telecommunications company to cut sharply the high
connection fees charged to competitors, an issue that has caused
deep trade friction with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications executives and politicians have been saying
that in the last week members of the Liberal Democratic Party, most
notably its influential secretary-general, Hiromu Nonaka, have been
talking to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. about the fees,
which make the cost of doing business here exceedingly expensive
for other telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are the main reason for a stalemate in talks on
telecommunications deregulation between the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing speculation that a deal is in the works to end
the stalemate and avoid a major trade dispute before Japan plays
host to a summit meeting of leaders from the richest industrialized
nations in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   NTT, the former telephone monopoly in Japan and still its
biggest telephone company, controls 99 percent of the lines that
connect directly to homes and offices here. The price it charges
others to use those lines is critical to opening the
telecommunications market in Japan. At current rates, about 40
percent of the revenues of competing carriers is used for fees paid
to NTT, according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
which regulates the market.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has threatened to take the matter to the World
Trade Organization, signaling a potential escalation in the dispute
at a time when Japan's government is working to ensure a smooth
summit meeting, which President Clinton will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Even politicians sympathetic to NTT, which has tremendous
political influence because of its legions of employees and strong
trade union, are trying to coax the former telephone monopoly to
make some concessions on the fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily, said
the normally conservative Fair Trade Commission was about to
publish a report saying that Nippon Telegraph's reorganization last
year failed to enhance competition in the telecommunications market
here and urging sharper cuts in access fees.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that in exchange for such cuts NTT may
get even more power than it already has and further hamper
competition here. Executives at competing carriers, Japanese
businessmen and politicians suspect that Nonaka and other senior
politicians are promising the telecommunications firm that they
will push for a sweeping revision of the restrictive law governing
its activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a move afoot to drastically revise, or even abolish
the NTT law,'' said Kei Hata, a member of the upper house of
parliament who is becoming one of the most vocal critics of the
government's regulation of Nippon Telegraph. ``I myself favor an
abolishment of the law, but only after we have secured conditions
for free and fair competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hata and many others say those conditions do not yet exist in
Japan. Abolishing the NTT law would open the door for NTT East and
NTT West, the two regional fixed-line phone companies in the NTT
family, to provide long distance and international service. Many
worry that with the advantages of NTT's deep pockets and existing
technology, they would wipe out competitors that are only just
beginning to secure a toehold in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to think more about the implications of changing the
law,'' Hata said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NTT's recent financial performance, which was far better than
the company had projected, undercut its contention that it would be
crippled by cuts of the magnitude demanded by the United States.
Both NTT East and NTT West vastly outperformed the expectations of
their parent company, which has given even NTT's supporters cause
to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Junichiro Miyazu, NTT's president, has not furthered his
company's cause by saying he could not explain the markedly better
performance. His insistence that declining profitability at the two
regional carriers was a trend also rang somewhat hollow against the
backdrop of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings of the regional carriers improved,'' Eita
Yashiro, the minister of posts and telecommunications, said at a
press conference Tuesday. ``It's very different from the initial
projections.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of that, Yashiro said, his agency would consider the
reduction in interconnection fees it has proposed, as well as the
proposed timetable for achieving those reductions. Japan has
proposed cutting the fees by 22.5 percent over four years, saying
further cuts would damage NTT.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, wants cuts of 41.1 percent
immediately and has said the ministry is helping NTT avoid a
far-reaching overhaul of its business.

BARAK AND ARAFAT HOPE TO RESTART PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority
leader Yasser Arafat are taking steps to revive their stalled peace
talks, which had been overshadowed for the past week by Israel's
abrupt withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is scheduled to fly to Germany on Thursday to meet with
President Clinton and discuss the ``implications'' of the
withdrawal and ``ways to advance the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations in particular,'' the prime minister's office announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, meanwhile, has restrained the often violent Palestinian
protest demonstrations of recent weeks, which are what had prompted
Israel to suspend the talks. His emissaries were working Tuesday
night to persuade hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails to resume eating in exchange for concessions on visitation
rights and other issues, Palestinian sources said. Officials on
both sides fear that the death of a hunger striker could detonate a
new round of violence in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are expected to resume this weekend or sooner,
though it is not yet clear where. Nor is it clear what new
concessions either side is willing to make to break what Arafat on
Monday termed the ``impasse'' in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   But right-wing opposition leaders and one disgruntled Barak
cabinet minister asserted Tuesday that Barak is prepared to give
the Palestinians up to 95 percent of the West Bank, including
fertile Jordan valley lands extending to the edge of the Dead Sea.
Israel would retain Jewish-settled West Bank lands near its present
eastern border, plus a narrow sliver of the West Bank border zone
with Jordan for security purposes, according to opponents of the
reported proposal. Israel currently controls more than half of the
West Bank, which it seized from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Natan Sharansky sent Barak a letter demanding
a security cabinet discussion of the alleged new negotiating offer,
a ministry spokesman said Tuesday night. Sharansky, who has
repeatedly threatened to quit the government over territorial
concessions in peace talks, said in his letter that the reported
new proposal would require up to 50,000 Jewish settlers to be
relocated into Israel and award the Palestinians sovereign control
over border crossings into Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltianski, said the position
ascribed to the prime minister ``does not represent the
government's posture or the agreement that we are working on.'' A
spokesman for Sharansky replied that the interior minister ``is
confident that his information is accurate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Negotiations in Stockholm aimed at drafting an outline for a
final peace settlement were suspended last week following violent
protests in Gaza and the West Bank on behalf of the Palestinian
prisoners. The elastic deadline for the so-called framework
agreement was most recently extended to June 23, but negotiators on
both sides have expressed skepticism that they could resolve all
outstanding issues in the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said last week's sudden Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon
has made it harder for him to compromise on territorial claims and
the highly sensitive issues of Palestinian refugees and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My public sees Hezbollah'' _ the guerrilla movement that
fought against Israel's presence in southern Lebanon _ ``as heroes
who succeeded in getting the Israeli army out of Lebanon, and
believes that that is the route we should take as well,'' he told
Dalia Izik, Israel's Environment Minister, in a meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his effort to end the hunger strikes by the prisoners _ and
by their protesting sympathizers in West Bank and Gaza plazas _ is
clearly intended to pave the way for a return to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's Palestinian critics say he has further quelled dissent
by trampling on civil liberties: A Ramallah television station was
closed down by Palestinian police this morning after airing
repeated reports about the hunger strikers, and earlier this week
the police arrested local leaders of the dissident Palestinian
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has quietly acknowledged Arafat's renewed control of his
internal security situation, lifting a week-long ban on travel by
Israelis and foreign tourists to Palestinian areas it imposed
following the firebombing of an Israeli car in Jericho.

LONG A COSTLY BANE TO RANCHERS, THE PRICKLY PEAR IS NOW PROVIDING
PROFITS
</HEADLINE>

By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Pity the poor prickly pear cactus no more.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of Texans have condemned it for pilfering moisture
from the prairie grasses that sustain cattle across this
drought-pestered state.
</P>
<P>
   But now the cactus is gaining a new image. New products,
including insect repellent and a skin-care moisturizing gel, are
being made from the extract of the prolific prickly pear.
</P>
<P>
   Since being introduced in the Caribbean islands in 1997, sales
of Cactus Juice products have gone national and are expected to top
$4 million this year, says the manufacturer, Safe Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started its factory in Rowlett, transferred
operations to Dallas before relocating deep in Texas ranching and
farming country this year. Safe Solutions, with 20 employees, is
now based in Seymour, about 130 miles west of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas native Rob Gibson started the company after moving to
Roatan, one of the Bay Islands off the Honduras coast, where he
desperately needed relief from tropical insects and sun.
</P>
<P>
   He had retired early from partnerships in a string of auto
repair shops and gone in search of nirvana. Instead, he found a new
business career. Through a friend, he learned about the
possibilities of products made from cactus juice and decided to
test some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say, `It's going to be the next aloe,''' said
Gibson, referring to widely sold products made from the aloe vera
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cactus Juice brand products are now sold in Kmart, Sam's Club,
some supermarket chains and other retail stores after their U.S.
debut this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only way the prickly pear is losing its
pasture-pest reputation.
</P>
<P>
   From a long history as a food and feed source in Mexico and
Central and South America, cactus farming is snagging interest in
Africa, Israel, Sicily, southern Italy, Southern California and
other regions.
</P>
<P>
   And cactus is being used for a variety of foods from salsa to
wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to get respectable,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Research on human health benefits of cactus extract has begun,
said Jonas Wilson, Safe Solutions' marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The French are even showing an interest in its uses for skin
care, said Jim Moss, a free-lance technical writer and editor of
the Professional Association for Cactus Development Journal, based
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters tout cactus vitamins, fiber and other nutrients. In
fact, cactus product claims are becoming so numerous that
scientists are urging caution for consumers. A cactus pill touted
for its health benefits was proved worthless, Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's move into the cactus product business was based on
research by another Texan, Richard Kunkel, who lived for many years
in Tarrant County and died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kunkel, a retired industrial chemist whose son is a friend of
Gibson, had studied cactus extract. After testing it for use as an
insect repellent in Central America, Gibson and his partners found
a way to mass produce it. Hence, Safe Solutions Cactus Juice Insect
Protection and Cactus Juice Miracle Gel.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Solutions contracts ranchers to harvest the native cactus,
which in the past was sprayed with herbicide, burned or bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not traditional agriculture,'' said David Eppele,
director of Arizona Cactus and Succulent Research, a 14-year-old
nonprofit botanical garden in Bisbee, Ariz., in the Chihuahuan
desert on the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Eppele said, most North Americans have
stubbornly refused to believe in the commercial possibilities of
cultivating common prickly pear cactus for human foods, skin-care
products and livestock feeds. The cactus needles are easily singed
off. Or, Eppele said, a grower can choose from 17 naturally
spineless varieties with varying degrees of cold tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Cactus is nutritious, and it might even benefit diabetics, based
on early research, Eppele said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites centuries of American Indians and then Hispanics using
cactus juice to soothe and heal burned and scraped skin. They would
use both the green cactus ears and the plant's red, yellow or
purple fruit for food and livestock feed.
</P>
<P>
   As a cultivated crop south of the Rio Grande, the young green
ears, called ``nopalitos,'' are a venerable staple in Hispanic
cooking and steadily becoming sampled more often by Anglos north of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nopalitos. That's yuppie food in Santa Fe, Sausalito and Fort
Worth,'' Eppele said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also rapidly becoming a U.S. staple. Eppele said U.S.
border officials at Nogales, Ariz., alone reported 138,000 tons of
imported prickly pear cactus in cans, jars and bulk fresh loads
crossing last year.
</P>
<P>
   A cactus margarita has been served on the San Antonio Riverwalk.
And although he hasn't sampled it yet, Wilson said, prickly pear
wine has been made. ``It's supposed to be pretty interesting,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of West Texas ranch wives have made jellies, jams
and relishes from ``cactus apples,'' the fruit. Now those
specialties and cactus candies and salsas are beginning to pop up
in more retail outlets, Gibson said. There are even kosher dill and
sweet-and-hot cactus salsas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could row crop it from here to Las Cruces,'' Eppele said.
``We can do this for free.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the desert plant doesn't need fertilizers, pesticides or
supplemental water. In some arid parts of Texas, New Mexico and
Arizona, producers could reap 50 tons per acre per year with no
costs other than the harvest work, he said. ``We've got to save our
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Eppele is pushing prickly pear for a major, cheaper role in
cattle feed, touting a mix of 75 percent cactus ears for fiber,
water and nutrients and 25 percent grain, molasses or cottonseed
byproducts, hay and minerals for a complete ration.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Seymour, the coming of the Cactus Juice factory has
created jobs in a town of about 3,100 people where most young
residents have been leaving to find work in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're part of a rural renewal project,'' Wilson said.

LONG A COSTLY BANE TO RANCHERS, THE PRICKLY PEAR IS NOW PROVIDING
PROFITS

By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Pity the poor prickly pear cactus no more.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of Texans have condemned it for pilfering moisture
from the prairie grasses that sustain cattle across this
drought-pestered state.
</P>
<P>
   But now the cactus is gaining a new image. New products,
including insect repellent and a skin-care moisturizing gel, are
being made from the extract of the prolific prickly pear.
</P>
<P>
   Since being introduced in the Caribbean islands in 1997, sales
of Cactus Juice products have gone national and are expected to top
$4 million this year, says the manufacturer, Safe Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started its factory in Rowlett, transferred
operations to Dallas before relocating deep in Texas ranching and
farming country this year. Safe Solutions, with 20 employees, is
now based in Seymour, about 130 miles west of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas native Rob Gibson started the company after moving to
Roatan, one of the Bay Islands off the Honduras coast, where he
desperately needed relief from tropical insects and sun.
</P>
<P>
   He had retired early from partnerships in a string of auto
repair shops and gone in search of nirvana. Instead, he found a new
business career. Through a friend, he learned about the
possibilities of products made from cactus juice and decided to
test some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say, `It's going to be the next aloe,''' said
Gibson, referring to widely sold products made from the aloe vera
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cactus Juice brand products are now sold in Kmart, Sam's Club,
some supermarket chains and other retail stores after their U.S.
debut this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only way the prickly pear is losing its
pasture-pest reputation.
</P>
<P>
   From a long history as a food and feed source in Mexico and
Central and South America, cactus farming is snagging interest in
Africa, Israel, Sicily, southern Italy, Southern California and
other regions.
</P>
<P>
   And cactus is being used for a variety of foods from salsa to
wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to get respectable,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Research on human health benefits of cactus extract has begun,
said Jonas Wilson, Safe Solutions' marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The French are even showing an interest in its uses for skin
care, said Jim Moss, a free-lance technical writer and editor of
the Professional Association for Cactus Development Journal, based
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters tout cactus vitamins, fiber and other nutrients. In

scientists are urging caution for consumers. A cactus pill touted

&HT;     WHISTLE-BLOWER CONTINUES TO ATTACK TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By NICOLE FOY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Jeffrey Wigand no longer travels with an armed
guard. The threats against his family have stopped. The anxiety and
paranoia have all but ended.
</P>
<P>
   But the fire remains.
</P>
<P>
   The same angry conviction that spurred Wigand to blow the
whistle on the tobacco industry continues to compel him to rail
against his former bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he detailed his high-stakes fight against Big Tobacco
for about 4,000 physicians attending the Texas Medical Foundation
annual conference at the Convention Center here.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand now works with a nonprofit anti-smoking group that
educates kids about the dangers of tobacco. He urged doctors to
closely track the Texas legislature's spending of the state's
recent $17 billion settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should convince the legislature to get more involved (in
anti-tobacco efforts) and see that your kids' inheritance isn't
wasted on prisons, roads and bridges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once an obscure scientist for Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp., the
nation's third largest tobacco company, Wigand enjoyed a brush with
celebrity after actor Russell Crowe portrayed him in the Academy
Awards nominated movie ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the notoriety has come with a price, he said during an
interview that he would do it all again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being followed wasn't fun. Being threatened wasn't fun,''
Wigand said dryly. ``But I know what I'm doing is the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigand, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, worked for the
tobacco company from 1989 until 1993. He said he began the
$300,000-a-year job with the goal of using his knowledge to develop
a safer cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   But Wigand said he soon learned ``the lawyers were going to tell
me what to think about science'' in order to hide the fact the
company knew about the risks of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   As the evidence mounted that tobacco company executives were
hiding evidence nicotine was addictive, Wigand acknowledged he
chose to look the other way. The money and health benefits were too
precious to abandon, especially since his daughter has spina
bifida, he said. (In the movie, she suffered from asthma.)
</P>
<P>
   But after he recommended that the company remove from its pipe
tobacco an additive suspected of causing cancer, Wigand was fired.
He was, however, given health care benefits and a severance
package.
</P>
<P>
   He also had to sign a confidentiality agreement vowing not to
reveal anything about his work with the company. What executives
wanted to hide, Wigand said, was that cigarettes are manipulated to
enhance their addictive nature, then marketed to children.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for his former employer have claimed Wigand's
allegations are false and that they stem from the vengeance he felt
after losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand said he later became infuriated when the CEOs of the
nation's seven top tobacco companies testified before Congress that
cigarettes were not addictive or dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to grant an interview to CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' and in
it, he spilled secrets about his former company's research into the
addictive nature of tobacco. But the piece CBS broadcast was
heavily edited. Executives cited a threatened Brown &AMP; Williamson
lawsuit over Wigand's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand also noted that at the time, CBS was controlled by
Laurence Tisch's Loews Corp., which also owned Lorillard, a firm
then working with Brown &AMP; Williamson on a deal with billion-dollar
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's eventual testimony in the first state lawsuit against
Big Tobacco helped lead to the 1998 national settlement between the
industry and 46 states. The $206 billion deal settled state
lawsuits filed against cigarette makers to recover Medicaid money
spent treating diseases related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the industry has agreed to pay $246 billion over 25
years to settle lawsuits in the four other states.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joan Hamburg, the talk show host on radio station WOR
here, had not eaten beets since she was a child, until she
encountered them a few weeks ago at Blue Hill in Greenwich Village.
``Some people have phobias about bridges, some about elevators,''
she said. ``I had a beet phobia.'' Yet, when she didn't recognize
her nemesis hidden in a beet ravioli with her braised cod, she ate
it and discovered: ``It was spectacular. I may have gotten over my
phobia.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of conversion is not so unusual lately, as a vegetable
generally perceived as a winter staple actually comes into season,
and in colors, sizes and shapes that beet phobics, reared on the
canned kind, could never imagine. Mention the word ``beets,'' and
New Yorkers, who once might have shuddered, now rhapsodize about
the last beet and goat cheese salad they had at Tocqueville off
Union Square or about the halibut with warm baby beets in herbed
vinaigrette at Bayard's in the financial district. Chefs are now
showcasing beets just about every way but the cliche of pickled and
sliced.
</P>
<P>
   Beets are bursting out all over, not only in the traditional
deep red, but also in yellow, pink, white, purple and even
red-and-white striped, the kind known as candy cane or Chioggia.
Picholine near Lincoln Center is serving red beet tartare with
caviar; Judson Grill in Midtown pairs candy cane beets with black
cod and horseradish oil; and Chanterelle in TriBeCa is even teaming
foie gras with a beet vinaigrette and beet greens.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are choosing beets not only for the deep rich color and
firm, slightly crunchy texture, but also for the sweet earthiness,
which varies with type. Chioggia is not only the sweetest, but
certainly the most surprising looking. Traditional red beets are
next on the sweetness scale, and their intense color makes a
wonderful foil for black caviar. Golden beets provide typical beet
texture and color but only the barest hint of beet flavor, so
subtle that it disappears when mixed with an herbed vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Beets are following the fashionable pattern of purple potatoes,
heirloom tomatoes and golden raspberries. These heirloom varieties,
long lost in the quest for standardized fruits and vegetables,
until small farmers began growing them again, have helped make the
beets more appealing, and not one of them has ever seen the inside
of a can.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between a beet pickled and put in a
can and something fresh from the garden with the brightness of
fresh flavor,'' said Kevin Penner, the chef at Della Femina in
Midtown. He proves the point with a terrine layering sweet roasted
beets with tangy goat cheese fondue.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' markets can take a lot of credit for turning beets into
a sought-after commodity by piquing the interest of chefs. ``Beets
are becoming more popular, because the Greenmarkets have made
people more aware of fresh produce,'' said Marco Moreira of
Tocqueville.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, local beets will be available in New York
at the Greenmarkets, from farmers like Guy Jones from Blooming Hill
Organic Farm in Blooming Hill, N.Y., who sells organic golden
beets, white beets, Chioggia and several varieties of red beets on
Fridays at Union Square. In the meantime, red beets are available
everywhere, and Gourmet Garage stores often have the golden and
Chioggia types as well.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., was a pioneer
in the beet revival. She said she was turned on to the many
varieties 20 years ago when one of her suppliers started sending
them. ``Initially, we loved the colors,'' Waters said. ``They were
so shocking to people, and it's great to have fruits and vegetables
that capture your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Chez Panisse is a restaurant where the patrons naturally accede
to the whims of the chef, which has only helped with beets. ``They
never send beets back,'' Waters said, ``and if they did, I would go
out there and tell them to eat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Chez Panisse is serving sweet, firm beets in a salad with
creamy avocados and a sharp citrus vinaigrette. Like Waters, most
New York chefs are devising dishes that play to that sweet
earthiness and firm texture. All are far removed from the
old-fashion red flannel hash with beets, Harvard beets sweetened
with orange juice or plain boiled beets. At Esca in the theater
district, well-herbed red beets provide the perfect contrast to the
buttery and fresh ocean taste of salmon tartare. At Danube in
TriBeCa, the Austrian chef Mario Lohninger has three beet dishes on
the menu, including very thinly sliced red beets seared in walnut
and hazelnut oils and flavored with Champagne vinegar, horseradish
caraway and coriander seeds. ``You have never experienced beets
until you have eaten them this way,'' said the chef, whose native
cuisine relies heavily on beets.
</P>
<P>
   Beets, which are native to a wide swath of Eurasia, from Britain
to India, have probably always had an image problem. (Their
botanical name, beta vulgaris, doesn't help.) Harold McGee, the
food scientist and author, said beet greens were probably eaten
before the roots ever were, although beets have been eaten since
prehistoric times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most chefs are bringing out better flavor in beets by
bypassing the traditional pot of boiling water. Beets are generally
roasted in their skins, at 375 to 400 degrees. Some chefs, like
Lohninger, roast them for four or five hours; others for as little
as an hour. Those who opt for the long roasting say it concentrates
the sweetness, which also depends on the growing conditions and the
age of the beets. Baby beets are so tender they can be eaten skins
and all.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Hamburg notwithstanding, beets are still not universally
admired. Dan Barber, an owner of Blue Hill, said the restaurant
recently introduced what it thought was a great early spring
combination of pork loin and warm beet salad. ``Most of the waiters
said people skipped right over it when they saw the beets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barber said: ``We're definitely going to bring them back
when the farmers are ready. There's a part of me that wants people
to see the beauty of them, especially when they are babies and
filled with sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he knows to camouflage them in ravioli.

   CLINTON-BARAK _ LISBON, Portugal _ White House officials said
Tuesday that President Clinton will take time out of a European
summit to discuss Middle East peace with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak when the two leaders are in Berlin later this week. They
will meet on Thursday, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart,
when Clinton is scheduled to participate in a summit with other
world leaders in Berlin. The summit on ``third way'' politics seeks
alternatives to the traditional liberal and conservative approaches
to government. Will wrapo in other news of the day. (Deans, Cox

   LEBANON-PRISON _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Until she her release during
the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, Journalism student Cosette
Ibrihim spent 9 months in the notorious Al-Khaim prison, run by
Israel's allies, the South Lebanon Army. She said that as a
Christian and the objects of an international human rights cause,
she received ``lenient treatment'' a month of interrogations and
beatings, no trials or lawyers. ``Here,'' here captors told her,
``You defend yourself.'' Lebanese are debating whether to turn the
hill top prison into a museum or turn it into a prison for
collaborators. Inmates there in the '80s describe days chained to
electrical posts, sessions of dowsings with extremely hot or
extremely cold water. While her country celebrates Israel's
withdrawal, Ibrihim is suffering from stress, aggravated ulcers and
exhaustion. She's bitter and unsure of what to do with her life.

ANALYSIS: INDONESIA RECLAIMS ITS HISTORY BY INVESTIGATING PAST
ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Investigators who are struggling to break
through the mental fog of former President Suharto as they question
him are searching for something that is perhaps more valuable than
the billions of dollars he is said to have stolen from his country.
</P>
<P>
   They are fighting to reclaim a piece of their nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The fitful interrogations of the ailing 78-year-old former
president, who was placed under house arrest on Monday, are one
part of a broad campaign by President Abdurrahman Wahid to dig into
a past that is filled with hidden abuses.
</P>
<P>
   As with the national treasury, which Suharto used as his
personal bank account, he ravaged his country and then concealed
the evidence _ from shady business deals to dirty political tricks
to military massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wahid is pushing to dig up the bones of the past in a series
of investigations and trials. In response, he is receiving mostly
abuse, either from people who shout that he is moving too slowly or
from others who fear instability or personal exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main motivation is a hunger to explore this period of
Suharto's government,'' said Adam Schwarz, the author of ``A Nation
in Waiting'' (Allen &AMP; Unwin, 1999), the basic history of
Indonesia's recent past. ``I don't think it's really about the
money, and it's only partly about issues of justice. What is really
driving this is a strong desire for an accounting of what happened
in the past, whether in the case of human rights violations,
judicial misconduct or corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive thing is that Indonesians will to some extent be
able to put the past behind them. The negative is that a lot of bad
things will be dragged back up to the surface and confronted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Indonesia's most powerful people are resisting this
process. Most of those who prospered during the 32 years of
Suharto's rule were complicit to some degree in the abuses or
corruption that were the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are really serious,'' said one victim of a violent
raid on an opposition party office in 1997, ``then the police
headquarters would be empty, because everyone was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   As they push to uncover the truth about past abuses, the
investigations go beyond a simple exploration of the past. They
also have become a battleground of contemporary politics, enabling
Wahid to keep some of his opponents from the Suharto years on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful people apparently are fighting back, instigating
violent incidents in an attempt to derail Wahid's government and
the threat it poses to them. Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono, who
was also a Cabinet member in the previous government, said he knows
of several former civilian and military officials who are paying to
foment unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have noted that on several occasions when a new
investigation is opened or new charges are brought, a riot erupts
or bombs go off somewhere in this volatile nation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Suharto did not begin in earnest until
Wahid took office last October. During the previous 17 months,
after Suharto's forced resignation in May 1998, the interim
government of President B.J. Habibie _ stocked with Suharto
loyalists _ protected him.
</P>
<P>
   The interrogations are moving slowly now because Suharto's mind
has been affected by three strokes. The disability is apparently
being maximized by his team of lawyers, and perhaps by Suharto
himself, to hamper the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid and his attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, are also
meeting resistance as they probe a number of other difficult areas
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The most startlingly successful initiative so far, perhaps
because it was politically insulated, was the trial and conviction
on May 18 of 24 soldiers and a civilian for the massacre of an
Islamic teacher and more than 50 students last year in the province
of Aceh. The defendants received jail terms of up to 10 years each
_ although human rights campaigners now ask why none of their
superiors have been charged in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   It will be much more politically difficult to complete an
investigation into the campaign of violence last year in East Timor
after that former Indonesian province voted for independence.
Wiranto, the former military chief, formally resigned his Cabinet
post this month as he continued to undergo questioning as one of 21
high-ranking officers and civilians implicated by a government
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Opening another highly sensitive investigation this month, the
National Commission on Human Rights began summoning former generals
for questioning about the killings of at least 50 Muslim protesters
in the Tanjung Priok district of Jakarta in 1984. Among those
questioned were the former military chief, Benny Murdani, and a
former vice-president, Try Sutrisno.
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been no full-scale investigation into the riots
in May 1998 that helped bring down Suharto. It was clear from many
accounts by witnesses that much of that violence was instigated and
that a campaign of rapes of ethnic Chinese women was orchestrated
and involved members of the military.
</P>
<P>
   And although Wahid has raised the issue, there has been no
formal investigation yet into the massacres that began it all: the
killings of 500,000 people and the jailing without trial of
hundreds of thousands more in an anti-communist purge that began in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   The origins and responsibility for those atrocities have never
been fully explored, but their ultimate outcome was clear: Suharto
became president of Indonesia.

&HT;     COURT TO SETTLE RIVER FIGHT BETWEEN VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stepping into a territorial deal dating to 1632,
the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to referee a dispute between
Virginia and Maryland over the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution and federal law, the justices are the
only ones who can settle lawsuits between states, but historically
they have accepted only cases they believe are important and cannot
be resolved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The interstate feud began four years ago when Maryland blocked a
plan by the Fairfax County Water Authority in Fairfax, Va., to
extend a drinking-water intake pipe from Virginia's shore to the
middle of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a plant along the riverbank uses a pipe that opens
only a few feet from the riverbank to supply water to 1.2 million
Northern Virginia residents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Virginia officials, concerned about muddied water and
the build-up of sediment around the pipe, proposed extending the
pipe 725 feet into the center of the river to collect cleaner
water.
</P>
<P>
   But Maryland, which owns the entire Potomac under a 1632 land
grant from King Charles I of England, refused to issue a
construction permit for the new pipe until the completion of a
state-ordered study on the environmental impact of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief to the court, Virginia Attorney General Mark L.
Earley argued that the pipe extension is needed to secure a
``reliable'' water supply and to protect residents from toxic
by-products that can't be removed from muddy water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are serious public health issues that militate against
further delay,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Earley said the delay in building the extension
costs Virginia several hundred thousand dollars a year because of
the expense involved in straining sediment out of the water that
comes into the existing pipe.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that several interstate agreements give Virginia
rights to the water in the river and allow the state to build out
from its shoreline without asking Maryland's permission. Earley
also claimed that an appeal to a Maryland administrative law judge,
which was filed in 1997 after Maryland denied the permit, has been
needlessly delayed and embroiled in politics. The appeal process no
longer offers a fair way of resolving the dispute, he argued.
``Maryland will continue to delay for years and ultimately deny
Virginia its permit and the Maryland courts will uphold that
determination,'' Earley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland responds that Virginia is responsible for the very
problem that Earley is complaining about.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia created its problem by allowing rampant residential and
industrial development, which has increased pollution and sediment
run-off into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Byrnie, a spokeswoman for Maryland Gov. Parris N.
Glendening, said in a statement Tuesday that her state has
``serious concerns'' about the environmental impact of a new water
intake pipe that must be addressed before the extension could be
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is confident that the Supreme Court will
recognize that Maryland has taken reasonable and appropriate action
to address those concerns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said environmentalists worry that the new pipe would allow
Fairfax County to draw more water and would feed even more growth
in Virginia, further damaging water quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Potomac River is only one of several boundary rivers being
fought over by states. The others are Alabama, Arizona, California,
Florida, Georgia, Kansas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court already is considering whether to look into a
case brought by California and Arizona against the federal
government and an Indian tribe over rights to Colorado River water.
The court has not yet decided whether to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Quechan tribe wants more water to irrigate its Fort Yuma
Indian Reservation, which straddles the river where it flows
between the two states. The tribe claims the water under an 1893
treaty that promised irrigation benefits that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   But both states contend the Quechan relinquished their claim in
a $15 million settlement over disputed land and water in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The high court also may be called on to resolve other disputes
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, state Attorney General Don Stenberg has asked the
high court to settle his state's legal war with Kansas over the use
of water from the Republican River basin. Kansas accuses Nebraska
of violating a 1943 interstate compact by allowing farmers to
divert more than their legal share of the river's water for private
use.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Georgia, Alabama and Florida have said that unless
a deal can be worked in the next few months over two river basins,
they also will ask the court to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   They are wrangling over the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basins, both of which
originate in Georgia. Georgia relies on the rivers for drinking
water and hydroelectric power, especially in the growing metro area
of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But downstream, Alabama and Florida are asking for assurances
that enough water will be available for their needs.

 &HT;    SEC tees up scheduling change
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ Over the next few days, the 12 members of the SEC
will gather at this resort for their annual ritual.
</P>
<P>
   They will engage in some R&AMP;R after hard year's work, and they
will get a check from the conference office to take back home. This
year, each school's share of television revenues is expected to be
between $5 million and $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, when SEC commissioner Roy Kramer ends the meetings
Friday, the conference also will have put in place a major change
in the way it schedules football games.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC will change its schedule format for the first time since
it expanded to 12 teams in 1992. The purpose is to give more
variety to the schedule and to please television, which provides
the largess.
</P>
<P>
   Because teams play just eight conference games, a rotation
determines the schedules. Under the old system, such games as
Alabama-Georgia, Alabama-Florida and Auburn-Tennessee came along
only twice in eight years. Under the new format, which will begin
in 2002, such games will come along twice every six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had to sacrifice a little to make this happen,''
Kramer said, ``but I think it's a big step forward for the
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hot topics during this week's meetings will include the
recent decision by the NCAA to eliminate summer basketball
recruiting in 2001. The coaches don't like it, but key college
administrators, including Kramer, are insisting some changes be
made.
</P>
<P>
   Some early decisions on which SEC football games will be
televised this fall also are expected.

HIGH-FLYING CHINESE CAPITALIST GETS LIFE SENTENCE FOR FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's most celebrated private entrepreneur,
Mou Qizhong, will end his days in a prison cell, a Chinese court
decided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Intermediate People's Court in Wuhan, an industrial city,
sentenced Mou to life in the country's bleak penal system, ending a
remarkable chapter in China's fitful march toward a market economy.
China's state press reported that Mou said he would appeal, but
appeals in such high-profile cases are rarely granted and almost
never successful if they are heard.
</P>
<P>
   Mou, 58, became the very model of the new Chinese capitalist in
the early 1990s, after Deng Xiaoping kicked off a fresh wave of
high economic growth and easy credit. Mou, a master at
self-promotion, delighted the Western and Chinese press with his
claims of great wealth and his crazy investment schemes, like a
string of private satellites to be launched from neighboring
Kazakhstan _ little of which any journalists took the trouble to
substantiate.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the media hype, Mou insisted that his Land
Economic Group was worth as much as $240 million, and Forbes
magazine listed him as the fourth wealthiest man in China. Now it
appears more likely that he was the most indebted man in China
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Mou's rise and fall say as much about Western misperceptions of
China's development as they do about the deep flaws in China's
hybrid socialist-market economy. It seems now that Mou was more a
symbol of how far an opportunist can get on China's political
favoritism and lack of transparency, rather than an example of
capitalistic entrepreneurship. And his case is a stark illustration
of the poor monitoring of China's leaky banking system, which is
swamped with bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuhan court said Mou defrauded the Bank of China's Wuhan
branch by drawing $75 million on a letter of credit that was
supposed to pay for computer equipment imported from Australia. Mou
apparently spent the money on satellite investments that generated
no revenue. When in 1996 Beijing finally told state banks to call
in their loans to Mou, his debts exceeded his assets by about $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing reporters with colorful copy _ Mou's
outlandish proposals included blasting a hole in the Himalayas to
let warm moist air flow in from India and turn the arid Tibetan
plateau into an oasis _ he had a compelling story. The son of poor
farmers, Mou spent four years in jail during the 1970s for
criticizing the leaders of China's disastrous Cultural Revolution
in a book titled, ``Where is China Headed?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He rose to prominence in 1989, when he openly supported the
government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square. China's leaders rewarded him with public recognition, which
allowed him the freedom to operate in what is still a tiny, tightly
circumscribed private sector.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he brokered a barter between Russia and his home
province of Sichuan, swapping a few hundred railroad cars of canned
pork, garments and electronic goods for four used Tupolev-154
passenger jets. The deal reportedly netted him $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mou was a charmed man _ for a while. Banks readily loaned him
money. He was toasted as China's new breed of capitalist at the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But the barter deal may
have been the only profitable business he ever conducted. He
ricocheted from one dubious project to another, including the
proposed purchase of an aircraft carrier for China's navy. By 1995
he was working on the satellite deal and his political capital was
running out.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Rongji, then China's deputy prime minister, had begun an
austerity drive to tame double-digit inflation and rein in bank
lending. Suddenly Mou's high profile drew scrutiny from more sober
eyes. In 1996, when he was unable to repay the bank loans, the
government began seizing his assets and confiscated his passport.
He was formally arrested in January last year and charged with
fraud in November.

massacred hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Daily, 69,
seemed an ideal guide. The story led to a Pulitzer for the AP and
the unmasking of Daily. As the Army and other reporters began to
study the records, it became clear that Daily was neither the war
criminal nor war hero he claimed to be. He was never at the scene
of the massacre or even with the unit. And interviews with veterans
show that Daily, who had been chatting them up for years to develop
books, may have airbrushed himself into their memories of the war.

   BRITAIN-ALTHORP (Great Brington, England) _ It is spelled simply
enough, in just two syllables, with no strange or gimmicky
combinations of letters. But for centuries it has been grievously
mispronounced by everyone who is not anyone. And no wonder. Why
would the average person know that the word ``Althorp'' is supposed
to be pronounced AWL-trupp? That is exactly the question Earl
Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and the
owner of Althorp, the family's impressive ancestral estate next to
this tiny village, asked himself recently. In a highly
unaristocratic move, the earl announced that ``Althorp'' should
henceforth be known the way common people might think it should be
known. By Sarah Lyall.

   LEBANON-HEZBOLLAH (Bint Jbail, Lebanon) _ After liberating
southern Lebanon with rockets and bombs, the Hezbollah militia is
back here in force _ this time with an army of doctors, nurses,
veterinarians, bulldozers, agronomists and engineers. One week
after the last Israeli soldiers retreated from the rocky hillside
villages that they controlled for nearly 18 years, the business of
keeping the water pumping and the hospitals running for an
estimated 75,000 Lebanese civilians has been taken on by Hezbollah.

<P>
   The government of Northern Ireland is up and running once again,
thanks to a narrow vote of support by the Ulster Unionist Council.
But the two great sectarian factions of the North remain at odds
over symbolic and substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists were barely mollified by the Irish Republican Army's
promise May 6 to put its weapons beyond use. The IRA must give
international monitors every opportunity to examine its arms dumps
and verify that the guns are safely buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday agreement, under which the government was
formed, is based on the belief that both sides can find a way
around ancient differences. This approach ought to guide a
compromise on the issue of whether government ministers from Sinn
Fein, the IRA's party, will fly British flags above their ministry
buildings. Ministers ought to have the option of substituting a
flag based on the emblem of the Northern Ireland Assembly _ a bunch
of flax to symbolize the Ulster linen trade.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise will be more difficult on a weightier question:
reorganization of the Royal Ulster Constabulary so that it will no
longer be a weapon of unionist power. A commission headed by Chris
Patten wants to change the name to the Northern Ireland Police
Service, encourage nationalists to join, and ensure that
representatives of both communities oversee police activities.
</P>
<P>
   The British government filed a bill to implement the Patten
recommendations, but made changes that could dilute the proposed
reforms. It is especially worrisome that nationalist recruitment
quotas will last only three years (subject to renewal), instead of
the 10 proposed by Patten. Parliament will consider the bill for
several months. The final version has to be unambiguous in support
of a force acceptable to the majority of people in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The signatories to the Good Friday agreement considered policing
too volatile an issue for the new Northern Ireland government. The
revival of the government this week will create a climate of
political dialogue that is essential to attracting nationalists to
the force. Peace is coming slowly to Northern Ireland _ slowly but
steadily.

PUNISHING FUJIMORI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who was reelected Sunday to
a third term in an election roundly lamented as unfair and
illegitimate, is a tough nut and should not be expected to crack
easily when confronted with criticism from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying issue in Peru's sham election is not the
personality or the politics of Fujimori. Indeed, he has used his
power to bring an unprecedented number of schools, health clinics,
and roads to the poor of Peru, and polls suggest he probably would
have won a fair election if Peru's Elections Board, staffed with
his loyalists, had postponed Sunday's runoff, as international
observers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's flouting of foreign election observers is significant
because it may be a sign that the democratic tide that has been
rising for a decade in Latin America has started to ebb. In
comparison with that prospect, the computer flaws in Peru's
electoral process are secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign monitors were certainly justified in asking that
Sunday's second round of balloting be delayed so they could
determine how newly installed computer software came up with 1.4
million more ballots cast than eligible voters during the first
round of voting April 9. But the perverting of democratic process
in Peru goes much deeper. It starts with Fujimori replacing
high-court judges so that he could change the constitution to
permit himself a third term. His domination of the media and his
refusal to accept the advice of international election monitors
completed the tableau of a power-drunk Fujimori mocking democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fujimori recently rescheduled much of Peru's foreign
debt and because economic sanctions could have unwelcome effects on
surrounding Andean nations, Washington and its allies in the
Organization of American States ought to try political rather than
commercial methods of chastising Fujimori, much as the European
Union did after the neo-fascist Jorg Haider entered a governing
coalition in Austria. The punishment of Fujimori should be
multilateral, depriving his government of OAS positions and
prerogatives. The OAS should be a club for democracies, one in
which Fujimori can no longer be treated as a member in good
standing.

store had to cancel its long-planned opening after the city of
Agoura Hills refused to issue a certificate of occupancy. Store
owners say the city reneged on its agreement while Agoura Hills
officials said Reed's hadn't complied with all the rules and

ALEXANDER TRIES DEFILING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sitcom writer could make this up _ unless, perhaps, he was a
direct descendent of Rod Serling.
</P>
<P>
   George Costanza _ or someone who looks and sounds alarmingly
like him _ rigs up a homemade bomb and holes himself up in a
library, threatening to blow the building (and himself) to
smithereens unless his not-so-Seinfeldian demands are met. (We'll
get to those demands in a second.) &QL; 
And who comes in to talk him out of it? Looks like an older,
wearier version of Lt. Columbo.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find proof that stage drama is actually stranger than
syndicated TV at the Geffen Playhouse where Jason Alexander (of
``Seinfeld'') and Peter Falk (``Columbo'') are playing fanatical
librarian and crisis negotiator respectively in the world premiere
of Lee Kalcheim's play, ``Defiled,'' which opens tonight.
</P>
<P>
   A suspense-driven, two-character play that confronts the
scariness of technology gone haywire, ``Defiled'' wasn't written as
Costanza vs. Columbo but pardon us if we hear some familiar echoes
from the dialogue and mannerisms of Harry Mendelssohn, the edgy
librarian and Detective Brian Dickey, the sandbagging cop.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, Harry's smarter than George. Well read, well
spoken and in possession of technology to cause major damage, this
librarian is somebody you could see yourself having a lengthy
conversation or debate with. Under calmer circumstances, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright guy. He's brighter than I am,'' Alexander says
over a rehearsal break dinner at a nearby Chinese restaurant.
``There's a lot going on with this guy, and there's just conditions
upon conditions upon conditions. Suicide is a big condition and the
amount of conviction he has about the why of it all. You can say
the words, but they have to mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have to do a lot of work, thinking about what am I
really fighting for here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a word: he's fighting progress, the type of advancements that
only a computers could create. The book tracking system in Harry's
library is about to be computerized, meaning the card files
(remember those?) will be purged. Harry wants those cards to stay.
More than that, he wants the ease and convenience the cards
represent not to be, well, defiled. If not, kaboom! And Harry won't
negotiate, not even with a good hearted plain talking cop like
Detective Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system works, it is fast. And it is personal. It is
perfect,'' Harry says during one of several long speeches. ``Why
change it just to change?''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily a techno-phobe, Alexander says he can
nonetheless relate to Harry's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet, for all its good, could be the undoing
of civilization,'' he says. ``I think it becomes potentially a
replacement for actual experiences which is part of the thesis of
this play. I think technology is ahead of our ability to use it
ethically and morally, so I have some of the concerns that the
character has about the dehumanization that we're going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who joins the conversation a little later, agrees. He is,
after all, a man who possesses a Masters degree but confesses that
he is too intimidated to make a long distance call from an airport.
What does it say about the convenience of the information age, he
wonders, if you have to remember 15 different telephone numbers
(phone, office phone, office fax, new area codes.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet? Don't get him started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few times that I have ever gone on the Internet, I was
surprised at how superficial the information was,'' says Falk, 72.
``There's this terrific book I've been wanting to read for 30 or 40
years about ants and termites and termitaries. I looked that up on
the Internet to find out more about it, all I got was superficial
information. You have to read the book! You read the book, you'll
know something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are intimidated by technology,'' he
adds, sounding a bit like Harry Mendelssohn. ``They don't know how
it works, and half of the time it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who last appeared on an L.A. stage 15 years ago, first
came across ``Defiled'' during a series of readings run by the
Coronet Theatre. Twice he participated in non-staged readings of
``Defiled'' opposite Woody Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   Very early, Falk found himself hooked, both on the relationship
that develops between the two very different characters, and on the
play's themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating play with a subject that everybody is
thinking about,'' Falk says. ``There is nobody alive on this planet
who hasn't thought about the things we're talking about in this
play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Falk's participation in the premiere of ``Defiled'' was a
given, Alexander's was less certain. When director Barnet Kellman
first sent him a copy of the play, Alexander had convinced himself
that stage work wasn't currently an option. Despite his theatrical
background _ including a Tony award for ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway'' and an appearance in the Reprise! version of ``Promises,
Promises'' at UCLA _ Alexander said stage roles aren't convenient
when you've got a young family to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The busy actor/producer will appear as Boris Badenov in ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' this summer, and he'll return
to television in a new series he's developing for Fox in 2001. But
movie and television projects have convenient or short term
schedules that can be worked around school routines and vacations.
Not so a five-week run in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love musicals and I love the theater, but what everything is
weighed against these days is fatherhood,'' said Alexander, 40, who
has two sons, ages 8 and 4. ``So the material has to be so
worthwhile that I can look my sons in the eye and say, `I gotta do
this. Everybody kind of has to do something for their soul now and
then. I gotta do this.''' If the material doesn't hold up to that,
there isn't a conversation to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Defiled,'' he says, the conversation was worth having.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really intrigued with the story and flattered at the
idea of being asked to play the character and also a little
intimidated by it. It had been a while since I had found something
that I really cared about. So I talked to my wife, and said, `This
could be a good thing.' She read it, and she said, `You need to do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing has been an intriguing, and, by all accounts, a
successful one. The two actors, both East Coast born and raised
(Falk in New York City, Alexander in New Jersey), say they have
enjoyed working with _ and, in some cases, against _ each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with his emotional availability,'' Falk says
of Alexander, ``his ability to generate genuine emotion very early
and his flexibility in terms of the various attitudes that this
character has to take. It's nice to be engaged when the other actor
forces you to be engaged. When you really hear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make a joke, but it was largely true, that I never
HEARD another actor, but I hear (Alexander).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being very gracious,'' replies Alexander. ``At the same
time, I have to come loaded for bear because you don't walk into
the first rehearsal with this little time and with an actor whose
work you respect, you don't walk in and say `Well, let's see what
happens.' You gotta show up. You gotta show up when they're that
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus there was another consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter is my father's favorite actor, you know,'' Alexander
says. ``He's unimpressed that I'm doing this play, but he's very
impressed that I'm working with Peter Falk. His advice to me is,
`Don't screw him up.''' &QL;

COMMENTARY: TRUTH IN ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh no, not another column on Social Security! But the mailbag
suggests that the issue needs one more go-round, because some
readers still think Social Security is just a pension fund _ one
that compares unfavorably with private retirement plans. And it's
true that lately it is being run more like such a fund than before.
But the many decades in which it was run on a pay-as-you-go basis
hang heavily over the system's prospects, and any honest plan for
reform must come to grips with that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its existence, Social Security was basically
``unfunded'': it didn't invest the contributions workers paid in,
it simply paid them out to retirees. This hand-to-mouth operation
worked because the nation's working population was steadily
growing; so each generation, when it reached retirement age, could
count on being supported by a much larger generation of workers.
For those who worked in the system's early years it was a terrific
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But baby boom was followed by baby bust. In the decades ahead, a
huge number of retirees will need to be supported by a rather small
number of workers. Pay-as-you-go would require either slashing
benefits, sharply increasing required contributions, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Of course officials have known for a while that this was coming,
and they actually _ surprise! _ took some responsible precautions.
In 1977 required contributions were increased without a
corresponding increase in benefits, and as a result the system has
been steadily accumulating a fund that will greatly delay the date
at which it runs out of money. But the fund still isn't big enough,
and the increased contributions mean that the implied rate of
return for today's workers is low compared with what they could get
if they were free to invest their money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that low return, once again, is not that the
Social Security Administration is a lousy investor; it's that
today's workers must over-contribute because previous generations
of Americans didn't put in enough to finance their own retirement.
It's a legacy of the pay-as-you-go past.
</P>
<P>
   Now what could a politician who wants to let workers invest
their own money honestly propose? He might say: ``I think that
workers should be free to invest their own money. Of course, that
means that we won't have enough money coming into the Social
Security system to pay the benefits currently offered to Americans
over 65; so I'm slashing those benefits, starting today. After all,
the future belongs to the young!'' Before making that proposal,
however, the politician should learn a trade; he's going to be
looking for another job very soon.
</P>
<P>
   Or he might say: ``I think that workers should be free to invest
some of their contributions, say 15 percent, on their own. Of
course, we have to maintain the benefits of today's retirees. So in
return for giving today's workers the privilege of investing 15
percent of their contributions, I'm going to cut their guaranteed
benefits by a lot more than 15 percent _ 30 percent, 40 percent,
whatever it takes to keep the system actuarially sound. I believe
that today's workers can make enough money in the stock market to
compensate. And if you can't, my fellow Americans, that's your
problem!''
</P>
<P>
   That, as far as I can make out, is what George W. Bush is
actually proposing _ though he has been more than vague about the
details. He hasn't specified how much guaranteed benefits would be
cut, let alone clearly stated that the percentage cut would have to
be a lot larger than the share of contributions workers were freed
to invest. (The plan described by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
The New York Times on May 30 would in effect impose cuts on that
scale, mainly through reduced cost-of-living adjustments and
increased taxes on benefits).
</P>
<P>
   What a politician can't honestly say is something like, ``Even
if a worker chose only the safest investment in the world, an
inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond, he or she would receive
twice the rate of return of Social Security'' _ as if that were a
meaningful comparison, as if the obligations to today's older
Americans didn't have to be met. But that quote isn't made up _
it's what Bush actually said.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that he'd never be able to get away with it if
Al Gore were still alive.

KINDER, GENTLER WORKPLACE HAS REPLACED THE ERA OF THE TOUGH BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ind., Mich., Miss.) By AMY ZIPKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every few weeks, some Silicon Valley startup tries to lure Mary
Morse, a software engineer, away from Autodesk Inc. a
computer-aided design company in San Rafael, Calif. At least one of
them has dangled an options package that could have made her rich
by now.
</P>
<P>
   But Morse invariably says thanks, but no thanks. The reason she
is staying put, she says, is simple: She likes her bosses.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here for managers that they will ignore at
their peril in the current job market. Being a tough guy might have
worked a decade ago when corporate America was downsizing and
laying off workers by the millions. But that era, exemplified by
Albert J. ``Chainsaw Al'' Dunlap, the roving chief executive who
boasted about how many people he had fired in order to raise his
companies' stock price, is over.
</P>
<P>
   The American workplace has evolved into a kinder, gentler phase.
With unemployment at a 30-year low, bosses realize that they have
to do more than pay good salaries and lavish perks on their
employees if they want to keep them. They also have to be nice to
them.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes a Gallup Organization study that shows that most
workers rate having a caring boss even higher than money or fringe
benefits. In interviews with 2 million employees at 700 companies,
Gallup found that how long employees stay at companies and how
productive they are is determined by their relationship with the
immediate supervisor. ``People join companies and leave managers,''
said Marcus Buckingham, a senior managing consultant at Gallup and
the primary analyst for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's two-year career at Autodesk is Exhibit A for that
reality. She has worked under several managers so far, she said,
and they have all gone out of their way to please her. The first
one guided her through a six-month internship, accommodating her
college schedule and providing time off for finals. The second
sealed her loyalty to the company by insisting on paying her $5,000
more than she requested as her starting salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he said without saying it was, `You're more
valuable than even that and I'm going to give you what your worth,'
'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then that manager's supervisor approached her unexpectedly and
asked to be her mentor _ an offer that she says filled her with
``shock, amazement and delight.''
</P>
<P>
   She accepted, and the supervisor asked her to draw up a list of
short-term and long-term goals. Then, she provided her with a list
of training courses, both inside and outside the company, that
would help her meet those objectives. And finally, she contacted
Morse's boss to make sure he would give her the time off to take
the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Enter boss No. 3, David Lein, Autodesk's automation manager.
Lein, Morse said, summoned her to his office from time to time to
discuss her career hopes. After she completed a project for the
redesign of a large piece of computer code, he asked her what she
wanted to do next. When she said she wanted to be a software
engineer, he recommended classes and gave her the time off to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Lein got together with other managers to arrange
for her transfer to a testing position, even though she lacked the
experience that was supposedly required for the position. While not
technically a promotion, the job required more expertise than her
previous one and was a logical step to a higher-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   All the kindness she has received over the last two years, Morse
says, is literally worth a million dollars to her. Before she
joined Autodesk, and again nine months after her arrival, she was
wooed by a telecommunications company that specializes in
high-speed data transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, she says, the company had not yet gone public and
offered her 7,000 stock options at an exercise price of less than
$1 a share. She was tempted, but rejected the offer after she was
told that although she had career aspirations for software
development, the company would not honor them. The interviewer told
her, she said, ``If I hire you, you'll remain here in testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Had she accepted, she would be sitting on options worth $1
million at the current stock price. But she has no regrets. People
at the company that wanted to hire her tell her they are bored and
frustrated. ``The general feeling is that they are putting in their
time,'' waiting for their options to be vested so they can bail
out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And friends at other Silicon Valley firms complain to her that
they have trouble getting up in the morning, telling her, she says:
``This thing worked out great, but I'm miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Workplace specialists say Morse's experience is not unusual _
nor is the unhappiness of her acquaintances at other companies. The
No. 1 reason people quit their jobs, they say, is dissatisfaction
with their supervisors, not their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a tight labor market for employers to think though
the social contract they are striking with people,'' says Charles
A. O'Reilly III, visiting professor at the Harvard Business School
and co-author ``Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve
Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People,'' which is to be
published this year by the Harvard Business School Press. ``When
job opportunities are plentiful, people with crummy bosses leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are four times more likely to leave than are
people with nice bosses, according to a 1999 study conducted
jointly by Spherion, a staffing and consulting firm in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and Lou Harris Associates. In the survey, only 11
percent of employees who rated their supervisor's performance as
excellent said they were likely to look for a job in the next year,
while 40 percent of those who rated their supervisors' performance
as poor were likely to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are plenty of bosses out there with mean
streaks, especially in highly competitive industries like
movie-making or macho strongholds like oil. Scott B. MacKenzie, a
professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business who has
studied workplace behavior for several years, says ``jerks'' can
still rise to the top if they are stellar performers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, being nice to employees is not a magic potion against
defections. The big layoffs of the late 1980's and early 90's all
but destroyed the tradition of loyalty to the company and replaced
it with a new culture of job-hopping. ``With downsizing, companies
began saying, `Don't expect a long-term future here, but keep your
skills up-to-date,''' says Mark Roehling, a professor at the
Haworth School of Business at Western Michigan University.
Employees complied, he says, with the result that many will leave
as soon as a better offer comes along.
</P>
<P>
   What should a company that is plagued by defections do? Change
its ways, advises B. Lynn Ware, an industrial psychologist who
heads Integral Training Systems in Menlo Park, Calif. If a company
learns that a valued employee is disgruntled, it should discuss it
with him. ``You should say something like, `I really want you to
have a better work experience than you've had recently,' '' Dr.
Ware says.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-economy companies are training managers in the art of
benevolence. Macy's West, a division of Federated Department
Stores, based in San Francisco, recently began a pilot program of
assigning mentors to new managers _ and telling all managers that
up to 35 percent of their compensation would be linked to how well
they retain the people under them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has apparently encouraged managers to be more
accommodating to employees' needs. Ellen Murrin, a group sales
manager for women's ready-to-wear clothing, for example, said she
was now more likely to grant requests for schedule changes and time
off than she used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are also pushing their managers to be
friendlier. An International Paper plant in Moss Point, Miss.,
holds morning training sessions on positive reinforcement, and
David Sulik, a paper-machine superintendent, says they have changed
his ways.
</P>
<P>
   He used to hover and watch for mistakes. As a compliment, he
would offer a pat on the back or a curt, ``Good job.'' Now, he has
cut back on the criticism and become more effusive in his praise,
even writing the occasional thank you note to an employee for an
exceptional performance. He also chats with workers more than he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they trust me more than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that trust can pay off. Lein, the manager at Autodesk who
went to bat for Morse, says that he too has had to resist
entreaties from other high-technology companies. He averages two
job offers a week, to say nothing of an avalanche of 200 e-mail
pitches from headhunters that he filters out with a software
program that spots telltale words.
</P>
<P>
   His reason for staying is similar to Morse's. When he looks
around Silicon Valley, he says, ``I see people burning out,
companies going under and never making it to the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   `` Maybe I'm a bit of an anomaly,'' he adds. ``Job satisfaction
and being challenged means as much to me as the money part of it _
just so as long as I feel rewarded.''

SCHOLARS URGE ASIAN-AMERICANS NOT TO APPLY AT NUCLEAR LABS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.M., Calif.)  (Eds.: Absence of hyphenation in Asian American organizations is
cq.) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Objecting to what it sees as racial discrimination, a national
organization of scholars and educators has formally called upon
Asian-Americans to boycott federal nuclear laboratories by not
applying for jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called the Association for Asian American Studies, is
objecting to the treatment of Wen Ho Lee, a former government
scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets, and to the
application of security rules to Asian-American scientists who
remain in federal laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which called for the action on Friday, is the
second scholarly organization this year to urge Asian-American
scientists to boycott the federal labs, which are run by the U.S.
Department of Energy. In March, a California-based organization
called Asian Pacific Americans in Higher Education called for a
similar boycott, citing closely related grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Because Asians and Asian-Americans make up more than a quarter
of all doctorates awarded in science and technology by American
universities each year, the impact on the federal laboratories
could be serious if young scientists decided to heed the
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of case touches a very raw nerve,'' said Stephen H.
Sumida, a professor of American Ethnic Studies at the University of
Washington in Seattle and past president of the Association for
Asian American Studies. ``I think everybody in the organization
knows that the `suspect pattern' of the treatment of
Asian-Americans goes back to the internment of Japanese Americans
in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the reaction among Asian-American scientists inside the
labs to the earlier resolution has been mixed, it has been the
subject of intense discussion and debate, as well as a source of
concern in the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake, it's counterproductive and it will not
be effective in terms of achieving its original objective,'' said
Jeremy Wu, the Energy Department's national ombudsman, who deals
with workplace issues like diversity and equal opportunity. Because
the boycott could reduce Asian-American participation at the labs,
Wu said, ``it certainly will hurt those who are fighting against
racial profiling in the department right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sumida said the boycott resolution was approved by an
overwhelming majority of about 250 members of the association who
voted on it during a national meeting in Scottsdale, Ariz. The
association has about 700 members in academic departments around
the nation, he said. The membership, which is about three-quarters
Asian-American, is concentrated in humanities departments but also
includes scholars in mathematics and the physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been charged with illegally downloading American nuclear
secrets onto unsecure computers and portable tapes. He has been
largely kept in an isolated cell while awaiting his trial,
scheduled for the fall, although more recently he has been allowed
to travel in shackles to review evidence in the case with his
lawyers. Even though Lee has not been charged with espionage, the
government has said that to free him would be to risk his
disclosing the location of the tapes, seven of which are missing,
to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution asserts that Lee, a former scientist at the
Energy Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory was singled out
for prosecution solely because of his race and treated with undue
harshness during his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Those claims were rejected by Myron Marlin, a Justice Department
spokesman. ``The indictment charges Mr. Lee unlawfully created
computer tapes containing some of our most sensitive nuclear
secrets, and now several of those tapes are missing,'' Marlin said.
``It's a serious charge and the proper place for this now is in the
courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the earlier boycott resolution has had an effect on the
labs is hard to determine. Jim Danneskiold, a spokesman for Los
Alamos, said that the number of Asian scientists applying for
postdoctoral positions at the lab had dropped significantly even
before the March boycott resolution, but that Asians and
Asian-Americans were still applying and being hired.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticisms of the resolutions, L. Ling-chi Wang,
chairman of the Department of Ethnic Studies and director of the
Asian American Studies Program at the University of California at
Berkeley, who helped introduce both resolutions, says that the
threat of withdrawing Asian-American talent from the labs is the
best available way to make their concerns widely known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully intend to use the resolution to send a very, very
strong message to our government that we do not appreciate the way
that we are being treated as Americans,'' he said. ``At the heart
of it is that the Asian-Americans' civil rights are being
violated.''

   A suspense-driven, two-character play that confronts the
scariness of technology gone haywire, ``Defiled'' wasn't written as
Costanza vs. Columbo but pardon us if we hear some familiar echoes
from the dialogue and mannerisms of Harry Mendelssohn, the edgy
librarian and Detective Brian Dickey, the sandbagging cop.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, Harry's smarter than George. Well read, well
spoken and in possession of technology to cause major damage, this
librarian is somebody you could see yourself having a lengthy
conversation or debate with. Under calmer circumstances, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright guy. He's brighter than I am,'' Alexander says
over a rehearsal break dinner at a nearby Chinese restaurant.
``There's a lot going on with this guy, and there's just conditions
upon conditions upon conditions. Suicide is a big condition and the
amount of conviction he has about the why of it all. You can say
the words, but they have to mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have to do a lot of work, thinking about what am I
really fighting for here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a word: he's fighting progress, the type of advancements that
only a computers could create. The book tracking system in Harry's
library is about to be computerized, meaning the card files
(remember those?) will be purged. Harry wants those cards to stay.
More than that, he wants the ease and convenience the cards
represent not to be, well, defiled. If not, kaboom! And Harry won't
negotiate, not even with a good hearted plain talking cop like
Detective Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system works, it is fast. And it is personal. It is
perfect,'' Harry says during one of several long speeches. ``Why
change it just to change?''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily a techno-phobe, Alexander says he can
nonetheless relate to Harry's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet, for all its good, could be the undoing
of civilization,'' he says. ``I think it becomes potentially a
replacement for actual experiences which is part of the thesis of
this play. I think technology is ahead of our ability to use it
ethically and morally, so I have some of the concerns that the
character has about the dehumanization that we're going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who joins the conversation a little later, agrees. He is,
after all, a man who possesses a Masters degree but confesses that
he is too intimidated to make a long distance call from an airport.
What does it say about the convenience of the information age, he
wonders, if you have to remember 15 different telephone numbers
(phone, office phone, office fax, new area codes.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet? Don't get him started.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few times that I have ever gone on the Internet, I was
surprised at how superficial the information was,'' says Falk, 72.
``There's this terrific book I've been wanting to read for 30 or 40
years about ants and termites and termitaries. I looked that up on
the Internet to find out more about it, all I got was superficial
information. You have to read the book! You read the book, you'll
know something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are intimidated by technology,'' he
adds, sounding a bit like Harry Mendelssohn. ``They don't know how
it works, and half of the time it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who last appeared on an L.A. stage 15 years ago, first
came across ``Defiled'' during a series of readings run by the
Coronet Theatre. Twice he participated in non-staged readings of
``Defiled'' opposite Woody Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   Very early, Falk found himself hooked, both on the relationship
that develops between the two very different characters, and on the
play's themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating play with a subject that everybody is
thinking about,'' Falk says. ``There is nobody alive on this planet
who hasn't thought about the things we're talking about in this
play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Falk's participation in the premiere of ``Defiled'' was a
given, Alexander's was less certain. When director Barnet Kellman
first sent him a copy of the play, Alexander had convinced himself
that stage work wasn't currently an option. Despite his theatrical
background _ including a Tony award for ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway'' and an appearance in the Reprise! version of ``Promises,
Promises'' at UCLA _ Alexander said stage roles aren't convenient
when you've got a young family to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The busy actor/producer will appear as Boris Badenov in ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' this summer, and he'll return
to television in a new series he's developing for Fox in 2001. But
movie and television projects have convenient or short term
schedules that can be worked around school routines and vacations.
Not so a five-week run in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love musicals and I love the theater, but what everything is
weighed against these days is fatherhood,'' said Alexander, 40, who
has two sons, ages 8 and 4. ``So the material has to be so
worthwhile that I can look my sons in the eye and say, `I gotta do
this. Everybody kind of has to do something for their soul now and
then. I gotta do this.''' If the material doesn't hold up to that,
there isn't a conversation to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Defiled,'' he says, the conversation was worth having.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really intrigued with the story and flattered at the
idea of being asked to play the character and also a little
intimidated by it. It had been a while since I had found something
that I really cared about. So I talked to my wife, and said, `This
could be a good thing.' She read it, and she said, `You need to do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing has been an intriguing, and, by all accounts, a
successful one. The two actors, both East Coast born and raised
(Falk in New York City, Alexander in New Jersey), say they have
enjoyed working with _ and, in some cases, against _ each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with his emotional availability,'' Falk says
of Alexander, ``his ability to generate genuine emotion very early
and his flexibility in terms of the various attitudes that this
character has to take. It's nice to be engaged when the other actor
forces you to be engaged. When you really hear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make a joke, but it was largely true, that I never
HEARD another actor, but I hear (Alexander).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being very gracious,'' replies Alexander. ``At the same
time, I have to come loaded for bear because you don't walk into
the first rehearsal with this little time and with an actor whose
work you respect, you don't walk in and say `Well, let's see what
happens.' You gotta show up. You gotta show up when they're that
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus there was another consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter is my father's favorite actor, you know,'' Alexander
says. ``He's unimpressed that I'm doing this play, but he's very
impressed that I'm working with Peter Falk. His advice to me is,
`Don't screw him up.''' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ This is crazy _ and very, very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in Texas has ruled that the Agriculture Department has
no legal authority to enforce modern scientific standards of meat
inspection, which were approved five years ago by Congress after a
bitter partisan fight.
</P>
<P>
   That judicial nitwit held that a meat processing plant showing
unacceptably high levels of contamination with salmonella bacteria
could not be closed down by federal inspectors. If little kids get
sick from eating diseased hamburgers, that's not the industry's
fault, U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish in effect concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives loathe the very concept of government
regulation on grounds that it unduly burdens the functioning of the
free marketplace. American consumers are supposed to be on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The meat processing industry stalled the new inspection system,
which detects dangerous microbes through modern scientific testing
methods, for 15 years after its development. The industry was aided
by anti-regulation Republican allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But public outrage and scary salmonella outbreaks finally forced
the GOP in 1995 to stop defending a 90-year-old system that
depended on seeing and smelling rotten carcasses. That year, when
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, then a presidential candidate,
conceded defeat, he complained he was being accused unfairly of
wanting to feed people ``dirty meat.'' He had been seen as putting
the principle of saving money for a big campaign-contributing
industry, which would have to install new equipment and retrain
workers, ahead of saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   Safeguarding public health is not some plot hatched by
overzealous socialists to hamstring honest businesses. It is the
minimum a responsible country can do to protect the well-being of
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials should never forget they have been given their
power to use it for the public good, not the good of vested
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Fish is trying to accomplish from the bench what
Congress could not do in defiance of the public good. He strained
mightily to rationalize his decision that flunking three tests for
salmonella contamination did not prove that the Supreme Beef
Processors' plant in Dallas had sanitation problems that warranted
its closing. The contamination could have occurred before the meat
got to the plant, Fish explained.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of this escapes those of us who think dirty food is
directly related to being processed in dirty places. And if the
plants weren't dirty when the food got there, the contaminated food
would certainly spread germs to the machinery when it was ground,
and they would be passed along to future batches. And what was the
plant doing accepting dirty food without checking on its purity in
the first place?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being closed by inspectors, the plant was also
forced to recall 180,000 pounds of ground beef because a sample
tested positive for E. coli bacteria, which can be a big killer.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge's convoluted ruling stands, it could undermine the
standards now protecting meat consumption all over the country and
force a return to the antiquated poke-and-sniff system.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fish's decision applies directly only to the northern
district of Texas, it may have consequences across the country.
Plants elsewhere may be emboldened to challenge the federal system.
</P>
<P>
   Before its troubles, Supreme Beef had a contract with the
Agriculture Department to supply hamburger for federal school lunch
programs in many states. Parents did not know their kids were
threatened with foul hamburgers and possible sickness. Surely the
federal government was right in stopping the plant's operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department will appeal Fish's ruling. Most other
plants have had no trouble complying with the new tests. Ninety
percent of the larger companies and 84 percent of the small ones
have already installed systems to keep salmonella-tainted beef out
of their plants.
</P>
<P>
   One political argument against the upgraded testing system used
to be that the danger of salmonella was being exaggerated. But this
illness is not fun. It can be deadly for infants and tots, the
elderly and those with weakened immune systems. About 600 deaths
and 1.4 million illnesses were attributed to salmonellosis last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional approval of overdue modernization of the meat and
poultry inspection system was a near thing. If it hadn't been for
Dole's concern about getting an anti-consumer image as he went into
a presidential campaign, the processing industry might have
succeeded in quietly burying the new high-tech regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, under public pressure the majority leader called off
his troops who were ready to block the new rules. Dole confessed to
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a fellow Kansan, that he didn't
want any more ``food fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's GOP presidential heir-apparent, George W. Bush, whose
home state is the focus of the new controversy, is unlikely to want
any food fights either.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could quickly pass legislation to reassert and bolster
the administration's power to enforce its inspection standards,
bypassing the political limbo of a long judicial appeals process.
It would be a powerful pro-consumer demonstration. But there will
be no pressure from Bush on the Republican majority to do so, and
you can bet it won't.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a group of rap legends and Harlem-based artists
announced last month that they would be mounting a Broadway-style
musical in the landmark Apollo Theater, the show was presented not
only as an indicator of Harlem's economic and cultural renewal, but
as the birth of a virtually new theatrical genre as well: the
hip-hop musical.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is ever simple when it comes to exploring an
embryonic artistic form, or, for that matter, stretching the
borders of artistic expression in Harlem. The Apollo has never been
known as a venue for plays. And while hip-hop may have invaded
every other aspect of culture, it has not yet established a place
for itself on the American stage.
</P>
<P>
   The play, ``Echo Park,'' opens Thursday. It has drawn on rap
legends and community resources like the National Black Theater and
the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, and it looks to set down a
version of hip-hop history at a time when the genre, now more than
20 years old, is given more and more to reflection and
historiography. As with almost any theatrical production, this one
has had its share of artistic struggles, sleepless nights and
financial headaches, but ``Echo Park'' also comes to the stage
bearing the burden of trying something that has not been done
before.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the curtain was to rise, the big dance numbers
were almost seamless, with break dancers leaping effortlessly into
back flips and diving across the stage into head spins, and the
rappers hitting their marks dead on. But the director was lamenting
that the dramatic scenes verged on lethargy, and the producers were
still worrying about the financial troubles of a venture that must
turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The first installment of a trilogy that traces the genre's
history since 1978, ``Echo Park'' is a would-be ``Hair'' for the
hip-hop generation, chronicling the rise of a rough-hewn cultural
form from the neglected parks and train yards of Harlem and the
Bronx to a multibillion-dollar industry. The cast includes the rap
luminaries Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Caz and D.J. Hollywood, but the
producers, Lifted Productions, also took a grass-roots approach,
enlisting graffiti writers to design the set, city B-boys for
break-dancing parts and untested neighborhood actors for other
roles.
</P>
<P>
   The producers, who regard this presentation of Echo Park as a
work in progress, have held ticket prices to $20 to $35 and have
not invited critics to the one-month run at the Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get input from the community and improve it so it's
ready for a tour, or going overseas, or maybe going to Broadway,''
said Eric H. Vinson, the executive producer. ``The idea is to get
an affirmation from the Harlem community, because, if you've ever
watched `Amateur Night at the Apollo,' you know how hard the
audiences there can be. That's the real test for us.''

   BATON ROUGE, La. _ I suffer from shopping anxiety, no doubt
because nothing looks good on me now that I'm past the age I never
thought it was possible to be in the first place. But it doesn't
really matter these days anyway, since most women's clothing seems
to be designed for skinny 14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, every once in a while, when my children say
something like, ``Hey, Mom, the '60s are over,'' as they did a
couple of weeks ago, I jump in the minivan and drive to the mall
looking for something to update my wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't do well. At the Gap, the store I've relied on for years
to supply me with blue jeans in progressively bigger sizes and
white T-shirts in a seemingly inexhaustible variety, I could find
nothing but capris _ those tight, above-the-ankle pants that have
spread from coast to coast like some terrifying virus.
</P>
<P>
   Capri pants and the little cropped shirts designed to go with
them hung on every hanger, in brilliant yellow, magenta, purple
passion, lollipop lime and poppy red. I tried on a few pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look cute,'' the saleswoman said as I emerged in one after
another pair of the tiny pants and the matching little tops that
made me look like a linebacker in fancy dress or, more accurately,
a fairly thin, 5-foot-4, middle-aged mom pushing the envelope in a
big, big way. Who was she kidding?
</P>
<P>
   The things weren't even comfortable to begin with, let alone
cheap. And what was with my calves, anyway? Why did they look so _
large? My legs are thin, so thin that in high school my best friend
called me ``Stick Legs,'' and I used our own '60s fashion
must-have, Frye boots, to hide them.
</P>
<P>
   But now I feel ... what is the word? Old? Dowdy? But I'm none of
the above. Thus I pushed on: Banana Republic, Urban Outfitters, the
Limited, Old Navy, Sears. I also needed a bathing suit, but how can
a woman locate a bathing suit when the entire mall seems devoted to
capri pants?
</P>
<P>
   What is it with the fashion industry, anyway? Because, suddenly,
I saw capri pants not just in the mall, but everywhere: at the
grocery store, on the mothers of my children's friends, on my
neighbors, and on the women who gathered recently at a fancy art
opening for another friend, who was also wearing capri pants.
Perhaps, I thought, this was just one of those fashion trends that
catches on only among gullible people in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, it seems that actual urban sophisticates, professional
women with cell phones and expense accounts, are wearing them, too.
My sister, who lives on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and is a
lawyer, reports that Zabar's is full of capri-clad women, and that
at her law firm, they have become a staple of casual Friday
wardrobes. Lawyers in capris? In Manhattan? Don't they know we're
wearing them on the Bayou, too?
</P>
<P>
   Even my own 6-year-old daughter has a pair. Actually, she is the
one person I know who looks good in them. After all, they were made
for her.

THE HIGH PRICE OF `ENGAGING' RUSSIA

 By ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Air Force One scheduled to land in Moscow
later this week, President Clinton still has not faced the fact
that his policy of ``engagement'' with Russia has become a colossal
disappointment. But in his visit to Moscow, he will encounter that
reality face to face, when he is greeted by President Vladimir
Putin, a former colonel in the KGB, the son of a party apparatchik
as well of the grandson of a trusted member of Lenin's and then
Stalin's personal detail.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be said that in the area of relations with Russia,
Clinton deserves some credit. The denuclearization of Ukraine and
Belarus and the reductions of strategic forces by both the United
States and Russia were negotiated with persistence and success.
Ukraine's independence has been strongly supported. The United
States expanded its relations with independent states in the
southern Caucasus and Central Asia. Most important, under Clinton's
leadership, NATO was enlarged eastward, and the administration has
pledged to continue that expansion, including the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the policy of ``engagement'' with Russia
has deteriorated into a one-sided courtship. No longer is the
Clinton administration striking a balance between positive
inducements and negative pressures. The administration not only
endorsed Boris Yeltsin's bombardment of the Russian Parliament in
1993, but persisted in hailing Yeltsin as a tested democrat, even
though his erratic presidency was a mixture of anarchy and
authoritarianism. Sadly, doing so discredited the very meaning of
the word democracy in the eyes of many Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The policy of engagement hit a low with Putin. Though his
election in March was precipitated by an arrangement whereby
Yeltsin resigned the presidency and Putin became acting president,
and no real alternative candidate was available to the Russian
people, the White House praised the election, hailing it as the
country's first democratic transfer of power in Russia's nearly
1,000-year existence. It even hailed Putin himself as a
``reformer,'' despite some justifiable concern about his
background. Putin's prompt appointment of five secret police and
military officials _ one is widely known as a specialist in
suppressing dissent _ as supergovernors was quietly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading up to this ``election,'' the Clinton
administration financially supported and promoted economic reforms
in Russia that enriched only a few, including some top Russian
leaders. The resulting pervasive corruption was simply ignored
until Western and Russian news media exposed it _ and even then,
the administration did not alter its policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration excused and even justified two
Russian wars against the Chechen people. Clinton compared the
Russian campaign to Lincoln's efforts to preserve American unity
and proclaimed, to widespread criticism, that the war's objective
was ``to liberate Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit this weekend, if not handled properly, poses new
risks. First, Clinton, in his eagerness to embrace a ``democratic''
Russia, could reach a hastily contrived agreement regarding missile
defense that may undermine stable strategic deterrence while
prompting allied disunity. Such a quick deal _ designed as a
defense against North Korea _ could precipitate Chinese efforts to
upgrade their nuclear forces and ignite allied fears that the
United States is seeking security for itself alone.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Putin could seek to enlist the United States in his
effort to assume the role of protector of the Central Asian regimes
against fundamentalist pressures emanating from Afghanistan. He
would like support for a Russian-sponsored anti-Islamic coalition
that would regain a dominant role for Russia in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must not once again be so hasty in extolling the new
Russian president as a democratic reformer. A dose of dignified
restraint, based on a realistic assessment of where Russia is
headed, could help redeem a policy of ``engagement'' that has
gradually lost its way. It is not too late.

 NEW YORK: for us.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The project was born two and a half years ago, when Kelly Scott,
a former model and actor who has appeared in small parts in
television sitcoms including ``Martin'' and ``Living Single,''
teamed up with Sean Couch, a former NBA basketball player and,
later, a financial analyst for such Wall Street firms as
PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Couch and Scott were both working on an all-black
production of the Maxwell Anderson play ``The Bad Seed'' at the
Victoria Five Theater in Harlem. Neither is an accomplished
playwright, though each has done some theatrical writing _ in 1996,
after Couch left Wall Street, he wrote ``The History of the
Blues,'' for the National Black Theater; Scott, a published poet,
has written two unproduced scripts. They wrote the script and
produced ``Echo Park'' together, with Scott, a neophyte, directing.
</P>
<P>
   The two had grown up just blocks apart but had never met, and
they shared many of the same childhood experiences. Both spent time
in the late 1970s in Echo Park, in the west Bronx, where disc
jockeys would rig their sound systems to lampposts and mix funk and
R&AMP;B sounds to create a danceable beat. They witnessed the emergence
of break dancing at such ``park jams,'' where teen-agers from
opposing gangs faced off and ``battled'' each other to flaunt head
spins, back flips, robotic maneuvers and other novel moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a whole generation of kids who grew up in hip-hop
culture but don't understand its origins,'' Couch said. ``They
don't know that it's a lot more than them getting on the mike and
rapping. Hip-hop was an explosion of suppression. The thread that
runs through it all was the desire to be seen and heard, the
ability to shine. I wanted to tell that history through the people
who lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   The writers looked to their own experiences for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the park scenes because I was in the park a lot
playing ball, and the club scenes were Kelly, because her aunt was
a big promoter and she was in the modeling scene,'' Couch said.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also influenced by the stories of those around
them. As Scott put it, ``D.J. Hollywood, Grandmaster Flash and all
those guys were my heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, they lifted moments from the life of Grandmaster
Caz, born in the Bronx as Curtis Brown, and reborn in the '70s as
M.C. and D.J. Casanova Fly. When he was 19 and a member of the Cold
Crush Four, Brown offered a book of his rhymes to his group's
manager, Henry (Big Bank Hank) Jackson, who went on to record the
seminal ``Rapper's Delight'' (``I said, hip hop, the hippie, the
hippie, to the hip hip hop'') as part of the Sugarhill Gang in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   The song is widely regarded as the hit that began rap's invasion
of the mainstream, and Casanova Fly, supported by a number of
hip-hop historians, claims authorship, although he says he has
never seen a dollar for his work. In the play, a character named
Doc achieves fame after stealing the main character's signature
raps.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's is a quintessential music business story, and because he
is also performing in the show, it hovers in the rehearsal hall
like a kind of medieval morality play. As a generic D.J. narrator
in ``Echo Park,'' Brown is boyishly gleeful in his role, especially
when he's spinning mixes at the turntables. ``I think this story is
based on everyone's story,'' he said. ``Everyone coming up in the
pioneer days of hip-hop can relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors also borrowed loosely from Kurtis Blow's early life.
Born Kurt Walker, he was a precocious young man who grew up in
Harlem in the '70s and much to his mother's consternation spent a
lot of his time scratching up her records. ``At 13, I knew I wanted
to be a D.J.,'' he said. ``I knew this was going to be big, huge. I
had no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The main character, Scott Jenkins, routinely clashes with his
mother, secretly a rhythm and blues singer, who calls his form of
expression ``loud, stupid music.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, as he prefers to be called, now 40, was living in
Woodland Hills, Calif., enjoying life as a family man with his
three young sons, writing theme songs for the NBA teams, and
working as a disc jockey on the Los Angeles radio station KPWR,
``Power 106,'' when Scott, an old friend, asked him to return to
New York City for the production last year.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the city for the first time in 15 years, Blow, who is on
a leave of absence from his radio job, appreciates the admirers who
stop him as he walks from the East Harlem rehearsal studio to a
pizza place nearby. ``I go home feeling life has revisited these
old bones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wonders privately if the M.C. character, Doc, may be
portrayed as a bit too much of ``a snake,'' (arguing that M.C.'s
were often the ones who got lost in the fame game) he says he
wanted to participate in the musical because it helps set the
record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many different versions of the history,'' he said.
``Now, everyone is fighting for their own part of the history when
in actuality, we're all part of the fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the writers were on a mission to create a comprehensive
picture of hip-hop's early years, 1978 to 1981, they brought a
variety of elements together on the stage: break dancing, graffiti
art, D.J.'s and rappers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is the first of its kind to incorporate all the
elements of hip-hop culture, the music, dance, art and spoken
word,'' said the show's choreographer, Adesola A. Osakalumi.
``You're not just seeing the parts, but the integration of the
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Osakalumi, who has been break dancing since the '70s, is a
member of GhettOriginal Productions, the dance company behind ``Jam
on the Groove,'' which ran at the Minetta Lane Theater in 1995. Jon
Pareles, the chief pop critic of The New York Times, called the
show ``jubilantly hyperactive'' in a review.
</P>
<P>
   But Osakalumi said that keeping the dances period-specific was a
challenge. ``There were dance moves that were done then that are
now lost,'' he said. ``Then there are others that have evolved,
like the elbow spin _ they used to do a half-spin and now they do
four or five spins _ so the dancers have to resist the temptation
to push it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar difficulties were faced by the Big Time Crew, a graffiti
art group from the Tremont section of the Bronx, which spraypainted
the boldly colorful wild-style graffiti set. ``It's much more
elemental than the work today,'' said Joe Rodriguez, a member of
the Crew. ``Now, we're more into background and sceneries. Before,
it was just your name, or wild-style train art.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers spent two years looking for the right mix of
artists, and, about a year ago, held auditions that attracted
actors and dancers from as far away as Germany and Japan. But they
decided to cast closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   One dancer, Josh Ortiz, 18, is a nephew of the Bronx dancers the
Incredible Breakers and learned many of his moves from his uncles.
Alien Ness, 32, born Luis Martinez in the Bronx, was an original
member of Zulu Nation, a group that assembled around the rap figure
Afrika Bambaataa, and often frequented Echo Park as a teen-ager.
``I'm practically playing myself,'' said Martinez, whose character
in the show is called Kid Ness. ``That's what they called me when I
was 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many in the cast had no professional acting experience,
the group spent six weeks training at the National Black Theater in
Harlem. And they spent five weeks in rehearsal at the Burgos center
in East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the script and assembling the cast, the producers said,
was easier than securing financial support. Couch and Kelly
enlisted Vinson to do the heavy hitting. Until 1993 Vinson headed a
sports and entertainment management and marketing company whose
clients included Savion Glover and Ossie Davis; he is now a
managing partner in Interactive Sports Signals, which he said
enhances the sound systems in sports arenas. As executive producer,
he had enough pull to convince executives at Colgate-Palmolive and
Pepsi to support the production through joint marketing efforts.
But Scott, Couch and Vinson also invested some of their own money
in the production, which has a $250,000 budget.

`THE TULSA LYNCHING OF 1921': IN THE AIR, HONEYSUCKLE AND GUNFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By JULIE SALAMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confronted by a mob bent on destroying the neighborhood, a World
War I veteran put on his uniform and stood at attention in front of
his house. It was Tulsa, Okla., in 1921, and he surely prayed that
his recent military service would protect him. As a black man,
however, he may also have suspected his actual fate was to be shot
point blank by his fellow citizens, who were white.
</P>
<P>
   In one day that mob murdered more than 300 African-Americans and
burned down the Greenwood neighborhood, one of the country's most
prosperous black communities, referred to as the Negro capital of
the Southwest. Greenwood, whose population had reached 15,000, had
thrived on hope as well as hard work, making its destruction all
the more improbable.
</P>
<P>
   This riot was perhaps the most devastating in the nation's
history and destroyed any illusions that upward mobility could fend
off racism. After the riot ended, in one survivor's words ``the
heavy air was soaked with the scent of honeysuckle as extravagant
and lavishly unreal as the gunfire.'' But someone else remembered a
different scent. ``A terrible smell,'' she recalled. ``Did they
burn bodies?''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials encouraged the destruction, so when the carnage
stopped, the cover-ups began. For 50 years this ugly chapter was
buried, and then exhumed by a new generation. Survivors came
forward; old newspapers were dusted off and read. In 1997 the
Oklahoma legislature created a commission to study the Tulsa riot _
to try to explain it and then to determine whether the state should
pay reparations of some kind to Greenwood itself or to individual
survivors. Its conclusions have yet to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the commission was formed, Michael Wilkerson, an
inspector for the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation turned
documentarian, was working on his own examination of this shameful
event. ``The Tulsa Lynching of 1921: A Hidden Story'' _ which
Wilkerson produced, wrote, directed and jointly edited (with
Michael Brown) _ is being shown Wednesday night at 6:30 on Cinemax.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly survivors and witnesses recollect; historians comment;
actors (including Bill Cosby, Nell Carter, Ed Asner and Alfre
Woodard) read from newspaper and personal accounts. The style is
straightforward, and that's fitting. The pyrotechnics are built
into the stories of machine guns raining down bullets on civilians
in peacetime, of women dragging children down residential streets
to escape. Vivid photographs illustrate the horror (a scorched
body) and the loss (rows of comfortable homes destroyed;
well-dressed children turned into refugees).
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of emotion and firepower was detonated by an
unproved allegation that a 19-year-old black man named Dick Rowland
had assaulted a white female elevator operator. He was arrested and
then word circulated that a lynch mob was gathering at the jail. A
group of black men arrived to protect him. Someone fired a shot,
which hit a black man, and the riot began.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours the police commissioned and armed 500 deputies, all
of them white, except for at least one light-skinned black man,
mistakenly enlisted. He reported that he and the other deputies
were told: ``Now you can go shoot any nigger you see and the law
will be behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary explains the context. Despite the prosperity
evident in Greenwood, with its black businessmen, doctors and
lawyers, Oklahoma didn't exactly welcome blacks. The railroads were
segregated, voting restricted and newspapers routinely reported
lynchings of black people. The Ku Klux Klan, which had almost
disappeared after the turn of the century, had been revitalized by
the release of D.W. Griffith's ``Birth of a Nation'' in 1915. Klan
recruitment ads ran next to newspaper advertisements for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   (This context is documented in ``Without Sanctuary: Lynching
Photography in America,'' a New-York Historical Society exhibition
that runs through Aug. 13.)
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa officials tacitly and directly supported the mob as it
looted, burned and killed, and even blocked firefighters from doing
their jobs. The rampage was spontaneous but also calculated:
telephone and telegraph wires were cut and trains blockaded to
prevent outside interference.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard did finally arrive and martial law was
imposed, but the indignities continued. African-Americans had to
register at detention centers; insurance claims by black families
were rejected; city officials declared the Greenwood area a fire
zone and put the land up for sale. Then the cover-up: the death
toll was wildly underreported, a white grand jury placed blame for
the riot on black residents, and newspaper articles encouraging the
lynching of Dick Rowland disappeared from archives.
</P>
<P>
   This intelligent and troubling documentary raises lingering
questions of guilt, retribution and reconciliation. We look at
pictures of the ruins, and listen to the words of one Greenwood
survivor: ``After that we distrusted every white person.'' What
kind of reparations can fully heal that wound?

ARISTIDE PARTY APPARENTLY GAINS CONTROL OF HAITI'S SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a preview of its strength in the coming presidential
election, the political party of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide gained firm control of the Haitian Senate, according to
preliminary results from the May 21 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which were released late on Monday by the
Provisional Electoral Council, gave Aristide's Family Lavalas party
14 of the 19 senate seats that were at stake in Haiti's first
parliamentary elections since 1997. Scoring large margins of
victory, the vote gives Lavalas the majority in Haiti's 27-member
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other five seats up for election, an independent
candidate won one race, while the results for the two seats from
the capital, Port-au-Prince, have yet to be announced. The two
remaining Senate seats for Grande Anse Province will be determined
in an election June 11 after electoral officials postponed the
original date because of disorganization and technical difficulties
in the weeks before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The elections represent Haiti's first step at resolving a crisis
that has left its government paralyzed and without access to $500
million in international aid since 1997. Bitter arguments between
current President Rene Preval, of the Lavalas party, and an
opposition-led Parliament over the results of the 1997 legislative
elections prevented the naming of a prime minister for nearly two
years. Last year, Preval appointed a new prime minister, but only
after Parliament was dissolved, and the nation has been without a
lawmaking body since then.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas' apparent sweep of this year's elections did not extend
to the lower house of parliament; there its candidates won outright
only 16 of the 83 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. A runoff will
be held on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lavalas' strong showing places it in the lead for
November's presidential election, where Aristide is seeking a
return to office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Opposition candidates have accused Lavalas of manipulating the
recent election through a campaign of violence and intimidation
that resulted in 15 politically motivated killings since late
March. They also said Preval forced the postponement of elections
three times to wear down opposition and secure a compliant
Parliament for Aristide's return.
</P>
<P>
   A Lavalas spokesman who was also a candidate for senator
dismissed those accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no totalitarian intentions,'' Yvon Neptune told the
Associated Press. ``The Haitian people want to get out of the rut
of crisis, and we want to implement a project that will change
society. We want peace and security, so we can concentrate on the
big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But peace has been elusive in the days since the election.
Tuesday, poll workers in the Delmas section of Port-au-Prince set
fire to the local election office when they were not paid. Last
week, Lavalas supporters ransacked the headquarters of a minor
political party and killed a person, according to diplomats and
international election observers. About 30 opposition candidates
have been arrested since last week on charges that many of the
observers said were trumped up. Most have been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall take is that Lavalas did do very well in the
elections,'' said a State Department official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``But its heavy-handed tactics like with
the arrests are marring what could have been a decent victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The final vote tally, which could come later this week, has been
delayed by disorganization at electoral offices. In some cases,
ballot boxes were dumped at collection stations, damaging records
and making recounts impossible. But election observers said there
was no indication of systematic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying there was absolutely no fraud,'' said Mary
Durran, a spokeswoman for the observer mission of the Organization
of American States'. ``It's just the nature of the fraud, it's not
organized on a national and systematic level that would have an
impact on the elections.''

BUSH BLAMES DECLINE IN MILITARY MORALE ON CLINTON-GORE
ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday challenged Vice
President Al Gore's fitness to serve as commander in chief of the
armed forces, saying that an erosion of the military's might and
morale during the Clinton-Gore administration was reason ``for a
new sign on the Pentagon that says Under New Management.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used an appearance here at the Veterans of Foreign Wars
Post No. 1, the group's oldest, to recite a laundry list of current
problems with the military, reiterate his commitment to making
necessary improvements and question whether voters should have much
confidence in Gore's capacity for leadership on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent _ who's no stranger to exaggeration, I might add _
boasts on his Web site that he has been intimately involved in the
best-managed build-down in American military history,'' said Bush,
an unmistakable sprinkling of sarcasm in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want the people of Colorado and America to consider the
results of seven years of the vice president's management
involvement,'' Bush said. ``Entire Army divisions are not prepared
for war. Military recruiting fell thousands short of its goal. And
6,000 United States soldiers are on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore claims that qualifies him for a promotion,'' Bush
continued. But, he said, ``The Clinton-Gore record cries out for a
new sign on the Pentagon that says Under New Management.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pointed remarks represented an aggressive attempt by the
Texas governor to turn the tables on Gore and blunt the questions
that Gore and other administration officials have raised about how
well the Texas governor is prepared to manage the country's
military and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts have long considered Bush's inexperience on
the global stage, along with a series of gaffes that underscored
it, to be a significant potential weak spot in his candidacy. Over
the last week, both Gore and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen
have expressed particular concern over Bush's proposal for the
research and development of a missile defense system more vast than
the one being considered by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a Republican, warned that it could lead to an arms
buildup by other countries, and, during an appearance on a Sunday
television news program, he even invited Bush in for a briefing by
State Department officials. Bush, making his first public comments
on the matter Tuesday, implied that he would not be R.S.V.P.-ing
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the comments to be political in nature,'' Bush said at
a news conference here after his speech at the veterans post. Bush
said that he had been amply informed and advised by his own team of
foreign policy and defense experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the briefing I got from Colin Powell and Dick Cheney
and Henry Kissinger was substantial,'' Bush said. ``I've got one of
the finest foreign policy teams ever assembled, and I call upon my
opponent not to allow members of the administration to politicize
matters of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, for its part, said Tuesday that the vice
president had made his own set of proposals for strengthening the
military and increasing spending on defense, particularly for
higher pay for enlisted men and women. Douglas Hattaway, a
spokesman for Gore, also said that low military pay was not a new
phenomenon and that there were about 19,400 service people on food
stamps in 1991, when Bush's father was president.
</P>
<P>
   And Hattaway questioned whether Bush was the right person to be
raising questions about military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush can talk about military readiness all he
wants,'' Hattaway said. ``Experts say his irresponsible position on
missile defense could lead to a new arms race. With all the complex
national defense issues we face, the next commander in chief should
not be going through on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone conference call with reporters that was
arranged by the Democratic National Committee, Jesse Brown, former
secretary of U.S. Veterans Affairs, made those criticisms even more
personal, questioning the nature of Bush's military service during
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not go overseas but served instead in Houston in the
Texas Air National Guard. Gore went to Vietnam as an Army
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's complaint with the health of the country's armed forces
was not new, but he rendered it in especially strong terms Tuesday.
Bush has said he would call for an extra $1 billion a year over
what Congress has already agreed to pay in salary increases for men
and women serving in the military. That is one of several ways in
which Bush would spend more on national defense, which he says is
currently being shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense spending as a percentage of the gross national product
is the lowest it has been since prior to Pearl Harbor,'' Bush said
Tuesday as he presented a litany of facts and figures to portray
what he views as a military in alarming decline. ``United States
Air Force readiness for combat has fallen to its lowest level in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we've asked our service men and women to do
too much with too little,'' he said, adding that their morale had
suffered sharply as a result.
</P>
<P>
   He said the blame rested with the Clinton administration, which
had overextended troops and deployed them in a sometimes haphazard,
poorly planned and unnecessarily prolonged fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we commit troops, there has to be a clear strategy,''
Bush said, citing Bosnia and Haiti as two examples of places where
that was arguably not the case.

 &HT;    Teacher remembered as a man of grace
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla _ As a child, Barry Grunow would collect
bugs from neighbors' yards and keep them in a jar. He didn't want
to steal them, though, so he left pennies and nickels in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just how Barry was,'' his brother, Kurt, recalled
Tuesday in a speech he was too emotional to give himself.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to kill spiders and palmettos inside his house,
carefully luring them back into the wild, Rev. Bill Corristan said,
reading Kurt's words.
</P>
<P>
   When he got a dog from the pound, young Barry Grunow picked
Wilma because ``she was the ugliest dog there and if he didn't take
her, nobody else would,'' his oldest brother Steve said.
</P>
<P>
   So went the glimpses into the too-short life of 35-year-old
English teacher Barry Grunow, remembered Tuesday at Good Shepherd
United Methodist Church before 1,600 teachers, friends, students,
family, maybe a stranger or two.
</P>
<P>
   In a crime that has touched a nerve in Palm Beach County and
nationwide, Grunow was shot and killed Friday in the hallway
outside his classroom at Lake Worth Middle School, during the last
class of the last day of school. The boy who police say shot him,
seventh-grader Nathaniel Brazill, could face charges of
first-degree murder and a lifetime in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Many in attendance Tuesday were other seventh-graders, clad in
black, crying and hugging one another, passing crinkled tissues. Up
front were those he left behind, his wife Pam, his 5-year-old son
Sam, his baby daughter Lee-Anne, his mother, his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry was reaching out with grace, even to the end,''
Corristan said. ``Even to the young man with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the church, alongside the roses and carnations,
stood a giant photograph of the way most people remember Mr. Grunow
and collages of happy family snapshots: Grunow swimming. Grunow
playing ball, Grunow holding his newborn baby, Grunow at a
graduation. Grunow smiling. Before the concluding hymn Amazing
Grace, the music of the 70-minute service was dominated by Grunow's
favorite, the songs of Jethro Tull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the dawn was coming, heard him reading my bell,'' went
the strains of Teacher. ``He said, 'My name's the teacher, that is
what I call myself and I have a lesson that I must impart to you.
It's an old expression but I insist it's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jump up, look around, find yourself some fun, no sense in
sitting there hating everyone. No man't an island and his castle
isn't home, the nest is for nothing when the bird has flown.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Krolick, a friend of Grunow's for 19 years, dating back to
when they worked together at a North Palm Beach record store,
remembered his love of sports. Grunow was a top basketball player
at Jupiter High School, played pickup games and helped coach the
sport at Lake Worth Middle.
</P>
<P>
   Krolick, a native New Yorker, is a lifelong Knicks and Yankees
fan. Grunow, originally from Michigan, followed the Detroit Pistons
and Detroit Tigers just as fanatically. The two watched these
rivalries play out over the years, Krolick recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do this for just anybody,'' Krolick said, taking off
his suit jacket and replacing it with a Piston's basketball jersey,
adding levity to the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry,'' he shouted, looking skyward, ``what do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grunow recalled talking to his nephew Sam after a
hurricane last summer. Sam told his uncle how his father took him
out to the ocean to see the big waves. Was he scared? Uncle Steve
asked. ``Sam said: No, I wasn't scared because my Daddy was holding
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Corristan implored those in tears to celebrate the Grunow's life
and not focus on his unexplainable death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the answer to how something like this could
happen, to why,'' he said. ``It's supposed to happen somewhere else
if it's to happen at all. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We can look to Tallahassee. We can look to Washington. We can
look to leaders all over the place to try to change things. We can
put laws on the books but until people change ... we'll never know
the peace that we want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush called Pam Grunow on Monday, telling her to ``take
her time about healing and grieving.'' He did not attend Tuesday's
service but Republican Congressman Mark Foley, an alum of Lake
Worth Junior High, interim schools Superintendent Ben Marlin, Lake
Worth Middle Principal Sharon Walker and several school board
members did.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they learned, Barry Grunow was a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said he was going to make a difference in his
class's lives,'' Krolick said. ``You could tell teaching was
Barry's niche in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always happy.''

ABC FIELD'S NEW `MILLIONAIRE' TO COUNTER CBS'S `SURVIVOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC is making one thing clear Wednesday night: It may
be in the business of making millionaires, but not at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   As CBS kicks off its island survival test, ``Survivor,'' at 8
p.m. Wednesday _ a show that CBS clearly hopes will become this
summer's phenomenon, as ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' was for
ABC last summer _ ABC has decided to make that goal as elusive as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, past the date by which it could even be
included in program listings, ABC threw in yet another edition of
``Millionaire'' to go head to head with the opening of the 13-week
run of ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The news got out last week, about the time TV Guide was arriving
with ``Survivor'' on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   The next sound heard was a howl of anger at CBS headquarters.
Several executives there, who asked to remain unnamed, accused
their ABC counterparts of playing dirty pool scheduling-wise to
undercut CBS's hopes without having anything to gain for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One CBS executive who did speak for the record was Leslie
Moonves, the president of CBS Television, who acknowledged that he
was far from happy with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bad for the network television business,''
Moonves said. ``You would think that ABC could accept their
victories and not have to go out and try to stop someone else from
having a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   This position left Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun, the two
co-chairmen of ABC Entertainment, a but nonplussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not do it?'' Bloomberg asked. ``It's a competition. We
obviously don't want them to get on the air and get traction with
their show. I have absolutely no regrets about doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is ABC's position, even though putting another edition of
``Millionaire'' on this week, after the official television season
has ended, does not provide any ratings benefits for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision does fly a bit in the face of the sentiment
expressed by some ABC executives that ``Millionaire'' is a precious
program resource that should not be overused. Even Bloomberg
conceded, ``I'd like to rest the show a bit if I can.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chance to stop ``Survivor'' before it can get going
apparently was too strong a lure to be passed up.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves noted that the decision seemed last-minute, as if ABC
suddenly got worried about the attention ``Survivor'' was
receiving. ``It clearly came after the TV Guide cover and all the
other press we've been getting,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   But Braun said, ``This is not something we thought about
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the ``Millionaire'' production staff said the extra,
anti-``Survivor'' edition of ``Millionaire'' had been in the works
for weeks. Which led to the speculation that ABC fully intended a
kind of stealth effort against ``Survivor'' at a time when CBS
could not alter its starting date.
</P>
<P>
   Braun said, ``We're totally trying to be smart in how we use
`Millionaire.' I don't believe by scheduling our programs against
theirs we're in any way compromising the television business. Our
job is to get people to watch our network, not the other
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The test of interest in ``Survivor'' may be skewed Wednesday,
but CBS executives said they always felt its real test would unfold
with the full length of its run, measured by how much word of mouth
the series can build up.
</P>
<P>
   Each week one of the contestants gets voted off the island by
the others, in a game of attrition leading to a climax in which the
last survivor takes home $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's hopes for a similar series, ``Big Brother,'' which will
play out over 90 straight nights later this summer, may hinge on
how well ``Survivor'' builds that audience.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC may try to play a hand there as well. ``We've haven't
decided yet what we'll be doing with `Millionaire' the following
week,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   RICHTER'S LATE FAREWELL
</P>
<P>
   With a week of shows celebrating his status as sidekick, Andy
Richter got a great send-off from ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien''
in every way, except from the NBC schedulers. Richter's final
night, Friday, coincided with coverage of one of NBC's NBA playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   The game ran so late that it delayed the start of ``The Tonight
Show'' almost until the usual 12:35 start of O'Brien's show. That
meant ``Late Night'' couldn't start until almost 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   So the ratings for Richter's finale _ he quit the show to pursue
an acting career _ were nothing to post in his book of memories.
That show averaged only a 2.7 in the biggest cities, not even as
high as the previous Friday when the show scored a 2.8. Each rating
point represents just over a million homes.
</P>
<P>
   BROKAW Quizzes PUTIN
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw will interview the new Russian president, Vladimir
Putin, on ``The NBC Nightly News'' Thursday, the first in-depth
interview Putin has granted to American television since he took
office on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw said Tuesday that he and his staff had been working on
scheduling an interview with Putin for several months, but the
Russian leader had proved elusive. With the summit meeting with
President Clinton scheduled this weekend, the timing apparently was
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are four big areas we'll concentrate on,''
Brokaw said. ``First, who is this guy? Then of course, the
relationship with the United States and the question of the nuclear
arsenals, crime and corruption, and how on earth do you revive that
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview is likely to occur about midday in Moscow, and
Brokaw said he expected to use a sizable portion of it during
Thursday night's broadcast. More of the interview will be seen on
the ``Today'' program on Friday morning and on ``Meet The Press''
on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the chance to really sit down with
him,'' Brokaw said, noting that he was the first American
television journalist to interview Mikhail S. Gorbachev after he
assumed leadership in the former Soviet Union. ``I think for the
most part Putin is still an enigma.''
</P>
<P>
   On another NBC outlet, MSNBC, George W. Bush will sit down for
an interview with Chris Matthews on his ``Hardball'' program
Thursday night at 7 p.m. This interview will be conducted live,
from a restaurant named El Pinto in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews said he planned to emphasize education, Social
Security, missile defense, possible running mates and Bush's
campaign strategy against Al Gore.

   ASBESTOS-TALC (Seattle) _ The talc used by Crayola and most of
America's other crayon makers comes from a century-old mine long
embroiled in battles over whether its product contains
cancer-causing asbestos. The mine in upstate New York, owned by
R.T. Vanderbilt Co., has been the center of a 30-year-long fight
pitting the asbestos and talc industries against physicians and
public health experts over just what, precisely, constitutes
asbestos. 2,500 words.

TV'S FICKLE NATURE KILLED `NOW AND AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last July, in that heady time when every producer thinks his new
show will be the next ``ER,'' Glenn Gordon Caron was talking about
the coincidence of his show being launched on CBS at the same time
ABC was introducing a new drama with a similar title.
</P>
<P>
   Caron's show was ``Now and Again.'' The one on ABC was ``Once
and Again.'' Even critics who keep track of this sort of thing for
a living were confused, often mentioning one title when they meant
the other.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Caron learned of the similar names, he figured he
should mention it to Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television.
But Moonves didn't seem concerned. ``He said, `Oh, let them worry
about us,' '' Caron recalled, ``and I thought, whenever you can get
bullishness from a network head about your show, you don't want
anything to diminish that. I took Les' confidence in the show as a
great sign, and we're just sort of charging ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   This is now. And, again, a network bull has become a steer when
faced with the prospect of rendering aid and comfort to a quality
show that's struggling in the ratings. Two weeks ago, CBS chose the
wimpy route and decided not to give ``Now and Again'' a second
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt it was our toughest call to make,'' CBS spokesman
Chris Ender said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then why make it?
</P>
<P>
   Ender's response is that CBS has ``a very deep roster'' of
dramas in development for next season and beyond. Isn't that like
saying your new car works fine, but the dealer has a bunch more
he's aching to sell so you're unloading the new car and buying an
even newer one to help the dealer out?
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is further validation of my theory that the TV
industry is more interested in keeping the assembly line going than
in fostering the growth of good shows. After all, it's just as
likely that whatever replaces ``Now and Again'' also will finish
the season at No. 76 in the Nielsen ratings, so why not keep ``Now
and Again'' on the air and let the audience warm to it? Besides,
``Now and Again'' finished just ahead of ``City of Angels,'' which
CBS renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show are hoping they can pester CBS sufficiently to
get the network to change its mind. They took out an ad in
Tuesday's Hollywood Reporter that read: ``Cost of building a
superhero: $3,000,000,000. Cost of losing a superhero:
Incalculable. Value of saving a quality TV show: Priceless. Bring
back `Now and Again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The ad also contains a blurb from a piece by Bruce Fretts of
Entertainment Weekly magazine, who wrote: ``When `Now and Again' is
at its best ... it's as good as anything on TV, including ``The
Sopranos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't go that far, but ``Now and Again,'' which tried to be
a drama, a romance, a comedy and an action/adventure sci-fi show at
the same time, was an Altoid in a prime-time lineup that was mostly
a megadose of halitosis.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, ``Now and Again'' was, in Caron's own
words, ``the story of a middle-aged man (Michael Wiseman) who dies
a violent death, only to disover that the government has saved his
brain in order to put it in a younger, stronger body. That body is
the scientific prototype of a special agent invented to take on the
kind of battles most men don't want any part of. Michael is
forbidden from ever making contact with anyone he knew before, for
to do so would put his friends and family at risk of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating thing about ``Now and Again'' was its
all-things-to-all-viewers approach. But Lisa Polly of Baton Rouge,
La., who helps maintain a mailing list of the show's fans and is a
leader of the campaign to save it, thinks that was its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew if it would be about the superhero or about this
man and his family,'' she said Tuesday. ``It just was always
something new and fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   In my precinct, the treatment of ``Now and Again'' has caused
more buzz than any other cancellation, probably because of CBS'
early show of support. Moonves had brought Caron, the creator of
``Moonlighting,'' back to network television with a carte-blanche
invitation to do whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Caron took the bait, and he succeeded in creating a vibrant,
unusual, kicky show. Some weeks it really clicked. Some weeks it
missed the target. But it always made Fridays at 9 a time slot
worth reserving.
</P>
<P>
   Next time Les Moonves offers his support, Caron might want to
frisk him first.

SPECIAL TWISTS THIS YEAR IN THE COMPETITION CALLED TONY MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It doesn't rise to the level of ``Shakespeare in
Love'' versus ``Saving Private Ryan,'' but the competition before
the Tony Awards on Sunday night nevertheless amounts to what
producers call Tony madness, a frenzy of promoting, politicking and
nitpicking by Broadway producers aimed at winning votes from the
705 voting theater people that can mean the difference between
millions in losses, even closing, and a show with legs.
</P>
<P>
   The splashy, celebratory publicity events in this period _ the
nominees' brunch at Sardi's, the photo op on the stairs of Radio
City Music Hall, where the awards will take place _ mask the
bottom-line desperation of producers to see their shows win best
play or best musical, the only two awards that they say affect the
box office.
</P>
<P>
   Because a Tony in those categories can lure tourists in New York
and ensure solid runs on the road, producers pull out all the stops
they can for their shows: spending as much as $250,000 to advertise
a show with a good chance of winning best musical, trying to book
television appearances and in some cases picking up the telephone
to cajole Tony voters they know.
</P>
<P>
   While the awards in other categories amount to little
financially, producers say, they promote those nominees anyway, in
part to get whatever attention they can from Tony voters but mostly
because they have no choice. There is an unspoken expectation that
producers will put promotional money behind the people in their
productions who have been nominated. The importance of that factor
was made starkly clear when Patrick Stewart announced from the
stage of ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' this month that the Shubert
Organization was inadequately promoting the show. (The producers
answered by filing charges with the Actors' Equity Association,
which ruled that Stewart had to write an apology.)
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the timing of Stewart's curtain speech just
before the nominations amounted to a personal Tony campaign.
Although awards for best actor or best actress may not sell
tickets, they have been known to enhance careers.
</P>
<P>
   For a few shows this season the awards are a matter of life and
death. ``The Wild Party,'' the new musical by George C. Wolfe and
Michael John LaChiusa, was gasping for breath when it was nominated
for best musical. It was selling only 50 percent of its tickets,
and there was some question whether the producers would keep it
running even after a nomination. They did.
</P>
<P>
   For Wolfe, the artistic director of the Joseph Papp Public
Theater, which is the lead producer of the show, an award would
also be a vindication (given the show's mixed reviews, including a
negative one in The New York Times) and a validation of his
decision to gamble big on Broadway again as he did last season with
the unsuccessful revival of ``On the Town.'' If ``Wild Party''
doesn't win, however, there is some question about whether it will
have built enough word of mouth to keep running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Party'' is considered the main competition for best
musical facing ``Contact,'' Susan Stroman's acclaimed dance show _
given that ``James Joyce's `The Dead' '' has closed and ``Swing!''
is generally considered a weak contender because of its lukewarm
reviews. Though favored to win, ``Contact'' would be a shoo-in if
it weren't for some fierce opposition to the show's being
considered a musical because it has no singing, original music or
live orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians' union, Local 802, has objected to the decision to
make the show eligible for the best musical award. Jack Goldstein,
the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, which runs
TKTS and theater support programs, resigned from the Tony
nominating committee to protest its inclusion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But ``Contact'' is not alone this season in challenging
traditional notions of what constitutes a book musical. ``The
Dead,'' which features Irish parlor songs, and ``Swing!,'' a dance
revue, also defy the conventional definition. And these shows
follow seasons of shows like ``Fosse,'' a dance revue that won best
musical last year, and ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' a revue that had a
long run largely because one of its numbers was performed on the
Tony Awards show, which can offer invaluable national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater,
which produced ``Contact,'' said he was outraged by the objections.
``They are the forces of darkness, those who have argued that it is
not a musical,'' he said. ``The music is no less original to what
it was originally made for than the music in `Swing!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody objects to `Fosse' because it doesn't have new music,''
Gersten continued. ``Suddenly we don't have a musical score.''
</P>
<P>
   This year members of the nominating committee _ a 24-member
group that can include performers, composers, educators and others
involved in the theater _ seem particularly dismayed that the Tony
Administration Committee ruled on questions of eligibility and that
the nominators' views were not taken into account. The
administration committee is made up of members of the League of
American Theaters and Producers and of the American Theater Wing,
which jointly present the awards.
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation letter, Goldstein of the Theater Development
Fund cited a letter he wrote last fall in which he suggested that
the administration committee brief the nominators after eligibility
petitions had been submitted but before making its decision public.
Another suggestion was to establish a Tony for Innovation ``to
recognize evolving theatrical forms, new technical advancements or
any creative approach to theater.'' Neither suggestion was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the playwright A.R. Gurney, who resigned from the
nominating committee this year because he was not allowed to
abstain from votes in which he felt ill equipped to take part, said
he felt frustrated by the fruitlessness of the nominators' attempts
to make their concerns heard. ``We were told to write letters, and
the problems would be addressed,'' Gurney said. ``That was in
September. Then they said we'll talk about it in January. Then they
said after we voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this rolling of the eyes when we meet because there
doesn't seem to be any opportunity to discuss things.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominators were invited to such a discussion on May 18 with
members of the administration committee. It was partly in response
to that meeting that the committee voted on May 23 to establish a
new category next season for special theatrical events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There actually seems to be a rough justice to all of this,''
said Edgar Dobie, managing producer of the Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   While producers say they don't pressure Tony voters, they
certainly call their friends. ``You get those who are calling
everybody, trying to collect favors for a quid pro quo,'' said one
producer who refused to be identified. ``It's a secret ballot, so
you never know whether they kept their word or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer Rocco Landesman, said he might, for example, call
the producer Michael David if they don't both have shows competing
in the same category. ``I might well say to him, `Moon for the
Misbegotten' is in the best play category, don't forget,''
Landesman said. ``Producers tend to call their friends, and friends
are reassuring. And generally, people do vote with their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the more tentative nudging that producers do,
sending special trinkets in the mail along with keep-us-in-mind
notes. On the theory that people remember best what they saw last,
the producers of ``Kiss Me, Kate'' are nervous that their show,
which opened in the fall, is at a disadvantage against ``The Music
Man,'' which opened in April. As a result, Tony voters have
received the cast CD and a souvenir program and have been invited
to return to ``Kate'' as a guest of the producers ``to get a fresh
look,'' said Roger Berlind, who produced it with Roger Horchow.
</P>
<P>
   A frustration for many producers in Tony season is that many
voters give their free tickets to friends or don't use their
tickets at all, but vote anyway. This has long been a problem. In
1996 The New York Times informally surveyed 17 voters, including
producers and other theater people, and found that 13 acknowledged
having missed one or both of two best-musical nominees that had
already closed, ``Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' and ``Swinging on
a Star.''
</P>
<P>
   While the tickets are supposed to be nontransferable, producers
say they are reluctant to enforce this rule by demanding
identification from those who pick up the tickets for fear of
creating ill will and losing votes.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``True West'' are upset that the two leads who
share roles are competing against each other because the Tony
committee denied the producers' request to have them considered
jointly. But ``True West'' seems unlikely to be hurt if neither
star wins because of the prominence of its two stars, Philip
Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, who are known for their film
work. And the producers are promoting both actors equally.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, a staunch supporter of theater, has featured
them on her show along with the actress Blair Brown of
``Copenhagen,'' who is also well known for her television series
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, producers of straight plays say they are
paralyzed on the publicity front during the pre-Tony period and
have to let the work speak for itself. ``We don't have a souvenir
program, we have a play,'' said Berlind of ``Copenhagen,'' which he
also helped produce (along with ``The Wild Party'' and ``The Ride
Down Mount Morgan''). ``We hope they come. There's not much we can
do beyond that that is not obviously self-serving and inappropriate
to the seriousness of the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the shows that are no longer running say they have
little choice but to sit tight, that pouring money into promotion
would be money lost. ``No, we are not launching a PR offensive,''
said Gregory Mosher, a producer of ``The Dead.'' ``What are we
going to do, take everybody out on a boat?''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that ``The Dead'' is actually dead; it will open at the
Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in July and then tour the country.
But it would be foolish, Mosher said, to expect much out of the
nomination period because the show has already left Broadway.
``It's like an indie film competing against `Mission: Impossible
2.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, shows that were shut out of the nominations _ like
``Saturday Night Fever'' _ or that only drew a few nominations,
like ``The Green Bird,'' have to work doubly hard to stay alive,
particularly without a musical number on the broadcast, which has
been known to be decisive. Already there have been casualties:
``Waiting in the Wings'' closed on Sunday and ``Taller Than a
Dwarf'' is closing on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Shows that were scheduled as limited runs to begin with _ like
``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ``Uncle Vanya'' and ``The Real
Thing'' _ are expected simply to play out to the end, though Tony
Awards can sometimes mean extensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after all the jockeying and marketing, producers say
there is only one thing left to do. Anita Waxman, who helped
produce four nominated shows this season _ ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' ``The Real Thing,'' ``The Wild Party'' and ``The
Music Man'' _ summed it up: ``Pray.''

<P>
   In Champaign, Ill., the theft of a trailer loaded with $20,000
worth of Kraft mayonnaise was cause for that town's newspaper, the
News-Gazette, to survey recent incidents of food theft in the
Champaign area. Personals is indebted to  &UR; J. Ehrlich &LR;  for passing
along the story. Among the crimes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Several months ago, $200,000 worth of Snickers and Three
Musketeers bars were taken from a truck parked at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last December, $1,530 worth of Kraft cheese _ including
Velveeta, mozzarella and Philadelphia cream cheese _ was stolen
from Kraft trailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, 11 cases of pizza _ worth $5,500 _ disappeared from a
Kraft freezer truck.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development on the national food crime scene, a
truck containing a shipment of Newman's Own salad dressing was
stolen recently on the way from Southern California to Portland,
Ore. The vehicle was recovered without the salad dressing, which
included 664 cases of Olive Oil &AMP; Vinegar, 238 cases of Balsamic

REGIS SPAWNS `SURVIVOR` 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What hath Regis wrought?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the resurgence of dark suits and a stupid catch
phrase, he's spawned ``Survivor,` the CBS `dramality` series (I'll
explain) that debuts May 31.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, marooning 16 people on a desert island off
Borneo for 39 days and televising their struggles doesn't sound
like it has much in common with ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' But the top prize is the same: a million bucks. Both
are competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And neither adheres to the traditional TV structure of comedy or
drama. Networks will try almost anything to cash in on
Millionaire's success (thus the Fox debacle ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?''), and reality shows are CBS' current attempt.
(Look for ``Big Brother'' later this summer.)
</P>
<P>
   `If they get sick and need to get off (the island), they can get
off,` Mark Burnett, `Survivor's` executive producer, said in a
conference call. `So clearly we're not doing ``Lord of the Flies''
here. It's not true, pure reality. On the other hand, it's not
scripted drama. It's somewhere in between.`
</P>
<P>
   Thus `dramality,` the term Burnett came up with to describe the
show.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six episodes, the `survivors` divide into two
groups and build competing communities on the island. Every three
days, there is a `reward challenge,` in which they compete for
luxuries like a hot shower or a call home, and an `immunity
challenge` - the winning team doesn't have to vote one of its
members off the island (the losing team does).
</P>
<P>
   After that, the remaining people form a single team, only now
the challenges reward individuals, until one person is left (and
rich).
</P>
<P>
   The competition is actually over already; CBS is keeping mum
about who won. While Burnett promised lots of intriguing TV (the
survivors cook and eat rats), if you're hoping to see heartless
back-stabbing - you know, literally - you're out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   `I was very worried about it turning into a Jerry Springer-type
thing by choosing people before they even got to the island I knew
would be at each other's throats,` Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   `I knew I was going to get the conflicts and friendships needed
to make a dramatic show without slanting it that way, which could
have become a complete free-for-all and nothing that anybody wants
to watch.`
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Good thing for him he doesn't work at Fox.

   FCC-CROSS-OWNERSHIP (Washington) _ The Federal Communications

broadcasters, including one that prevents companies from owning a
broadcast station and newspaper in the same city and another
prohibiting a company from owning more than one national television
network. By Stephen Labaton. (We plan to move the story by 9 p.m.

   KOREA-MASSACRE-DAILY (Clarksville, Tenn.) _ Edward Daily seemed
to have the resume of a true American hero. When the Associated
Press began investigating reports that the unit he said he was with
had massacred hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Daily,
69, seemed an ideal guide. The story led to a Pulitzer for the AP
and the unmasking of Daily. As the Army and other reporters began
to study the records, it became clear that Daily was neither the
war criminal nor war hero he claimed to be. He was never at the
scene of the massacre or even with the unit. And interviews with
veterans show that Daily, while developing his books, may have
airbrushed himself into their memories of the war. By Michael Moss.

   CHINA-NKOREA (Yanji, China) _ Like hundreds of thousands of
hungry North Koreans have sneaked into neighboring China to find
food, escaping a deadly famine in their homeland. But now, Chinese
police have sharply increased their efforts to expel the North
Koreans living undercover in China, creating a climate of fear
along the border and fueling a potentially explosive international
refugee crisis. The number of ``food migrants'' sent back has at
least doubled this year, up to about 2,000 a month, aid groups on
the border say. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. (Scheduled to move by 8

`THE STORY OF THE BEATS': SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE '60S 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of the review) 
 By JULIE SALAMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to propose our own souls to ourselves,''
the poet Allen Ginsberg once said. ``We were trying to find truth
and meaning in life,'' said Jack Kerouac.
</P>
<P>
   These explanations of purpose seem so innocent now, so unironic.
(Isn't that refreshing?) As young men in the 1940s and '50s, the
group of writers called the Beats helped set the stage for the '60s
counterculture with what Kerouac called their ``secret naked
doodlings'' and ``secret scatological thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   An ``American Masters'' documentary by the filmmaker Chuck
Workman has admirably captured these personalities, as well as
their uninhibited willingness to push an idea or a metaphor or a
sentence to the limit. ``The Source: The Story of the Beats and the
Beat Generation,'' Wednesday night at 9:30 p.m. on PBS, mesmerizes
with its protean visual style and dynamic score (which includes
Dizzy Gillespie, the Doors, and Philip Glass' riveting
``Metamorphosis,'' performed as a tribute to Ginsberg, before the
poet's death in 1997). It is also moving and funny and smart.
</P>
<P>
   Workman hypothesizes that the Beats were instrumental in
breaking down cultural and political taboos, and that their
influence lingers. Fair enough. Individual expression has become
almost obligatory; Buddhism has been embraced by New Age thought;
the poetry coffeehouse lives in the East Village and on the
Internet. Ginsberg even appeared in a Gap ad. Still, the sections
on the '60s and beyond are less energetic than those chronicling
the early years, maybe because the iconoclasts had become
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   A pulsing stream of images and ideas captures the deeply
ambivalent character of the 1950s. The public face of the era was
represented by satisfied conformity: Ozzie and Harriet, tract
houses, drive-ins, television and President Eisenhower. But there
was another world where everyone else lived: blacks, gays,
potheads, Lenny Bruce and people who liked Charlie Parker and may
even have been curious about John Cage.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of this alternate universe drew Jack Kerouac, a
hunk football player, to New York from Lowell, Mass., in 1944 to
become a writer. It brought William Burroughs, the product of a
proper St. Louis family who would become an addict and an exile
(after accidentally killing his wife during a drunken ``William
Tell'' re-enactment). Ginsberg grew up nearby, in Paterson, N.J.,
but his outsider credentials were solid: gay and a poet.
</P>
<P>
   Workman interviewed or collected interviews with Ginsberg,
Kerouac, Burroughs, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso and other
known or once-known or almost-known writers. We see that they were
nakedly in love with their own ideas and observations, with the
notion of coming to grips with their own reality. No one else's
reality mattered to them after Hiroshima. ``There was suddenly the
realization: `Why are we being intimidated by a bunch of jerks who
don't know anything about life?''' said Ginsberg. ```Who are they
to tell us what we feel and how we're supposed to behave?'''
</P>
<P>
   Drugs and drink were crucial to this group's creativity and to
that of their literary heirs, or so they believed. We see
Burroughs, who describes himself as ``sort of a WASP washout,''
shooting up. Elsewhere, Ken Kesey says, ``I could never have
written `Cuckoo's Nest' without LSD.''
</P>
<P>
   As young men, they were giddily narcissistic but apparently
unconcerned with celebrity (difficult, now, to imagine a group of
writers in New York like that). Kerouac wrote 14 books before he
was published. They kept busy writing, partying, talking, and
filming themselves and each other. We are shown clips from ``Pull
My Daisy,'' a movie written by Kerouac and starring his friends, a
Beat curiosity. (It will be shown in its 27-minute entirety on
Channel 13 on July 14 as part of the ``Reel New York'' independent
film series).
</P>
<P>
   John Turturro, Dennis Hopper and Johnny Depp give individual
readings from Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac. Norman Mailer offers
up a Beat-influenced poem he wrote for Ginsberg. Brief, vulgar and
poignant, it's not much of a poem, but it is a perfect example of
the documentary's idiosyncratic heart.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Champaign, Ill., the theft of a trailer loaded with $20,000
worth of Kraft mayonnaise was cause for that town's newspaper, the
News-Gazette, to survey recent incidents of food theft in the
Champaign area. Personals is indebted to  &UR; J. Ehrlich &LR;  for passing
along the story. Among the crimes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Several months ago, $200,000 worth of Snickers and Three
Musketeers bars were taken from a truck parked at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last December, $1,530 worth of Kraft cheese _ including
Velveeta, mozzarella and Philadelphia cream cheese _ was stolen
from Kraft trailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, 11 cases of pizza _ worth $5,500 _ disappeared from a
Kraft freezer truck.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development on the national food crime scene, a
truck containing a shipment of Newman's Own salad dressing was
stolen recently on the way from Southern California to Portland,
Ore. The vehicle was recovered without the salad dressing, which
included 664 cases of Olive Oil &AMP; Vinegar, 238 cases of Balsamic
Vinaigrette and 344 cases of Family Recipe Italian.

<P>
   _  &UR; Bob Blumer &LR; , ``The Surreal Gourmet,'' will be driving around
San Francisco this week in his customized vehicle, an Airstream
trailer with two giant pieces of toast popping out of its roof. And
the Washington Monthly reports that during the 1998 congressional
session, 84 representatives and senators were stopped for drunken
driving and released after they claimed congressional immunity.
Elsewhere in transportation,  &UR; Tom Walton &LR;  observed a flying missile
propelled from a FedEx truck in the East Bay the other day, took

   _ The San Francisco swing band  &UR; Lavay Smith &LR;  and Her Red Hot
Skillet Lickers' second CD, ``Everybody's Talkin' 'Bout Miss
Thing!'' is No. 12 on the Billboard traditional jazz chart this
week. Smith turned down offers from major record companies and
produced the album on her own Fat Note Records; everything near it
on the chart is from a major label.

suggested prayer, and offers a free ``best-seller,'' a book about
knowing God.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women-only investors' clubs earn an average return of 21
percent, says a University of California at Davis study reported in
Publishers Weekly, but men-only clubs earn only 15 percent. This is
said to be because women do more careful research.
</P>

   _  &UR; Steve Finacom &LR;  was surprised that the Cafe Mediterraneum in
Berkeley, which opened in 1950 and is Berkeley's most venerable
``haunt of bohemians and aged hippies,'' has an ATM machine. It's
been there for four months, a worker told Personals, and the only

WITH TRADE LINKS STRONGER, U.S. INSURERS SCOUT FOR BUSINESS IN
CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Sy Sternberg, the chairman of New York Life
Insurance, was in China this week trying to figure out whom to meet
in order to ensure that his company is next among the dozens of
insurers who have applied for a license to do business in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the process is in awarding licenses,'' said
Sternberg, though his company has devoted more resources than
almost any other American insurer to securing the right to operate
here. He has tried to touch all the bases _ from officials of the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
Still, he cannot be sure he has met the person who makes the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in China's murky business world, where market access
depends on whom you know and how happy you have made them _ though
no one will tell you who those people are. Instead, chief
executives like Sternberg operate on supposition and hearsay to
identify the hidden decision makers and cultivate what they call
``top of mind,'' which means making their company the first that
Chinese leaders think of when considering foreign supplicants from
their industry.
</P>
<P>
   China's entry into the World Trade Organization is supposed to
change all that, and with the House willing to grant China
permanent normal trade relations, American companies are expected
to share in any WTO bounty. The Senate, too, is expected to approve
normal trading status for China. Were Congress not to grant Beijing
such status, it could enter the WTO anyway and exclude the United
States from many trade benefits that WTO membership conveys.
</P>
<P>
   As part of China' WTO membership, the country has promised to
publish all rules and regulations governing trade and to create
clear procedures for acquiring licenses to do things like sell
insurance in the country. If Beijing holds to its promise, China
will undergo a sea change in how business is conducted here and
take a step toward government by rule of law instead of
administrative fiat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen overnight, but 10 years from now
we'll look back and say it was a turning point,'' said Patrick
Cranley, who is the head of Cigna's efforts to win a license in
China and chairman of Shanghai's American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, China's transition to Western-style transparency is
likely to be piecemeal and slow. But the insurance industry is one
of the areas that promises a reasonable pace of change, for one
thing because there is little concern that foreign companies can
dominate a market in which comfort and familiarity play such a key
role. The state-owned People's Insurance Co. of China currently has
70 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic companies stand to benefit almost as much as foreign
concerns from the promised candor. Already, Western companies have
helped crack open markets that orthodox state-owned companies never
considered or dared not try to enter for fear of angering officials
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no Chinese insurer sold life insurance to
individuals before the American International Group won a license
to do so in Shanghai seven years ago. The slim commission paid to
Chinese insurance agents did not warrant the effort. Then AIG began
paying its agents as much as 40 percent of the first year's
premium, and the individual life insurance business took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one imagined that Beijing would allow that, so no one ever
tried,'' said Albert Lu, a former agent for the China Pacific
Insurance Co. and now ING Insurance's chief representative in
China. All major Chinese life insurers offer individual policies
today.
</P>
<P>
   China needs a developed insurance industry now more than ever as
the country tries to shift the burden of cradle-to-grave benefits
away from its over-encumbered state enterprises, half of them
breaking even or losing money. Instead of providing free medical
care, many state-owned companies are buying health insurance for
their employees. A move from state-subsidized housing in favor of
individually owned homes has increased the need for property and
casualty insurance. And many people now buy life insurance with an
annuity attached that serves as a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the market has slowed from what it was a few years
ago, but remains higher than in Western economies. Life insurance
premiums, which grew 40 percent annually early in the 1990s, are
still growing at more than 10 percent a year. And life insurance
premiums account for only about 1 percent of China's total economic
output _ one of the lowest rates in the world, and behind nations
like Bulgaria and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Once China enters the WTO, the country has promised to lift
restrictions on the number of foreign companies it will allow to
operate. And foreigners will be allowed to sell insurance in at
least three cities immediately upon China's joining the global
trade group. After three years, all national restrictions will
disappear and foreign insurers will be allowed to sell group
insurance, the market's largest segment, from which foreign
companies are still barred.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, no one knows what the licensing process will be
and so companies like New York Life and Cigna are continuing their
relationship-building strategy. New York Life, for example, has
established a $250 million infrastructure investment fund that it
will use to support Beijing's current drive to build up the
country's long-neglected Western regions. To help invest the money,
the insurance company has hired the China Development Bank, run by
Chen Yuan, former deputy governor of the Chinese central bank,
which was the country's insurance regulator until late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg of New York Life has spent much of his own time
lobbying for the license or otherwise trying to demonstrate his
support for China, meeting with more than 100 members of Congress
to push for normal trading relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth strategy is to expand into high-growth emerging
markets, and China is an important part of that strategy,''
Sternberg said, ``so it's important that I dedicate my time.''

   In Champaign, Ill., the theft of a trailer loaded with $20,000
worth of Kraft mayonnaise was cause for that town's newspaper, the
News-Gazette, to survey recent incidents of food theft in the
Champaign area. Personals is indebted to  &UR; J. Ehrlich &LR;  for passing

</P>
<P>
   _ Several months ago, $200,000 worth of Snickers and Three
Musketeers bars were taken from a truck parked at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last December, $1,530 worth of Kraft cheese _ including
Velveeta, mozzarella and Philadelphia cream cheese _ was stolen
from Kraft trailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, 11 cases of pizza _ worth $5,500 _ disappeared from a
Kraft freezer truck.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development on the national food crime scene, a
truck containing a shipment of Newman's Own salad dressing was
stolen recently on the way from Southern California to Portland,
Ore. The vehicle was recovered without the salad dressing, which
included 664 cases of Olive Oil &AMP; Vinegar, 238 cases of Balsamic
Vinaigrette and 344 cases of Family Recipe Italian.

<P>
   GREAT BRINGTON, England _ It is spelled simply enough, in just
two syllables, with no strange or gimmicky combinations of letters.
But for centuries, it has been grievously mispronounced by everyone
who is not anyone.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. Why would the average person know that the word
Althorp is supposed to be pronounced AWL-trupp?
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the question Earl Spencer, brother of the late
Diana, Princess of Wales and the owner of Althorp, the family's
impressive ancestral estate next to this tiny village, asked
himself recently. In a highly unaristocratic move, the earl
announced that Althorp should henceforth be known the way common
people might think it should be known, as AWL-thorp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems fitting to change the pronunciation once and for all
to a version that everyone can pronounce and understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The earl, who particularly wants things to be user-friendly for
the tens of thousands of visitors he hopes to attract this summer
to the Diana-themed memorial at Althorp, said that the word had
always given him trouble. Before he inherited his earldom and went
by the lowlier title of Viscount Althorp, for instance, he arrived
at a new job in New York to find his name listed as ``Al Thorp.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it was a shot across the bow, Spencer's bold declaration
of linguistic democracy does not seem to have unsettled the
countless British aristocrats who wear their own flamboyantly
semi-pronounceable names, and those of their enormous homes, like
badges of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The Cholmondeley family, for example, was not suddenly moved to
declare that from now on they no longer wanted to be called the
CHUM-leys. Nor did the Earl of Harewood announce an end to his
preferred pronunciation, HAR-wood, either for himself or his
estate, Harewood House, even though the adjoining village of
Harewood, full of non-aristocratic residents, calls itself
HAIR-wood.
</P>
<P>
   And the Beaulieus are still clinging to their traditional style,
simple and decidedly un-Frenchified: BEW-ley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of those things that either you know, or you
don't know,'' said an official at Cholmondeley castle, explaining
how civilians learn, apparently by osmosis, that the unwieldy word
is supposed to be spoken as chumley. (``No, indeed not,'' she
added, when asked whether her name might be used.)
</P>
<P>
   What gives these people, you might ask, the right to defy the
conventions of the alphabet and insist on eccentric pronunciations
of their own choosing?
</P>
<P>
   ``All this nonsense is about who's in the club, and who's out,''
said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage.
``There is a tendency in this country to change names around, in
order to appeal to the upper classes in a way that doesn't allow
the lower classes to pronounce things correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many things connected to the upper classes in Britain,
though, it is more complicated than that. Many of the most
aristocratic families in Britain have names that date back many
hundreds of years, to a time when words were not always spelled or
pronounced as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that we've been literate for so long,''
said Graham Pointon, a pronunciation adviser in the BBC's
Pronunciation Department. ``The English language has been written
down since Anglo-Saxon times. While the pronunciation has moved on,
the spelling has lagged behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, he said, the pronunciation of long words changed
simply because people were sick of having to use so many syllables.
Think of how Worcestershire is supposed to be pronounced
WUSS-ter-sheer; or how Magdalene, a college at Cambridge University
(and also at Oxford, but there spelled without the final `e'), is
supposed to be pronounced MAUD-lin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of language is to communicate as much as
possible with the least possible effort, so sounds which used to be
pronounced are left out over time,'' Pointon said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Britain where people of all stripes are highly attuned
to social distinction, the way words are pronounced cannot help but
separate the wheat from the chaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those class distinction indicators that people
like to hang onto to show that they're upper class,'' said Robin
Harcourt Williams, the librarian at Hatfield House, the home of the
very upper class Cecil (rhymes with thistle) family.
</P>
<P>
   And changing one's name _ or one's pronunciation _ has long been
used by the lower classes to affect a patina of poshness. One of
the most popular comic creations on television, for instance, is
the character Hyacinth Bucket in ``Keeping Up Appearances,'' who
insists that her name be pronounced Boo-KAY.
</P>
<P>
   And many Britons speak fondly of people their parents or
grandparents knew who were desperate to save themselves from
embarrassing names by inventing exotic pronunciations. That way,
for instance, the comical Sidebottoms became the flamboyant
sid-AY-boh-TOMS.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the same family often disagree on how their names
should be pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Powell, Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief of staff,
pronounces his last name to rhyme with towel. But Charles, his
older brother, a Conservative who served as chief of staff for
former Prime Minister John Major, decided that he wanted to
pronounce it in a slightly snootier way, to rhyme with roll _ the
usage also favored by the late novelist Anthony Powell. (Major
himself has a brother named Terry Major-Ball, but dropped the
``Ball'' in his own name).
</P>
<P>
   In Great Brington, where they have always said AWL-thorp, there
was general relief at Spencer's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visitors were always embarrassed when I told them they were
mispronouncing it,'' said Christine Whiley, the Great Brington
postmistress. ``I'm glad he's finally bowed to public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Geordie Greig (pron. gregg), the editor of the Tatler
magazine and a keen student of Britain's upper classes, being a
member himself, said he was sorry to see the old usage go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always thought I was being incredibly clever, knowing it
was AWL-trupp,'' he said, fondly mentioning one of his other
favorite words, equerry (pron. uh-QUAIR-y by those in the know,
apparently). ``It was always nice to have thought one was on the
inside track, and now we're all left with this lowest-common
denominator word, with everything reduced to its simplest, blandest
and most approachable level.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Spencer said, he is sure people will continue
to find ways of getting the name Althorp wrong. When his sister
died, he said, one American television station reported that her
body was heading to its ``final resting place, at Antwerp.''

   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the candidate for Mexico City mayor
from the leftist party governing the city, has surged to a 17-point
lead over two rivals, a poll of 1,109 people by the newspaper
Reforma said. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent. His stunning rise came during a monthlong challenge to his
residency credentials by President Ernesto Zedillo's party. A court
threw out the challenge, and the candidate appears to be drawing
support from voters who see him as a victim of official harassment.

a Chechen political figure freed from prison last fall and put in

the 1998 Omagh bombing that killed 29 people. Fifteen other men

Adoption of the proposals would not come before December 2001.

 &HT;    Desired finish line awaits in Sydney
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ When the NCAA Track and Field Championships start
today, a number of elite athletes will be aspiring to use their
performances as a springboard into the Olympic Trials later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina hurdler and sprinter Terrence Trammell has a
legitimate shot of competing in Sydney. Others such as Georgia
hammer thrower Andras Haklits (Croatia) already have earned spots
on their countries' Olympic teams. And some, like Georgia Tech
freshman 800-meter whiz Brendon Mahoney, are just soaking up the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is definitely to make the (NCAA) finals, then to run a
fast enough time to qualify for the Olympic Trials,'' Mahoney said.
He is a Marist product whose 1-minute, 48.4-second clocking is the
fastest by a collegiate freshman this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an unbelievable experience to run with Olympic
hopefuls but also a great learning experience for the next Olympic
Trials,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC 800-meter champ needs to lower his time to 1:46.7, and
his next shot comes tonight in the 800 semifinals. Advancing to the
Friday final will be the eight fastest runners in a talented field
that features defending champion Derrick Peterson, a Missouri
senior and Lovejoy High graduate.
</P>
<P>
   If the championships hold to form, the meet can be counted on to
produce Olympians _ possibly even Sydney medalists.
</P>
<P>
   In its pre-trials form chart, Track and Field News picks
Peterson fifth in the 800 and Trammell third in the 110 hurdles.
Stanford's Gabe Jennings is picked second in the 1,500, and UCLA's
Seilala Sue ranks as the favored discus thrower. The best shots for
collegians to make the U.S. team are in the sprints, with such
hopefuls as Coby Miller of Auburn, Shawn Crawford of Clemson and
Southern Cal's Angela Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long distances are so much mental and experience, and a
lot of these people they'll be racing against at the trials have
had years of world-class racing,'' said Rachel Cook, distance coach
at the University of Georgia. ``Then, Gabe Jennings has run 3:37,
and, on any given day, that can make the team. Plus, he's been good
at an international level.''
</P>
<P>
   And gifted as the sprinters might be, they will have their hands
full at the trials. The 100 world record-holder, Maurice Greene,
also is challenging record-holder Michael Johnson in the 200. It's
no easier on the women's side, where Marion Jones and Inger Miller
are favored in the 100 and 200.
</P>
<P>
   To improve his chances, Trammell, a Southwest DeKalb graduate,
plans to try the rare double of the 100 and the 110 hurdles, both
here and at the trials in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't see why a collegiate athlete could not make
the (Olympic) team unless they were injured or mentally drained,''
said Trammell, defending NCAA hurdles champion. ``The top times
right now in the U.S. are mostly collegiate athletes. The biggest
thing for the collegiate athlete, because of the strenuous season,
is getting rest and still staying sharp for the Olympic Trials.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Bev Kearney is at the pinnacle of her
profession. But is that enough for the driven women's track and
field coach at the University of Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   She's come so far. At 42, she's in the third year of a five-year
contract that pays her an annual base salary of $110,000, and few
college track coaches make more. Of course, few have accomplished
more than the former Auburn sprinter who got into coaching almost
by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney is a seven-time national coach of the year. Her
Longhorns have won four of the last five NCAA team titles,
including the past two outdoor crowns leading into this week's meet
at Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kearney sees so much still to be done, both in terms of
rebuilding her young team as well as the much bigger and more
significant picture of the gender and racial equality in her
profession.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, however: Success hasn't mellowed her. If
anything, it's merely stoked her already raging competitive fire,
which was one reason she was so upset last week after Nebraska
snapped Texas' string of nine straight conference outdoor
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard she was intense, but it's even more than I
thought,'' said John Rembao, Kearney's assistant for three years.
``She's a vicious competitor. After the Big 12 meet, she was like,
`I believe in them. Why don't they believe in themselves?' Things
like that just tear her up. She takes it personally because she
believes it's her fault when we don't do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not her nature to sit idly by and allow bad things to
happen when she thinks she can do something about it,'' Rembao
added. ``A lot of people don't know quite what to make of her
because they can't imagine anyone hating to lose as much as she
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearney arrived at Texas in 1993 after five seasons as coach at
the University of Florida. Her overall coaching resume includes 30
coach-of-the-year honors, 20 NCAA top-10 finishes, five NCAA
titles, 25 NCAA individual champions and 16 conference team crowns.
</P>
<P>
   And she shows no sign of letting up. It's apparent by the way
she paces nervously at big meets, usually alone. Often, not even
her own assistant coaches and support staff can find her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been tough, and she's getting tougher,'' said
former UT quartermiler Suziann Reid, a 17-time All-American who
continues to train with Kearney along with numerous other elite
athletes. ``It doesn't matter how much success she's had. She knows
people are coming after her, so she demands the best from herself
as well as us. She gets tougher every day, and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   A question-and-answer session with Kearney:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you gotten over losing the Big 12 outdoor meet to
Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know if you get over it. You just move on. Whether
you have a good experience or bad experience, it stays with you.
Unfortunately, the bad experiences seem to linger a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you discussed it with your team?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've had some small meetings and some individual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was said?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm pretty direct. Some people would probably call it harsh.
It just depends on where your head is as to how you receive it. If
you understand that what I'm telling you is said in a manner that's
trying to help you, then you'll take it in the right way. If you're
in a defensive move, it's going to be offensive. It depends on the
person receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you worry about how they take it when you're being direct?
</P>
<P>
   A: You always worry about how it's going to impact somebody, but
the bottom line is you have to weigh that against whether or not
withholding the information is going to hurt them more than giving
them the information. I always feel that if you've got a way to
help a person get beyond what prevented them from doing their best
in the first place, the personal sacrifice may be to you because
sometimes there is some fallout from their reaction. But you've got
to be willing to take that chance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you think at the Big 12 meet when you saw the
Nebraska women celebrating after (UT's) Nicole Hoxie false-started
in the hurdles?
</P>
<P>
   A: I immediately wanted to come back in the next event and drill
them. When that happens, it makes me want to shut you down.
Unfortunately my team didn't respond that way. It's like in
basketball. If someone slams on you, you can either pout about the
slam or come back and turn the crowd back in your direction by
doing something even greater. Me? I want to shut you back down. My
goal is not to give you any more ammunition than you've already
got.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People would say you're at the top of your profession. Do you
feel that way?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you start to get wrapped up in the success and failures
in your past, you forget about what you're doing now. Whether I win
or lose, I'm moving on because winning last year isn't going to
help me win this year. Losing last year doesn't mean I'm going to
lose next year. The greatest tragedy any program, coach or team can
do to itself is to rely only on tradition to sustain itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is winning national championships what you thought it would
be?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's what I thought it would be and more. It's also a lot
less. It depends on what perspective you're looking at it from.
When you finally get it done and you see the look on your team's
face and all the accolades that come from it, it's wonderful. It's
like you can finally exhale. But if you think it's going to mean a
life change, you're wrong. It did not guarantee me greater
acceptance as a coach. It did not guarantee me access to the inner
circles. I still had to face a lot of the biases that women and
minorities face. That was one of the things that was really
discouraging to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has that aspect gotten better?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. And I don't know if it will ever change. That was the one
thing I had to realize. You think if you work and achieve all these
things, all of a sudden life will become fair, and it doesn't. It
doesn't create a greater or equal playing field for you. You still
have to overcome a lot of biases in society and in sport.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you cite an example?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't pinpoint and I'd prefer not to pinpoint any
particular situation, because I've never used it as a crutch. But
you've got to look at the lack of numbers of women and minorities
in coaching, and you've got to understand there is a struggle still
going on. A lot of what I've done has been pioneering, and that's
made it very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of salary and prestige, you're at the top of your
profession. So do you still consider this your fight?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most definitely. Money doesn't change that aspect of it.
That's always going to be a very strong passion of mine. That's one
of the reasons I've made it, because I hope I can open up doors to
show administrations and universities that we can do this. If
that's not part of the mission of what I do, winning and losing
isn't worth it. You can't pay us enough money for the amount of
hours, stress, time and effort we put into this. It's not just
about the money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has reaching this point in your career been as fulfilling as
you thought it would be?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm amazed at where I am. I'm in shock. Sometimes I walk
around the campus and I wonder, ``Is it me here?'' I get
embarrassed when I walk in the Co-op and see that poster of myself
because I never thought that would be me. I see videos from
national telecasts and think, ``C'mon, is that really you?'' At
some point you're going to wake up, and it's all going to
disappear. I think I'm more amazed than anything else. I know it's
not my doing but the grace of God that I'm here because you never
think that you have the type of abilities or special skills to
accomplish all that I've done. I can't give you a road map on how
I've done it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you as big a target as your team?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think I'm the main target. I have absolutely no idea why. I
know I can be very outspoken. I say what I feel and fight for what
I believe in, and I can be very passionate when I believe in a
cause. When I go to a meet, I'm there to take care of my team and
so I don't do a lot of socializing, and that can be misunderstood a
lot of times.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So other coaches perceive you as aloof?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know what it would be called, but they don't know me
well. There are only a few coaches that I have a lot of
conversations with. At a meet, I'm working. I'm a basket case
before my athletes compete. When I leave a meet, I'm exhausted.
I've run, I've jumped, I've sprinted, I've done exchanges, I've
hurdled. I go home and I'm just busted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you're not a social animal at meets?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been burned a lot. I used to be a lot more open, but
when you sit down and talk about situations and then you hear the
information back in a way that wasn't given, I've learned to be
more protective of myself. When I first got started in the
profession, I went to some older coaches and got burned. It ripped
my heart out. I have a lot of acquaintances on the track circuit
but not a lot of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a lot of jealousy toward you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people have, in the past, felt this was their job and
that I didn't deserve it. I've heard comments like, ``If I had the
team she had, I'd have won, too.'' Or, ``She can't coach. She can
just recruit.'' I've heard it all, man. I'll tell people in a
minute that there are coaches more technically proficient than me
and more meticulous than me. But nobody works harder than me in
this sport.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But hasn't it taken more than hard work for you to reach this
level?
</P>
<P>
   A: Honestly, I think it has to do with the fact that what I
don't know, I'll find out. I made a pact with myself that I'd never
let what I don't know hurt my athletes in achieving what they seek.
I think my greatest asset is like when a mom knows when something
is wrong with their child. I think I have very good instincts. God
has blessed me with that ability, and that goes beyond any type of
coaching. Sometimes, if you really watch what I do, it doesn't make
sense, because I'll invent some stuff. I'm out there. I'm
completely off the wall when I coach. Sometimes I'll stay up all
night because I can't figure something out. I should literally be
exhausted when I get to the track but I'll just be wired, because
I've got it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has your philosophy changed with your success?
</P>
<P>
   A: When it gets to the point where I no longer desire to be the
best, I don't think I need to be at Texas. It doesn't mean when I
can't win, I don't need to be here because that's impossible for
anybody to expect, to win all the time. It's just unrealistic. But
when you lose the desire to be the best, whatever the best might be
at that point in time given the circumstances, you need to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can success get old?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think that ever happens. I think the fight sometimes
can get tiring. Or you can lose the passion for what you're
fighting for. If you cease to believe this is a battle, then it's
time to move on to another battle. I was told once that I always
complain that I don't get enough rest but that I always manage to
fill up the calendar even when I don't have to. At first I refused
to believe that about myself, but I realized that last year, yeah,
I'm like that. I need to learn to say no sometimes and take some
time off.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything in coaching you still want to do?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not in coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Then what?
</P>
<P>
   A: I might like to start a business. I originally wanted to go
into counseling with a spiritual base, but I want to do something
in fitness, counseling and wellness. I want to eventually develop a
sanctuary of peace where people can come and just forget. Where
they can get pampered by fitness and counseling. It's not
necessarily a religious thing, but it has to have a spiritual base
because I think that's the only true means to peace and joy. It
would have to have a very peaceful environment. I'm kind of corny,
I guess.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there time in your life now for serenity?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, and I think that's why I'm seeking it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is coaching as much fun now as it was when you were trying to
reach this point in your career?
</P>
<P>
   A: In some ways yes, in some ways no. I miss the naivete of it
all from when I first started. But I don't miss not even being
given a visit by a prospect. Now I can get my foot in the door. It
doesn't guarantee me any results, but at least I can get my foot in
the door. I now have people wanting to come to Texas and train with
Bev Kearney. I love that aspect, but I miss the naivete of it all,
when you just didn't know what you couldn't do. I just didn't know
any better, starting out. I try to retain a little bit of that in
everything I do. I always try to hire coaches who don't have a huge
past in coaching because they're enthusiastic enough and still
present that naivete of why can't we do this or that. I always want
people with that kind of mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But for you personally, the fire's still there?
</P>
<P>
   A:It ain't going nowhere.

SPORTS COLUMN: WORN WITH PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The native New Yorker Mark Jackson, in a
lemon-colored suit, was chatting with a knot of people after the
game on Monday. They were standing alongside the Madison Square
Garden court about a half hour after the Knicks had beaten
Jackson's Indiana Pacers, 91-89, in Game 4 of the Eastern
Conference finals. Jackson was approached by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark,'' the reporter said, ``what did you think of Chris
Dudley?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson looked at him with something close to crossed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come here when I'm talking to my family and ask me about
Chris Dudley?'' he said. Then he smiled a wan smile. ``He does what
he's asked to do. He did a great job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. A few minutes earlier, in another part of the Garden,
the coach of the Pacers, one Larry Joe Bird, had a like thought.
``One of our main problems was not getting too many second-chance
points,'' he said, ``especially when Dudley was in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley's own coach, Jeff Van Gundy, pointed to a moment in the
third period when the Knicks, who had enjoyed a big lead, saw it
shrink. ``Then we missed two straight shots but Chris got the
offensive rebounds both times, passed out to Larry Johnson one time
and Charlie Ward the other,'' Van Gundy said, ``and turned them
both into 3-pointers. They were huge plays for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for someone to have such an impact when he played
only eight minutes of the entire game, taking one shot and sinking
none, and when he is given no opportunity to shoot a free throw,
which, in general, is a blessing in disguise, for he is the single
worst free-throw shooter in National Basketball Association
history, at 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley also is less than the most graceful basketball player. He
is often in foul trouble. He is 6 feet 11 inches, with a square jaw
as well as a square face, and, perhaps because of back problems and
knee problems, his gait is uncommon. If you saw him at a curb, you
might ask if he needed help to cross the street. If he were a
trapeze artist, one could imagine him pulling down the the swinging
bar and collapsing the rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs, the Knick guard, calls him Dr. Crash. ``Because,''
explained Childs, ``he crashes the boards for rebounds. He's not
one to shy away from contact. He'll knock over a teammate as soon
as he would a guy from the other team. He goes all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley has been the starting center for the Knicks since Patrick
Ewing went down with an foot injury in Game 2 against Indiana, and
may be at that post Wednesday in Indianapolis for Game 5, if Ewing
is still ailing. Before this, Dudley had played in just one game in
the last month and a half of the regular season, and just 20
seconds of one game in the Toronto playoffs and .7 seconds in his
one game in the Miami series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he is effective in blocking shots, running the floor,
defending, rebounding and hustling for loose balls. In an odd way,
he is a living metaphor for the spirit of the whole team. ``Even
though he hadn't been playing,'' Van Gundy said, ``Chris stayed in
shape, worked hard in practice _ and after practice _ and did the
job when he was called on.'' Van Gundy also said that most people
don't realize how ``banged up'' Dudley is. Like the rest of the
Knicks, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Miami series, Chris came to me and said he wanted to
play and believed he could help the team,'' Van Gundy said. ``I
told him I couldn't make promises. He could have shut down and just
collected his money. He didn't. He's the ultimate professional.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Dudley's 13th season in the league. He is 35 years old
and is in the second year of a four-year, $28 million contract. He
is also that rare National Basketball Association specimen, an Ivy
Leaguer _ an economics major and third-generation Yalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered if some of my shooting problems are because I
overanalyze things too much,'' he said. But he's also, now, ``a
little rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wide-open shot in Game 3 but passed the ball because I
was disoriented,'' he said. ``I thought I was farther under the
basket than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his notorious free-throw shooting, he's been diligent
recently at practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much improved,'' said the Knicks assistant coach Brendan
Malone, ``but it's hard for fans to tell because he doesn't go to
the line that much.'' In Game 3, when he hit two straight free
throws, the cheers shook rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley is an unassuming man, a generous spirit _ he has a
foundation for helping disadvantaged youngsters to a college
education _ and a family man. He and his wife, Christine, have an
18-month-old boy, Charles, who, at games may be the only person in
the Garden wearing a Knicks shirt with ``Dudley 14'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   It appears he wears it with pride, like his dad.  &QL;

 &HT;    Nasdaq's bounce a record 7.9%
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors returned to the stock market after the Memorial Day
holiday in a buying mood on Tuesday, and their appetite for
battered technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq composite index to a
record percentage gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing specific driving investor sentiment, but
bargain hunting following recent declines is not surprising,'' said
Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst David Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the gains occurred on relatively modest volume _ 830
million New York Stock Exchange shares _ continuing a trend of weak
trading that has made analysts cautious about calling an end just
yet to the market's spring sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Nasdaq market was propelled by a revitalized
technology sector, led by big-cap tech names that rebounded from
last week's battering.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 254.37 points to 3,459.48, posting its
second-largest one-day point gain _ less than a half-point shy of
the gain on April 18. In percentage terms, the gain of 7.9 percent
surpassed the previous record of 7.3 percent on Oct. 21, 1987,
following the market's crash that year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts credited some of the technology demand to Lehman
Brothers semiconductor analyst Dan Niles, who said Intel is one of
his favorite stocks. Intel shares rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim said the market's ``prevailing themes'' are still in
place: the still-high valuation of many shares, and the interest
rate outlook based on the economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   The first of several economic reports this week that will get
the market's close attention _ a stronger-than-expected consumer
confidence report for May _ caused a brief downdraft in the market
early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most significant is Friday's release of the May payroll
report,'' said Kim. ``Tight labor market conditions have been
repeatedly raised as a potential (economic) imbalance by the
Federal Reserve, and Friday's release will be significant in
shaping Fed expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The plus side of the Fed's almost yearlong series of six
interest rate increases, designed to slow an inflationary economy,
is that they are closer to the end than to the beginning, Kim
added.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in technology shares spilled over into the market
generally, producing a broad-based rise. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 2.2 percent, the broader S&AMP;P 500 stock index 3.2
percent and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks _ including
many technology companies _ 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's rally, the market remains seriously depressed
for the year. The Nasdaq suffers the most, trading more than 31
percent below its March 10 all-time high of 5,048.62 and 15 percent
below its 1999 close.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average is also down 8 percent for the
year and 10 percent below its January high, while the S&AMP;P 500 is
down 3 percent for the year and almost 7 percent below its late
March high.

 &HT;    xpo Design Center entering Chicago
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Homeowners in Chicago will soon get their first taste
of Home Depot's Expo Design Center stores.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said Tuesday it has nailed down sites to open three
interior design showrooms in the Windy City next year. Real estate
brokers are looking for a fourth spot, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Expo stores, designed to sell high-end remodeling projects
and decor, will open in several new markets this year as part of a
national rollout. Home Depot, based in Cobb County at I-285 and
Paces Ferry Road, currently has 15 Expos in six states. The
retailer wants to open about 200 Expos over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Existing Expo markets will get more stores, too. Last week, Home
Depot opened an Expo buying office in Orange, Calif., to support
its West Coast expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Two Expos are scheduled to open this year in Southern
California, where it already has three Expos. Another two will open
this year near San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other expansion sites this year include Boston and Detroit,
which are both new Expo markets, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, the retailer is scouting real estate in
Buckhead, Kennesaw and northern Gwinnett County. Expo President
Bryant Scott has said he wants to open four more showrooms here, in
addition to the Perimeter Mall and Alpharetta locations.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Indoors, a competing concept by Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
is speeding up growth plans as Expo moves across the country. Sears
Chairman and Chief Executive Arthur Martinez recently told analysts
that 100 sites would be picked by 2002. The Great Indoors currently
operates two stores in Denver and Scottsdale, Ariz. and plans to
open two more in Detroit and Dallas this year.

<P>
   YANJI, China _ As the police truck bumped past frosty pine trees
toward the North Korean border in January, Yoon and the six other
prisoners locked in back knew they had only an hour to act.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of thousands of hungry North Koreans who have
sneaked into China, Yoon and his wife first came to find food,
escaping a deadly famine in their homeland. But now, two years
later, Chinese police officers had burst into their tiny rented
room, arrested the couple and were sending them back separately _
to certain persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon, 29, still vividly recalls a terror-filled ride, as he sat
alternately crying and clawing at the cable lock that sealed the
truck's back gate. Just miles from the border, it snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of us ran away, but a woman and her 15-year-old couldn't
run fast enough,'' said Yoon, a baby-faced former professional
athlete who is now a fugitive in China again. ``We pulled and
pulled. We were totally desperate. If I'm sent home I'll be
sentenced to life in prison _ or death. I will do anything not to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police in recent months have sharply increased their
efforts to expel North Koreans living undercover in China, creating
a climate of fear along the border and fueling a potentially
explosive international refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, migrants are extremely nervous about
interviews, refusing to divulge names and hometowns, or to have
pictures taken, for fear of helping the Chinese or North Korean
authorities to locate and them and send them back, or persecute
relatives still at home.
</P>
<P>
   The number of ``food migrants'' sent back has at least doubled
this year, to about 2,000 a month, aid groups on the border say.
The problem is that the office of the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees says it believes that a number of the people whom the
Chinese call ``food migrants'' probably meet the criteria for
protected political refugee status, which would make their return
illegal under international law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese government is not allowing U.N. workers to
travel to the border to make that determination, even though China
has signed related treaties.
</P>
<P>
   While most North Korean refugees are driven to China by hunger,
their government often regards them as traitors once they flee.
Many face not just renewed hunger, but also persecution if they are
returned.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly why China has begun in earnest to enforce
its longstanding policy, but experts point out that the Chinese are
hoping for a visit this year from North Korea's reclusive Communist
leader, Kim Jong Il, and fear the growing stream of gaunt North
Koreans crossing their border.
</P>
<P>
   And so the government has recently stepped up raids on the
hundreds of tiny shelters and factories where the illegal migrants
live and work, generally run by local churches, South Korean aid
groups or Chinese of Korean descent.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, local authorities generally ignored the 100,000 to
200,000 North Koreans estimated to be staying illegally in this
border region, where the language of small talk is Korean and the
favored dish is spicy kimchi. North Koreans were generally deported
only if they became too visible or committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has quietly expressed concern to the
Chinese about its poor access. Most Western nations, though
disturbed, have remained mum. All worry that criticism would prompt
the Chinese to seal the border altogether, closing what remains an
important safety valve for a five-year famine that experts say has
caused as many as 2 million deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people were from Cuba, or Vietnamese boat people,
they would absolutely be considered political refugees,'' said a
Western scholar who studies Korea. ``But this is very delicate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly how many North Koreans have recently been
handed over to North Korean border guards on the bridges that span
the narrow Tumen River. Relief workers with contacts at the local
public security bureau say the number was about 7,200 in 1999 and
is likely to be at least twice as high this year.
</P>
<P>
   While refugees say first-time offenders who are sent back to
North Korea are sometimes released after questioning, repeat
offenders are punished harshly. Yoon said his older brother had
been imprisoned after being forced back to North Korea and later
died in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 80 prisoners on the verge of repatriation at a
Chinese border jail took two guards hostage, demanding not to be
sent back, North Koreans and aid workers here said. It was a
predictably futile move: Chinese soldiers easily regained control,
sending back 60 right away.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoon's wife, Lee, who was jailed at one of the five Chinese
border prisons here earlier this year, understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was freezing, there were not enough mattresses and meals
were just a bit of rice or porridge,'' recalled Lee, a lively
former singer. ``But what was on our minds, all the time, was that
we needed to escape.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   North Hamgyong Province, across the border from China, is a
mountainous mining region of North Korea, poorly suited to farming.
So when the state grain distribution system there stopped providing
regular food deliveries in 1996, after years of weather disasters
and mismanagement, people had little to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 40, a former interpreter and Communist Party member from
the province, who is now being hidden by a church group in China,
made her first trip across the border in June 1998, because she
``couldn't stand the hunger anymore.'' She has since been sent back
to North Korea twice, with increasingly severe punishments each
time.
</P>
<P>
   In a former life, she remembers, there was an apartment stocked
with food, a good job, a television and two happy children. Now,
with hollow cheeks and perpetually downcast eyes, she and her
husband survive on handouts, spending their days hiding in a low,
dark room with other North Koreans. She had never met a Westerner
before, and in the back room of a cheap Korean restaurant, she
talked nervously.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, she recounted, she and her husband left
their children with relatives and simply waded across the Tumen
River into China when the North Korean guards changed. The Chinese
do not aggressively police the long border, although migrants say
patrols have recently increased. The couple were sent back just two
months later, by police officers investigating a murder, but were
treated benignly in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The police questioned them but in the end sent them home,
saying, ``We understand that you don't have anything to eat, so go
home and don't do it again,'' Kim recalled. But having long since
sold their possessions to buy food, they said, they had no way to
eat. Soon they waded back.
</P>
<P>
   Like many North Koreans who subsist in China, they rarely
ventured out and were ultracautious, moving from safe house to safe
job and back again. But when Kim's sister fell ill in a distant
Chinese city, they went to help her and were quickly detained.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Kim said, her forced return to Korea was marked by
beatings and, finally, jail.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean police immediately took her to a security
office for a violent interrogation, she said. Officers punched her,
demanding to know why she had left and where she had lived. North
Korean agents work extensively in the Chinese border region, trying
to identify Koreans who have strayed and the Chinese who help them,
aid groups say.
</P>
<P>
   The process was repeated at a second security office, where the
delicate woman said she was tied up by her hair. Then, exhausted,
she was sent to a prison, where the inmates slept on the floor
without sheets, and where there were no showers. Although the
prisoners worked long days in the field, she said, rations were
meager and families were expected to bring in food. Many had none
to give.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions got so bad that the wardens started releasing
prisoners, including Kim. ``They were worried someone would die and
didn't want to be held responsible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her brief elation turned to terror when a policeman, a
childhood friend, told her that she would be rearrested. She said
goodbye to her two children, now 11 and 15, and fled _ this time in
need of political protection. ``I miss them terribly, but if I go
back now I'll be executed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoon, the former athlete, is terrified by the current crackdown
because he has similar fears. When he sneaked across the border the
last time, in 1998, he was already running from Korean police
officers who had come to arrest him for two previous trips to
China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the food shortages started, ``we stole coal from a
railroad yard by our home _ which we sold or traded for food _ and
in the summer we stole from state farms,'' Yoon said. But in 1997
he had to make the two brief trips in search of additional food.
</P>
<P>
   When he fled this last time, sympathetic Chinese helped him and
his wife find work on a farm in Heilongjiang Province, 100 miles
from Yanji. There, the urban couple planted rice, for a total of
$70 a year, before the farmer kicked them out, saying the police
might raid his property.
</P>
<P>
   They then moved to Yanji, a small industrial city, where Yoon
found work in a candle factory and Lee knitted for a living. Last
Dec. 12, police officers beat down the door of the tiny apartment
where they lived quietly with two other migrants and took the
terrified couple to the station.
</P>
<P>
   There, interrogators accused them of one crime: being North
Koreans in China illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us over and over, asking, `You are North Koreans,
aren't you?' '' Yoon recalled. Using the broken Mandarin he had
picked up during almost two years in China, he hotly denied the
accusation. But despite hours of wailing and pleading, they were
ultimately separated and slated for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, both managed to elude return, he by jumping from
the truck, and she when a policeman plucked her from a vanful of
prisoners about to be handed over into North Korea. She suspects
that a man who had previously given her shelter bribed the police.
</P>
<P>
   Since that experience, the couple said, they have become even
more careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is getting worse in this area,'' said Yoon,
noting that the candle factory where he had long worked was afraid
to employ him any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is little he can do, a man who cannot go back to his
home _ or his 6-year-old daughter _ and cannot move forward either.
Asked about the future, the small, clean-cut man dressed in donated
clothes laughed, a mixture of sadness and cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking for North Koreans like me, there are no
plans,'' he said. ``I live day by day. Each night I just think,
`Good, I survived today.' ''

ANGER AND DISILLUSIONMENT SIMMERS IN ONCE-THRIVING SERB CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia _ Velimir Pajevic, a pediatric surgeon,
says that the average size of the craniums of newborns here is one
centimeter smaller than in 1991, a result of declining nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Kragujevac, the capital of Serbia in the early 1800s, is a city
of nearly 200,000 people, built around the Zastava car and
munitions factory, said to be the first factory built in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But after a decade of war, sanctions and decline, about 60
percent of those of working age are not working, said Branislav
Kovacevic, president of the Sumadija Coalition, a regional
opposition group in this traditional heartland of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Zastava, which employed 40,000 people 10 years ago, now employs
4,000, officials here say. Some 20,000 people are officially
unemployed, while 35,000 others are on ``paid leave'' from Zastava
and its associated companies.
</P>
<P>
   Branko Vuckovic, a reporter and editor with Radio Kragujevac,
said: ``This used to be the Serbian Detroit. Now it's the Serbian
Gdansk,'' the huge Polish shipbuilding city, where Solidarity was
born, that no longer makes many ships.
</P>
<P>
   He gestured to the remains of a few espressos and mineral waters
on a cafe table. ``That's about 100 dinars,'' he said, or about
$2.50 at the unofficial rate of exchange. ``Those on paid leave
from Zastava are paid 350 dinars a month _ just three times what's
on this table.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is repairing part of Zastava bombed by NATO
during the war, and says it has plans for greatly expanded car
production. But few here believe such assertions, saying the only
future for the factory is an assembly arrangement with a more
modern car company, currently impossible because of international
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Life is so hard here, for so many, that this is known as ``the
valley of the starving.'' Of course, that is an exaggeration, since
many city dwellers get by because of their connections to the land,
said Borivoje Radic, head of the city's Executive Council and a
member of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet life has rarely been harder here, he says. The city is also
home to at least 20,000 refugees, 15,000 of them from Kosovo and
the rest of them Serbs who fled from Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's annual budget, given the decline of the country's
currency and economy, is now only a fourth of what it was in 1997,
Radic says _ the equivalent of $4 million, down from $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   So there is plenty of anger here, in one of the most important
towns for Serbia's democratic opposition, some 90 miles south of
Belgrade. Here the opposition coalition built in 1996 and called
Zajedno, or Together, remains together, unlike that in Belgrade,
where the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic and the Serbian
Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic are usually at daggers drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for the opposition leaders in Belgrade,
Milosevic would not be in power,'' Kovacevic said, referring to
President Slobodan Milosevic. ``People no longer believe in the
people on the stage of those rallies.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, about 2,000 people a night gathered to protest the seizure
of Studio B in Belgrade, the main opposition television station,
while the crowd of protesters in Belgrade itself, 10 times larger
in population, had shrunk to fewer than 700.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Studio B was perceived as a
propaganda organ for Draskovic, much as state television served
Milosevic's interests, and did not function as a genuine
public-interest station.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there is a full complement of news, with Radio B2-92,
which lost its frequency in Belgrade, available, as well as
opposition television news and documentaries. A local FM station
broadcasts the Serbian-language programs of Radio Free Europe,
Voice of America, the BBC and Deutsche Welle all day long. ``People
here are well informed,'' Vuckovic said.
</P>
<P>
   A local opposition weekly, The Independent Light, said Serbia
was ``on the razor's edge,'' but described Belgrade as ``deaf,
blind and anemic,'' a pun on the association of independent
broadcasters, or ANEM, whose broadcasts can no longer be heard in
the capital. But it is also a commentary on the general view of
Belgrade from here, which is of well-off, cynical, corrupt
politicians and citizens who are largely indifferent to the fate of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgrade is a great disappointment,'' Radic said. ``You can't
expect to defend Studio B from here. If they dared to take TV
Kragujevac, we couldn't avoid a serious conflict.'' Like Studio B,
TV and Radio Kragujevac are owned by the city, which is run by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, four years ago, the Serbian authorities tried to seize
control of the television here. Up to 50,000 people gathered around
the station, which had been occupied by the police. People cut off
electrical power to the building and threatened to invade it; a
deal was done and the station was left alone.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the same now, Vuckovic said. ``In Serbia, we say
that when you show your teeth, the government retreats. But when
people are undecided, then they just go faster.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as everywhere in Serbia, there is more talk of revolution
than signs of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, the situation is highly explosive,'' Radic said. ``It
would only take a spark.'' Vuckovic agrees, saying, ``It's like a
small room full of gas fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the phlegmatic Pajevic thinks that the reality is far
different.
</P>
<P>
   There is less of a sense of revolution here than of passivity,
anxiety and alienation. People are still afraid to lose what little
they have left, and they mistrust the desires and capacities of the
Belgrade leaders of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Pajevic says the right analogy is surgical, not military.
``We're far from an explosion,'' he said. ``What you have here is
anesthesia, anesthesia and hopelessness. There is so much
disappointment in the opposition, many people won't even vote.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People live day to day, he said, scraping by on friends and gray
market trading. Few pay their electricity bills, but the government
does not insist, a form of social pacification. ``Our boss plays
nice like that,'' Pajevic said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   And while the independent newspaper Blic is available here, for
eight dinars, ``for the same money, people will buy bread and milk
for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Pajevic, the doctor's wife, is a city official in charge
of social welfare issues. A former member of Draskovic's party, she
has become disgusted with its hierarchy and joined the Democratic
Party instead, which has also disappointed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the opposition is dropping even here, where
the coalition continues,'' she said. ``There is too much corruption
and not enough clear goals and strategies. People need to see that
we are working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake of the opposition, Dr. Pajevic said, was to
win local elections four years ago and take power. ``These guys
were practically jobless, and now they've got cars and salaries and
cell phones and things to lose,'' he said. ``They've become fat and
happy. People wonder if they really do want change. People think
that both the regime and the opposition want to keep the status
quo.''

MARKETS SURGE AS TECH STOCKS RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index surged to its biggest
percentage gain and the second-largest point gain in its 29-year
history Tuesday as investors snapped up technology heavyweights
like Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index shot up 254.37 points, or 7.9
percent, to 3,459.48. Of the stocks that make up the Nasdaq 100
index, 98 rose in price, while the remaining 2 lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the gains, the Nasdaq is still down nearly 15 percent
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 44.43 points, or
3.2 percent Tuesday, to 1,422.45, and the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 227.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,527.13.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the Nasdaq was the highlight of a very strong
session for stocks generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the start of something good,'' said Bill Allyn,
head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. Allyn and others said it
was significant that stocks, which opened strong, remained that way
throughout the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors expected the market to rally and fail, as they have
so many times during this correction,'' he said. ``When the market
didn't pull back, it came as a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the positives and the possibility of an impending summer
rally, there are some caveats. This was the first day following a
long weekend, and trading volume, a good gauge of investor
enthusiasm, was fairly light. About 844.2 million shares traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   And the gains were recorded without a great deal of
market-moving news developments. Later this week investors will be
confronted with a number of important economic reports, including
May employment data scheduled to be released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But for a day, optimism reigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq is the index people will be watching going forward,
because it is seen as still being vulnerable,'' said Bill
Schneider, head of block equity trading at Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   The gains came on a day when Laszlo Birinyi, one of Wall
Street's most bullish stock market forecasters who runs his own
market research firm in Westport, Conn., turned a bit cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi, whose forecasts over the last few years have been
closer to the market's actual performance than most of his
colleagues, started the year predicting that the S&AMP;P 500 would rise
another 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have changed,'' since then, he said Tuesday.
As a consequence, Birinyi says the S&AMP;P will record a gain of
between 8 percent and 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look at the flow of funds, we don't see nearly as many
stocks being bought as over the last several years,'' he said,
``and the stocks that are being bought are not being purchased as
aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, although money flowing into equity mutual funds is
up 150 percent from a year ago, and funds flowing into aggressive
growth funds are up 220 percent, ``those stocks aren't really
reacting,'' he added. ``And cash levels are not unusually high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not bearish,'' Birinyi concluded. ``There are still a lot
of situations which under our metric look very good. I guess I am
rationally exuberant.''
</P>
<P>
   Big technology stocks like Cisco and Oracle jumped Tuesday.
Cisco gained 4 15/16, to 59 7/8. Oracle, the database software
maker, gained 7 3/16, to 74 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices rallied after a Lehman Brothers analyst issued a bullish
report on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's Semiconductor index rose 11.1
percent, its biggest gain in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro soared 11, to 85. And Intel surged 8 3/16, to 125
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone stocks got a boost from France Telecom S.A.'s $40
billion acquisition of Orange PLC from Vodaphone AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's PCS wireless unit rose 7/8, to 54 3/8. AT&AMP;T's Wireless
Group gained 1 3/8, to 27 5/8. And SBC Communications rose 1 5/8,
to 44 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream Wireless jumped 19 1/2, or 19.4 percent, to 119 7/8
after a Japanese newspaper reported that NTT DoCoMo, Japan's
largest mobile phone company, is in talks to buy as much as 20

ADVERTISING COLUMN: BANK'S UNUSUAL `BIG' ADS AIM FOR BRANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``What is this about big?'' Sir Anthony Hopkins asks in
a new campaign for Britain's second-largest bank, Barclays PLC,
which carries the tagline ``A Big World Needs a Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, seeing the big picture, having the big idea,
clinching the big deal. Nobody wants to clinch the little deal. Who
wants to do that? You'd be a little-deal clincher, a small shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, everything about Barclays' first branding campaign is
big. The actors that appear in the three commercials are big names:
Sir Anthony, Tim Roth and Nick Moran. Each actor commanded a big
fee; according to reports, Sir Anthony received a very big $1.2
million. The commercials are directed by a big-time director, Tony
Scott, who also directed ``Top Gun'' and ``Enemy of the State.''
The commercials themselves are shown on big screens at big movie
theaters across Britain, as well as on television and in print. And
the campaign has already reached a big audience: Barclays estimates
the campaign is reaching 80 percent of the British population.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one small problem with the $15 million campaign.
Barclays is _ as Hopkins mockingly forgets the campaign's
catchword, asking, ``Um, what's the word?'' _ well, small.
</P>
<P>
   The British bank is in the midst of a very big cost-cutting
program that at the very least will make the 300-year-old financial
institution smaller: It just closed 172 branches. Matthew Barrett,
the bank's new chief executive, is hoping that by having a big
brand, with the big reach of the Internet _ where he thinks most
consumers will bank in the future _ he can counter the effect of
the branch closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's a brand that is under-leveraged,'' Barrett
said. ``Brand is going to be increasingly important. When people
are surfing the Internet, why will they pick one supplier versus
another? It will be because they are aware of the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which was created by Leagas Delaney in London, was
a challenge because of the traditionally staid image of British
banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem that Barclays had was similar to the other banks
and financial institutions,'' said Tim Delaney, the advertising
agency's co-founder. ``Despite the enormous amount of money spent
on advertising in the last 10 to 15 years, they are all perceived
to be the same by customers.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercial starring Sir Anthony waxing on about all
things big has received the most attention, Barclays created two
other commercials playing on the ``big'' theme and several print
ads. In the commercial starring Tim Roth, he cites the World Trade
Center as an example of the tallest building in the world _ for
only 29 days, until another was built even taller.
</P>
<P>
   Legas Delaney won the Barclays account, beating J. Walter
Thompson, a unit of the WPP Group; the London office of Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy; and BMP DDB, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays settled on the unusual campaign after research pointed
them toward something a bit radical, at least for a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most banks, if you examine advertising around the world, they
position themselves as trying to be the friend to the customer,''
Barrett said. ``Bankers want to be loved, and that never flies.
People have lives, they have their own friends. They don't need us
for friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers may not need bankers as friends, but at least some
Londoners have questioned why anyone would want to use a big bank
as opposed to a small one, perhaps with personal service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's taking it too literally,'' said Caitlin Thomas, head of
brand advertising at Barclays. ``It was always a metaphor for the
breadth and depth of the resources we provide. Bigness is not all
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Anthony himself has come under increasing criticism for
participating in the advertisement. In a hand-written postcard to a
Labor Party politician, Gwenda Thomas, who had sought his support
in her campaign against some of the branch closings, Sir Anthony
said: ``It seems that I have been wholly responsible for leaving
thousands of people destitute. I just have to set the record
straight by saying that I do not run Barclays. I made a commercial
back last June. But I suppose the press love to have a scapegoat,
so why not an actor?''

 &HT;    New Vietnam memorial at the Atlanta History center
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's just a simple slab of marble, but a new Vietnam
War Monument located at the Atlanta History Center represents a
great deal to a local veterans group.
</P>
<P>
   The monument is meant to honor patriotism and remind visitors
that the Vietnam conflict hit Atlanta hard, claiming the lives of
at least 412 metro-area men.
</P>
<P>
   Believed to be Atlanta's first permanent Vietnam memorial, it
was erected in a Walk of Honor in a landscaped, flower-filled park.
It was unveiled in a solemn ceremony by the Atlanta Vietnam
Veterans Business Association, a low-profile group whose primary
mission is to honor those Atlantans who never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The group was founded on Veterans Day in 1981 by businessman Don
Pardue and several other Atlanta veterans who had gathered in a
local pub to toast their friends who never made it home. It has
grown to an organization of 250-plus members. For the past 13 years
it has erected monuments to individual Atlantans in locations
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Atlanta History Center, one of Atlanta's premier
tourist attractions, asked the group to dedicate a monument to all
metro Atlantans who died in Vietnam and to erect it on its property
at the corner of Slaton Drive and West Paces Ferry Road. The
history center's Walk of Honor, outside its pay-to-enter grounds,
is open to the public 24 hours a day and will eventually include
other monuments as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are honoring us by putting the memorial up here,'' says
history center director Rick Beard.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans group president, Rick Lester, 52, an Army
helicopter pilot who narrowly escaped death when he was shot down
in 1969, says thousands of people will be able to see the monument
in its prominent spot. ``This location will allow visitors to see
that Atlantans who selflessly answered their country's call and
made the ultimate sacrifice are forever in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the group will revert to its original plan of placing
monuments to individual Atlantans around the city, Lester says.
</P>
<P>
   The history center is covering the cost of the park, estimated
at $200,000, but the veterans group, which operates on the $25
annual dues of its members, is erecting the monument. Post
Landscape Group donated several thousand dollars for design.
</P>
<P>
   For the memorial's dedication, bagpipers, a 30-piece Army band
from Fort McPherson and an honor guard participated, and a rifle
squad fired a 21-gun salute. Lester, Beard and Gen. Hal Hornburg, a
veteran of the Vietnam, Persian Gulf and Kosovo wars, delivered
brief remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Lester says scores of family members of Atlantans who died or
who are still missing attended the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.), an honorary member of the Atlanta
Vietnam Veterans Business Association who became friends with
Lester when the two spent months in an Army hospital recovering
from their wounds, says ``what they do is a wonderful thing.
``Dedicating memorials to young Vietnam veterans in places where
people live, work and play _ I think that's a fascinating concept.
It's done with great dignity, with little fanfare. It's the Vietnam
veterans themselves and the families involved that are the focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just beautiful that in a quiet way, they have honored one
of their own every year. And only now is this group coming to
public attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard says the decision to erect the Vietnam memorial grew out
of the history center's decision earlier this year to host several
Vietnam War displays, which have proven popular. ``Reqium,'' a
collection of photos taken by journalists who died in action;
``Snapshots of the War'' by Capt. George Herren, depicting barracks
life in Vietnam; and ``Local Memories of a Distant War,'' featuring
artifacts loaned by members of the Atlanta veterans group, will
stay up through June 4.
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of the veterans business association is to
improve the Vietnam vets' image, which many feel was tarnished by
Hollywood and the news media during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't see yellow ribbons tied around trees to remember
friends and neighbors who were serving,'' Lester says. ``But I
think the public has realized what our true role was, and I've had
many people thank me for what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Army chopper pilot Mitch Johnson, 52, sees the veterans
group as ``a great representation for all soldiers, regardless of
what war they served in _ businesspeople who went through a lot and
are now doing things to help others.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a former Army nurse who remembers with horror
working on hundreds of wounded GIs, calls the veterans association
``a wonderful group which has given a lot to the city of Atlanta,
most particularly these families of these boys who were killed in
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardue, a 54-year-old infantry officer shot in the chest after
two months in Vietnam, says the group's founders never dreamed the
organization would grow into what it has become. But after its
first informal meeting, word spread among Atlanta Vietnam vets, and
by 1987 the group had enough members to begin erecting monuments to
individual Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kicked it around one night and said, `Why don't we do
something like they did in Washington but for Atlantans who
died?''' Pardue says. ``So we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group's members range from FBI agents to business
owners, corporate executives, attorneys, physicians, ministers,
judges, airline pilots and professors. They represent all ranks,
from enlisted men up to generals.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland says the ``image of the Vietnam veteran was sealed for
years as a walking time bomb, out of sorts with himself ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact is that most came back and in a very courageous
and positive way, picked up their lives and moved on. That's what
the AVVBA is _ people who saw vigorous combat but have moved on.''
</P>

 &HT;    Quiet intuition forges David Bottoms' connection between verse
and life
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The handwritten sign on the door of the convenience
store reads ``Gone to Doctor's. Back as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning across his seat to peer through the passenger-side
window, David Bottoms weighs his few options, then nudges the green
Toyota pickup back onto the two-lane highway. ``I knew he'd been
sick,'' he says. ``Well, I got to bring you back up here. This
place'' _ a Circle K somewhere in Cherokee County, Ga., _ ``it's
got the best CDs of anywhere around.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns the CD player in the truck up a gentle notch and the
disappointment is gone. ``Listen to that clear mountain voice,'' he
is saying as he points us back toward Canton, the town where he
grew up. ``That's Mac Wiseman. Lester Flatt and Mac Wiseman are two
of the best country singers ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's new poet laureate, appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes and
officially sworn in today, is a man who lets you know his
enthusiasms. He sets them before you like a man wanting to pour a
guest a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to see my truck,'' he was saying a few days earlier
over lunch, slapping an open hand on the table. ``That is a great
truck. Best truck I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Later: ``I want you to meet Kelly. She's a trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Jean Beard is his wife of 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to a Cobb County cinema to buy movie tickets for his
daughter's 10th birthday party: ``Rachel wants to meet you. You got
to meet Rachel. Little girls are something, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Mac Wiseman again: ``You say your wife likes
bluegrass? That's got to be a good woman.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be around Bottoms long to know what revs his
engine. A sweet-running pickup, bluegrass the way it's supposed to
be played, old tapes of the late Duane Allman's guitar riffs, a cut
of beef at Longhorn Steakhouse, poetry that hears the deep truths
the world is trying to tell us.
</P>
<P>
   Ask David Bottoms' acquaintances and former students at Georgia
State University what qualities define the man, and certain words
and descriptions keep coming up. He is unpretentious. He is
relaxed. He is comfortable with himself. He is patient. He takes
others more seriously than he takes himself. He has an intuitive
feel for what a student's poem wants to say, and helps her say it
in her own words.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are basically two kind of workshop leaders,'' says
Michele Newcome, who did graduate work in creative writing under
Bottoms. ``One kind is a good line editor, and another kind can
read a poem and know immediately what has to reach the reader. I
think it's a magical quality, and Dr. Bottoms has it.''
</P>
<P>
   He does have a Ph.D., but on the fourth or fifth time you hear
someone call this unprofessorial man ``Dr. Bottoms,'' your
curiosity is piqued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if everyone calls him that,'' Newcome says,
laughing, ``but for me, at least, it's a measure of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The respect goes beyond the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bottoms would invite us to his home for workshop,''
Newcome says, ``and we'd often bring our children. It never once
bothered him. One time, there was a student who had a 3-year-old,
and the child didn't have a tricycle. Dr. Bottoms went in the
garage and dug out a tricycle that had been his daughter's. He just
gave it to her.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't surprise you, once you've spent time with him. There
is a groundedness about Bottoms that seems more connected to the
simple upbringing in Canton, Ga., than to his upscale neighborhood
in east Cobb County, Ga., (``I couldn't live here if Kelly wasn't a
lawyer''). He was the only child of a father who nearly died at sea
in World War II and a mother who took him to a bookstore in Canton
every week. These are the kinds of things he remembers from his
childhood. The bookstore is long gone, replaced by a business that
deals in sewage treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, is the old wooden desk in a Canton classroom _ the
desk where his father, David Bottoms Sr., once carved his name as a
boy, the same desk his son found himself sitting in when he was in
sixth grade. ``You know how you go into a room the first day of
class and find where you want to sit,'' he says. ``I go to this
desk at the far corner of the room and I'm looking at my name
carved into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his poems, Bottoms imagined breaking into the school's
boiler room one night, hammer in one hand, flashlight in the other,
climbing a staircase, finding a door and sweeping the darkness with
his beam until it lights upon the tangible evidence of his father's
childhood, with its unspoken dreams and its silent sorrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Bottoms,'' says Ernest Suarez, a professor of English at
Catholic University of America, ``is a poet who focuses very
intensely on the physical world. But the poetry never stops there.
It's always with the intent of making us see beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, in Bottoms' poem ``The Desk,'' he imagines wresting the
scarred oak top free of its frame and slipping away with it into
the night. The minor vandalism would be discovered, but nothing of
value would be missing _ no typewriters, no business machines, no
audiovisual gear. Only a broken window and, inexplicably, a topless
desk.
</P>
<P>
   School officials would scratch their heads, wondering why anyone
would want an otherwise useless slab of wood, and that would be the
end of it. But years later the desk top would lie against the
vandal's basement wall, and he would ``wonder what it means to own
my father's name.''
</P>
<P>
   At 50 years of age, Bottoms has the look of a man in a
19th-century daguerreotype _ solemn of mien, slightly hunched in
posture, a salt-and-pepper beard that gives his face a look of
stern Calvinism. He and wife Kelly are Episcopalians, but he grew
up a Baptist, and his no-frills religious upbringing influenced his
poetic voice. He points to the First Baptist Church in Canton where
his mother went and, a few blocks away, Oakdale Baptist where his
father went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hers was the uptown church,'' he says. ``Or as uptown as
anything in Canton can be.''
</P>
<P>
   On most Sundays he worshipped uptown, but there were other weeks
when he would find himself in the pew with his father. The earthier
language of his father's church left him, he guesses, with a feel
for concrete images, natural speech rhythms and a directness of
manner. But he has since come to think of religion in terms of
mystery and revelation, and both, he says, are at the heart of what
a poet is attempting to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his truck in a parking lot that once had been a
baseball field his father had cleared and laid out, he says: ``It's
all gone now. It was very sad when they did all this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the lot is a tanning salon, a place to get your
nails done, a Domino's pizza house, an outlet for AirTouch cell
phones ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The world sends us all these signals,'' he says. ``The poet's
kind of the interpreter.'' Whatever the poem says on the surface,
there are emotional connections to what lies hidden beneath. It's
the poet's job, he says, to dig deep enough in his words and images
to find what is universal in his personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always looking for the mystery, in poetry and in life,''
says Megan Sexton, managing editor of Five Points magazine and a
former graduate student under Bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking for it even _ or maybe especially _ when he drives
a country back road, listening to the music of people whose voices
are the echo of generations. He is talking about something
contemporary _ public education _ when a note catches his ear.
``Listen to ol' Doc Watson play that guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns it up a notch, his ears a receiver for the signals the
world is sending him.

 &HT;    Rashes, rats and sex: `Survivor' bids to be next `Millionaire'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to Pulau Tiga, a remote island near Borneo, erstwhile
home to 16 castaways, one newly minted millionaire, an omnipresent
TV crew and a lot fewer rats than there used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The island was home-unsweet-home to ``Survivor.'' In March, 16
carefully screened volunteers were ``stranded'' on Pulau Tiga,
forced to build their own shelter, forage for food (rat-on-a-stick,
you'll learn, tastes just like chicken) and cope with infected
insect bites.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't fun enough, every few days they would hold a
tribal council and vote to exile one person. The last one standing
after 39 days on the island got $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of re-creating last summer's instant TV craze, ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' CBS will run ``Survivor'' as a 13-week
summer series. The network has been carefully orchestrating the
show's hype, setting up phone interviews for journalists but
refusing to send any tapes out in advance. A brief clip was shown
to advertisers in New York two weeks ago, but it was the equivalent
of a movie trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really couldn't let your guard down. You didn't know who
you could trust,'' Ramona Gray, 28, said in a telephone interview.
``I was prepared for anything physical, but the psychological part
was the hardest. One minute somebody could like you, the next
minute they would hate you.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gray, the participants included a retired CEO, a
single gay father, a housewife-mother, a basketball coach, a female
truck driver, a former Navy SEAL and a substitute teacher. They
range in age from 22 to 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has been compared to MTV's ``The Real World,''
``Gilligan's Island'' and ``Lord of the Flies,'' William Golding's
classic novel about castaways who revert to the basest level of
human nature. These ``Survivors'' didn't stoop to murder, but there
was sex among the competitors as well as plenty of tension and
arguments, all to the delight of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of water and oil mixing, or not mixing,'' said
Gray, back in her job as a chemist in New Jersey and contractually
forbidden to divulge too much detail (particularly who won). ``I
think any time you mix total strangers, not everyone's going to get
along.''
</P>
<P>
   She says there was particular tension between some of the older
castaways who tried to take charge _ the retired CEO and Navy SEAL
_ and the 20-somethings. ``We were all young and high strung, and
just like, `No, we don't agree with that.''' She said although she
expected racial tension _ there were two blacks and 14 whites _
there was none.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real surviving part was surviving each other,'' says
executive producer Mark Burnett, who lived on the island with the
contestants. ``It's a petri dish of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   And a well-culled petri dish it was. As Burnett went through the
6,000 applicants and narrowed the pool, he did extensive background
and psychological tests on the potential players. Then they signed
a contract as thick as ``War and Peace,'' Burnett said. That's
because when an earlier version of the show first aired on Swedish
TV, a participant who was rejected later committed suicide. Fox's
``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire'' scandal added to the
pressure to make sure all the players were clean going in.
</P>
<P>
   That cleanliness soon passed. Several survivors have joked about
the ripe smell they soon developed, particularly after two straight
days of torrential rain. One man who brought a toothbrush (players
could bring one item each) was in demand to loan it out, and skin
rashes got so bad that hardly anyone wore underwear.
</P>
<P>
   And although only one person won cash, there was at least a side
benefit for all the contestants. Nearly everyone lost between 10
and 20 pounds during their stay. Just not enough rats to go around.

VETERANS AND REPORTERS WONDER WHAT DROVE A SOLDIER TO LIE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Tenn., Ky., Mo., Colo., Texas, S.C., Okla., Va., Md., S.D.,
Fla., Ind.)   By MICHAEL MOSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. _ Edward Daily had all the trappings of an
American war hero: comrades who remembered his courage on the front
lines, combat records attesting to his swift rise in rank, orders
awarding him medals for valor.
</P>
<P>
   His exploits, including a rescue of a soldier under fire and his
capture by the North Koreans, were amply supported by Army
documents and the testimony of men who said they recalled fighting
alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   When The Associated Press began investigating whether the Army
unit he was assigned to _ the Seventh Cavalry Regiment _ killed
hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Daily, who is 69,
seemed an ideal guide into difficult terrain.
</P>
<P>
   He had written three books on the unit _ a proud, historic
division once led by George Armstrong Custer _ had organized its
veterans group and swapped stories at its reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Daily gave the AP reporters a list of ex-soldiers' telephone
numbers. And he admitted his own role in the atrocity at the
village of No Gun Ri, saying he had slaughtered civilians on orders
from his commanders and was still haunted by the sound of ``little
kids screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the confession, his presence at No Gun Ri _ in fact, most of
Daily's military record _ appears to be invented or imagined. And
fellow veterans now say that Daily, in phone calls, chats at
soldiers' reunions and barroom reminiscences, managed to airbrush
himself into their own fragile memories of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   As AP reporters tried to track down the story of what happened
at No Gun Ri, Daily made his own calls to fellow veterans, several
veterans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to inform me how things happened,'' said Norman
Tinkler, 69, a veteran of the Seventh Cavalry who told the news
service that he had emptied a machine-gun belt on defenseless
people. Tinkler stands by his account, but said he cannot recall
whether the AP or Daily called him first.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Daily's life reveals a man who loved to hear other
men's war stories, and who went to extraordinary lengths to create
his own legend in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So embedded is Daily in the memories of some veterans that they
still find it difficult to believe he was not with them at No Gun
Ri. ``I know that Daily was there,'' insisted Eugene Hesselman,
another key witness in the original Associated Press account. ``I
know that. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Millard Gray, of Fort Cobb, Okla., said he believed for years
that Daily rescued him on the battlefield _ until a buddy pointed
out that he would not have been able to recall anything immediately
after being pummeled by a concussion grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who was not quoted by the AP, said he now realizes that
his memory of Daily pulling him out of a foxhole came from Daily.
``I didn't know the difference,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Daily says he does not dispute Army documents that
show he was not at No Gun Ri, but rather spent most of the war as a
mechanic and clerk behind the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember it vividly,'' Daily said in an interview at
his home here on Monday _ Memorial Day, which he spent in
seclusion. ``But they are saying I was with a different company.
I've seen their documents. How do you deny that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel,'' he said, ``like I'm in a dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily denied fabricating or altering any records. ``No, no,
no,'' he said. Asked to explain how he came to show friends
citations for some of the Army's highest medals, including the
Distinguished Service Cross, Daily said ``I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment further on the records, citing the Army's
continuing No Gun Ri investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The AP won the Pulitzer Prize this spring for its article on the
incident at the South Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri. The news service
has stood by its account in the days since questions emerged about
Daily's war record, saying a host of other witnesses, including
South Koreans, confirm that an atrocity took place. In addition,
the AP has cited Army records that ordered other units in Korea to
prevent civilians from crossing American defense lines.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Hanley, a reporter who worked on the AP project, said
that as many as 20 veterans confirmed some or all of Daily's
account, and that the reporting team found sources outside Daily's
sphere of contacts. He acknowledged that Daily was a valuable
source for the AP, turning over a list of ex-soldiers phone numbers
early in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talked to each other in this investigation,'' Hanley
said of the veterans. ``This is why it was important that we try to
not get a grapevine going.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may have been an impossible task to determine whether
Daily was harvesting memories or creating them.
</P>
<P>
   The citation he showed friends for the Silver Star, which
praised Daily for ``bravely'' commanding his platoon under fire and
rescuing another soldier appears to have been fabricated; Army
records show he did not receive the medal or the promotion to which
it refers.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with the Army's continuing inquiry
of the alleged massacre, investigators have obtained a falsified
letter claiming Daily had been taken prisoner of war. There are
fabricated letters awarding him medals that he actually did not
win, including the Silver Star, they say.
</P>
<P>
   There are two versions of the regiment's Christmas-dinner
roster, one with Daily's name typed at the bottom of the list _
slightly crooked at that. A group photo of the regiment he showed
to friends is also suspect: Daily's head, marked with an arrow and
the word ``me,'' appears to be super-imposed on another man.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is close to concluding that its troops fired on
civilians at No Gun Ri, but that the number killed remains
unproven. And people familiar with the inquiry say the Army thus
far has found only one man who makes the crucial contention that
there were orders to slaughter the civilians as they huddled in a
railroad-trestle culvert at No Gun Ri: Edward Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Daily's assertions about his record were not universally
accepted by his peers. He joined an association for winners of the
prestigious Distinguished Service Cross, a medal military records
show he never received. In 1991, Morris G. Worley, the
administrator of the association, concluded that Daily had
falsified his supporting documents and kicked him out. After
discovering other false claimants as well, Worley now sends for the
military records of anyone wanting to join the group.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why would Ed Daily, a Kentucky native who worked in steel mills,
sold used cars and had a fondness for war antiques, falsely confess
to an atrocity? Some observers believe there is a rise in the
number of people who are exaggerating their military histories.
Most want to remake themselves into heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But others are moved to claim a dishonor, psychologists say,
like people who falsely confess to crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not uncommon when a serious murder occurs for a couple
of folks to drop by and say, `I did it,''' said Jonas Rappeport, a
forensic psychiatrist now retired in Baltimore. ``The purpose of
this seems to be self-importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Down, a 68-year-old former steelworker and veteran of the
Seventh Cavalry, is one of Daily's staunchest supporters. He helped
Daily organize their veterans' group, and he thinks its members
should back him no matter what the reality of his war experience.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans who have come to doubt the massacre story regard
Daily in terms they cannot explain. ``I have the feeling now that
Daily was a con man, although I don't know why he was,'' said
William Hoffman, 74, of Fairfax, Va., an former Seventh Cavalry
platoon leader who retired from the Army and then worked as an
executive with Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else could a nice guy who has been so strong in promoting
the Seventh Cavalry and organizing the reunions and coming to them
and giving speeches do this? I'm still puzzled.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in Covington, Ky., in 1931, Edward Lee Daily was 17 when he
met an Army recruiting sergeant with ``medals plastered all over
his chest,'' Daily wrote in a short memoir he would give to his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who divorced when he was 10, signed the teen-ager's
papers, Daily said. When given a choice of assignments, he picked
the cavalry and described it as seemingly preordained. ``Strangely,
my eyes kept focusing on that big yellow and black patch with the
horse head on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily also wrote about becoming an expert marksman with the
Seventh Cavalry Regiment, then jumping into the opening days of the
Korean War in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, military records show, Daily went from serving as a
clerk to a mechanic in the lusterless 27th Ordnance Maintenance
Company, only joining the Seventh Cavalry for a few weeks the
following year _ eight months after No Gun Ri allegedly occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the states after the war, Daily found work in a steel
mill, ran a truck-stop cafe, and in 1978 signed up as a salesman
with Heuring Chevrolet in Valparaiso, Ind. ``He was the top
salesman out of 25,'' said Craig Heuring, now general manager.
``Every customer loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Married with a son, Daily seemed to have erased Korea from his
mind, his former wife, Hilda Daily, said. ``It was a shock to me,''
she said of the AP report. ``He never talked about the war.''
</P>
<P>
   But after his life took a hard turn starting in the mid-1980s _
his marriage broke apart, his work suffered, and, Daily said, he
stepped up his mental-health therapy _ the war became a cornerstone
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   The war was nearly all Daily talked about with Fred and Lois
Carlen, who handled the photographs for his books in their
Valparaiso photography shop. ``He liked war relics, and it was so
funny to see Ed come in with this big sword,'' Mrs. Carlen said,
recalling an antique sabre.
</P>
<P>
   Daily began focusing on Korea after a 1986 reunion of cavalry
veterans. ``If you guys will get me stories, I'll put them together
and we'll put them in a book,'' Daily told attendees, according to
Down.
</P>
<P>
   At this and other reunions, the best stories emerged in the bar,
and Daily had a knack for injecting himself into the conversation,
veterans said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Snuffy'' Gray, 74, a former second lieutenant who spent
five years with the Seventh Cavalry, recalled a reunion at Fort
Meade, Md., in 1996. ``Daily asked me, `Who is that?' I said,
`That's Johnny De Borde, my mortar observer.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Gray said, Daily walked up to De Borde and
said: ``How in the hell are you? It's been a long, long time,
buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he hugged me,'' De Borde recalled Monday. ``I had not seen
Daily before in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone assumed he was there,'' Gray said of Daily's account
of No Gun Ri. ``No one questioned it. He wove such a damn web.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily's own recollections of his invented combat experiences
became grippingly real. In 1993, William McKown, the regiment's
food service technician who spent 24 years in the Army and now
lives in Englewood, Fla., returned to South Korea with a small
group of veterans that included Daily. They were riding in a
minibus, McKown said, ``alongside this river we were defending and
this ravine went by, and Ed called out, `That's where I was
captured.''' No evidence has surfaced that Daily was indeed
captured.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion over Daily's record stems from a 1973 fire
which destroyed many files at the National Personnel Records Center
in St. Louis. Veterans were invited to help reconstruct their
records and Daily appears to have enhanced his own history with
material provided by others in the unit for use in his books on the
Seventh Calvary. Daily said he does not recall any details about
submitting documentation to the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone could be persuaded they had fought side-by-side
with Daily, including Tinkler, the machine gunner. Tinkler did not
attend the unit's reunions and said he was startled to receive a
phone call from Daily one day asking if he remembered how he
bandaged Tinkler when he got shot in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `hell no, I don't remember,''' Tinkler recalled. ``I
wasn't remembering too much at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily was, without question, a linchpin in efforts to preserve
and honor the memory of the Seventh Cavalry and served as its
president in the early 1990s. In 1993, he attended a peace ceremony
in South Dakota with members of the Lakota Sioux tribe to help make
amends for the massacre at Wounded Knee by the Seventh Cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daily has this thing about apologizing,'' says David Hughes,
72, of Colorado Springs, a former Seventh Cavalry officer who
believes the Associated Press exaggerated what might have occurred
at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Daily passed up at least one opportunity to confess his role in
No Gun Ri before the AP interviewed him. For more than a decade, he
spent two hours in group therapy every two weeks at the Veterans
Administration hospital in Nashville, according to David Shepard, a
clinical pharmacist who helped run the sessions. Daily continues to
receive disability payments from the VA for neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good member _ very supportive, very verbal. He talks,
which is good,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did Daily mention a massacre. Still, Shepard said he
was ``shocked'' earlier this month when allegations surfaced that
Daily's war record had been embellished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the rock of the earth, in my opinion,'' Shepard said. ``I
never saw him to be someone who would stretch the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daily went on the road to help other veterans who suffer from
post traumatic stress syndrome. In the fall of 1998, James Kerns,
70, a former sergeant living in Piedmont, S.C., said Daily invited
him to a workshop in Columbia, S.C., where Daily opened the session
by talking about the affliction.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kerns said, he had not yet been contacted by the
AP, but its reporters had begun asking others, including Daily,
about No Gun Ri. While at the workshop, Kerns said, Daily asked him
about the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had orders, but it wasn't the same order I
had,'' Kerns said. Kerns then told the AP that he was instructed to
hold the civilians in place to protect the regiment's position, and
that any firing was aimed over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1998, said Tinkler, the machine-gunner, Daily brought up
No Gun Ri in their conversations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I remembered who did the shooting, and I said yes,
I was the one. And he said, who gave the orders, and I said there
was no one gave the orders,'' Tinkler said.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkler confirmed his quotes in the AP article _ that he shot at
the civilians on his own accord, fearful that they were shielding
enemy soldiers. Tinkler now says he cannot be sure who called him
first, Daily or the AP. Hanley of the AP said he was convinced that
the news agency contacted Tinkler first.
</P>
<P>
   Daily confirmed speaking with fellow veterans about No Gun Ri
but said that, for the most part, they called him to ask about the
AP's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, eyewitness accounts are all the Army has in its attempt
to verify the AP account. As many as 12 investigators at the
Pentagon's archives in College Park, Md., have been sifting through
thousands of paper-filled gray file boxes since last fall; a new
batch arrives in their room, 24 boxes to the cart, several times a
day. Thus far, people familiar with the Army investigation said, no
paper trail has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the veterans. The officers who are said to have
given the orders are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans who might have carried them out cannot be found.
Others are reluctant to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkler recently received a letter from the Army asking him to
meet with its investigators. ``What will I tell them? Not damn
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily declined to address the question of why he would confess
to a massacre he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Burns, a Vietnam veteran, was a consultant on ``Stolen
Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its
History,'' (Verity Press, 1998) an expose of soldiers who
exaggerated their war records. Burns said it has become more common
in recent years for ex-soldiers to falsely claim dishonor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do that because there is a movement in this country, the
victim-hero thing. `People will feel sorry for me that I killed
children and women, and they will understand me,''' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Daily may have been undone by a one-time admirer.
Robert Bateman, a teacher at West Point, was commanding the Seventh
Cavalry Regiment in Texas in the mid-1990s when Daily came to
visit. Bateman had him sign his regiment flag, called a guidon.
Daily sent him Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   But within days of the AP article, Bateman, his suspicions
aroused, filed the first Freedom of Information Act request for
Daily's personnel records, according to archive records. Within
weeks, the AP and other news organizations were filing their own.
</P>
<P>
   They received a one-page synopsis showing Daily was not with the
Seventh Regiment at No Gun Ri. It took several more months for this
information to emerge this spring in news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Daily called on his veteran friends to try to
convince them he was for real. Hesselman met him in November at the
Skyline Chili's restaurant in Erlanger, Ky., where, he said, Daily
opened a folder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some proof he was promoted to first lieutenant, with a
battlefield commission,'' Hesselman said. ``He showed me a copy of
the order. I'm going by what he showed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I put too much faith in what he's telling me,''
Hesselman 't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Seventh Cavalry veterans remain bitter about Daily's
efforts. ``He deflowered our moment in time with a horrible
story,'' says De Borde.
</P>
<P>
   Other friends think Daily should simply move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed likes the limelight, he always did,'' said his friend Down.
``But I'd say to him now, `Ed, you've had your run. It's time for
you to get an old hound dog or two and sit on the porch and relax
like everyone else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his home, standing beneath a 200-year-old maple tree,
Daily said he was inclined to take that advice. He said he was
sleeping very little. His phone rang so much he disconnected it. He
turned down an invitation to speak to veterans at a Memorial Day
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done. I'll never write again,'' he said. ``I've lost my
dedication. It's dog-eat-dog out there, and I'm mentally drained.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sara Lee, the giant consumer goods company that sells
everything from Ball Park hot dogs to Playtex bras and Hanes
underwear, said Tuesday that it would reorganize its operations and
divest itself of four divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has annual revenue of about $20 billion, said
that later this year it expected to take two of those divisions
public: Coach, its leather goods business, and PYA/Monarch, one of
the nation's largest food service distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee executives say the company also intends to sell
Champion, the athletic apparel maker, as well as the international
fabrics unit of Courtaulds Textiles, the British retailer that Sara
Lee acquired in March. Together, the four units generate about $4
billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, which executives say will narrow and sharpen the
focus of the conglomerate, which is based in Chicago, are also
expected to raise about $2.5 billion for Sara Lee, which could use
the money to make acquisitions that better complement its core
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by lackluster earnings growth and a belief that the
company's stock price is undervalued, top executives moved Tuesday
to re-energize Sara Lee with promises of a more centralized and
efficient management structure, a more focused portfolio and a more
aggressive investment strategy, particularly in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the company has been acquiring dozens
of major brands. And now, with its longtime chief executive, John
H. Bryan, set to step down this summer, the company says it would
like to create a more streamlined global enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new vision for Sara Lee, a vision that will focus
our business portfolio and resources,'' said C. Steven McMillan,
the president and chief operating officer of Sara Lee, who will
take over as chief executive on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sara Lee rose slightly Tuesday, up 12.5 cents, to
$18.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. The gains may have been
tempered because Sara Lee executives also warned Tuesday that
earnings in the coming year could come in about 5 percent below
expectations because of currency weakness in Europe, which accounts
for about 40 percent of the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, however, largely praised the move by Sara
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good news, bad news day,'' said John McMillin, an
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``But now that Sara Lee got a
haircut, they should be a better looking company. Sara Lee had
clearly gotten into too many businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee executives said the company could divest itself of
additional units in the coming year. And analysts said that might
help remove some of the stigma in the investment community that the
company is too diversified.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the divestitures, they'll be a little less of a
conglomerate, but much more so than other food companies,'' said
Terry Bivens, an analyst at Bear Stearns. ``They want to prune back
operations they feel are no longer strategic.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts, however, say the move does not set the stage for
Sara Lee to enter into a major merger with another food or consumer
goods giant, or make it likely that Sara Lee will acquire a major
company.
</P>
<P>
   While other large food companies may get tangled up in the
bidding war over Bestfoods, Sara Lee is a different kind of beast.
The company is too diversified, the analysts say, and it is too
much of a hodge-podge of food and consumer product companies to be
attractive as a takeover target. And the company's depressed stock
does not give it the currency to use to take over another food
giant.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts said they expected Sara Lee to continue to
move aggressively in acquiring smaller companies. In the last year,
Sara Lee acquired Chock Full o' Nuts, the the nation's
fourth-largest coffee roaster.
</P>
<P>
   Now, analysts say, there are rumors Sara Lee could target
Flowers Industries or the Dial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sara Lee is reorganizing itself into three
units: food and beverages, intimates and underwear and household
products. The company previously had five units.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McMillan, at a news conference Tuesday in New York, said the
company would retain its long tradition of operating as a
decentralized company but that he would begin to push the company
into a slightly more centralized bent to take advantage of the
company's desire to capitalize on its global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The company chose to divest itself of Champion, Coach and the
international fabric units of Courtalds because they did not fit
neatly into the company's strategy, and in some cases they were
tied to the ups and downs of the fashion business.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said that the company would rather focus on
``inner-wear'' rather than outerwear, which is why Sara Lee
maintains Playtex, Hanes and other apparel.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said Tuesday that it had made investments in
three small companies: Uniao's coffee business, the largest coffee
business in Brazil; Sol Y Oro, a leading intimate apparel business
in Argentina; and a minority interest in the Johnsonville Sausage
Co., one of the largest makers of fresh premium sausages in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   PYA/Monarch, the nation's fourth-largest food service
distributor with about $2.7 billion, also did not fit into the
company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Tuesday's move is also aimed at reaping value
for divisions that were locked in a company that is largely
undervalued by the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really to unlock value,'' said William Leach, an
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Other food companies are
trading at much higher multiples. Sysco is trading at 30 times
earnings and Sara Lee trades at 12 times earnings. If they sold off
all their brands, they'd probably get 25 times earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it hoped to take Coach and PYA/Monarch
public by the end of the year, keeping an 80 percent stake in the
companies. Within 18 months, however, the company hopes to sell off
that stake if market conditions are favorable.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan, the incoming chief executive, said the company decided
that a mix of public offerings and outright sales would be most
beneficial to the company. He also said that the company was
motivated by concerns about the stock's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decisions are frequently made because we are trying to
drive value for our shareholders,'' he said. ``We think we are
substantially undervalued right now.''

 &HT;    Prosecution wants Lewis' limo driver back on stand
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Prosecutors want another shot at witness Duane
Fassett, the limousine driver who last week failed to say he saw
NFL star Ray Lewis deliver a blow in a fatal street fight.
</P>
<P>
   But a big question remains: Can they make him return?
</P>
<P>
   Fassett, a tortured soul during his court appearance, testified
he did not see Lewis hit one of the victims in the lower chest as
he had earlier told police. Also, Fassett backed off earlier
statements to police that he overheard Lewis' co-defendants,
Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of
Miami, admit to stabbing the victims.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard did not
follow proper procedures, and there may lie the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Howard hoped to introduce Fassett's incriminating statements
into evidence Tuesday through the testimony of a police detective
who was with Fassett when he made them. But Superior Court Judge
Alice D. Bonner refused to let that happen, saying Georgia law
requires prosecutors to first confront witnesses about inconsistent
statements. She noted Howard failed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the district attorney expressed
confidence that the Baltimore-area resident would return. ``I plan
on calling him,'' said Howard. ``He's still under subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard released Fassett from his subpoena in open court,
said Bruce Harvey, attorney for Oakley. ``Mr. Fassett is absolutely
under no obligation to reappear,'' Harvey contended.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Howard was on the phone to David Irwin, Fassett's
lawyer in Baltimore. Irwin said Howard wanted him to fly Fassett to
Atlanta Tuesday night. ``He's not going to like that,'' said Irwin,
who had yet to tell his client.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett can either return voluntarily or require prosecutors to
issue an interstate subpoena, which requires several steps. Also,
Fassett must be served the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``By recalling him, it tends to suggest that Howard does not
believe his own witnesses,'' said Dan Summer, a Gainesville
attorney. ``That would not look good to a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Fassett's re-appearance marked a day of
testimony from two limo passengers and two of the victims' friends.
One of the friends shot at the limo as it sped away from the scene
where Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, of Decatur were
stabbed to death Jan. 31 after a night of post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Sparks, a 24-year-old college student from Chicago,
</P>
<P>
   Trial: Headlinehere
</P>
<P>
   (salinity) Continued from B1
</P>
<P>
   buttressed prosecution contentions that Lewis led a cover-up
after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Lewis' hotel that night, Sparks said, she was a
passenger in a car where another limo passenger threw a bag in a
Dumpster behind a fast-food restaurant. She said the white hotel
laundry bag thrown into the trash was big enough to carry clothing,
supporting the prosecution's belief that Lewis was getting rid of
the blood-stained suit he wore that night.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks also testified that Jessica Robertson, who spent Super
Bowl weekend with Lewis and drove the car to the Dumpster,
destroyed a photo of the Lewis entourage taken that night at the
Cobalt nightclub. The photo would have allowed investigators
quickly identify those in the limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessica said she took it out of my purse,'' Sparks said. ``She
said she burned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks also said that she saw blood on the pants and shoes of
limo passenger Carlos Stafford, the man she saw dispose of the
laundry bag. Stafford has not been charged and is negotiating with
prosecutors for a grant of immunity in exchange for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Burros, an Akron, Ohio, native who grew up with the
victims, admitted to firing seven shots at the limo as it fled the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Burros testified he witnessed the fight from a distance and then
saw as many as 10 people run to the limo. He said he walked up, saw
Baker lying on the street and ran towards his GMC Yukon Denali
parked nearby. But a friend was already driving it toward the
scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burros said he grabbed his .45-caliber handgun from under a rear
seat and jogged up the street pumping off rounds. He said he only
tried to shoot the tires, which he did. In fact, Howard in his
opening arguments, credited Burros' action with allowing police to
identify the limo.
</P>
<P>
   However, defense attorneys repeatedly dwelled on the fact that
prosecutors have not charged Burros with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I would be dealt with at a later date,'' said
Burros, admitting he could be charged with aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, one of Oakley's two attorneys, pointed out a
contradiction in Burros' testimony. The lawyer noted that the
shell-casings from Burros' gun eject to the right. But the casings
were found around Baker and Lollar's bodies, to the left of and up
the hill from where Burros said he fired the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tony Axam, one of Lewis' attorneys, got the 185-pound
Burros to say he had a 46-chest and 34-inch waist and could bench
press twice his weight. In previous testimony, a cabdriver said he
saw an athletically built man with a V-shaped build standing over
the bodies, angrily pointing at them.
</P>
<P>
   Axam then displayed a red leather jacket that Burros wore the
night of the killings. A woman who witnesses the fight from the
apartment window said the most ``ferocious'' of the attackers wore
a red jacket.

POLITICAL NOVELS FOR ALL SEASONS, AND FOR ONE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This being a campaign season, novels with a political spin must
be tolerated. It was ordained, for example, that Joe Klein would go
to the Beltway again in hopes that a book under his own name would
repeat at least some of the success of one by Anonymous. Ah, where
is Bill Clinton when a writer needs him?
</P>
<P>
   One reviewer of the best-selling ``Primary Colors'' drew
attention to the debt that the then-anonymous author owed to ``All
the King's Men,'' Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel based on the
career of Huey Long, reminding readers of the central emotional
relationship between Long and the narrator, Jack Burden. the
governor's main aide. Although Klein delayed admitting his own role
as writer, he frankly signaled his borrowing: In ``Primary Colors''
(Random House) President Jack Stanton's chief aide and the book's
narrator is Henry Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The Klein novel was credited with perfect pitch in capturing the
players and the spirit of the 1992 campaign. When Klein's identity
was revealed, any reader could recognize the Washington
journalist's know- how in the portraits of George Stephanopoulos,
Mario Cuomo and Gennifer Flowers aka Cashmere McLeod. That was the
novel's strength. But set against its model, it also demonstrated
the limitations of a good book by a good journalist compared with a
smashing book by a very good novelist. For the reader, it was the
difference between admiring a clever reproduction and being knocked
out by the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal sellers swiftly go, but the recent extortion conviction
of the flamboyant Edwin Edwards, sometime governor of Louisiana,
will have served a cultural purpose if it sends readers back to
``All the King's Men.'' In its marriage of political pertinence and
literary distinction, Robert Penn Warren's novel endures where many
other ``topical'' works speedily vanish.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century after its appearance, the combination of Warren's
prose and the character of Willie Stark, his reimagining of Huey
Long, retain their power. In Willie, Warren created not only a
zesty campaigner but a figure who combined earnest populism with
unscrupulous tactics, high-minded aspirations with tough-minded
calculation, an irresistible appeal with appalling cynicism. He is
a big figure, an American original.
</P>
<P>
   The first glimpse of Willie tells a lot about his just-folks
manner and the book's flavor. Stopping off at a soda fountain on
the way to visit his pappy, Willie spies ``a tall, gaunt-shanked,
malarial, leather-faced slice of jerked venison, wearing jean pants
and a brace of mustaches hanging off the kind of face you see in
photographs of General Forrest's cavalrymen.''
</P>
<P>
   Their conversation goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``How's your boy?'' Willie asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aint doen so good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, jail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, what they doing round here, putting good boys in
jail?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good boy. Hit wuz a fahr faight, but he had a leetle
bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit wuz fahr and squahr, but he had a leetle bad luck. He
stobbed the feller and he died.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tried yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't complainen. Hit wuz fit fahr and squahr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad to seen you. Tell your boy to keep his tail over the
dashboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Willie directs Jack Burden to get onto the case and scout
out a smart lawyer to help the countryman's son or to put in a
quiet fix. When it comes to a face-off between the law and a good
old boy, Willie is with the fellow with a leetle bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   And when, in an important turn, Willie runs up against a judge
with a reputation for honesty who decides not to endorse Willie's
candidate, the order is to dig up dirt on the judge: ``It's dirt
makes the grass grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose there isn't anything worth the digging? Jack asks.
Willie, with his Old Testament view of his fellow man, sets him
straight: ``Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he
passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud.
There is always something.'' ( Klein has one of his characters make
the same point in almost the same words: ``There's always something
there.'')
</P>
<P>
   Something is found; no one doubts that, if pressed, Willie will
use it even if it means the good judge's ruin. Willie is not fond
of the law; it keeps getting in the way of his plans to better the
lives of all the down-and-outers who know that he is on their side
against those who these days are known as special interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, Willie draws Depression-era cheers with promises
that, given a little spiffing, resemble those that today's
candidates still find useful although they may lack Willie's
incantatory locutions: ``And it is your right that every child
shall have a complete education. That no person aged and infirm
shall want or beg for bread. That the man who produces something
shall be able to carry it to market without miring to the hub,
without toll. That no poor man's house or land shall be taxed. That
the rich men and the great companies that draw wealth from this
state shall pay this state a fair share. That you shall not be
deprived of hope!''
</P>
<P>
   Willie means it on the stump, and his audiences believe him. He
is a radical in a jurisdiction where the wealthy and the powerful
are accustomed to reign. He has a tendency toward the dictatorial
but he steers clear of flat-out extortion. Yet he does not allow
squeamishness to get in the way of what he believes needs to be
done; forget the pieties of those who never get their hands dirty
or do anything worth doing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the law, neither Edwards nor Long were sticklers. Willie
shares their unenthusiastic outlook. He calls the law ``a
single-bed blanket on a double bed and three folks in the bed and a
cold night.'' And he goes on: ``There ain't ever enough blanket to
cover the case, no matter how much pulling and hauling, and
somebody is always going to nigh catch pneumonia. Hell, the law is
like the pants you bought last year for a growing boy, but it is
always this year and the seams are popped and the shankbones to the
breeze. The law is always too short and too tight for growing
humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   What Willie understands is that society is bent on doing
business, and if that means winking at the law, that's the way
things are and were and always will be: ``It's just a question of
who has got his front feet in the trough when slopping time
comes.'' The observation doesn't seem to have lost much in the last
50 or 100 years or a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   When reformers cry ``Graft!'' Willie grants that OK, there may
be a little, just enough to make the wheels turn without squeaking.
He would probably have faulted Edwards for squeaking so noisily
that he compelled the righteous to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfair to ask that Klein's portrait of Bill Clinton in
``Primary Colors'' should approach Warren's vividly reimagined
portrait of Huey Long. Whatever one's opinion of the president, he
was no Huey Long.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Klein book's popularity, along with being an engaging
read it seems to have benefited both from the hoopla about the
anonymity of the author and from readers' belief that they were
getting the down and dirty goods from the season's Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking that appeal, Klein's second try at a political novel,
``The Running Mate''(Dial Press), has stirred little interest, and
the Clinton-Stephanopoulous doings are yesterday's news. As for
Willie, he endures. His language may be a touch dated, more's the
pity, but the character is as vibrant as ever. Warren wrote a book
for all seasons.

SOTHEBY'S SHAREHOLDER OPPOSES CHAIRMAN'S SON AS BOARD LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The largest outside shareholder in Sotheby's Holdings
says electing the son of the company's former chairman to its board
would represent an inappropriate conflict of interest in the face
of the continuing criminal investigation into price fixing at the
auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and its rival, Christie's, are the subjects of a
Justice Department investigation into allegations that the
auctioneers fixed commissions charged to buyers and sellers for
several years. Christie's disclosed on Jan. 28 that it had agreed
to cooperate in exchange for leniency, and people involved in the
case said prosecutors were in the late stages of evaluating
possible criminal charges involving Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   A. Alfred Taubman, the wealthy real estate developer who owns a
controlling interest in Sotheby's, resigned as its chairman in
February after Christie's disclosure. Taubman retains voting
control of the company and its board through stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Robert, was scheduled to replace Taubman on the board
in April, but the company's annual meeting was postponed at the
last minute after objections by Ronald Baron, whose investment
funds are the largest outside investors in Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Robert Taubman's appointment to be inappropriate at
this time,'' Baron wrote to investors in his funds in a quarterly
report obtained Tuesday. ``We believe Robert Taubman will soon
recognize the enormous conflicts of interest he will face.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron also said other board members were exceptionally close to
Albert Taubman. Baron also complained that he had been assured
several times in recent months that there was no substance to the
federal price-fixing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Baron questioned the independence of Sotheby's board in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April, and he has
been negotiating with the company over the makeup of the board.
Baron's funds have invested nearly $500 million in Sotheby's stock,
which has lost about half its value in recent months. But Baron
sought to reassure his investors that Sotheby's long-term prospects
would be strong after the conclusion of the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sotheby's declined to comment on Baron's remarks
and said that the annual meeting had not been rescheduled. A lawyer
for Albert Taubman also declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for
Robert Taubman, president of Taubman Co., said he would have no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the criminal inquiry, Sotheby's and Christie's
are subjects of class-action litigation in U.S. District Court in
New York. On Friday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is presiding over
the case, chose the law firm of Boies, Schiller &AMP; Flexner as lead
counsel in the combined suits.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, best known for its role in the Microsoft Corp.
antitrust suit, was chosen from among 20 that submitted bids to win
the right to lead the effort to win damages from the auction
houses. The judge said his decision was based on the economic terms
of the bids ad the ability of the lead counsel to best serve the
people suing the auctioneers.

to have the resume of a true American hero. When the Associated
Press began investigating reports that the unit he said he was with
had massacred hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Daily,
69, seemed an ideal guide. The story led to a Pulitzer for the AP
and the unmasking of Daily. As the Army and other reporters began
to study the records, it became clear that Daily was neither the
war criminal nor war hero he claimed to be. He was never at the
scene of the massacre or even with the unit. And interviews with
veterans show that Daily, while developing his books, may have
airbrushed himself into their memories of the war. By Michael Moss.

FCC MOVES TO RELAX SOME LIMITS ON OWNERSHIP OF MEDIA OUTLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday
proposed to ease several decades-old regulations on broadcasters,
including one that prevents companies from owning a broadcast
station and newspaper in the same city and another prohibiting a
company from owning more than one national television network.
</P>
<P>
   In a biennial review that Congress ordered as part of its
overhaul of the telecommunications industry four years ago, the FCC
said it had begun preparing new rules to relax, but not eliminate,
both the cross-ownership and dual-network restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposed easing the way the listening audience of local
radio markets are measured by regulators in a way that could enable
companies to own more stations than they do under current limits.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals may have significant implications for several
pending and recently completed mergers in the broadcast and
newspaper industries. Existing rules would have required
significant divestitures after Viacom's acquisition of CBS and
Tribune Co.'s proposed purchase of Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said some restrictions had become outdated as
Americans increasingly turned to new technologies like satellite
television and high-speed Internet services offered through
telephone and cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a wave of corporate deals has led to new
levels of concentration in the broadcast, cable and telephone
industries, testing the ownership limits imposed by both the FCC
and Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media marketplace has become increasingly dynamic and
competitive, with an expanding number of information outlets and
media platforms and more Americans than ever before are using these
options,'' said William E. Kennard, the FCC's chairman. ``The
report we issue today balances the public interest in diversity of
ownership with the demands of a changing marketplace and the
broadcast industries' need to realize economic efficiencies and
remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the cross-ownership and dual-network regulations were
rooted in the idea of promoting diversity of the airwaves, and
officials at the FCC said they were not planning on eliminating the
restrictions but easing them in particular cases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the proposed changes outlined Tuesday are more gradual
than some large companies had sought, they mark a significant
policy change for the FCC, which has defended legal attacks and
criticisms over the rules for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the cross-ownership rules, the FCC said there was
still a need for restrictions in many areas across the country to
prevent a company from controlling both a newspaper and television
station.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC also concluded that in some cities, particularly
large ones with many media outlets, ``there might be situations in
which the rule may not be necessary to protect the public interest
in diversity and competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the dual-network rule, the FCC said that two
emerging television networks, UPN and WB, were still developing and
ought to be able to attempt to attract new investments from a major
network. But FCC officials said they would not alter rules that
prevent the four majors _ ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC _ from acquiring
one another.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes, which are unlikely to become final
regulations for many months, have come after heavy lobbying by some
of the nation's largest broadcasting and newspaper companies, which
have big stakes in trying to hold onto recently acquired television
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-ownership restrictions have threatened to force
Tribune Co., which has agreed to buy Times Mirror, to sell some
properties in three cities _ New York, Los Angeles and Hartford,
Conn. _ where the companies have newspapers and broadcasting
properties. The Tribune Co. has also spent years trying to persuade
the fcc to permit it to own both a newspaper and a television
station in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The dual-network rule has threatened to force Viacom, which
recently completed its acquisition of CBS, to sell its half
interest in UPN. When it approved the deal four weeks ago, the FCC
gave Viacom one year to sell its stake in UPN. But if the agency
finishes writing new rules before then, the company might not have
to put the network up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC stopped short of recommending any easing of the
limitations that have prevented a company from reaching more than
35 percent of the national television audience, prompting Fox,
which is at the limit and wants to continue to expand, to
immediately file a lawsuit against the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC decision today is a textbook case of arbitrary and
capricious government action,'' said Chase Carey, chairman and
chief executive of Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national TV ownership cap, which may have served a purpose
in the days when only three TV networks competed in local markets,
long ago outlived its rational and is now harming rather than
promoting its original public interest objectives of diversity,
localism and competition,'' he said. ``In an era in which scores of
nationwide programming networks are available to viewers from cable
and satellite providers, it makes no sense to artificially limit
the number of markets in which broadcasters can compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said that Fox's argument had confused trends in the
local market with trends in the national market and that there
remained a compelling need to prevent any one company from
controlling the national market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Americans still get most of their news and
public affairs information from broadcast stations, and in a
participatory democracy like ours, it is vitally important that we
encourage the wisest possible dissemination of this information
from diverse and antagonistic sources,'' he said. ``Our structural
ownership restrictions seek to promote this First Amendment
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics said that Kennard's own observation that most
Americans relied heavily on broadcasting to get their news
demonstrated the need to keep the cross-ownership in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasting remains the single most important source of
information at the local level for many many voters, and most of
the rest get their information from newspapers,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a Washington
group that promotes diversity on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have these voices controlled by fewer and fewer owners
cannot help democracy,'' he said. ``The evolution of the Internet
has yet to make any significant change on how people decide to cast
their vote for the mayor. The degree to which a few large economic
powers in any community can control the debate is no less today
than it has been in the past.''

WHERE'S IRKUTSK? ASK A BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten students from across the country gathered as finalists in
the National Geography Bee on a Washington stage last week,
standing alongside ``Jeopardy'' host Alex Trebek and waving at
their parents beaming in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Only one could name two of the three largest sections of Denmark
(Jutland, Sjaelland and Fyn.) But all shared one notable trait, the
same shared by all but two finalists in the 12-year history of the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer is? They were all boys.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, educators have bemoaned that a large percentage of
Americans cannot locate their own country on a map, much less point
the way to Irkutsk. Geography slipped off school curriculums,
derided as too dependent on rote learning, as educators blended it
into broader social studies classes. Students who learned it tended
to do so at home or on their own time.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts to emphasize the importance of the subject over
the last few years have highlighted a new problem. With students
left to their own devices, a geography gender gap has become
evident, so wide that with five million students participating in
the bee, boys are 45 times more likely to end up as finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and educators have bounced back and forth over the
last few years debating whom schools shortchange more: boys (in
reading) or girls (in math and science). But with so much attention
focused on them, those disparities have begun to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Why the geography gap endures, researchers say, has something to
do with the fact that most schools are still not teaching the
subject, and something to do with the toys geared toward boys and
other social influences. But mostly, they say, the gap stems from
cognitive differences that give boys better spatial skills than
girls. The same advantages that help boys in the geography bee make
them, in general, better at navigation and finding their way. And
that, they add, just might explain why men so stubbornly _ some
would say determinedly _ refuse to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are some differences biologically, and unless you
can provide different kinds of enrichment in education and what
parents do, you're not going to see this difference go away,'' said
Lynn S. Liben, distinguished professor of psychology at
Pennsylvania State University, a co-author of a study the National
Geographic Society commissioned on why girls do not do as well on
the bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have to say this as a woman,'' she said, ``that it's
not true that every woman is worse than every man or every girl is
worse than every boy. But at the group level, it is true. If you
have to bet money, bet the man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geographic Society started the geography bee a decade ago
out of concern that Americans did not know anything about the
subject. A Gallup survey in 1988 found that 20 percent of Americans
18 to 24 years old could not find the United States on a map
without labels. American students performed the worst among
students of 10 nations when asked to identify regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began, geographers and educators say, in the 1950s,
when schools began absorbing geography and history into one course:
social studies. This was seen as a way to get students thinking
about the broad picture, to analyze rather than just memorize
facts.
</P>
<P>
   After the surveys, the Geographic Society began arguing that
understanding geography is key to understanding other subjects _
the history of wars, the development of cities and regions.
Congress agreed, declaring a National Geography Awareness Week.
</P>
<P>
   The Geographic Society distributed atlases and handbooks on how
to teach geography to every public, private, and parochial school
in the country. In recent years, several companies have developed
computer interactive games to emphasize geography.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts seem to be paying off in some small ways: an
overwhelming proportion of students rate geography as the least or
second-least favorite subject, but the fraction of those who say it
is their favorite has risen to 14 percent, from 8 percent in 1983;
74 percent of American teachers have taken a college course in
geography, up from 59 percent in 1983. And the College Board now
offers an advanced placement exam in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Still, teaching of geography is haphazard, and most students who
learn it study it out of interest, not because a teacher asks them
to. Notably, 4 out of 10 finalists in this year's bee were schooled
at home. The year's winner, 13-year-old Felix Peng from Guilford,
Conn., learned at home as a toddler, as his father would point to
Taiwan, his birthplace, then spin the globe and have Felix find it
again. As Felix grew, his father added more and more countries to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, the Geographic Society had a new concern. Worried about
the dearth of girls not just in the finals but in the entrance
round of the contests in schools, it commissioned a study by Liben
and Roger M. Downs, a geography professor, also at Pennsylvania
State. The society was worried that it might be asking questions in
a way biased against girls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that was not the case. Rather, they said,
the gap results from a combination of factors, the most significant
being the difference in spatial skills between boys and girls.
Research on cognition, Liben said, shows that boys tend have higher
mental rotation skills, allowing them to better imagine what things
look like reversed or upside down. This helps them interpret maps _
as well as the diagrams that accompany allegedly easy-to-assemble
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Young, a finalist from Reston, Va., learned his geography
by studying a map on a shower curtain, requiring him to recognize
his Mozambiques and Madagascars backward.
</P>
<P>
   Women turn the maps and diagrams around to figure out where they
are, Liben said, or simply ask for directions, while men will
struggle through the mental rotation. (``Whether you view that as a
negative or positive, as you're stubborn or trying to be macho,
depends on whether you're a man or a woman,'' she adds.)
</P>
<P>
   This cognitive difference, though, was exacerbated by social
factors, the researchers said. Boys, for instance, tend to play
with blocks and mechanical toys.
</P>
<P>
   And teachers notice what the study said: that girls simply do
not gravitate toward maps and geography.
</P>
<P>
   In Guilford, Felix's teacher, Louis Russo, started a
before-school geography club. No girls showed up. ``I always
encourage the girls to get involved, I don't want them to think
it's an all-male situation,'' he said. ``But they just don't pick
up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest starts young. ``The boys just seem to naturally
take to it,'' said Howard S. Becker, a social studies teacher in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and a coordinator of the state's geography
bee. ``Whenever I ask them, `How long have you been doing this?'
they say, `Since I was 3 or 4, I've always had an interest in
looking at atlases and maps. I've never seen one girl who says
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are more likely to end up on the honor roll or do well in
school, teachers say. But unless the school or the teacher focuses
explicitly on geography, they are not likely to become interested
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls at this stage are much more interested in the big
picture; they tend to explore areas that don't lend themselves to
this much detail,'' said Linda Ague, the librarian at the Cal Young
Middle School in Eugene, Ore., who coached Alex King, 13, to the
finals last week. ``Geography tends to be get blended into a block
curriculum; we don't have a geography textbook in the whole
building. For kids who think in that generalized, big picture way,
the geography stays just a piece of it. The boys tend to gravitate
to the detail, to the map part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liben and Downs study found that the girls who ended up in
the higher rounds of the Geography Bee were more likely to come
from smaller states or territories, where there is less
competition. This year, the two girls in the semifinals were from
Puerto Rico and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Friend, the entry from Barton, Vt., says her secret is
reading, especially newspapers, and looking up any place she
doesn't know. ``I like to find out about things that are happening
and where they are happening,'' she said. ``Not many of my girl
friends do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie is an excellent all-around student. An aspiring doctor,
she wrote in her Geography Bee biography that she admires Marie
Curie, Amelia Earhart, and Susan B. Anthony, ``because they proved
that women could succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe they would have known that Irkutsk is a city in
Russia. &QL;

 &HT;    Effort rises to settle Coke suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that a federal judge has extended the deadline for
plaintiffs' attorneys to formally seek class-action status in the
racial discrimination lawsuit against Coca-Cola, settlement talks
take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a mediator, attorneys for both sides are
attempting to resolve the case before the legal warfare
intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks began in mid-April, but there still appears to
be a significant gap that will need to be closed if an agreement is
to be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're close at all on the money,'' Larry
Jones, a former Coke manager who has called for a boycott of
company products, said Tuesday as his group of about a dozen people
protested outside Coca-Cola headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was referring to a potential monetary settlement that
would include not just four plaintiffs in the case but also a
prospective class of 2,000 black current and former employees
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both sides are prohibited from talking about the
negotiations. In addition to money, however, another key issue
concerns new diversity policies and practices that could be
established to improve conditions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Coke Chairman Doug Daft frequently has said he wants the company
to be a corporate leader in diversity. Daft also has said that he
wants a speedy and equitable resolution of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs faced a deadline Tuesday to file a brief seeking
class-action status for the case, but U.S. District Judge Richard
Story postponed the filing date two weeks. Both sides agreed to the
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the mediation involves complex issues and is on-going,
the mediator has requested that plaintiffs be granted an extension
... until June 14, 2000, to file their motion,'' Story said in an
order.
</P>
<P>
   A class certification brief would be one of the most important
documents in the case. It would include a detailed argument of why
the lawsuit should be expanded to include about 2,000 current and
former employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filing of the brief could be a watershed event,''
plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In such a brief, the plaintiffs would use information and
computer data obtained from the company and analyzed by a labor
economist. The economist would give an expert opinion on whether
Coca-Cola has systematically discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The brief also would include affidavits from scores of current
and former employees detailing their personal experiences at Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brief is like a fine wine,'' Mehri said. ``It's only going
to get better with a little bit more age.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief could be a powerful legal weapon offsetting some of
the recent efforts the company has made to improve its record on
diversity. Among those efforts are $1 billion, five-year program to
increase business opportunities for minorities and women, tying
managment compensation to diversity and hiring a new diversity
director.
</P>
<P>
   The company has strongly denied that it has systematically
discriminated against black employees. It would have 75 days to
file a response to the plaintiffs' class certification motion if
one is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones predicted the plaintiffs will file the brief in two weeks
because negotiators won't make enough progress to warrant another
delay.
</P>
<P>
   The delay granted Tuesday, Jones said, ``gives Coke more time to
hoodwink the American people into thinking they want to settle the
suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company is not trying
to hoodwink anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to work towards an equitable and timely resolution
of the lawsuit,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks could continue even if the plaintiffs file a
class certification brief in two weeks. But, some legal experts
said, the negotiations could become considerably more difficult
because one side or the other may dig in its heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the plaintiffs, for example, put some damaging information
in their certification brief, it could force the defendant into an
entrenched position,'' said Stephen Forte, managing partner of
Smith Gambrell &AMP; Russell who has extensive class-action experience.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the defendant may want to settle the case,
Forte said, is to prevent some of the information in the brief from
becoming public.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Forte added, Coca-Cola also could become more
entrenched if the brief turns out to be weaker than it thought it
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the certification motion is wanting, and the defendant
doesn't think the plaintiffs can get the class certified, then the
defendant could decide it should litigate,'' Forte said.

 &HT;    No verdict in kidnapping case
 &HT;    By Andrea Ball
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal jury did not reach a verdict Tuesday
during the first day of deliberations in the Madalyn O'Hair
kidnapping case. Jurors will return to court today.
</P>
<P>
   In the third week of the high-profile case, the eight-man,
four-woman jury spent almost seven hours weighing the evidence in
the trial of Gary Paul Karr, 52, who is accused of kidnapping
atheist leader O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter
Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations will continue at 8:30 a.m. in the Austin federal
courthouse. If convicted by a unanimous jury vote, Karr faces life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it for money,'' prosecutor Gerald Carruth told jurors
in closing arguments. ``He did it because he was greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say David Roland Waters, the O'Hairs' former office
manager, recruited Karr and Florida friend Danny Fry in 1995 to
hold the family hostage and steal $500,000 in gold coins. The
O'Hairs were later murdered, dismembered in an Austin storage unit
and buried in a Camp Wood ranch, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Fry was found dead on a Dallas County riverbank just days after
the O'Hairs disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few weeks, prosecutors have built a
circumstantial case without bodies, eyewitnesses or concrete
physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Hairs remain missing. No one reported seeing the family
kidnapped or murdered. Blood found inside the storage unit rented
by the alleged kidnappers could not be linked conclusively to the
O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors connected Karr to the atheist leaders
though an extensive paper trail including credit card, telephone
and van rental records. Witnesses connected Karr to Waters,
ringleader of the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Tom Mills called the circumstantial case weak
and attacked prosecutors' theory that the kidnappers disposed of
all the physical evidence by washing away the blood with a
beach-filled spray bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have 15 quarts of blood and some guy's going
to come in with some goofy insect sprayer and make it so there's no
blood?'' Mills said. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills contends that Karr was hired by Waters to help the O'Hairs
flee the country to escape federal tax. If the O'Hairs were
murdered _ and the defense won't concede they were _ Karr was not
involved, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, who began deliberating at 11:30 a.m. and stopped at 6
p.m., have not been sequestered.
</P>
<P>
   Their task could be arduous. The jury must consider hundreds of
documents, testimony from more than 70 witnesses, and a 10-page
statement in which Karr told police that Waters killed the O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   They must also decide whether a conspiracy existed and, if so,
whether Karr participated in it.
</P>
<P>
   For Karr to be found guilty of kidnapping, the jury must agree
that he conspired with others to kidnap the O'Hairs, that he held
them for financial gain, and that he forced Jon Garth Murray to do
business in another state.
</P>
<P>
   The jury must also determine Karr's guilt or innocence on four
other charges: conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery and
extortion, interstate travel in aid of racketeering enterprise,
conspiracy to engage in monetary transaction in criminally derived
property, and interstate transportation of stolen property.

<P>
   The jury will vote on each charge separately.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers awaited the verdict in the federal courthouse
Tuesday, while federal prosecutors retreated to their Congress
Avenue offices. Neither side was surprised at the jury's lengthy
deliberations.

said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: COMPANY COMBINES OFFICE SPACE, INTERNET AT
AIRPORTS

   Larry Brilliant, one hand wrapped around a cold can of Coke on
his desk at SoftNet Systems Inc., was describing a way of life that
most people might regard as road torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people traveling on business all the time, working
like maniacs, an average of 2.4 separate visits each week to an
airport, where they spend an average of two hours each trip,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I see this as cause to notify Amnesty International, but
Brilliant, a physician who got into the computer world as an early
investor in Apple Computer, sees it as his major market. These
potential customers, he said, are the creme de la creme among the
estimated 30 million business travelers around the world who belong
to a group that fits his description of ``They're
price-insensitive, time-sensitive, and on the road constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant is the chairman and chief executive of SoftNet, whose
businesses include providing broadband Internet technology for
cable systems. Recently, SoftNet, with partners that include Nokia,
Compaq Computer and Cisco Systems, sank $100 million into a
subsidiary, SoftNet Zone, which is planning in the fall to start a
system of local area wireless networks in airports, hotels and
convention centers that will provide high-speed Internet service
and e-mail access for business travelers on the move.
</P>
<P>
   As a part of that initiative, SoftNet and Delta Air Lines last
month announced a deal to set up centers for Delta customers to
access the Internet, as well as their corporate intranets and
e-mail systems. Delta plans to begin this service later this year,
starting at its hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Salt Lake City
and Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived recently at Softnet's headquarters in San Francisco's
booming dot-com district through a circuitous route. Back in
February, on a layover at the Tampa International Airport in
Florida, I had spent a productive hour working at a storefront
business center called Laptop Lane, which rents private office
cubicles with desks, phones and computers offering high-speed
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   This struck me as a spectacular innovation, being able to rent a
private office _ I paid $2 for the first 5 minutes and 38 cents for
each additional minute _ in a place as invincibly dismal as an
airport. The parent company, Laptop Lane Ltd., had said it would
open locations in 80 airports worldwide within two years.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time I got home and called Laptop Lane, the company
had been acquired by Brilliant's SoftNet for $45 million.
Brilliant, and backers like Nokia, it turned out, had an even more
ambitious idea: Use Laptop Lane's hard-won airport real estate as a
base for SoftNet's plan to sell wireless and fixed-line high-speed
Internet connections to business travelers. Until Laptop Lane
entered the picture, SoftNet had been considering that hotels would
be the main anchor for its local-network Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant said that he visited his first Laptop Lane only about
10 months ago, and began to see the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stranded at O'Hare and I bumped into this Laptop Lane,''
he recalled. ``Man, I was hooked. This was my own room. I was
paying for it. I made a conference call and took my shoes off.'' He
added that as a business traveler he belonged to all of the major
airline premium clubs, but ``in those clubs, you're never that
comfortable working; you always feel like the person behind you is
waiting for you to get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Laptop Lane was limited by physical space, even as
its locations increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Atlanta airport, 250,000 people circulate every day,
and about 80,000 of those are the people Larry is talking about as
potential customers,'' said R. Bruce Merrell, the founder and chief
executive of Laptop Lane, who was in Brilliant's office when we
talked. ``We have three locations in Atlanta, but they can only
accommodate 400 people at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting to me about SoftNet's plan, beyond its
world-view audacity, is the practical combination of high-flying
technology with the most down-to-earth business concept of all,
real estate.
</P>
<P>
   In airports, Laptop Lane locations will do double duty as
customer-service centers for Softnet Zone customers going online at
the gate or ``anywhere else you want, including the shoe-shine
stand and the bathroom,'' Brilliant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to have human beings nearby, because things will
go wrong with your computer,'' he said. ``They will have
technicians who can find you immediately and get you online.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said the idea of linking up with an Internet provider
that someday expects to sell wireless access directly on airplanes
in flight hadn't dampened the enthusiasm for the physical real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have Laptop Lanes in the top 60 United States
airports and the top 30 international airports within a five-year
period,'' he said. ``Since we went in with Softnet, in fact, it's
been raining airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant, meanwhile, suggested that Merrell's original business
plan would probably have led the company to expand its businesses
through local area networks providing Internet access anywhere in
an airport, not just in the limited space of the storefront
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they probably could have done this on their own,
Brilliant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, thanks Larry,'' Merrell replied, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provided they had the money,'' Brilliant added.

 &HT;    Charges of academic abuses could
 &HT;    still make big trouble for Big Orange
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knoxville _ A year ago, no college football fans were more
upbeat than the University of Tennessee's. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols were coming off two SEC championships in a row and
their first national title since 1951. From Knoxville to Memphis,
Tennessee's faithful were convinced that they finally had broken
Florida's stranglehold on the conference and were headed for a
lengthy reign.
</P>
<P>
   But now Big Orange Country is slightly uneasy. No one is
panicking, but subtle signs point to what could be difficult times
ahead for a football program that won 99 games in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ After going 9-3 last season, Tennessee's talent base was hit
hard by the NFL draft. Of the nine starters taken, five were
juniors. As a result, many of the early polls are picking Tennessee
to finish behind Florida and Georgia in the SEC East this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another projected starter, center Greg Barnum, shocked coaches
after spring practice when he suddenly left school and returned to
his native Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sophomore running back Onterrio Smith, a future star, was
dismissed from the team earlier this month for several violations
of team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tennessee has recruited at a high level since Phillip
Fulmer became head coach in 1993, the effects of those personnel
losses should not last long. But a threat looms on the Big Orange
horizon that could have a more profound effect on the football
program for years to come
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Tennessee's football program has dealt with
charges of academic abuses in its tutorial system, which is run by
the athletics department. Among the charges by Linda Bensel-Meyers,
a tenured English professor, is that Tennessee's academic support
system for athletes conspired with members of the UT faculty to
steer athletes to easy courses in order to keep them eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers also charges that some tutors have written papers
for athletes and that athletes at Tennessee receive an unusually
large number of grade changes, when compared with the rest of the
student body.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bensel-Meyers charges, some athletes leave
Tennessee without meaningful degrees and are unable to make a
living if they don't succeed in professional athletics. She says
Tennessee is selling a dream that, for the vast majority of the
athletes, will never come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes aren't fully aware, when they first come in, how
mythic the dream of going to the pros really is,'' Bensel-Meyers
said. ``We perpetuate that myth in the athletic department, and
that's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee officials, from president J. Wade Gilley to football
coach Phillip Fulmer, have strongly denied these charges. Some,
like athletics director Doug Dickey, have gone on the offensive to
defend the school's image.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can disagree about how athletes receive
tutorial assistance and suggest changes to make the system better,
said Dickey. But, he emphasized, there is no conspiracy to keep
athletes eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to violate academic integrity to be
successful,'' Dickey said. ``But if anybody wants to suggest
changes that will strengthen our program and make people feel
better about it, we will be happy to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges went public Sept. 26 on ESPN.com. Tennessee
conducted an internal investigation into the charges and found no
violations of NCAA rules. That report was forwarded to the NCAA,
which in March said the matter was closed.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, Bensel-Meyers released her report on the academic
performances of 39 UT athletes 24 football players, 13 basketball
players and two others. The performances showed, in her opinion, a
consistent pattern of academic abuses. Among her charges where that
the athletes received a total of 105 grade changes.
</P>
<P>
   The records were turned over to Gilley and are in the process of
being studied by a subcommittee of the university's faculty senate.
</P>
<P>
   Other Tennessee officials, after looking at the same records,
are beginning to disagree publicly with some of the conclusions
drawn by Bensel-Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   One charge by Bensel-Meyers was that 18 of the 39 athletes in
question had not declared a major by the beginning of their junior
season, which is required by the NCAA's satisfactory-progess rules.
A check of those records by the registrar's office, however, showed
that 38 of the 39 had declared majors by their junior year and that
the other athlete had left school early.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee athletic officials also disagreed with the alleged 105
grade changes, saying that 41 were incompletes granted and that
only 11 were actually one grade changed to another grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to find out now is why there are two different
stories,'' said Burton English, a professor of agriculture and
chairman of the athletics committee of the faculty senate.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   The athletic committee of the faculty senate already has called
for more faculty oversight into the tutorial program for athletes.
The subcommitte charged with studying Bensel-Meyers' records might
make even more recommendations when it finishes its study, which is
expected to take all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bensel-Meyers says that she thinks the entire tutorial and
academic-assistance program for athletes should be moved out of the
athletic department and placed under the academic umbrella. The
primary interest of Tennessee athletics, she says, is financial,
which means keeping the athlete eligible at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey disagrees, saying that athletes, given the extraordinary
time demands they face, need an advocate as they attempt to
navigate some of the rough waters of college academics. ``There
will be some structural changes,'' English said. ``Whether tutoring
will be brought out of athletics or not, I don't know. But there
will be additional faculty oversight, I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving the university a clean bill of health in March, the
NCAA now says it will return to Tennessee later to study the
records to determine whether it violated rules.
</P>
<P>
   But to focus solely on whether Tennessee violated NCAA rules is
to miss the point, Bensel-Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created a very effective system of not violating NCAA
rules but violating academic integrity,'' Bensel-Meyers said. ``We
use these kids up, make as much money as we can off of them, and,
when they're done, we kick them down the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, the coach since 1993, strongly disagrees. He points to
the fact that the American Football Coaches Association cited the
school for its high graduation rate three of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm proud of my degree at the Univeristy of Tennessee,
and lots and lots of people are,'' said Fulmer, a former Volunteer
player who graduated in 1972. ``And we're no different than the
people at Georgia, Kentucky, and Florida. It's a fine institution,
and we've done quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision will rest with Gilley, who has been on the job for
less than a year. Gilley is caught between loyalty to his faculty
and to the 107,000 fans and alumni who pack Neyland Stadium for
football games on Saturdays in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gilley insists that it is not an either/or situation. ``We're
going to take every charge seriously, and we will make sure to
protect the integrity of the institution,'' he said. ``If you do
things in the right way, in the long run it will pay dividends. And
we're going to do things in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's fans appear to feel comfortable with the situation,
for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans who call us feel there have been no NCAA violations,
so their anxiety level is not as high,'' said Jimmy Hyams, who
hosts a daily sports-talk show on WNOX in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the NCAA finds no violations, people here think the way
Tennessee tutors its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   With the publicity given the case, the athletics department will
have to change the way it does business. And any big change will
become part of the recruiting process. Recruiting at this level is
cut-throat, and rival schools will take any advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee significantly tightens down academically on
athletes, even if those changes appear to be reasonable, recruiters
from opposing schools will use that information against the
Volunteer program. ``The issue is about college football,'' Fulmer
said, ``and, typically, whether it be recruiting or budgets or
admission standards or whatever, we're typically not going to put
ourselves at a disadvantage with Florida and Georgia, and Alabama
and Auburn, and LSU and others. I'm sure all of that will be
weighed as we go through.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the football program say that Tennessee can
overcome the problems. But the highest levels of college football
already contain enough obstacles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the real heroes of ``Grass,'' Ron Mann's punchy and
enjoyable new documentary on the history of marijuana in the United
States during the 20th century, is Mayor Fiorello La Guardia of New
York. While Harry Anslinger, the federal government's first drug
czar, spent his career looking for a way to pin as many evils on
marijuana as he could, and punishing those who disagreed with him,
La Guardia calmly commissioned a study on marijuana use. The study
concluded that ``the sociological, psychological and medical ills
commonly attributed to marijuana have been exaggerated insofar as
the City of New York is concerned.'' It's no wonder that an airport
was named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grass'' begins with the adoption of anti-marijuana laws as
part of an institutionalized racism toward Mexicans in the
Southwest early in the century. Eventually, the film says, the laws
were a bludgeon against anyone who threatened the status quo: the
young during the 1960s, and before that, entertainers like Robert
Mitchum and Gene Krupa. ``Grass'' misses out by not including a
clip from the ``The Gene Krupa Story,'' a middlebrow attempt to
depict the lurid world of jazz in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grass'' offers meticulous sound design, and some snappy
graphics put together by the film's art director, Paul Mavrides,
who once toiled in the underground comics world. There's a brief,
unidentified cameo by the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, the
cannabis heroes of the comics whose adventures Mavrides helped
depict.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is broken up into sections recounting the varying
official takes on the effects of marijuana, like its leading to
insanity, heroin abuse, communism and finally, indolence. The movie
doesn't focus exclusively on the gaunt, wide-eyed stereotype of the
pot addict, though it does use that image to score a number of
laughs. There are views of maniacal pot smokers like those that
appeared in the 1950s publications of E.C. Comics, which figured
prominently in ``Comic Book Confidential,'' one of Mann's early
films.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Comic Book Confidential'' and Mann's documentary
``Twist,'' ``Grass'' fixes on a frightened mainstream reaction to a
cultural phenomenon and a overzealous, singleminded crusader.
Anslinger lends himself to the Javert treatment; it doesn't help
that he, and most of the other law enforcement officers shown here,
all age to look like J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   The film is narrated by the celebrity weed aficionado Woody
Harrelson, whose very name in the credits will ensure a laugh from
audiences. But ``Grass'' doesn't just limit itself to easy potshots
like showing scenes from the infamous ``Reefer Madness'' (1936),
although it does use a number of the propaganda films that sought
to frighten the naive. In those overwrought little dramatizations,
marijuana smokers were driven to rape, violence and in the 1960s,
even to the shocking implication of miscegenation. The film also
leaps ahead to the days of ``Just Say No,'' just to show that the
swing of the anti-pot pendulum in the other direction was useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grass'' is a huge step forward in cool and confidence for
Mann, who makes his case here with seductive, fun Pop Art graphics
and very smart use of music and clips: Cab Calloway and other jazz
hipsters are among those seen extolling the virtues of marijuana,
though Rick James, whose ``Busting Out'' is heard on the
soundtrack, probably isn't exactly the best choice for a pro-pot
poster child. President Richard Nixon, to show his tough-on-crime
stance, is seen waging his own war against pot and deputizing
another unlikely drug warrior, Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   With its pointed narrative, the film makes its case with a
minimum of pushiness and a subtle nod to its crowd. ``Grass''
begins and ends with the credits, as if assuming its target
audience might suffer short-term memory loss for some reason.

 &HT;    Tech, Georgia swing for a title
 &HT;    By Stan Awtrey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Georgia and Georgia Tech golf teams are expected to have
leading roles when the NCAA Championships begin today in Opelika,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the defending national champion, and Georgia Tech is
the No. 1 seed for the 72-hole event on the Lake Course at the
Grand National Golf Complex.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State is making its first trip to the NCAA Tournament.
The Panthers are seeded 20th but tied Georgia for fifth place in
the East Regional in Moosic, Pa. Georgia State's top players have
been D.J. Fiese and Jack Croyle.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Georgia came from five shots behind on the final day
to beat Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about us winning by three shots last year,''
Bulldogs coach Chris Haack said. ``Out of almost 1,200 shots, you
can always think of three that got away from you, and that's where
the breaks factor in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a four-day grind that takes a lot of focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the No. 4 seed in the tournament. The Bulldogs are
led by Michael Morrison, who shot a 1-under 212 to earn medalist
honors in the East Regional, and by Erik Compton, who holds the
school's tournament scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech earned the tournament's No. 1 seed, despite placing
third in the East Regional. The Yellow Jackets missed the cut in
the nationals last year after finishing third in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really not tried to focus on what went wrong,'' Tech
coach Bruce Heppler said. ``We've moved on and are getting ready to
do our best again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech is led by junior Bryce Molder and senior Matt Kuchar.
Molder is a two-time ACC Player of the Year and is ranked as the
No. 1 collegiate player by Golfweek. Kuchar, a former U.S. Amateur
champion, leads the team with a 70.63 stroke average.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal always has been to help bring Georgia Tech a national
championship,'' Kuchar said.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are familiar with the course. They played at the
Ping/Golfweek Preview Invitational at Grand National in the fall.
Georgia Tech finished fourth and Georgia fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, which won the East Regional, is the No. 2 seed. The
Tigers are led by John Engler, Jonathan Byrd and Lucas Glover, who
all tied for fourth in the regional.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State, the No. 3 seed, was third in the Central
Regional in Victoria, Texas. Among the Cowboys' top players is
Charles Howell of Augusta.

SPARKS HOPE THEIR TIME HAS COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With the fourth WNBA season under way, the
Sparks have made it clear that their aim is to move one step
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks came within one victory of advancing to the
championship series last season when they extended eventual
champion Houston Comets to the decisive third game in the Western
Conference finals. Now that they've tasted postseason victory, they
are hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks have a new general manager in former teammate Penny
Toler, a new coach in former Laker Michael Cooper, and a new, more
assertive attitude this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that now is our time,'' forward DeLisha Milton said.
``We can't sit around and wait for opportunities to come to us, we
have to kick the doors down, go in head-first and demand whatever
we want through us earning respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who open the 2000 season at the Forum tonight at
7:30 against Utah, finished last season with their first winning
record at 20-12 and made their first post-season appearance. They
defeated Sacramento in a one-game playoff, and took the first of
three games against the Comets, who went on to win their third WNBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Until some team shows otherwise, Houston is still in command of
the league, as was evident of its 84-68 victory over New York in a
rematch of last year's finals.
</P>
<P>
   But it is widely discussed that the strength of the league lies
in the West and there are several capable teams that could shake
the Comets foundation. The Sparks are one, Sacramento with 1999
Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year Yolanda
Griffith is another. Utah, which has a front court that towers over
the rest of the league, has as good a chance as any team,
especially if point guard Jennifer Azzi returns healthy after
undergoing hand surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper feels the Sparks defensive shortcomings last season
prevented them from going all the way. But that won't be an excuse
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the staples that separates Houston from the
rest of the league and right now,'' said Cooper, who was the NBA
Defensive Player of the Year in 1987 and was a five-time
all-defensive first team member. ``Obviously, there are more teams
that can match with Houston, such as ourselves, Sacramento, Utah
and Phoenix. But the difference between us and them is defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton (9.9 points, 5.5 rebounds) along with 6-5 Lisa Leslie
(15.6 ppg, 7.8 rpg) and swing Mwadi Mabika (10.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg)
return to their starting roles as the team's leaders in scoring and
rebounding. Mabika led the team is assists with 3.8 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Ukari Figgs, who started the first 10 games last season before
spraining her ankle, is back to start at the point, and so is
shooting guard Tamecka Dixon (6.8 ppg), who started 14 of 32 games
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks should be strong off the bench with two versatile
players in 6-3 LaKeisha Frett, who started 18 games last season,
and 6-2 Vedrana Grgin, a Croatian native who joined the team Friday
after leading her Brazilian team to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper isn't worried about Grgin's late start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for teams to matchup with us,'' he said.
``She's already picked up what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige Sauer, a 6-4 center from Connecticut and second-round
draft pick, and 6-5 Clarisse Machanguana is expected to pick up the
slack for Leslie, Allison Feaster is another option at the small
forward spot, and Nikki McCrimmon is the backup point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to take off where we pretty much left off,''
Leslie said. ``We feel very strong and confident.''

LESSONS: SCHOOL ISSUES WARRANT VOTERS' ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Education is the ultimate apple-pie issue: To vote against it is
to be branded anti-child and un-American. Ask any group of
suburbanites to say yea or nay to the proposition ``Should we do
the best for our children?'' and the vote will surely be unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   But it is, alas, never that simple, as I discovered recently
when the town where I live _ Dobbs Ferry, just up the Hudson from
Manhattan _ voted on a bond issue to expand and upgrade the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbors' opinions, often adamant, were all over the map.
Many people rallied around the bond, but many others found fault.
It cost too much. The construction estimates were inflated. The
planning process was flawed. We hired the wrong architect. The
students' needs were not being met. In the end, the doubters
prevailed, and the bond failed.
</P>
<P>
   So, does that mean Dobbs Ferry is anti-education? Not at all.
There were legitimate concerns about the process, especially since
another bond had passed two years earlier but construction had
never started. Now the district was asking for more, and many
people were puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   The stated reasons for hitting us twice included rising
construction costs and necessary changes, but to a casual observer
there was no real way to know if that was the truth or if the
project, which included a much-needed gym and new classrooms for a
growing student population, had been bungled.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely the problem: Most voters on a small-town
school bond will, of necessity, be casual observers. Those of us
who are neither architects nor construction managers _ and lack the
time for a crash course in such matters _ have little choice but to
put our faith in the school board we elected, and the
superintendent that board has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I could be better informed. But I have a job, plus two
teen-agers. That combination puts a dent in my day. And many people
are in a similar position.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, of course, took the time to study the issue
closely, but their conclusions varied widely. At least one couple
split, with the husband voting no, the wife yes. One architect said
that it was a good plan, while another said that it was a disaster
from the start _ that if we had hired the architect he had
recommended, the school addition would be built by now. Who do you
believe?
</P>
<P>
   I chose to put my faith in the school board and backed the bond.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was wrong. Most people know little of school board
candidates when they cast their votes. We read reams of details,
intimate and otherwise, about national politicians, but no
investigative reporters swoop in to delve into the qualifications
of school board candidates. It usually comes down to ``He seems
like a decent person'' or ``Her credentials look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, we've got a good school board. But they are
volunteers, often squeezing this work into busy lives; there's only
so much energy they can devote to school issues. Even in the best
of circumstances, there will be a certain haphazard quality to the
whole business, not just in Dobbs Ferry, but in any small town.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent and assistant superintendent are, of course,
paid to focus on these issues, but that's a big burden for two
people who must also deal with all sorts of other district issues.
An added complication in Dobbs Ferry is that we just got a new
superintendent during winter. The construction bond was a lot to
throw at someone new, though to the superintendent's credit, he
seems to have hit the hallways running.
</P>
<P>
   And voters, no matter how objective they try to be, no matter
how much they say, ``I want to do what's best for the district,''
will find their own interests sneaking in. I, for instance, cannot
help wondering whether the new gym will be ready for my son, a
junior, and how the changes will affect my daughter, a
seventh-grader. Those with younger children, no doubt, scrutinize
the plans for the elementary school more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Those without children face a different choice. They could
easily vote down every proposal to spend extra money on the
schools, trying to keep their taxes as low as possible, but those
who take the long view realize that quality schools are part of
what keeps property values high in many suburbs. They cannot
jeopardize that.
</P>
<P>
   But the childless are unlikely to scrutinize the process as
closely as parents do. In the recent vote, I'm sure many of them
said, ``Now they want more money? After we just voted $22 million?
Forget it!''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a relative handful of people decided the issue. In a
town of about 10,000, only about 1,400 people voted, rejecting the
bond by 100 or so votes.
</P>
<P>
   For me, this is what it adds up to: Even after focusing a fair
amount, it is frustrating to have so little understanding of an
issue that will surely have as much, if not more, impact on my
family than the actions of the national politicians we hear about
ad nauseam.

CLINTON RENEWS HIS EMPHASIS ON EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ It took President Clinton a year into his
first term to visit Europe, and continental leaders weren't sure
what to expect. As a candidate, Clinton belittled the international
interests of the man he defeated to win the White House, and his
early months in office were consumed by domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton finally got to Brussels, Belgium, in January
1994, he set out an expansive agenda, calling for the United States
and Europe ``to revitalize our partnership,'' arguably the
strongest intercontinental alliance in history. With the Cold War
ended, Clinton said, ``we must build a new security for Europe,''
based on integration of security forces, market economies and
national democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six years later, on Clinton's 21st presidential journey to
Europe, the White House contends the American president has made
good on his promise without sacrificing the United States' strong
influence on European security and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made significant progress,'' said Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser. ``The U.S. has supported a
stronger Europe as a complement to, not a competitor of, a stronger
transatlantic alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on Europe is accentuated in Wednesday's session
between Clinton and leaders of the European Union, the 14th such
U.S.-E.U. summit of his presidency. Clinton meets with Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Gutteres, who holds the revolving presidency
of the E.U. Council of Ministers, and Romano Prodi, the former
Italian prime minister who is president of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official warned against
expecting any breakthroughs on more difficult, long-running
U.S.-E.U. disputes such as the European resistance to Latin
American bananas grown by U.S. companies and U.S. beef raised with
hormones. Washington has reacted by slapping tariffs on some luxury
goods and banning others.
</P>
<P>
   Such controversies ``are certainly not trivial,'' Berger said,
``but it's not surprising, I think, given the volume of our trade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-E.U. trade grew seven-fold between 1994 and 1998, Berger
said, and now stands at almost $400 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement among the leaders is more likely on efforts to fight
infectious diseases, especially HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a solemn responsibility to take the benefits of the
information economy, of the explosion in biomedical discoveries,
and to use them to give every young person in the world the chance
to live up to their God-given potential,'' Clinton said in a speech
Tuesday at a science museum in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach to Europe gets generally good marks from
continental observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, the Clinton presidency has been perceived in a
favorable light,'' said Dirk Berg-Schlosser, a political scientist
at Philipps University in Marburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But there are problems beyond the trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Berg-Schlosser said Europeans are uniformly distressed by
Clinton attempts to sell Russia on amendments to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to accommodate the United States'
prospective national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres, in a meeting with Clinton, relayed objections to the
missile shield from a recent meeting with Russian President
Vladimir Putin. The controversy is expected to highlight a
Clinton-Putin meeting in Moscow this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Lisbon early Tuesday after an overnight
flight from Washington. He was greeted by President Jorge Sampiao
at a monument beside the Tagus River that commemorates the role of
Portuguese navigators, including Vasco de Gama, in exploring the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The central portion of Clinton's day was taken up in meetings
with Sampaio and Guterres, both part of Portugal's Socialist ruling
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton was in office a year before visiting Europe, he
has made up for any lost time. Clinton, by now the most traveled
president, has ranged widely across the continent in his 21 trips,
from Ireland in the west to Russia in the east, from Finland in the
north to Turkey in the south.
</P>
<P>
   From Portugal, where Clinton is the first U.S. president to
visit since President Reagan in 1985, he is to fly on to Germany,
Russia and Ukraine during his week-long tour.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced that Clinton will hold a separate
meeting in Berlin on Thursday with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel, who canceled a trip to Washington recently because of
renewed fighting in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that Clinton and Barak
believe it is important to further discuss prospects for an
Israeli-Palestinian framework agreement, especially in light of
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak will be in the German capital to participate
in a meeting on governing in the information age and global
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic ended
another season at Avery Fisher Hall June 3 with Mahler's Ninth
Symphony, one of the great valedictory works in the symphonic
repertory. And indeed, goodbyes might seem to be in order, as talk
in musical circles centers increasingly on who will replace Masur
as the orchestra's music director.
</P>
<P>
   Philharmonic representatives traveled to Milan recently to talk
terms with Riccardo Muti, and other candidates are said to be
waiting in the wings. But often lost in the seeming confusion of
the last year or so has been the fact that whoever is selected, the
72-year-old Masur, who has done so much to restore the orchestra to
a lofty international standard of performance since taking it over
in 1991, is to remain in place for two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This imposing and politically savvy maestro, who played a
significant role in the downfall of the East German regime, is
surely no one's idea of a lame duck, and few have ever found it
wise to underestimate his determination, staying power or
resilience. Yet his ebullience seems to have faded a bit during
years of battles with the Philharmonic management.
</P>
<P>
   To a visitor who had not spoken to him at length for years, he
seemed subdued in a conversation in his Avery Fisher Hall studio
the other day, as he reflected on his achievements in New York and
discussed the future. This year he also becomes the principal
conductor of the London Philharmonic, and in 2002, he exchanges one
music directorship for another, taking over the Orchestre National
de France in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major point for me is still the New York Philharmonic,
because I don't want to leave as someone who says, `I'll say
goodbye poco a poco, diminuendo,''' Masur said, giving a musical
twist to the fate of MacArthur's old soldiers. ``This I never can
do, because we are too close together. The players are expecting
that I will fight till the last day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight with them as well as for them, one suspects, given the
tempestuous nature of some of Masur's rehearsals over the years,
especially the early ones. His tone of voice made clear that he
does not intend to disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   Justifiably, Masur, whose annual salary is about $1.3 million,
takes great satisfaction in the orchestra's improvement over the
last decade. What Zubin Mehta left behind was a group loaded with
talent, largely because of his many superb hires, but seemingly
bereft of morale. Although Masur has hired wonderful players
himself, including Carter Brey as principal cellist and Sheryl
Staples as associate concertmaster, his greatest feat may have been
to instill the needed spirit, pride and sense of discipline among
the players.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, this was not a one-time feat but something that had
to be maintained, as became apparent when the orchestra repeatedly
lapsed into old bad habits under lenient guest conductors; it still
does so on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like to leave behind is this kind of feeling
responsible,'' Masur said, ``this kind of pride to be a member of
the New York Philharmonic, to be a member of one of the leading
orchestras of the world, as it is now without a doubt, so that the
ups and downs are not so dependent on the music director or the
director or the board or the money they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my goals exactly when I came, and it was not easy with
the orchestra at the beginning. But as they learned that I was open
to them, they started to trust me. We have grown together, and this
is the most wonderful thing I have achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, his greatest satisfaction may have led to his
greatest disappointment. ``It disturbed some people,'' Masur said.
``I was criticized for being too close to the orchestra. Where else
should I be as a conductor? My disappointments are not in any
direction toward the orchestra. Absolutely not. My disappointment
is that it was possible that with a change of chairman of the
board, the whole politics of the Philharmonic turned around 180
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   This was as close as Masur came to naming names. Stephen Stamas,
who had been the chairman of the orchestra since 1989, was replaced
by the present chairman, Paul B. Guenther, in 1996. Deborah Borda
was then the executive director of the Philharmonic, having arrived
shortly after Masur in 1991; she left last December to become
managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The resulting
vacancy has just been filled by Zarin Mehta, the executive director
of the Ravinia Festival and Zubin Mehta's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Masur's relationship with Philharmonic management through the
years has been at least as stormy as his relationship with the
players ever was. The final battle became public in early 1998,
when the board refused to extend his contract the usual three
seasons ahead. It was agreed that Masur would stay until 2002 but
that a search for a successor would begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a raw deal with some people,'' Masur said. ``Decisions
were made by three or four people.'' Masur's view that he got a raw
deal is widely shared among players as well as the public. Not that
he finds much comfort in such support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that this is a free country, and a lot of people
don't feel free,'' he said. ``They come to me and say, `I'm so
sorry about what happened, but I have no power.' Maybe they should
have gone through the school we went through in East Germany. You
had no power, but you had to be brave. And it makes you proud if
you always try to say what you think and to say what you believe is
useful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the very least, the timing of the board's action was awkward,
for Masur had resigned his longtime position as Kapellmeister of
the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra just a year before, ostensibly to
devote himself more fully to New York. The conductorial world was
not rich in obvious candidates to succeed him, and the Philharmonic
did not seem to have anyone particular in mind: certainly no one,
it may be said two years later, whom it could pin down quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever will happen to the Philharmonic was, in my opinion,
not planned very carefully,'' Masur said. ``I was ready to stay
longer. I was ready to go earlier if we found the right person,
just to keep things going as they should go. And at the moment we
are a little bit between two chairs, as we say in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful achievement of the board that we have a lot
of money. We can do nearly everything, and we can do everything in
an artistic way. On the other hand, it could have been a closer,
more open cooperation. This is my only disappointment, that I found
some people who are simply not honest, only looking for their
interests, their power.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, for his part, said, ``If you look at the history of
the New York Philharmonic, we have had very few music directors who
have served much longer than a decade.'' Zubin Mehta, at 13 years,
served the longest tenure in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that for a dynamic institution like the
Philharmonic, change is often necessary, and this was one of those
times,'' Guenther continued guardedly. ``Kurt Masur has done a
spectacular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Philharmonic administrators have also expressed dissatisfaction
with perceived limitations in Masur's repertory, which leans
heavily toward the Germanic.
</P>
<P>
   So what remains for Masur to accomplish?
</P>
<P>
   He has evidently given up one of his cherished goals: to see a
pipe organ installed in Avery Fisher Hall. Although such an option
exists in current planning for renovation of the building along
with others in Lincoln Center, it seems to be largely theoretical,
for the ample cost has not been included in figures bandied about
to date.
</P>
<P>
   But Masur is still hopeful about setting up a summer home for
the orchestra in the Seventh Regiment Armory, across Central Park
from Lincoln Center, and establishing a series of informal,
adventurous concerts modeled after the London Proms, to attract,
especially, a young audience. Although complex negotiations with
the various parties controlling the building have repeatedly bogged
down, they evidently remain alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last goal, even if it doesn't occur until I go away, will
be to do the first concert,'' Masur said, ``an open concert in
whatever condition the hall will be in in summertime, to prove that
young people will come with the right programming.''

GORE'S PROPOSAL FOR PROTECTING FORESTS GOES BEYOND CLINTON'S 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska, Mich., Ohio, Wisc., Mo.)  (EDS: Will be updated.) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Wading into one of the most contentious
environmental debates in the nation, Vice President Al Gore pledged
Tuesday to prohibit logging and road building on 43 million acres
of undeveloped national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's promise goes beyond a proposal the Clinton administration
made just three weeks ago that would bar road building across a
broad swath of roadless land in 155 national forests and
grasslands. That land accounts for about a quarter of the entire
forest system and includes many of its most pristine areas.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they praised Clinton's proposal, many environmental
groups said it did not go far enough because it would not prevent
logging in those undeveloped forests. Environmentalists also
criticized the plan, which is under review, for explicitly
exempting the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the nation's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore addressed both complaints, saying that he would
bar logging as well as road building in the roadless areas. And he
strongly suggested that he would extend the same protections to the
Tongass, where conservation efforts have been opposed by Alaska's
influential congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be a national
priority to preserve these roadless areas as they are, no ifs, ands
or buts about it,'' Gore said. ``No more destructive development
and exploitation. And just so I'm crystal clear about it, no new
road building and no timber sales in the roadless areas of our
national forests. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Tongass, Gore added, ``I will ensure total and permanent
protection for the roadless areas in the Tongass, America's great
temperate rain forest.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made his announcement after picking up the
endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, which represents
the leadership of more than 40 environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``His environmental achievements are the most extensive of any
public official in high office,'' said Deb Callahan, president of
the league. ``Without Al Gore and this administration, we would
already be experiencing a dramatic backward slide on the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its new environmental promises, Gore's speech was notable
for not mentioning Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican
rival. The vice president has been criticized by some fellow
Democrats for spending too much time in recent weeks attacking Bush
rather than explaining where he would lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's speech, Gore's aides said, was just the first of
several in which he plans to focus on his own proposals and vision,
rather than reacting to news that Bush creates. The vice president
has also begun devoting more of his speeches to spotlighting parts
of his background, a strategy the Democratic National Committee
plans to incorporate into a series of biographical television
commercials in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore gave his Republican opponent a pass Tuesday,
Callahan, who worked on Gore's 1988 presidential campaign, did not.
She asserted that Bush had done little to reduce air pollution or
improve state parks in Texas. And she accused Bush of pandering to
big corporate polluters that have contributed generously to his
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush's appointees to key cabinet and administrative
positions predict an administration of, by and for the special
interests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, said that Bush's
administration had actually added nearly 91,000 acres to the state
park system and had significantly reduced the release of toxic
pollutants into the air, water and soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al Gore chooses surrogates to pollute Governor Bush's
record, he should choose ones that have their facts straight,''
Barlett said. ``The new Al Gore is the same old Al Gore. The
negative campaigning will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the league's endorsement, the Republican National
Committee on Tuesday circulated copies of a memorandum written at
least six months ago by a board member of the Sierra Club, one of
the nation's largest and most influential environmental groups,
that sharply criticized Gore's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this legacy, no real environmentalist could ever endorse
Al Gore,'' wrote Michael Dorsey, a doctoral candidate at the
University of Michigan's school of natural resources and
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel J. Weiss, the Sierra Club's political director,
described the memorandum as ``one person's opinion,'' adding that
it would have ``no impact'' on whether the group endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists expect the Sierra Club to back Gore by
the fall. Indeed, the group has already spent $250,000 on
television commercials attacking Bush's environmental record. The
spots are being broadcast in Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin and
will begin running in Ohio this week.
</P>
<P>
   A third, smaller environmental group, Friends of the Earth,
which endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and has
been sharply critical of Gore's record on global warming and trade
issues, remains undecided in the race. A spokesman, Mark
Whiteis-Helms, said the group is considering endorsing Ralph Nader,
the Green Party candidate, but has not ruled out backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing new protections for the national forests, Gore
stepped into an emerging national debate over development in some
of the nation's wildest lands.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the expanded protections contend that roadless
areas encompass some of the cleanest, safest wildlife habitats in
the nation. But off-road vehicle enthusiasts and timber industry
officials argue that too much public land has already been placed
off limits to the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech Tuesday, Gore also pledged to prevent oil drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. And he asserted
that passing campaign finance reform legislation would be a form of
environmental protection, because it would reduce the influence of
big corporate polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also defended his 1992 book on the environment, ``Earth in
the Balance,'' which was recently reissued, much to the glee of
some Republicans who say it exposes Gore as an extremist on the
issue. But Tuesday, Gore said: ``I am proud I wrote that book. I
stand by every word in that book.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``I believe that God created only this one earth
and the earth is in the balance. Save it we can, and save it we
must.''

 &HT;    Bear warnings don't slow visitors to Smokies
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elkmont, Tenn. _ Jay Kelley and his grown son, Shane, looked
forward to their hike on the Little River Trail, one of the most
popular in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Besides winding
next to a river and through a hardwood forest, its great attraction
is that the walk starts on a flat roadbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the easiest hikes in the Smokies and that's why we
decided to go,'' said Shane Kelley, 26, from Lebanon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But a yellow sign stapled to the trail marker made the hike less
inviting to his father: WARNING. Bears Are Active In This Area.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers posted the notices soon after a black bear mauled a
Tennessee school teacher on the trail May 21. The fatality
apparently is the first from a bear attack in the park's 66-year
history. Officials are awaiting an autopsy report to verify that
the attack caused the woman's death. Previously, the only recorded
death caused by a black bear in a national park occurred at
Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Kelleys had heard about the attack a week before
their Memorial Day weekend visit. Despite assurances from rangers
that the attack was an isolated incident, the elder Kelley decided
to take a shorter walk.
</P>
<P>
   His son hiked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see a bear, all I have to do is outrun you,'' Shane
Kelley joked with his dad, before hiking 2.3 miles on the Little
River Trail to another path. The attack has raised bear awareness
but not deterred visitors from the most popular national park in
the country, which straddles the Tennessee-North Carolina line. Few
people have cancelled reservations in the park's developed
campsites or withdrawn backcountry permits.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the park reopened three backcountry campsites (Nos.
21, 23 and 30) near where school teacher Glenda Ann Bradley was
killed. A fourth, No. 24, remains closed because of reports of a
third bear in the area. Rangers there have set up a simulated
campsite and are cooking bacon and other fatty foods to see if it
attracts a bear. A video camera will monitor the area through the
week.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,600 black bears live in the park, which is visited
annually by 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 99 percent of the people who visit have a respect for
black bears,'' park resource officer David Carney said at the
Sugarlands Visitor Center just outside Gatlinburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 1 percent of 10 million people is still a lot. Someone who
might chase a black bear with a Nikon camera needs to realize it's
not a dog, it's not a cat, it's not a domesticated animal. It's a
wild animal. If you picked up a rabbit here, it's a wild animal, it
will bite you. A black bear just happens to be big enough to do
more damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the entrance to the Elkmont Campground, which is adjacent
to the Little River Trail, a sign clearly designates the area: BEAR
HABITAT. But every campsite was filled over the Memorial Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Massey, a 38-year-old metals buyer from Newnan, didn't
hesitate hiking the Little River Trail with his wife and 4-year-old
son. ``You've got a lot more chances of getting hurt in Atlanta
than on the trails out here,'' Massey said. ``Everybody that's come
up to the Smokies has seen a bear. It's such a rare incident that
someone gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The park averages about one minor injury a year because of a
black bear encounter, officials said. A female hiker was
hospitalized 10 days in 1989 after a black bear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The two-lane roads that snake through the Smokies frequently are
clotted by ``bear jams'' _ traffic backups caused when motorists
pull off to watch black bears wandering in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   A bear jam Sunday clogged Little River Road between the Elkmont
campground and the Sugarlands Visitor Center on U.S. 441. George
Kabel of Dallas, Ga., had his zoom lens zeroed in on the bears. It
was the first time he had seen a wild black bear. It was nothing
new to his wife, Susan, who had seen similar beasts on previous
trips to the park.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the fatality, ``I wouldn't go out on the
trails,'' Susan Kabel said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, Bradley and her ex-husband, Ralph Hill, entered the
park around noon, officials said. A few hours later, Hill went
fishing and Bradley stayed behind near the intersection of the
Little River and Goshen Prong trails.
</P>
<P>
   Hill returned and found Bradley's pack. Her body was about 40
years off the path. Hill tried to scare off two bears _ a 110-pound
female and her 40-pound cub _ hovering over the body, officials
said. Nearly a dozen hikers threw rocks at the bears but couldn't
scare them off. After a hiker ran to get them, two rangers killed
the bears by firing 19 rounds from their 9 mm and 10 mm
semiautomatic pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Bradley's autopsy won't be released for two to
three months. There's no suspicion of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying that we're about 100 percent certain that it
was a bear attack,'' said park spokeswoman Nancy Gray. ``But we
can't say for certain until the autopsy.'' Not far from the park in
eastern Tennessee, Jones Cove Elementary School, where Bradley
taught fourth grade, will establish a memorial garden in the
teacher's honor. Earlier this month, her colleagues named her the
school's teacher of the year. Her funeral is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there was nothing more that would please her,''
said Jo An Trentham, principal of the 200-student school. ``She
loved the outdoors and hiked a lot.''

HIGH COURT TO CONSIDER CLEAN AIR ACT AND ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for rewriting and additional details on Clean Air case and
new material on two other cases; story grows by about 950 words and
is now 2 takes) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday expanded its
continuing review of the Clean Air Act by agreeing to decide
whether the statute requires the government to look beyond the
public health benefits of reducing air pollution and consider the
economic costs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The court's action raised the stakes even higher in a case, to
be argued next fall, that already promised to be one of the most
important environmental and administrative law cases in years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the justices agreed to hear the Clinton
administration's appeal of a ruling by the federal appeals court
here that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the Environmental
Protection Agency, handed such broad authority of a legislative
nature to the administrative agency as to amount to an
unconstitutional ``delegation'' by Congress of its lawmaking power.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Tuesday in the same case, the court granted a separate
appeal, filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group of
regulated industries, that asked the justices to examine the Clean
Air Act from a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   If the court were to read a broad cost-benefit requirement into
the EPA's rule-making authority, the business groups said, the
whole delegation question could be avoided, because the
cost-benefit requirement ``could functionally serve as the
necessary intelligible principle'' to preserve the law's
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had argued against granting the
business groups' appeal, characterizing it as an invitation to a
judicial override of a choice that Congress had already made. In
enacting the Clean Air Act, the administration told the court,
Congress ``reasonably concluded'' that pollution standards ``should
be based on health and welfare considerations alone so that
Congress and the public know that EPA's judgments on the health and
welfare threats posed by particular criteria pollutants are not
compromised by considerations of economic and technical
feasibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case are new standards, set by the agency in
1997, for ozone and small airborne particles. The administration's
appeal is Browner vs. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257,
and the appeal granted Tuesday is American Trucking Associations
vs. Browner, No. 99-1426.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In invalidating the new standards in its ruling last year, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the
EPA lacked ``any determinate criteria for drawing lines'' and had
``failed to state intelligibly how much is too much.'' The opinion,
by Judge Stephen F. Williams, suggested strongly that a
cost-benefit analysis could supply such criteria.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams said the appeals court was constrained by its own
precedent, a 1980 decision known as the Lead Industries case that
specifically barred the agency from considering any factor other
than public health. Only the Supreme Court was in a position to set
that decision aside.
</P>
<P>
   Although it declined to review the Lead Industries decision at
the time, the Supreme Court is familiar with the cost-benefit issue
from a series of regulatory battles in the early 1980s involving
the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In a 1980 case, a deeply
splintered court struck down the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration's standard for exposure to benzene, holding that
although OSHA did not have to engage in full cost-benefit analysis
to justify new regulations, it did have to make a preliminary
finding that current exposure levels posed ``a significant risk of
harm.'' That requirement presented a limiting principle that would
avoid a finding of undue delegation, the court said then.
</P>
<P>
   In a case the next year, involving standards for worker exposure
to cotton dust, the cause of brown lung disease, the court refused
to read a cost-benefit requirement into the occupational health
statute and said Congress had made its choice ``by placing the
`benefit' of worker health above all other considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Edward W. Warren, a lawyer here who won
the benzene case 20 years ago and will  &QC; argue for the business
groups in this case, said his clients were not asking the court to
adopt a ``technocratic, lives-for-dollars'' analysis of the Clean
Air Act or to use the case as a vehicle to ``transform the
administrative state.'' He said it was possible to interpret the
statute as making public health the primary consideration, with
cost considerations coming in only at the point of selecting among
alternative strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For purposes of the case, the most relevant phrases of the Clean
Air Act are those that instruct the administrator of the EPA to set
air quality standards that while ``allowing an adequate margin of
safety, are requisite to protect the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no completely safe levels, above zero, of the
pollutants that the law regulates. According to the business
groups' brief, the phrase ``adequate margin of safety'' suggests
that the agency ``must trade off the costs and benefits of
additional safety, just as designers strive to engineer `adequate'
_ but never complete _ safety into every product they design.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were also these developments at the court Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   Potomac River Dispute
</P>
<P>
   Exercising its infrequently used ``original jurisdiction'' to
resolve suits between states, the court said it would allow
Virginia to proceed with a suit against Maryland over use of the
Potomac River, which forms a border between the two. Maryland owns
the river, under a grant from King Charles I of England in 1632,
but under various interstate compacts Virginia has been allowed to
make ``reasonable use'' of the Potomac from its own shoreline,
including the construction of pipes to draw river water for
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia brought this case, Virginia vs. Maryland, No. 129
Original, to protest Maryland's refusal to allow the Fairfax County
Water Authority to build a new intake pipe from the shoreline to a
point in the main channel, 725 feet offshore. The county authority
says the new pipe is needed because the current intake pipe, at the
shoreline, is subject to runoff, clogging by leaves or ice, and
other problems that would not occur near the middle of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Church Arson
</P>
<P>
   After its ruling last week that the federal arson law does not
apply to arson of a private residence, the court ordered two
federal appeals courts to reconsider whether the law applies to
arson of a church. In one case, Rea vs. United States, No. 99-6136,
the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, found that a
church annex, used as a schoolhouse and for other activities, was
sufficiently connected with interstate commerce to be covered by
the law.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in New Orleans,
almost simultaneously vacated a man's guilty plea for burning a
church. In that case, United States vs. Johnson, No. 99-1266, the
appeals court said the government had not shown that the Hopewell
United Methodist Church in Centerville, Texas, had the ``explicit
connection with or effect on interstate commerce'' necessary for
federal jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous decision last week, Jones vs. United States,
No. 99-5739, the court held that Congress did not intend the arson
law, which requires that a building be ``used'' in an activity
affecting commerce, to apply to a house used as a private
residence.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeals courts disagree on how the ruling applies to
churches or other types of buildings, there is a good prospect for
further Supreme Court decisions.

PARIS MAYOR'S TROUBLES GROW AS FRAUD INVESTIGATION WIDENS
</HEADLINE>
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The web of scandal surrounding the mayor's office here
got a little more complicated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial sources said that 15 city officials, including Mayor
Jean Tiberi's top aide, had been put under formal investigation for
election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another blow to President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist
party, which is maneuvering frantically to hold onto the mayor's
office, one of the most prestigious posts in France. Apart from its
wedding-cake ceilings and crystal chandeliers, Paris' city hall has
a huge budget and provides a national platform for whoever runs it.
</P>
<P>
   With elections just 10 months away, Chirac's party, Rally for
the Republic, has just dumped Tiberi as its candidate for
re-election after five years of scandals and judicial
investigations into his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the new investigations reach far beyond Tiberi and threaten
even to taint Chirac as they involve fixing Paris elections while
he was its mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on computer records in one district of Paris,
investigators have apparently found 859 names fraudulently added to
electoral rolls in 1995 by officials associated with the mayor's
party.
</P>
<P>
   The race for mayor has proved so far to be one of the more
entertaining political stories in France. Partly, this has to do
with Tiberi, who has behaved like gum stuck to the party's shoe.
Despite polls indicating that only 5 percent of Parisians consider
him honest, Tiberi has pressed on, holding news conferences to
deplore his treatment and to tout his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tiberi tried to force his party to put his
candidacy to a vote of local members. But the party's national
headquarters unveiled a little problem: the list of local members
Tiberi had supplied contained 1,500 ghost members. Some had moved
away, stopped paying dues or died. One party employee found seven
strangers listed as living in her house.
</P>
<P>
   Tiberi is still threatening to run without the party's backing.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiberi has not provided the only theatrics. Half a dozen
heavy-hitting politicians have thrown their hats into the ring and
then retrieved them again.
</P>
<P>
   They include the party's former prime minister, Edouard
Balladur, and Jack Lang, a Socialist who was former President
Francois Mitterrand's culture and education minister and is still
one of the best known faces on the French cultural-intellectual
scene. Lang was recently drafted into Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's government, presumably to clear the way for Bertrand
Delanoe, Jospin's choice to become mayoral candidate of his
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Rally for the Republic has chosen Philippe Seguin as its
candidate. Seguin is often described as large in stature and
personality, and the party no doubt hopes that his presence will
eclipse Tiberi's sordid reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals attached to Tiberi have been unrelenting. His wife,
Xaviere, before her conviction was set aside on a technicality, was
found guilty of accepting $36,000 from the government for a 36-page
report on a subject in which she had no expertise. At trial, a
witness testified that Tiberi had suggested she be given the job.
Other scandals have involved awarding public housing contracts to
party supporters. Allegations that some of the mayor's political
cronies hold city jobs but do no work are still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 officials now under formal investigation include Tiberi's
deputy mayor, Jacques Dominati, who belongs to the Rally for the
Republic's sister party, Liberal Democracy. The newspaper Le
Parisien quotes him today as admitting to limited fraud in the 1989
election, but nothing ``very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just some activists who were a bit too enthusiastic and
signed up extra names in my arrondissement,'' he told the
newspaper. ``But there was no large-scale organization.''

   BINT JBAIL, Lebanon _ After winning control of southern Lebanon
with rockets and bombs, the Hezbollah militia is back here in force
_ this time with an army of doctors, nurses, veterinarians,
bulldozers, agronomists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the last Israeli soldiers retreated from the
rocky hillside villages that they controlled for nearly 18 years,
the business of keeping the water pumping and the hospitals running
for an estimated 75,000 Lebanese civilians has been taken on by
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   In this ragged town of 13,000, which served as a military
headquarters for Israel and its Lebanese allies during their
occupation of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah workers have set up metal
dispensers filled with drinking water in the streets because a
pipeline that used to bring drinking water from Israel has been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Here and throughout the south, Hezbollah workers have also
bulldozed debris from the streets and widened the narrow roads.
They have sent in insecticide-spraying trucks to kill mosquitoes.
They are surveying the damaged and destroyed buildings to decide
how much material to provide for reconstruction. They drive from
village to village in nine modern mobile clinics and have sent in
doctors and nurses to run an additional nine stationary clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In Beit Jbail, the Hezbollah health organization has also taken
over the regional hospital, which was abandoned during the
withdrawal by the local Lebanese doctors who used to be paid by
Israel to run it. The new management quickly renamed the place,
which used to be called simply Beit Jbail Hospital, in honor of a
comrade who died in a guerrilla attack on the town's Israeli
military guard post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to take over,'' said Fouad Taher, who manages
another Hezbollah-owned hospital in Lebanon and was dispatched to
help run the one here. ``The government should take its normal
place. The only reason we took this hospital is that we knew the
people really needed these services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the power vacuum left by the sudden withdrawal of Israeli
troops and the flight of many of their allies in the South Lebanon
Army, Hezbollah has started to operate in the south much as it does
in the rest of Lebanon, as a kind of parallel government offering
social services, development loans and reconstruction aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still considered by the United States and other
nations to be a terrorist group that bombed embassies and kidnapped
Westerners in the 1980s with the help of radical patrons in Iran
and Syria, Hezbollah has developed a different image in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Its network of services and institutions has helped it become
one of the country's strongest political parties in recent years,
with nine representatives now in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When other Lebanese militias were forced to disarm in the past
decade, Hezbollah maintained its weapons, turning them on Israelis
and members of the South Lebanon Army. Hezbollah operations in the
south, first as a guerrilla movement attacking Israeli positions in
the occupied buffer zone and now as a rapid-reaction force to
maintain public order, are likely to further its political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, no one in the Lebanese power structure appears
willing or able to challenge Hezbollah, or the Party of God, which
is lauded by every faction and religious grouping here as the
liberator of national territory. The government, which is still
haggling with the United Nations over whether the Israeli
withdrawal is complete, has refused to send its army to the south,
although dozens of Lebanese policemen have taken up positions at
checkpoints and are directing traffic at intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which is the major power in Lebanon and has 30,000 troops
stationed elsewhere in the country, has done little but
congratulate Hezbollah, although Syria has acted to try to limit
the group's political power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, thousands of Lebanese, including mayors
and federal government officials, have crammed into the Beirut
sitting room of Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's general
secretary, to offer congratulations and to kiss his hands and
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah, who does not hold a government or parliamentary post,
has acted deferential toward the official government, saying his
organization has no intention of setting up a parallel or competing
structure in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah directors of the Bint Jbail hospital, for
instance, courteously showed the Lebanese minister of health, Karam
S. Karam, around the facility on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Karam, who was accompanied by a French delegation that had
arranged a training program for Lebanese doctors who were scheduled
to operate the hospital after the Israeli retreat, said he is
grateful that Hezbollah moved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Israelis withdrew, it was chaotic,'' Karam said. ``So
those working in the hospital fled. Then thugs came in and started
taking things. The ones who came immediately to establish order
were Hezbollah. They are organized and they are fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Karam said, he is ready to take on the hospital. So when
he returned to Beirut, he paid a call on Nasrallah, who offered
reassuring words: ``He told me, `The minute you decide to take it
over, we will give you the keys,''' Karam recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah banners, meanwhile, are draped across countless
electric poles, buildings and even junk piles throughout the south
now. So are the banners of the Jihad-al-Binaa Association,
Hezbollah's reconstruction arm. Its engineers and architects are
making a survey of every building in the area, its insecticide
trucks are spraying, its veterinarians have examined livestock and
its water trucks have provided water.
</P>
<P>
   None of those services have been provided by the Lebanese
government, which began only three days ago to work on a new water
pipeline to villages once served by Israeli water.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, the Jihad-al-Binaa has been rebuilding houses in
Lebanon that were destroyed by Israeli bombs, as well as running
two agricultural extension centers and advancing money to farmers.
Like its parent organization, the reconstruction agency saw its
work as part of the battle with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the war against Israel, it was a weapon in the
struggle,'' said Ibrahim A. Ismail, the general manager of
Jihad-al-Binaa. ``We fought Israel through development of
Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail said the group's preliminary estimates show that 1,600
houses in the former buffer zone have been destroyed since 1978,
when Christian militias allied with Israel began attacking many
Muslim areas. Another 1,200, he said, may have been partially
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our survey of the houses, we will see if we can give
help,'' he added, ``although that is not our job. It's the
government's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's energetic efforts may have already paid off in terms
of reducing tensions among Lebanese in the south and particularly
among Christians, who had feared they would be the target of the
Muslim militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the withdrawal, Hezbollah clerics
visited many of the remaining priests and Christian leaders and
Hezbollah fighters helped stop some of the looting that took place
after Israel's allies fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came and talked to us and told us not to worry,'' said
Ibrahim Yunis, a schoolteacher in the small Christian village of
Dibel, near Beit Jbail, where two-thirds of the residents fled to
Israel during the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all what we were led to expect. The whole picture
has changed from black to white, from what we used to hear about
what Hezbollah would do to us to what we now are feeling.''

INS OFFICIAL CONVICTED ON ESPIONAGE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A veteran immigration official here was convicted
Tuesday of espionage in a case that caused the expulsion of a Cuban
diplomat and heightened political tensions between the United
States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court found the official, Mariano Faget,
54, guilty of violating the Espionage Act by disclosing government
secrets to a boyhood friend who wanted to do business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, an acting deputy director with 34 years of service with
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service office here, was
convicted of disclosing official secrets, using those secrets for
his personal use and lying to federal investigators about his
foreign business ties and his meetings with a Cuban diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Faget, who came to the United States from
Cuba when he was a teen-ager, said when he took the stand last week
in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   But federal prosecutors argued that Faget, whose job involved
reviewing government decisions on naturalization and asylum, had
sold out his country to help a business partner and himself.
</P>
<P>
   The case came as Cuban exiles in Miami protested the decision by
Attorney General Janet Reno to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez home
to Cuba, and as Cubans demanded the boy's return in
government-sponsored demonstrations on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Faget's arrest led to the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat, Jose
Imperatori, who had dealings with Faget and was accused of spying
by U.S. officials. Cuban officials denied the accusations.
Imperatori refused to leave the country and did so only after
federal agents escorted him to a Washington airport.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who faces up to 10 years in prison, is scheduled for a
sentencing hearing in August.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested after a government undercover operation in
February, when government agents passed phony information to him
about the fictitious defection of a Cuban diplomat, and warned him
that the information was secret. Faget, as a senior supervisor with
the immigration service, had a high security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 minutes after the meeting with the agents, he called a
Cuban-American boyhood friend and business partner, Pedro Font, and
told him the name of the Cuban official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mariano Faget was a government employee willing to betray the
trust of the people he was sworn to serve,'' Curtis Miner, an
assistant U.S. attorney, said in his closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who was nearing retirement, was on the board of directors
with Font of America Cuba Inc., a corporation formed to pursue
business interests in Cuba if the U.S. trade embargo against the
island is ever lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Faget told the jury last week that he called his friend because
Font was supposed to meet later that day with the Cuban official
named by the government agents, and he was afraid that Font would
be harmed if Cuban officials thought he was somehow involved in the
defection.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12-member jury apparently did not accept that Font, a
New York businessman, would have been in any danger from Cuban
officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He disclosed classified information information for no better
purpose than his own personal reasons, his own personal gain,''
Miner said. ``He took it out of the realm of control of the United
States government and gave it to someone else to use however they
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget's lawyer had argued that his client was not doing anything
that threatened national security and that he was only trying to
help a boyhood friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``An honest government servant,'' said Edward O'Donnell, Faget's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors used surveillance tapes to show meetings between
Faget and Cuban diplomats in a Miami bar, acts that are illegal
under federal law because of Faget's job at the immigration
service.
</P>
<P>
   And Faget had marked ``no'' on a disclosure form for immigration
service employees when he was asked if he had any foreign business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Font and Faget had known each other in Cuba, where Faget's
father had worked in the police force controlled by Cuba's
president at that time, Fulgencio Batista. Faget and his family
fled Cuba in 1959.

BUSH SAYS ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO `POLITICIZE' HIS NUCLEAR ARMS
PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ George W. Bush on Tuesday accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of trying to ``politicize'' national defense by
criticizing his proposal to reduce the number of American nuclear
warheads and build a large anti-ballistic missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued his rebuke on the same day that he, in turn, accused
the Democratic administration of plunging military morale to
``dangerously low'' levels by over-deploying troops around the
world, under-paying them and poorly equipping them.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off a four-day campaign swing through the West, the
likely Republican presidential nominee reacted to Secretary of
Defense William Cohen's offer to brief Bush and his national
security advisers on the state of America's strategic nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters on Tuesday that he already has received
``substantial'' national defense briefings from Colin Powell,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney; and former National Security Adviser Henry
Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one of the finest foreign policy teams ever
assembled,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the only Republican in President Clinton's Cabinet, and
Vice President Al Gore, Bush's likely Democratic opponent, both
have criticized Bush's nuclear arms proposal. They contend it would
harm arms control efforts and threaten world security.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor announced last week that he would consider
making unilateral reductions in nuclear weapons at a deeper level
than the one being negotiated by the United States and Russia. He
also called for the construction of a larger anti-ballistic missile
defense system than proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in a nationally televised interview on Sunday, said that
Bush's larger anti-missile system would prompt Russia and other
countries to respond by increasing their own nuclear arsenals. Were
that to happen, he said, it would make negotiated reductions in
nuclear warheads less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call upon my opponent not to allow members of the
administration to politicize national defense,'' Bush said. ``I
found the comments (by Cohen) to be political in nature.``
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown denied Cohen's
comments were political. In a conference call with reporters
arranged by the Democratic National Committee, Brown questioned how
Bush would pay for his anti-missile defense system and warned that
it could spur an international arms race. He also questioned
whether the technology existed to build it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also said the administration recognized the problems that
American troops face and was ``working responsibly to address
them.``
</P>
<P>
   But on a visit in Denver to the country's oldest Veterans of
Foreign Wars post, Bush blamed President Clinton for military
morale problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a man who's in charge of morale in the military. We
have a commander in chief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also ridiculed Gore for claiming, on his campaign Web site,
that the administration has had a well-managed military
``build-down.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that America's defense spending, as a percentage of
Gross Domestic Product, was at its lowest level since the 1941
attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. troops are over-deployed and underpaid and under-trained.
Entire Army divisions are not prepared for war. Military recruiting
fell thousands short of its goal, and 6,000 United States soldiers
are on food stamps,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore record cries out for a new sign on the
Pentagon that says, `Under New Management.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to increase military pay, renovate substandard
military housing, upgrade training and give the military a ``clear
sense of mission.'' He said that, if elected, he also will order an
immediate review of America's overseas commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would honor America's peacekeeping commitments in
the world's hotspots but also would negotiate political solutions
and convince America's allies to shoulder more of the peacekeeping
load.

WHO DARES CALL THIS MAESTRO A LAME DUCK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, June 4) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a performance in Chicago a few years ago, a woman came up
to Roy Haynes and told him that the way he played drums reminded
her of the four seasons. Not Vivaldi, but
winter-spring-summer-fall.
</P>
<P>
   He liked that remark. Haynes embodies a great deal of jazz's
history. He is among a small group of musicians who have seen 50
years' change of weather in jazz from the best vantage point _ the
back of the bandstand, the rhythm section. He has played with
practically everybody of major significance since the 1940s _ from
Louis Armstrong to Pat Metheny, as he likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   He is 75, small, bald and careful about his clothes, and he
looks as fit as a soldier. The way he plays the drums sounds
unprogrammed and original. When he's onstage, especially, he seldom
repeats a pattern on the high-hat or the ride-cymbal. Where many
drummers use those two cymbals as comfortable pulse-setters to lay
underneath the main event of the drums themselves, he emphasizes
them, smacking the cymbals loudly and making the audience hear the
harmony and density in the metal. He displaces a band's rhythms,
making the music sound as if it's spilling out over the sides of
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm listening to something on the radio and it becomes the
same thing over and over,'' Haynes said last week, while sitting in
the living room of his house near Long Island's south shore, ``I
change the channel. If it's moving, I find out where it's going. It
has to go someplace. If it just stays in one place, it becomes
stagnant _ water, music, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   When Haynes lived in Harlem in the late '40s and early '50s, the
jazz musicians of his acquaintance were listening to Afro-Cuban
music all the time _ the Cuban conguero Chano Pozo had joined Dizzy
Gillespie's big band, and the orchestras led by Machito, Tito
Puente and Tito Rodriguez were playing regular gigs at uptown dance
halls. Whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship or not (
Haynes disdains most suppositions about such things, feeling that
his style has always been within him), he developed an outgoing,
open sound on the drums that has led many compare him to a timbale
or conga player. He lets rhythm flow through him without a feeling
of constraint; sometimes the pulse gets stretched, but it's
constantly changing, the kind of musicianship that always sounds
modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way he breaks up time,'' said David Kikoski, who has
been Haynes' regular pianist since 1986. ``The accents he does with
his different limbs are more complex than anything that came before
him. The syncopation that he developed influenced all modern
drummers. It sounds natural because it is natural. What he plays on
the drums is the way he lives, the way he talks, the way he
walks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roy Haynes Trio,'' a new disc on Verve/Universal recorded
with the pianist Danilo Perez and the bassist John Patitucci, is an
unpretentious little record that in some ways is a retrospective
for Haynes. Cut in half between two sets, like an LP, it's
half-studio and half-live; its repertory stretches from his early
days (Bud Powell's ``Wail,'' which he recorded with Powell in 1949
on one of the most fundamental recording sessions in jazz) through
the 1960s (a song by Chick Corea, on whose first album, ``Now He
Sobs, Now He Sings,'' Haynes appeared, and with whom he still
occasionally plays) and into the recent years (Pat Metheny's
``Question and Answer,'' taken from Metheny's 1989 trio album of
the same name, with Haynes and Dave Holland).
</P>
<P>
   It's got a few formula bebop rhythms, a minimalist piece written
by Thelonious Monk and beloved by drummers called ``Green
Chimneys,'' as well as that open, unyielding conga sound, which
happens quite naturally in a few places; Perez, from Panama, tends
to draw Latin rhythms out of drummers by turning jazz vamps into
Latin montunos, and Haynes responds energetically.
</P>
<P>
   The trio, starting an American tour, will perform at Birdland in
New York this Thursday through Saturday. ``I never thought I would
be this age and touring,'' Haynes said. He says he never wanted to
become the kind of jazz musician who's still on stage after the
point when he should have been told to hang it up. But forget age _
there are few better drummers in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he first heard bebop, Haynes flinched a little. ``I
feel like I've been playing it all my life,'' he said. ``I'm one of
the inventors of it! Well, not really, but that's my period.''
</P>
<P>
   All paradigm-shifting art styles have debatable beginnings:
there are precursor figures who point the way and then a next wave
young enough to swallow it whole and make an actual style of it.
Haynes was from the latter camp.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston during the early '40s, Haynes was part of the vibrant
black jazz subculture in the Roxbury section: he played for
lindy-hoppers and zoot-suiters. He was in touch with the bebop
coming from New York, buying the first records by Coleman Hawkins
that carried intimations of the new style, taking the bus down to
New York's 52nd street on weekends before he was out of his teens.
He remembers writing a letter to his brother in 1943 in which he
tried to describe the new sound he was hearing as something like
the famously tight, complex music of the John Kirby band but with
different harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York in 1945 at the request of the bandleader
Luis Russell and joined the cast of characters who hung around the
crossroads of 126th Street and Eighth Avenue. Jazz had central
locations back then; musicians would sit in the bar of the Hotel
Braddock, cruising for work, or stand on the corner eating and
talking, holding a sort of open-air office hours. His first gig was
at the Savoy Ballroom, playing for dancers again. In 1947 he joined
Lester Young's band; two years later, when Young split up his band
to go on tour with the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic revue,
Haynes started working on 52nd Street, the new locus of activity,
with different young bandleaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fashionable, then, to leave the big bands and play with
the small groups,'' he said. Haynes turned down a job offer from
Duke Ellington in 1951, preferring to keep playing with Charlie
Parker. ``That's what we wanted to do _ just stay in New York and
gig.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most instructive periods was his time spent as a
member of Thelonious Monk's band during Monk's long residency at
New York's Five Spot in the late '50s. ``Monk played the oddest
tempos,'' Haynes recalled, singing a few floaty,
neither-fast-nor-slow bars of ``Let's Cool One.'' ``He used to say
that drummers can usually just play a few tempos,'' he said. ``If
you take them out of those tempos, they'll either bring the tempo
up or bring it back. And he may have had a point there.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes also recorded and worked at clubs with jazz's finest
vocalists and learned how to negotiate his way around each one's
rhythmic center. ``Playing with Ella Fitzgerald,'' he said,
alluding to her exact sense of time, ``was like playing with the
Basie band. Playing with Billie Holiday was like playing with Prez.
Playing with Sarah Vaughan was like playing with Charlie Parker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Vaughan _ her great self-titled album from 1954, including
Clifford Brown as well as Haynes, has just been reissued by Verve _
was one of the most challenging jazz musicians of the century.
``During that period,'' Haynes said, ``she sang the slowest ballads
I have ever heard. Mmm. Today, it's harder to play really slowly
with most bass players, because they don't fill out that space that
needs to be filled out if the drummer's going to play with
brushes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' he added, warming up to the topic, ``you can play
something slow, but it can still have intensity in it. There's a
way that 'Trane did it too, when he played a ballad. It wasn't
necessarily that slow, but you'd be up there'' _ he raises his head
above his head to show the rhythm section's level of intensity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   His favorite subject seems to be time and what can be achieved
by the subtle altering of it; he had just seen Willie Nelson
performing on television and was full of praise for how the singer
races the tempo of his singing and guitar playing while keeping an
inner sense of steady time. ``He played one of Django Reinhardt's
tunes,'' Haynes said. ``I said, my god. I didn't know he was that
slick.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes started leading groups in the late '60s, and like a
number of other drummers _ Elvin Jones, Max Roach, Jack DeJohnette,
Arthur Taylor _ has been a cultivater of young talent. He offers
his experience to his charges, but experience has not taught Haynes
to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got more energy than 20- and 30-year-old musicians I've
travelled with,'' said Kikoski. ``We can be on a train for hours
and hours, get to the bandstand and Roy will always be completely
energized and ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes contends that when he's not playing he gets restless. ``I
probably sleep better when I'm playing,'' he said. ``If you really
mean it, that's your life, that's your love, that's your religion.
I mean, some people just start studying this thing, and that's a
little different. I do it the old-fashioned way.''

OREGON ADOPTEES GRANTED ACCESS TO BIRTH RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Kan., Tenn., Alaska, Del.)   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ More than 18 months after Oregon passed the nation's
first voter-approved law allowing all adult adoptees access to
their birth records, a Supreme Court justice ended an emotional
legal-appeals process Tuesday and cleared the way for the law to
take effect on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A group of birth mothers had sued to block the law, contending
that it would violate promises made years ago by adoption agencies
that their identity would never be revealed against their will to
the children they gave up for adoption. State officials announced
Tuesday that they would begin processing requests for birth
certificates from any adoptee 21 or older who was born in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Division said it had already received requests
from more than 2,200 adoptees for the records under a provision set
up by the law, known as Measure 58 and approved in November 1998.
But those applications have not been processed pending the outcome
of the challenge to the law, which was upheld earlier this year by
the state's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on Tuesday rejected an emergency
request to delay the records law from taking effect, and the state
said it would probably start mailing out copies of birth records by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, of course, adoptees and birth parents have sought
out each other, using one of a burgeoning number of registries and
Web sites that foster such reunions. But the Oregon case, by giving
adoptees absolute rights to their records even if birth mothers
never sought contact, set off a turbulent debate over whose rights
should take precedence.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees have cast access to their birth certificates as a right
that might answer basic questions about the circumstances of their
birth and perhaps the medical histories of their biological
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very mindful of their roots and where they came
from,'' said Berry Price, a 56-year-old machinist who, as an
adoptee, cheered O'Connor's action Tuesday. ``Bringing somebody
into the world without giving them some background on their
situation, their ethnic origin and so forth, I think that's wrong.
You have this hole in your background, and you feel a need to fill
it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Price knows that his birth mother may well be dead and that the
name on his birth certificate may be fictitious anyway.
Nonetheless, he has filed his application and is eagerly awaiting
word.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the debate, a group of six anonymous birth
mothers has fought vigorously against the law through their lawyer,
Franklin Hunsaker, of Portland, himself the father of five adopted
children.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsaker said Tuesday that his clients were ``extremely
disappointed, scared and even angry that their rights have been
ignored by voters and the courts.'' And he pleaded with adoptees to
respect the wishes of those biological mothers who have filed a
separate state form indicating that they do not wish to be
contacted. That request is not legally enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good reunion is one based on mutual consent, where
both sides want it to happen,'' Hunsaker said in a telephone
interview. ``So if there's a request there,'' he said, meaning a
preference not to be contacted, ``my clients would plead with adult
adoptees not to trample on their rights. Please honor it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McDermott, an adoptive father who is the lawyer for the
law's supporters, said he disagreed with the critics who said that
the law would set off a spate of incidents in which birth mothers
were contacted against their will, a prospect that one of the women
suing to block the law said had given her ``flashbacks and
nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said he believed that most adoptees would not pursue a
meeting if they knew that their biological parents did not wish to
meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would take a rather unusual adoptee to pursue
that,'' he said. ``Why would you go somewhere when you're told
you're not welcome?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the great majority of cases, biological parents
welcome such overtures. In Oregon, according to the most recent
records released by the Health Division, 40 birth parents have
filled out a form indicating that they desire contact from the
children they gave up for adoption, and 16 have requested no
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is unique in having a voter-passed initiative opening up
the birth records. But at least three other states (Tennessee,
Alaska and Delaware) have various provisions, either passed in the
legislature or mandated by the courts, allowing adoptees access to
their birth certificates. And Kansas has never had an explicit
prohibition against such access.
</P>
<P>
   Such records do not automatically enable an adoptee to find a
birth parent. In some cases, a birth mother managed to have her
name omitted from the birth certificate, and in other cases a name
alone is not enough information to allow the birth parent to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, where the courts found that birth mothers had no
constitutional right to keep their biological children's birth
certificates confidential, some of the anonymous mothers argued in
court papers that they were afraid that their husbands or children
might now discover long-guarded secrets that could cause severe
turmoil in their families. And lawyers for those opposing the law
said some mothers had been raped, and that a call from the person
who resulted from that crime would be traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   The birth mothers who brought the case have not been identified
publicly. One birth mother, named ``Mary,'' wrote in a letter to
The Oregonian earlier this year that she was horrified by the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, for $15, the state may simply hand over your identity to
the adult you placed for adoption as an infant 21-plus years ago,''
she wrote. ``In a few days, the very promises we built our lives
upon may be up for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But the law's supporters were jubilant, saying that it properly
extended to adoptees the right to gather information about the most
basic of questions: Where did they come from?

 &HT;    Time Warner: `We're committed to CNN'
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One thing won't change when Time Warner merges with
America Online: The marriage of old and new media will retain its
commitment to CNN and Atlanta, according to Ted Turner's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission in life is to preserve, protect and defend the
journalistic heritage of CNN,'' Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally committed to Atlanta,'' said Levin, who added
the merger will ``enhance the role of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin offered his reassurances Tuesday evening at Atlanta's
Centennial Olympic Park bash that kicked off the annual CNN World
Report Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who founded CNN, will remain influential in the new
company, Levin said, despite recent news reports that he feels like
he has been relegated to a back seat. ``He's not going to lose
control. ... He and I are still here,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner declined to say anything Tuesday about what role he
expects in the new company, but he said he's ``not worried about
the intermediate future of CNN. In the long term, anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, his bosses and many of his CNN employees have gathered
in Atlanta this week for the cable news network's annual conference
and its 20th anniversary, which is Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary will be marked by a huge invitation-only party
at Philips Arena with 15,000 guests, speeches, presentations and
rock music from Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is keyed to ``CNN World Report,'' a weekly show
in which international journalists affiliated with CNN file special
reports on their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, more than 300 journalists and TV executives
will hear from newsmakers including Vice President Al Gore, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Queen Noor of Jordan. They'll also
do a good bit of partying.
</P>
<P>
   Although the events are closed to the public, CNN has scheduled
two retrospectives on its 20 years, to air 9-11 p.m. Thursday and
Friday, hosted by Larry King.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Prosecution wants Lewis' limo driver back on stand
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Prosecutors want another shot at witness Duane
Fassett, the limousine driver who last week failed to say he saw
NFL star Ray Lewis deliver a blow in a fatal street fight.
</P>
<P>
   But a big question remains: Can they make him return?
</P>
<P>
   Fassett, a tortured soul during his court appearance, testified
he did not see Lewis hit one of the victims in the lower chest as
he had earlier told police. Also, Fassett backed off earlier
statements to police that he overheard Lewis' co-defendants,
Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of
Miami, admit to stabbing the victims.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard did not
follow proper procedures, and there may lie the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Howard hoped to introduce Fassett's incriminating statements
into evidence Tuesday through the testimony of a police detective
who was with Fassett when he made them. But Superior Court Judge
Alice D. Bonner refused to let that happen, saying Georgia law
requires prosecutors to first confront witnesses about inconsistent
statements. She noted Howard failed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the district attorney expressed
confidence that the Baltimore-area resident would return. ``I plan
on calling him,'' said Howard. ``He's still under subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard released Fassett from his subpoena in open court,
said Bruce Harvey, attorney for Oakley. ``Mr. Fassett is absolutely
under no obligation to reappear,'' Harvey contended.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Howard was on the phone to David Irwin, Fassett's
lawyer in Baltimore. Irwin said Howard wanted him to fly Fassett to
Atlanta Tuesday night. ``He's not going to like that,'' said Irwin,
who had yet to tell his client.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett can either return voluntarily or require prosecutors to
issue an interstate subpoena, which requires several steps. Also,
Fassett must be served the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``By recalling him, it tends to suggest that Howard does not
believe his own witnesses,'' said Dan Summer, a Gainesville
attorney. ``That would not look good to a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Fassett's re-appearance marked a day of
testimony from two limo passengers and two of the victims' friends.
One of the friends shot at the limo as it sped away from the scene
where Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, of Decatur were
stabbed to death Jan. 31 after a night of post-Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Sparks, a 24-year-old college student from Chicago,
buttressed prosecution contentions that Lewis led a cover-up after
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Lewis' hotel that night, Sparks said, she was a
passenger in a car where another limo passenger threw a bag in a
Dumpster behind a fast-food restaurant. She said the white hotel
laundry bag thrown into the trash was big enough to carry clothing,
supporting the prosecution's belief that Lewis was getting rid of
the blood-stained suit he wore that night.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks also testified that Jessica Robertson, who spent Super
Bowl weekend with Lewis and drove the car to the Dumpster,
destroyed a photo of the Lewis entourage taken that night at the
Cobalt nightclub. The photo would have allowed investigators
quickly identify those in the limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessica said she took it out of my purse,'' Sparks said. ``She
said she burned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks also said that she saw blood on the pants and shoes of
limo passenger Carlos Stafford, the man she saw dispose of the
laundry bag. Stafford has not been charged and is negotiating with
prosecutors for a grant of immunity in exchange for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Burros, an Akron, Ohio, native who grew up with the
victims, admitted to firing seven shots at the limo as it fled the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Burros testified he witnessed the fight from a distance and then
saw as many as 10 people run to the limo. He said he walked up, saw
Baker lying on the street and ran towards his GMC Yukon Denali
parked nearby. But a friend was already driving it toward the
scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burros said he grabbed his .45-caliber handgun from under a rear
seat and jogged up the street pumping off rounds. He said he only
tried to shoot the tires, which he did. In fact, Howard in his
opening arguments, credited Burros' action with allowing police to
identify the limo.
</P>
<P>
   However, defense attorneys repeatedly dwelled on the fact that
prosecutors have not charged Burros with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I would be dealt with at a later date,'' said
Burros, admitting he could be charged with aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, one of Oakley's two attorneys, pointed out a
contradiction in Burros' testimony. The lawyer noted that the
shell-casings from Burros' gun eject to the right. But the casings
were found around Baker and Lollar's bodies, to the left of and up
the hill from where Burros said he fired the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Tony Axam, one of Lewis' attorneys, got the 185-pound
Burros to say he had a 46-chest and 34-inch waist and could bench
press twice his weight. In previous testimony, a cabdriver said he
saw an athletically built man with a V-shaped build standing over
the bodies, angrily pointing at them.
</P>
<P>
   Axam then displayed a red leather jacket that Burros wore the
night of the killings. A woman who witnesses the fight from the
apartment window said the most ``ferocious'' of the attackers wore
a red jacket.

LOS ANGELES POLICE ARE SEEKING CLUES IN KILLING OF CHIEF'S
GRANDDAUGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Nev.) By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The police were searching for clues on Tuesday in
the fatal shooting of the police chief's granddaughter, who they
believe became the unintended victim of a gunman who fired into her
car at a drive-through restaurant on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know she was not the intended target,'' said Lt. Horace
Frank, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. ``She
just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bernard Parks' granddaughter, Lori Gonzalez, who would
have turned 21 next week, was shot about 10:15 p.m. on Sunday as
she and a male companion were leaving the restaurant at La Brea
Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard in the South-Central neighborhood of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, described as a heavy-set African-American in his
20s, approached the passenger side of the car as it slowed and
fired several shots into the car, the police said. The passenger
ducked and Gonzalez, who was driving, was struck several times, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were investigating whether the 20-year-old
passenger may have been the intended target. The identity of the
man was not made public. He was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   The police had no motive for the shooting, and continued to
interview the passenger on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jason Lee, a public information officer, said the police
were investigating the possibility that the shooting was gang
related.
</P>
<P>
   Several gangs operate in the area, Lee said, and drive-by
shootings have been a problem. He declined to say whether
Gonzalez's passenger was a gang member.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a gang problem, Lee said the crime rate in the
neighborhood had fallen about 30 percent over the last three years.
The neighborhood is a mix of commercial and residential buildings,
with numerous strip malls and middle- to lower-income residents.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities speculate that the gunman, who may have had a
grudge against Gonzalez's passenger, spotted him while they were at
Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the restaurant said there had been no problems in
recent years, although the restaurant was equipped with special
security devices, including a protective shield at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area that's had problems with criminal activities,''
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the neighborhood have expressed concerns about
drug dealers and gang problems.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and his wife, Bobbie, were in seclusion on Tuesday. They
have four children and several grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a student at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, was
in Los Angeles visiting her mother when the shooting occurred,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Joe Gonzalez, told The Los Angeles Times that he and
his wife had divorced 18 years ago. About two years ago, Gonzalez
moved to Mission Viejo to live with her father, and enrolled at
Saddleback College last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez described his daughter as ``wonderful with people and
full of life.'' She had worked as a clerk at a drugstore and as an
operator with Pacific Bell. She also taught Sunday school to third,
fourth and fifth graders and had recently gone to Tijuana, Mexico,
to build houses for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was said to go frequently to Los Angeles to visit her
mother and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The police on Tuesday were asking the public for assistance in
solving the killing, appealing to anyone who might have
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where we really need the public's help,''
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   If the authorities are correct in their assumption that the
passenger was the gunman's target, it will not be the first time a
relative of the police chief has been at risk because of a
passenger in the car.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, one of Park's daughters was charged with conspiracy to
sell cocaine and trafficking in cocaine in Clark County, Nev.,
after she gave a ride to a man and unknowingly became enmeshed in a
drug deal. The charges were dropped in October 1998 at the
prosecutor's request.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS INCREASING THEIR ACTIVITY FOR GORE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Environmental groups, worried that a Republican in
the White House would harm their cause, are stepping up their
campaign activity in favor of Al Gore and against George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the League of Conservation Voters became the first
major national environmental group to back Gore, during an event on
the banks of Lake Michigan in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it has not yet endorsed a presidential contender,
the Sierra Club is running television ads in a number of Midwestern
states featuring two Houston-area residents who criticize Texas
Gov. Bush's environmental record in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, who has long championed environmental
causes and wrote a 1992 book on the subject, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' clearly hopes that this issue will move voters,
particularly suburbanites concerned with sprawl and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Touting the record of the Clinton administration, Gore said,
``We have proven once and for all that pollution does not have to
be the price of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, however, accused environmental activists of
distorting the Texas governor's record.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett argued that the League of
Conservation Voters was biased because its president, Deb Callahan,
worked on Gore's unsuccessful 1988 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious where their loyalties lie and that is with Al
Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee Callahan introduced Gore by saying he had fought
for cleaner air, measures to combat global warming and expansion of
the federal park system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al Gore wins, the planet wins,'' said Callahan, who
dished out as much criticism of Bush as she did praise for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   She said that as Texas governor Bush has presided over a state
with some of the worst air, water and land pollution in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's friends are the biggest corporate polluters
and lobbyists for timber, mining and oil companies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan also claimed that ``under the Bush administration not
one single acre of land has been added to the state park system.
And Texas ranks 49th among the states in government spending to
support its parks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bartlett said that under the governor's watch 90,919 acres
have been added to the state park system. One of those additions
was a 40,000-acre donation in 1996 to the Chanati Mountain State
natural area in Presidio County in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said that the Legislature in 1999 approved a $16
million bond package that could be used for park land purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Loyless, the Conservation League's political director,
said that while the state may have received land donations, that is
not the same as the government budgeting for and actively pursuing
park expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does say something about how the state of Texas reacts
rather than advances public land acquisition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have a hard time selling his environmental credentials,
particularly with the media focus on Houston overtaking Los Angeles
as the city with the nation's worse ozone smog record last year. A
recent Pew Poll found that voters believed Gore would be better
than Bush in protecting the environment by a margin of 55 percent
to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even many environmentalists who do not believe the Clinton
administration has been as aggressive as it should have on a number
of their issues are wary of a Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been some dissension on the board of the Sierra
Club over whether to endorse Gore, the group's political director,
Dan Weiss, said that there is ``zero possibility'' that Bush would
receive the influential organization's backing.

U.S. RETREATS ON PERU VOTE; ASSESSMENT IS NOT `FINAL' 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration backed away Tuesday from
its own harsh assessment that the presidential runoff election on
Sunday in Peru was invalid. American officials privately voiced
misgivings over competing American priorities there.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department reiterated the administration's concern and
``regret'' that President Alberto Fujimori had decided to proceed
with the election despite allegations from international monitors
that its fairness could not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by reporters at the daily news briefing of the
department, a spokesman, Philip Reeker, refused several times to
endorse remarks by an unidentified department official who told
some of the same reporters on Monday that Fujimori's victory over
the opposition candidate, Alejandro Toledo, was a result of a
``flawed process'' and, therefore, illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The correct thing is to say that we haven't taken any steps or
made any final determinations,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   The backpedaling occurred as the Organization of American States
prepared to receive a report on Wednesday from the envoy it sent to
observe the election, Eduardo Stein, and to consider steps it might
take against Peru.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the move away from
confrontational language was merely a tactical retreat. Many OAS
members resent United States influence over the 34-nation
organization and fear that perceived efforts by Washington to run
their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the administration remained convinced that
Fujimori's re-election, for his third five-year term, was not
legitimate. But he said the remarks by the official on Monday had
not been adequately examined by her superiors because of the
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the countries in the region recoiled from that
marker,'' the senior official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is prepared to acknowledge an interruption of
democratic government in Peru and will support a call by the
Organization of American States for an emergency meeting of its
foreign ministers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials in various U.S. agencies said Tuesday that they
were largely torn over how to respond to the events in Peru. For
all his autocratic tendencies, the officials conceded, Fujimori has
managed to bring a measure of peace and prosperity to the country,
enjoys considerable popular support and has been a stalwart in
Washington's largely futile battle against drug producers.
</P>
<P>
   Branding him an undemocratic usurper could force action that
would undermine hard-won American progress in an increasingly
troubled region, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An American official who follows the U.S. drug strategy in Peru
said some administration policymakers awoke Tuesday with
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a jilted lover,'' the official said. ``You
wake up the next morning and say, `Oh no, I'm going to have to give
away this and that.' Peru is such a pivotal country for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Andes, the official noted, the administration
faces crises. Colombia, the chief drug exporter, has ceded ground
to guerrilla bandits, and an American aid package for Bogota is
bogged down in Congress. Ecuador is emerging from its own
constitutional crisis, and Venezuela is increasingly under the
personal control of Hugo Chavez, a military leader who was elected
to the presidency after having led a failed coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kissing off Fujimori in any time frame is bad,'' the official
said. ``At this moment, it's particularly acute. We have ulcers
over what's happening in Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   The agenda for Peru appears to leave administration officials at
odds over priorities, said Cynthia McClintock, a political science
professor at George Washington University who is writing a book on
U.S. relations with Peru in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In its advocacy for democratic integrity, she said, ``the State
Department is left competing against three important agencies'' _
the CIA, the Pentagon and the office of the White House drug policy
adviser, Barry R. McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior administration official insisted Tuesday that
``there is no trade off,'' and that The United States will insist
on fair elections both because it is good for Peru and because it
will ``strengthen the hemispheric commitment to democratic
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the OAS said Fujimori is largely unimpressed
by international criticism and would not likely respond to words
not backed by deeds. ``He's going to try to tough this one out,'' a
longtime official said.

CHANGING THE WORLD, ONE ENDLESS DANCE AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By DAVID BAHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, the director Jon Reiss could not have cared less
about raves. As far as he was concerned, they involved nothing but
hordes of teen-agers, psychedelic drugs and mindlessly repetitive
techno music.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just blew me away,'' recalls Reiss, 35. ``The hair on the
back of my neck was standing up. The music and collective energy
brought me to this spiritual level that I had only experienced
while meditating. I knew I had to learn what made it tick.''
</P>
<P>
   So he set out to make a documentary about the phenomenon,
``Better Living Through Circuitry,'' one of three new films, along
with the recently released ``Human Traffic'' and ``Groove'' (which
opens Friday, to celebrate the rave scene. As Greg Harrison, the
director of ``Groove,'' says, ``Rave serves a powerful purpose in
the modern Western world because those kinds of communal, cathartic
experiences based on music have been factored out, or at least
commodified, in our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rave itself began in England during the late 1980s, when
rebellious youths took over abandoned warehouses, consumed
hallucinogens and danced to live DJs into the morning hours. It was
not until the early 1990s that these events made it to this
country, much to the dismay of narcotics enforcement officials and
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, in movies like ``Trainspotting'' (1996) and last
year's ``Go,'' rave culture has been presented as little more than
a backdrop for misery and death. But for this most recent crop of
rave moviemakers, the films are an attempt to dispel misconceptions
and portray the subculture in all its blissed-out, trippy glee.
``For the most part, raves have been unjustly vilified by the
media,'' Harrison says. ``With `Groove,' I wanted to portray the
positive aspects and optimism that underlies the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   That optimism, vibrantly apparent in all three films, stems from
ravers' faith in music and dance as regenerative, liberating
forces. Unlike the aggressive and nihilistic currents that ran
through the punk rock scene, rave, as the documentary ``Better
Living Through Circuitry'' (which opened May 12) portrays it,
cultivates a life-affirming attitude and socially productive
spirit. In fact, for the technologically savvy and musically
innovative, it provides a vast outlet: participants communicate and
network over the Internet (since the locations of underground
events are ever-changing), designing cutting-edge graphics and,
perhaps most intriguingly, composing and generating electronic
dance music.
</P>
<P>
   ``DJs have replaced rock stars in our world,'' says Justin
Kerrigan, the 25-year-old British director of ``Human Traffic'' and
an outspoken rave devotee. ``The freshest tracks around come from
DJ's and kids playing around on their bedroom computers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reiss, what is most impressive about rave culture are its
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I found amazing is that they share the same
fundamental values that I have but thought were gone,'' he says.
``And that is the notion that if society doesn't offer the avenue
you want, to go out and create it yourself. Here are people with a
view of the world where money isn't the be-all and end-all of
everything. People are drawn into raving because of the
transformative effect of the experience, not just materially, but
spiritually, psychically. And there's something about that
collective purpose that gives it an additional dimension, a
communal energy if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   As Reiss' compelling documentary shows, rave is open to anyone
regardless of race, sexual orientation or age (though participants
tend be well under 30), and it's that inclusiveness that attracts
revelers _ many of them outsiders who feel uncomfortable at other
social and athletic events. Reiss spoke with scores of DJs,
musicians, promoters and fans, accumulating over 200 hours of
interviews before editing the film down to a richly packed 88
minutes. What emerges is a self-determined community dedicated to
creative expression and personal freedom, of which drugs are not
necessarily an integral part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that drugs are not important to a lot of people who
have kept the culture going,'' says Stuart Swezey, who produced
``Better Living Through Circuitry'' with Brian McNelis. ``Certainly
drugs can be a transporting experience, but there are many ravers
that have never taken them and those who still rave that have grown
out of them. And that's one of the reasons we put off addressing
the issue until halfway through the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Swezey does not dispute the indelible imprint of
drugs, particularly Ecstasy and acid, on the rave scene, something
all three films boldly reflect. Both ``Human Traffic'' and
``Groove'' portray drugs with such cozy familiarity that their
presence is merely taken for granted. The skimpy plot of the
infectiously energetic ``Human Traffic'' involves a group of
British friends living for the weekend so they can pop Ecstasy,
dance and forget their problems.
</P>
<P>
   The more substantive and equally entertaining ``Groove'' weaves
together several drug-related story lines. The central one involves
an uptight writer named David (Hamish Linklater) whose first
rave-Ecstasy experience teaches him a lesson in liberation. Along
the way, he falls for the lost and jaded Leyla (Lola Glaudini), a
perpetual party-goer unable to escape the scene. Strategically,
however, no one dies in either film.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no overdoses or shootouts in my film,'' says
Harrison, who, like Kerrigan, refused to cave in to early pressures
by film company executives to inject a little death and gunfire
into the plot. ``The darkness in my film is more realistic and
pervasive in that it deals with getting trapped in the scene. Yes,
rave can be an epiphany that changes the way you see your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it can also be a trap, as it is for Leyla, sucking you
into a false sense of happiness and well-being if you're unwilling
to examine your life as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   By acknowledging a wider range of rave experience as well as the
limits of its liberation, ``Groove'' has greater emotional
resonance than the frenetic, cartoonish ``Human Traffic.'' But in
the end, even ``Groove'' is too much of a tidy crowd-pleaser to
satisfactorily explore the various motivations behind recreational
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what all three films do successfully convey is the
passion and primal power surrounding communal dance. As McNelis
notes, drugs are not the focus of raves; collective transcendence
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our film is not about telling people to attend these events to
do drugs,'' he says. ``If anything, it reveals a world that
encourages them to attend these events to dance, sweat, let go,
and, if you want, experience some kind of enlightenment.''

(Editors: Capitalized NO in 6th graf from end is cq.) 
 By WENDY PERRON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From opposite ends of the dance universe come two
superstars: Mikhail Baryshnikov and Yvonne Rainer. He from the
purest centuries-old classical tradition, she from the
rule-breaking Judson Dance Theater of the 1960s. He the prince of
Russian ballet; she the high priestess of the American avant-garde.
He known for his natural theatricality, she for her resistance to
anything theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   They are rehearsing together for a season of the White Oak Dance
Project, of which Baryshnikov is founder and director as well as
lead performer, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from June 7 to 11.
In addition to a new work by Rainer, there will be premieres by
Mark Morris and John Jasperse and Trisha Brown's ``Glacial Decoy''
(1979). How did it happen that Baryshnikov asked Rainer, who had
not choreographed a dance in decades, to contribute to this
program?
</P>
<P>
   In the last 25 years Baryshnikov has journeyed deep into the
repertory of American modern dance, while Rainer, in the last year,
has returned to the dance studio after 25 years as a noted feminist
filmmaker. Since its inception in 1990, White Oak has commissioned
40 new dances from modern choreographers, starting with its initial
resident choreographer, Mark Morris, and on through Lar Lubovitch,
Maurice Bejart, Kevin O'Day, Neil Greenberg and Lucy Guerin.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Baryshnikov, 52, came to Judson Memorial Church in
Greenwich Village when Rainer, 65, danced in a new version of her
seminal ``Trio A'' (1966), a five-minute continuous phrase in which
the dancers never look out at the audience. Planning a program for
this fall featuring choreographers from Judson Dance Theater,
legendary as the incubator of postmodern dance, Baryshnikov invited
Rainer to choreograph something.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to see White Oak and met him, I was surprised and
pleased that he was familiar with the titles and the personnel of
my past work,'' Rainer said recently during a rehearsal at the
Trisha Brown Studio near Columbus Circle in Manhattan. ``He'd done
his homework. I said I could give him `Trio A' and `We shall Run'
(1963). Then he said, `Maybe you'd like to do a new piece.' I
gulped. And then it began to obsess me. What would I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Separated by a quarter-century from her work in dance, she went
home and riffled through her book ``Work: 1961-1973'' to gather
bits and pieces from her past artistic life that could be
rearranged. Harking back to the Dadaist method of fragmentation,
Rainer chose a collage structure to contain the selections. Like
much of her work in both dance and film, the ideas and images are
presented not in a beginning-middle-and-end format, but in a series
of radical juxtapositions of tasks, interactions and spoken texts.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients for this collage, titled ``After Many a Summer Dies
the Swan,'' are drawn from ``Three Satie Spoons'' (1960), ``The
Bells'' (1961), ``The Mind Is a Muscle'' (1968) and ``Continuous
Project _ Altered Daily'' (1970). Actions may be simultaneous,
deflecting attention from one another, or sequential. One section,
in which dancers cushion one another's movements with pillows, has
a goofy precision.
</P>
<P>
   In another, two women link arms around each other's waists as
they repeatedly melt to the floor and rise, still attached. They
are reciting, in falsetto, a Gertrude Stein-ish bit of text by
Rainer: ``That was so lovely.'' ``Yes yes that was so lovely.''
``It was so lovely it will make me think about it a lot.'' ``In
fact we will write about all that thinking,'' and so on. Rainer
advises audience members: ``You kind of roll with the different
elements that keep coming to the surface and disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Rainer and Baryshnikov in a studio together makes perfect
sense. Both have short spiky hair, long torsos and arms, boyish
bodies. When they kissed each other hello they seemed to be exactly
the same height, and their rehearsal demeanor has a similar balance
of readiness and calm. They understand each other's physicality,
and more, they seem to understand each other's state of mind.
Rainer said, ``He has this restless intellect that's led him into
this '60s corner of dancing.'' He affectionately called her a
``professional revolutionary,'' and added, ``It's fun to see such
passion in her.''
</P>
<P>
   While rehearsing the group sections, the six White Oak dancers _
besides Baryshnikov, they are Raquel Aedo, Emily Coates, Roselynde
LeBlanc, Michael Lomeka and Emmanuele Phuon have vivid
personalities and dance technique to burn, but Baryshnikov shows
slightly more relish for the movement than the younger performers
do.
</P>
<P>
   A high point of the piece is sure to be ``Valda's Solo,''
originally from Rainer's first film, ``Lives of Performers''
(1972). Here, it reveals Baryshnikov in a different mood. He wears
a velvet gown, and lets a red ball roll off his hand and drop to
the floor. Not much happens, but it's riveting. While the dancer
and actor Valda Setterfield looked elegant and aristocratic in the
film, Baryshnikov looks lonely and pensive, creating an aura of
melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   Far in the pasts of both Rainer and Baryshnikov are precursors
to this collaboration. Baryshnikov started dancing with modern
dance choreographers soon after he defected from the Soviet Union
in 1974, including Twyla Tharp, Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham, Paul
Taylor, Erick Hawkins and Merce Cunningham. Even earlier, during
his last year in St. Petersburg, he presented a program in which he
chose and danced in works by experimental choreographers, including
Mai Murdmaa from Estonia. She had him rolling on the floor _ quite
simple and grounded compared to what his audience expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer and ballet critic Nina Alovert recently said:
``From the beginning, he wanted to do contemporary dance. He tried
to do every way of ballet which we've had in Russia. In 1971 he
danced in `Creation of the World' by Natalia Kasatkina. It was
everything not classical. It combined knees turned in and knees
turned out. He danced it like a god.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainer remembers seeing Alicia Markova dance ``Giselle'' in the
late 1950s. ``She was the only dancer I have ever waited for at the
stage door,'' Rainer said. ``I was totally transported.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later, one of the many bits in ``The Mind Is a Muscle'' was
something she called the ``Nijinsky pose.'' In the new piece, she
extends the cushion section with a kind of classical pas de deux
with Coates, the most obviously balletic of the White Oak women,
partnered by Baryshnikov with pillows. She is using their
virtuosity as a ``found object,'' in almost the same way visual
artists like Robert Rauschenberg did in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov traces his interest in Judson Dance Theater back to
David Gordon, whom he invited to choreograph for American Ballet
Theater when he was its artistic director. Gordon created ``Field,
Chair and Mountain'' (1986), in which Martine van Hamel was
promenaded on point on top of a metal folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said of Baryshnikov's being drawn to this experimental
work: ``His attraction is to dance with integrity. He's willing to
back up his own taste and intuitions. He refuses to stay in the
past. He takes other people's past and tries it on; he's an
inquisitive guy.'' The choregrapher Trisha Brown has called
Baryshnikov ``a questing spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   His quest, at this point, is partly a search for what sits
comfortably in the mind as well as on the body of a no-longer-young
dancer who wants to keep dancing. Two years ago, Baryshnikov told
Laura Shapiro of Newsweek: ``I've gotten into minimalism in my
dancing. In the first part of life you accumulate experience, and
then at the end you try to get rid of what's not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainer started getting rid of the extras early on. In fact, it
was her modus operandi as a dance minimalist. After working on
``Parts of Some Sextets,'' she wrote the now-famous manifesto, ``NO
to spectacle no to virtuosity no to transformations and magic and
make-believe no to the glamour and transcendency of the star image
no to the heroic ...,'' first published in 1965 in The Drama
Review. But in the new piece, she uses not only Baryshnikov's
heroic image, but also a new text about transformation _ an essay
by Vladimir Nabokov about a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of her manifesto, Rainer now says, ``One of the
functions of a manifesto is to clear the air, to start over or
re-examine expectations.'' Here, Rainer and Baryshnikov join
together in the postmodern project of re-examining, reconstructing,
reanalyzing and representing. He is re-examining his role(s) in the
dance world and she is reconstructing and rearranging her works
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   For Rainer, the challenge is to bring her quotidian, tasklike
dances onto a proscenium stage.
</P>
<P>
   One of her few forays into such a situation was at the Billy
Rose Theater on Broadway in 1969, when the producer Charles
Reinhardt invited several young, unorthodox choreographers to
perform, including Twyla Tharp, Meredith Monk and Rainer. Pat
Catterson, new in New York at the time, remembers the effect that
Rainer's ``Rose Fractions'' had on her: ``I'd never seen anything
like it. It was in that anything-can-follow-anything mode. In one
part, Yvonne did Lenny Bruce's monologue on snot. In another part,
dancers and nondancers were doing `Trio A.' It was unpretentious,
accessible, egalitarian and totally of the moment. They ended by
doing it to the Chambers Brothers' `In the Midnight Hour,' and the
audience was on its feet hooting and howling. We all felt like we
wanted to do that. After it was over, some audience members went
right up on the stage and did it. When I got home, I did all the
moves I could remember from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainer is enjoying her return to the dance world: ``I love
working with dancers. I've never been entirely comfortable as a
filmmaker because I never shot my own film. I'm a techno-idiot, so
much of it is out of my control. Here I feel like I'm back where I
belong. It's like coming home, at least temporarily.'' She has the
utmost regard for Baryshnikov's choice to delve into dances of the
rebellious '60s. ``It's unprecedented for a classical dancer to do
this,'' she said. ``And he's pulling in an audience that, in many
cases, is unfamiliar with that history. So in that sense he is a
revitalizing force in the dance world.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month while on tour, after two standing-room-only
performances by White Oak in Clearwater, Fla., Rainer faxed this
report: ``The first night we softened them up. Misha introduced me
and I basically told them not to worry. They laughed at everything.
The second night: no introduction, much more subdued response
during the piece, but at the end, a combination of standing ovation
and boos.''

   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton on Tuesday became the first
president to visit Portugal since Ronald Reagan in 1985, and as
Clinton opened his last scheduled trip to Europe as president, he
found himself confronting the same major issues that Reagan faced _
trade disputes and missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   While Reagan supported a space-based missile defense system
known as Star Wars, Clinton will be pushing his own plan to deploy
a limited missile defense system, if he can reach agreement on
modifying the 28-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As they had done for days leading up to the trip, aides to
Clinton stressed again Tuesday that they did not expect him to
reach any concrete agreements, as Reagan also failed to do 15 years
ago. But in contrast to the significant anti-American
demonstrations that Reagan received, only one ``Clinton Go Home''
slogan was seen Tuesday on a wall in Lisbon.

   An article Tuesday in the left-of-center daily Publico
underscored the difficulty Clinton faces in selling his missile
defense initiative _ not only to Russia but also to the rest of the
world. The newspaper compared Clinton's dilemma to that of Reagan
on ``Star Wars,'' saying Clinton will ``have to persuade his
European partners that the new American anti-missile defense system
that the U.S. wants to develop can bring advantages to European
security and world peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a difficult task,'' the article continued,
``especially for a president at the end of his career, in the face
of negative reaction already expressed in most European capitals.
Europe is afraid that this initiative, a `soft' version of Ronald
Reagan `Star Wars' in the '80s, will end up triggering a new arms
race, alienating Russia and feeding Beijing's nuclear ambitions.''

   Few people turned out to see Clinton on Tuesday. But the
president still found that the opening day of his weeklong trip to
Europe was full of mutual praise and old-fashioned sightseeing, and
his day of meetings with a close ally was relatively free of
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reinforced just how enjoyable a day it had been, saying
in a toast to Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, at a state
dinner Tuesday night: ``It has been a pleasure for me to spend time
with another president who likes to read detective novels, listen
to good music and play golf. We could have had a two-day summit on
those three topics alone.''
</P>
<P>
   From here Clinton will travel to Berlin, to Moscow _ where he
will have his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin _
and finally to Kiev, Ukraine. While in Berlin, he will also meet
privately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who will be
attending a political conference along with Clinton and other
leaders. The two leaders are expected to discuss Israel's
withdrawal from southern Lebanon last week and the status of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Welcoming Clinton to Portugal on Tuesday, Sampaio said: ``It was
from here five centuries ago that the Portuguese navigators _ who
explored the Atlantic coast of Africa, discovered the maritime
route to India, found Brazil and circumnavigated the earth _ set
sail. Our increasingly globalized world owes a lot to their
deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton echoed Sampaio's words, saying, ``Here at this historic
point of embarkation, from which Portuguese explorers led an entire
continent to see beyond the horizon, we find ourselves again, as
you said, Mr. President, on a new voyage of discovery.''
</P>

<P>
   The two men stood together at the sun-bleached limestone
16th-century Belem Tower at the entrance to Lisbon's harbor, where
Portuguese frigates honored Clinton with a 21-gun salute. The two
presidents reviewed an honor guard of paratroopers in fatigues,
white gloves and purple ascots who are headed to East Timor as part
of a United Nations peacekeeping force. Portugal asserted residual
rights over East Timor, which is now moving toward independence,
for more than two decades after the territory was seized by
Indonesia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that this nation is proud of those troops and their
mission, and on behalf of the American people, I thank you for
it,'' Clinton told Sampaio.
</P>
<P>
   From there, a cavalry regiment of musicians on horseback led
Clinton's motorcade to the Jeronimos Monastery in the town of
Belem. There, he laid a wreath at the carved tomb of poet Luis
Camoes and spent half an hour touring the 16th-century structure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a tour of the interactive Knowledge Science Center,
Clinton told scientists and researchers, ``I have just had a lot of
fun.'' He also praised what he called cutting-edge research across
national boundaries on diseases like AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis. ``These diseases can ruin economies and threaten the
very survival of societies,'' said Clinton, whose administration
has elevated issues like disease to the top of the national
security agenda.

<P>
   On Wednesday, at the 17th-century Queluz Palace outside Lisbon,
Clinton will meet with the European Commission's president, Romano
Prodi, and Portugal's prime minister, Antonio Guterres. Portugal
currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the 15-nation European Union are locked in
complicated disputes over European restrictions on the importation
of bananas, U.S. beef and genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the European Union objects to a sales tax
break that the United Sates grants to major corporations that set
up operations in offshore tax havens like the Virgin Islands and
Barbados. Those companies are not required to pay U.S. sales tax
and duties on their exports, which the European Union argues is a
form of subsidy that will amount to about $25 billion to U.S.
companies over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Clinton will attend a meeting with leaders of more
than a dozen other countries on ``third way'' politics hosted by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The approach, also described as
``progressive governance,'' explores a middle ground between
traditional forms of socialism and capitalism.

   In Aachen, Germany, on Friday, Clinton will be awarded the
International Charlemagne Prize, presented annually to a person who
has worked toward European unity. Other recipients of the award
have been Winston S. Churchill and Francois Mitterrand. The only
Americans to have received the award have been George C. Marshall,
author of America's plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, and
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, Clinton will be in Moscow for his first
summit meeting with Putin. Samuel R. Berger, the national security
adviser, told reporters last week that the visit would produce no
breakthroughs in arms control or Russia's objections to a U.S.
missile defense plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will address the Russian Parliament, the
first U.S. president to do so. Later that day, he will travel to
Ukraine for a meeting with President Leonid Kuchma before heading
home to Washington that night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton has less than eight months left as president, but in
some quarters he is already being talked about in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's article in Publico, the Portuguese daily, said of his
visit: ``On the other side of the Atlantic, he is looked as if he
already belonged to the past. In Europe, he is being given the
prize to those who have aided the European cause. Bill Clinton was
a good president to Europe.'' The article was titled, ``Clinton
Says Goodbye to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   And Portugal's leading tabloid newspaper, Correio da Manha,
focused on Clinton's enormous $4,000-a-night suite at the Dom Pedro
Hotel. Situated on the top floor, it has, the newspaper said, a
panoramic view of the capital, ``a private elevator for security,
luxury furniture, original works of art, a spacious hall, tropical
plants, a bar, a winter garden and a private terrace of 160 square
meters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also has a private dining room for 12 people, with a
terrace of 60 square meters, connected to a fully equipped
kitchen,'' it continued. ``The suite has two more rooms, the bigger
of which looks out to a natural solarium. There is a dressing room
and a marble bathroom connected to this room, as well as panoramic
vistas over Lisbon, a sauna, a Jacuzzi with hydro massage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the state dinner Tuesday night, Clinton was serenaded by
Mafalda Arnauth, Portugal's hottest young fado singer. Fado is
melancholic Portuguese music played with string instruments and
built around the concept of saudades, the yearning for a past that
was better and may never return.

   The Federal Communications Commission proposed easing several
decades-old regulations on broadcasters, including one that
prevents companies from owning a broadcast station and newspaper in
the same city and another prohibiting a company from owning more
than one national television network. The proposals may
significantly affect several pending and recently completed
mergers. Existing rules would have required significant
divestitures after Viacom's acquisition of CBS and the Tribune

United's parent, UAL, if it breached the contract, while UAL would
be forced to pay $50 million to US Airways if it got cold feet. In
addition, either company can terminate the agreement if the merger
is not completed by Dec. 31. Shares of US Airways rose 6.25 cents,
to $43.625, while UAL fell 81.25 cents, to $51.9375.

OREGON ADOPTEES GRANTED ACCESS TO BIRTH RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Kan., Tenn., Alaska, Del.)   (Eds: CORRECTS in lede, law took effect Tuesday afternoon.) 
By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ More than 18 months after Oregon passed the nation's
first voter-approved law allowing all adult adoptees access to
their birth records, a Supreme Court justice ended an emotional
legal-appeals process Tuesday and cleared the way for the law to
take effect Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A group of birth mothers had sued to block the law, contending
that it would violate promises made years ago by adoption agencies
that their identity would never be revealed against their will to
the children they had given up for adoption. State officials
announced Tuesday that they would begin processing requests for
birth certificates from any adoptee 21 or older who was born in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Division said it had already received requests
from more than 2,200 adoptees for the records under a provision set
up by the law, Measure 58, which was approved in November 1998. But
those applications have not been processed pending the outcome of
the challenge to the law, which was upheld earlier this year by the
state's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on Tuesday rejected an emergency
request to delay the records law from taking effect, and the state
said it would probably start mailing out copies of birth records by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, of course, adoptees and birth parents have sought
out each other, using one of a growing number of registries and Web
sites that foster such reunions. But the Oregon case, by giving
adoptees absolute rights to their records even if birth mothers
never sought contact, set off a turbulent debate over whose rights
should take precedence.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees have cast access to their birth certificates as a right
that might answer basic questions about the circumstances of their
birth and perhaps the medical histories of their biological
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very mindful of their roots and where they came
from,'' said Berry Price, a 56-year-old machinist who, as an
adoptee, cheered O'Connor's action Tuesday. ``Bringing somebody
into the world without giving them some background on their
situation, their ethnic origin and so forth, I think that's wrong.
You have this hole in your background, and you feel a need to fill
it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Price knows that his birth mother may well be dead and that the
name on his birth certificate may be fictitious anyway.
Nonetheless, he has filed his application and is eagerly awaiting
word.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the debate, a group of six anonymous birth
mothers has fought vigorously against the law through their lawyer,
Franklin Hunsaker, of Portland, himself the father of five adopted
children.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsaker said Tuesday that his clients were ``extremely
disappointed, scared and even angry that their rights have been
ignored by voters and the courts.'' And he pleaded with adoptees to
respect the wishes of those biological mothers who have filed a
separate state form indicating that they do not wish to be
contacted. That request is not legally enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good reunion is one based on mutual consent, where
both sides want it to happen,'' Hunsaker said in a telephone
interview. ``So if there's a request there,'' he said, meaning a
preference not to be contacted, ``my clients would plead with adult
adoptees not to trample on their rights. Please honor it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McDermott, an adoptive father who is the lawyer for the
law's supporters, said he disagreed with the critics who said the
law would set off a spate of incidents in which birth mothers were
contacted against their will, a prospect that one of the women
suing to block the law said had given her ``flashbacks and
nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said he believed most adoptees would not pursue a
meeting if they knew that their biological parents did not wish to
meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would take a rather unusual adoptee to pursue
that,'' he said. ``Why would you go somewhere when you're told
you're not welcome?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the great majority of cases, biological parents
welcome such overtures. In Oregon, according to the most recent
records released by the Health Division, 40 birth parents have
filled out a form indicating that they desire contact from the
children they gave up for adoption, and 16 have requested no
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is unique in having a voter-passed initiative opening up
the birth records. But at least three other states (Tennessee,
Alaska and Delaware) have various provisions, either passed in the
legislature or mandated by the courts, allowing adoptees access to
their birth certificates. And Kansas has never had an explicit
prohibition against such access.
</P>
<P>
   Such records do not automatically enable an adoptee to find a
birth parent. In some cases, birth mothers manage to have their
names omitted from the birth certificate, and in other cases a name
alone would not be enough information to allow the birth parent to
be found.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, where the courts found that birth mothers had no
constitutional right to keep their biological children's birth
certificates confidential, some of the anonymous mothers argued in
court papers that they were afraid that their husbands or children
might now discover long-guarded secrets that could cause severe
turmoil in their families. And lawyers for those opposing the law
said some mothers had been raped, and that a call from the person
who resulted from that crime would be traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   The birth mothers who brought the case have not been identified
publicly. One, named ``Mary,'' wrote in a letter to The Oregonian
earlier this year that she was horrified by the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, for $15, the state may simply hand over your identity to
the adult you placed for adoption as an infant 21-plus years ago,''
she wrote. ``In a few days, the very promises we built our lives
upon may be up for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But the law's supporters were jubilant, saying it properly
extended to adoptees the right to gather information about the most
basic of questions: Where did they come from?

MICROSOFT JUDGE SHOULD CONSIDER CONSUMERS' BEST INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Regardless of how anyone feels about Microsoft, it's
becoming increasingly difficult to see how the presiding judge's
approach to restructuring the company will help consumers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts raise a compelling question: If antitrust law's
purpose is to protect consumers, why is Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson seeking a remedy that may harm rather than help consumer
interests? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Justice Department trustbusters recommended splitting
Microsoft into two companies, the judge counterproposed a three-way
split. Justice's lead attorney David Boies, however, responded that
this would be time-consuming and have ``disruptive effects,'' not
only on Microsoft, but also on the entire software industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when Justice initially responded to Jackson's finding that
Microsoft was guilty of monopolizing the operating-system market,
its remedy of splitting the company in two was met with skepticism.
Critics generally claimed a breakup wouldn't heighten competition
in ways that could be expected to benefit consumers. Instead, the
resulting competition between two or three separate companies
probably would lead to higher prices by ending the cross-subsidies
of some products Microsoft employs to sell other products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, says New York University economist Nicholas
Economides, a separate browser company would have to charge for its
product, which Microsoft currently doesn't do. This would make
Internet access more expensive, he contended in a recent analysis
in The Wall Street Journal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the operational context, Economides predicts a period of
difficulty in the aftermath of any breakup. Each ``Baby Bill,'' as
the proposed new companies are characterized, would produce
separate versions of Windows, which probably wouldn't be
compatible. Information technology managers thus would be forced to
go through a long period of adjusting and readjusting until one new
operating system became dominant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another curious aspect of the Microsoft case is Jackson's
apparent desire to get it over with as soon as possible. While
nobody likes to see legal action drag on interminably, the target
is one of the most important components of the economy. If mistakes
are made in haste that have long-range debilitating results for
this critical industry, it could be to the economic detriment of
all Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seems a reasonable expectation for the presiding
judge to acknowledge his limitations in this matter. Jackson is far
from being an expert in information technology matters, and may be
relying on old-economy instincts ill-suited to dealing with
new-economy problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economides points out that some observers favor a Microsoft
breakup based on the declining price of long-distance calls after
AT&AMP;T's dismantling. It's not a good analogy, he says, because the
various components of ``the old Ma Bell empire'' were separate
entities with plenty of managers to oversee the restructuring.
Microsoft, on the other hand, is an integrated company with fewer
than a couple of dozen senior executives. So the talent pool
wouldn't be sufficient to man the new companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the NYU prof admonishes, it would be good for those involved
in deciding Microsoft's fate to remember whose interests they're
supposed to be serving. &QL;

GREEN, NATURAL LAW PARTIES MOVE CLOSER TO TEXAS BALLOT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Two alternative political parties met a Tuesday
deadline for delivering petitions to Texas election officials in a
bid for space on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party of Texas collected an estimated 74,000
signatures, and the Natural Law Party of Texas said it collected
about 76,000.
</P>
<P>
   To get their candidates on the ballot, the parties had to
collect 37,380 signatures from registered voters who did not
participate in this year's Democratic or Republican party
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sandage, a Houston mediator and Green Party candidate for
U.S. Senate, said his party's apparent success in gathering
signatures is evidence of the desire among voters for political
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message is that the two big parties are merely
ding and dong, and voters need a third choice,'' Sandage said. ``I
really think the desire for a third-party alternative, more than
our party's environmental issues, got me more signatures than
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Nickless, assistant director of elections in the Texas
secretary of state's office, said it could take all summer to
verify the two parties' petitions.
</P>
<P>
   If enough signatures are validated, the parties will appear on
the Texas ballot with the Democratic and Republican parties, plus
the Libertarian Party.
</P>
<P>
   Libertarians won automatic ballot access without petitioning
this year, after one of their statewide candidates in 1998 won more
than 5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Less successful in their petition efforts this year were the
Reform Party of Texas and the Constitution Party of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution Party submitted only about 2,500 signatures, in
part to protest what organizers claim is the two-party system's
dominance of the election process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to demonstrate to the Legislature how impossible it is
to get on the ballot in this state,'' said Jim Wade, state chairman
of the Constitution Party. ``It's ridiculous, it's Draconian.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, Reform Party members alerted state election
officials that the party would not be submitting petitions to
appear on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which grew from 1992's United We Stand effort
launched by Dallas billionaire Ross Perot, was unable to fulfill an
ambitious plan to collect signatures in Texas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many party activists have blamed Pat Buchanan, a presidential
contender who bolted the Republican Party for the Reform Party last
year, with helping to derail the party's statewide efforts.
</P>
<P>
   To secure his own place on the Texas ballot, Buchanan in early
May submitted his own petitions as an independent candidate,
calling it ``insurance'' in case the Reform Party failed in its
statewide efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he will seek the party's presidential nomination
at its convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party, meanwhile, is fielding four candidates for
statewide office in Texas, including Sandage, who is challenging
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party presidential nominee is expected to be national
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Law Party is fielding 31 candidates in Texas. The
party's presidential nominee is likely to be John Hagelin, who also
is seeking the Reform Party's nomination.
</P>

   Kingsley Brooks, who is stepping down as Natural Law Party
chairman to run Hagelin's campaign, said getting on the ballot in a
large state like Texas is central to building credibility for
alternative political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real desire out there for something other than the
same old, same old,'' Brooks said. ``Voters feel that democracy has
been stolen from them. I think people really want to take it back,
and there is a huge voice out there crying to be heard.'' &QL;

LAMAR HUNT JR. SETTLES ASSAULT LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   DALLAS _ As potential jurors waited to be picked Tuesday
morning, Lamar Hunt Jr. settled a civil lawsuit that alleged he
sexually assaulted his mentally disabled sister-in-law on three
evenings in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County District Judge John McClellan Marshall ruled that
provisions of the settlement were confidential. He instructed
lawyers not to discuss its details.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt Jr., 43, son of Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and
owner of a 20 percent share of the Chiefs, attended a closed
hearing on the settlement. He slipped out a side door at its
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   He was not charged criminally for the episodes alleged in the
civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going home,'' his lawyer, Donald H. Flanary, said after
the hearing, declining further comment on the case. Hunt Jr. now
lives in a Dallas suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Baldwin, a lawyer representing Judy Fitzpatrick, Hunt Jr.'s
sister-in-law, would speak only generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy Fitzpatrick is very happy and pleased to have this whole
torrid story behind her so she can pick up the pieces of her
life,'' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, 42, declined to comment as she left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   According to her lawsuit, Fitzpatrick has been diagnosed with
``severe learning disabilities, cognitive deficits and social
deficiencies.'' Baldwin said she now lived with family members in
Pennsylvania and worked in a cannery.
</P>
<P>
   A former Kansas City resident, Hunt Jr. was an acclaimed flutist
with the Kansas City Symphony for 11 years before returning to
Dallas in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt Jr.; his brothers, Clark and Daniel; and his sister,
Sharron Munson, each own 20 percent of the Chiefs under a trust
established in 1997 as part of his father's succession plan, which
ensures that the team remains in the family. The elder Hunt
retained the remaining 20 percent and serves as the club's owner.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Lamar Hunt Jr. worked for the Chiefs as a promotions
manager.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit filed in December, Fitzpatrick alleged that Hunt
Jr. came to her room and forced her to perform sex acts three times
while she was visiting his family in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In his formal response, Hunt Jr. acknowledged engaging in sexual
activity with Fitzpatrick but contended she participated willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hunt Jr.) specifically denies (Fitzpatrick) ever showed any
fear in connection with their sexual activity, and to the contrary,
she freely participated in sexual activity with (Hunt Jr.),''
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Had the case gone to trial, a key piece of evidence would have
been a 10-page handwritten document prepared by Hunt Jr. sometime
after October 1997 and titled ``Confessions of a Sex Addict.''
</P>
<P>
   In great detail, Hunt Jr. described his sexual and spiritual
history from age 11 to the alleged assault on Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made unwanted advances on her on consecutive nights,'' Hunt
Jr. wrote. ``...If this is disturbing I am sorry, but I think that
for whatever reason God wants me to expel this demon once and for
all and make that complete and thorough confession once and for
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he begged for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Judy, I am sorry for the repulsiveness of my behavior to
your honor as a woman,'' Hunt Jr. wrote. ``I hope you can forgive
me....To God, I throw myself on your mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanary has acknowledged that his client wrote the letter but in
court filings argued that Hunt Jr. was not a sex addict. In a
deposition given earlier this month, Hunt Jr. acknowledged he was
under treatment by a therapist for ``obsessive compulsive
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Hunt Jr.'s wife, Jocelyn, filed for divorce, citing as
evidence the 10-page ``confession.'' No final decree has been
issued. They have seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Court records showed the couple had spent about $1.25 million
litigating the divorce, including fees for legal work and
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   In those records Hunt Jr. acknowledged he once estimated his net
worth at $95 million, though now he says it is between $5 million
and $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   He is an employee of Unity Hunt, a company that services the
Lamar Hunt family and its interests and assets. He also is a member
of partnerships that own the United Center basketball arena in
Chicago and present cable television broadcasts of Chicago sporting
events.

GORE EXPANDS ON CLINTON'S FOREST-PROTECTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska, Mich., Ohio, Wisc., Mo.)  (EDS: SUBS last 3 grafs before optional take to add Western
lawmakers' opposition and Gore and Clinton not conferring before
speech; Subs overline.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Wading into one of the nation's most contentious
environmental debates, Vice President Al Gore pledged Tuesday to
prohibit logging and road building on 43 million acres of
undeveloped national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's promise goes beyond a proposal the Clinton administration
made just three weeks ago that would bar road building across a
broad swath of roadless land in 155 national forests and
grasslands. That land accounts for about a quarter of the entire
forest system and includes many of its most pristine areas.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they praised President Clinton's proposal, many
environmental groups said it did not go far enough because it would
not prevent logging in those undeveloped forests. Environmentalists
also criticized the plan, which is under review, for explicitly
exempting the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the nation's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore addressed both complaints, saying that he would
bar logging as well as road building in the roadless areas. And he
strongly suggested that he would extend the same protections to the
Tongass, where conservation efforts have been opposed by Alaska's
influential congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be a national
priority to preserve these roadless areas as they are, no ifs, ands
or buts about it,'' Gore said. ``No more destructive development
and exploitation. And just so I'm crystal clear about it, no new
road building and no timber sales in the roadless areas of our
national forests. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Tongass, Gore added, ``I will ensure total and permanent
protection for the roadless areas in the Tongass, America's great
temperate rain forest.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made his announcement after picking up the
endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, which represents
the leadership of more than 40 environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``His environmental achievements are the most extensive of any
public official in high office,'' said Deb Callahan, president of
the league. ``Without Al Gore and this administration, we would
already be experiencing a dramatic backward slide on the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its new environmental promises, Gore's speech was notable
for not mentioning Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican
rival. The vice president has been criticized by some fellow
Democrats for spending too much time in recent weeks attacking Bush
rather than explaining where he would lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's speech, Gore's aides said, was just the first of
several in which he plans to focus on his own proposals and vision,
rather than reacting to news that Bush creates. The vice president
has also begun devoting more of his speeches to spotlighting parts
of his background, a strategy the Democratic National Committee
plans to incorporate into a series of biographical television
commercials in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore gave his Republican opponent a pass Tuesday,
Callahan, who worked on Gore's 1988 presidential campaign, did not.
She asserted that Bush had done little to reduce air pollution or
improve state parks in Texas. And she accused Bush of pandering to
big corporate polluters that have contributed generously to his
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush's appointees to key cabinet and administrative
positions predict an administration of, by and for the special
interests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, said that Bush's
administration had actually added nearly 91,000 acres to the state
park system and had significantly reduced the release of toxic
pollutants into the air, water and soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al Gore chooses surrogates to pollute Governor Bush's
record, he should choose ones that have their facts straight,''
Barlett said. ``The new Al Gore is the same old Al Gore. The
negative campaigning will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the league's endorsement, the Republican National
Committee on Tuesday circulated copies of a memorandum written at
least six months ago by a board member of the Sierra Club, one of
the nation's largest and most influential environmental groups,
that sharply criticized Gore's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this legacy, no real environmentalist could ever endorse
Al Gore,'' wrote Michael Dorsey, a doctoral candidate at the
University of Michigan's school of natural resources and
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel J. Weiss, the Sierra Club's political director,
described the memorandum as ``one person's opinion,'' adding that
it would have ``no impact'' on whether the group endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists expect the Sierra Club to back Gore by
the fall. Indeed, the group has already spent $250,000 on
television commercials attacking Bush's environmental record. The
spots are being broadcast in Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin and
will begin running in Ohio this week.
</P>
<P>
   A third, smaller environmental group, Friends of the Earth,
which endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and has
been sharply critical of Gore's record on global warming and trade
issues, remains undecided in the race. A spokesman, Mark
Whiteis-Helms, said the group is considering endorsing Ralph Nader,
the Green Party candidate, but has not ruled out backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing new protections for the national forests, Gore
stepped into an emerging national debate over development in some
of the nation's wildest lands.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the expanded protections contend that roadless
areas encompass some of the cleanest, safest wildlife habitats in
the nation. But off-road vehicle enthusiasts and timber industry
officials argue that too much public land has already been placed
off limits to development. The ban has also been strongly opposed
by some powerful Western lawmakers who say it would reduce logging
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials have said that simply banning road
building would significantly reduce future logging in the roadless
areas. But Gore sided Tuesday with environmentalists, who contend
that unless logging is specifically prohibited, helicopter logging
and other activities could damage the land.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not consult with Clinton about Tuesday's speech,
advisers to the vice president said. But aides to the two men did
confer beforehand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech Tuesday, Gore also pledged to prevent oil drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. And he asserted
that passing campaign finance reform legislation would be a form of
environmental protection, because it would reduce the influence of
big corporate polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also defended his 1992 book on the environment, ``Earth in
the Balance,'' which was recently reissued, much to the glee of
some Republicans who say it exposes Gore as an extremist on the
issue. But Tuesday, Gore said: ``I am proud I wrote that book. I
stand by every word in that book.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``I believe that God created only this one earth
and the earth is in the balance. Save it we can, and save it we
must.''

 By STEPHEN LABATON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday
proposed to ease several decades-old regulations on broadcasters,
including one that prevents companies from owning a broadcast
station and newspaper in the same city and another prohibiting a
company from owning more than one national television network.
</P>
<P>
   In a biennial review that Congress ordered as part of its
overhaul of the telecommunications industry four years ago, the FCC
said it had begun preparing new rules to relax, but not eliminate,
both the cross-ownership and dual-network restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposed easing the way the listening audience of local
radio markets are measured by regulators in a way that could enable
companies to own more stations than they do under current limits.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals may have significant implications for several
pending and recently completed mergers in the broadcast and
newspaper industries. Existing rules would have required
significant divestitures after Viacom's acquisition of CBS and
Tribune Co.'s proposed purchase of Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said some restrictions had become outdated as
Americans increasingly turned to new technologies like satellite
television and high-speed Internet services offered through
telephone and cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a wave of corporate deals has led to new
levels of concentration in the broadcast, cable and telephone
industries, testing the ownership limits imposed by both the FCC
and Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media marketplace has become increasingly dynamic and
competitive, with an expanding number of information outlets and
media platforms and more Americans than ever before are using these
options,'' said William E. Kennard, the FCC's chairman. ``The
report we issue today balances the public interest in diversity of
ownership with the demands of a changing marketplace and the
broadcast industries' need to realize economic efficiencies and
remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the cross-ownership and dual-network regulations were
rooted in the idea of promoting diversity of the airwaves, and
officials at the FCC said they were not planning on eliminating the
restrictions but easing them in particular cases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the proposed changes outlined Tuesday are more gradual
than some large companies had sought, they mark a significant
policy change for the FCC, which has defended legal attacks and
criticisms over the rules for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the cross-ownership rules, the FCC said there was
still a need for restrictions in many areas across the country to
prevent a company from controlling both a newspaper and television
station.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC also concluded that in some cities, particularly
large ones with many media outlets, ``there might be situations in
which the rule may not be necessary to protect the public interest
in diversity and competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the dual-network rule, the FCC said that two
emerging television networks, UPN and Warner Brothers, were still
developing and ought to be able to attempt to attract new
investments from a major network. But FCC officials said they would
not alter rules that prevent the four majors _ ABC, CBS, Fox and
NBC _ from acquiring one another.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the proposed rules to be issued in the next few
months, and the commission would then consider them. The proposed
changes have come after heavy lobbying by some of the nation's
largest broadcasting and newspaper companies, which have big stakes
in trying to hold onto recently acquired television companies.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-ownership restrictions have threatened to force
Tribune Co., which has agreed to buy Times Mirror, to sell some
properties in three cities _ New York, Los Angeles and Hartford,
Conn. _ where the companies have newspapers and broadcasting
properties. In New York, Tribune would own both WPIX, a WB
affiliate, and Newsday, which is based in Long Island. The Tribune
Co. has also spent years trying to persuade the fcc to permit it to
own both a newspaper and a television station in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The dual-network rule has threatened to force Viacom, which
recently completed its acquisition of CBS, to sell its half
interest in UPN. When it approved the deal four weeks ago, the FCC
gave Viacom one year to sell its stake in UPN. But if the agency
finishes writing new rules before then, the company might not have
to put the network up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC stopped short of recommending any easing of the
limitations that have prevented the stations owned by a company
from reaching more than 35 percent of the national television
audience, prompting Fox, which is at the limit and wants to
continue to expand, to immediately file a lawsuit against the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC decision today is a textbook case of arbitrary and
capricious government action,'' said Chase Carey, chairman and
chief executive of Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national TV ownership cap, which may have served a purpose
in the days when only three TV networks competed in local markets,
long ago outlived its rational and is now harming rather than
promoting its original public interest objectives of diversity,
localism and competition,'' he said. ``In an era in which scores of
nationwide programming networks are available to viewers from cable
and satellite providers, it makes no sense to artificially limit
the number of markets in which broadcasters can compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said that Fox's argument had confused trends in the
local market with trends in the national market and that there
remained a compelling need to prevent any one company's stations
from controlling the national market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Americans still get most of their news and
public affairs information from broadcast stations, and in a
participatory democracy like ours, it is vitally important that we
encourage the widest possible dissemination of this information
from diverse and antagonistic sources,'' he said. ``Our structural
ownership restrictions seek to promote this First Amendment
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics said that Kennard's own observation that most
Americans relied heavily on broadcasting to get their news
demonstrated the need to keep the cross-ownership in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasting remains the single most important source of
information at the local level for many many voters, and most of
the rest get their information from newspapers,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, which promotes
diversity on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have these voices controlled by fewer and fewer owners
cannot help democracy,'' he said. ``The evolution of the Internet
has yet to make any significant change on how people decide to cast
their vote for the mayor. The degree to which a few large economic
powers in any community can control the debate is no less today
than it has been in the past.''

PREMIER, IT SEEMS, ISN'T ALONE IN SEEING JAPAN AS DIVINE
</HEADLINE>
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With a furor over his characterization of Japan
threatening his party's hold on power, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
stood before journalists for 40 minutes last Friday denying that he
had blurred the boundary between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's strenuous self-defense rested on his contention that in
calling Japan ``a divine country with an emperor at its center,''
he had intended to say nothing more than that the emperor is a
popular and cherished national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the prime minister's intentions, by touching on a
taboo subject with such little caution he has shown the jagged edge
of a nostalgic form of nationalism that is enjoying a powerful
resurgence among conservative politicians.
</P>
<P>
   His statement continues to embroil his office, giving his
cabinet a 19 percent approval rating in a poll after he had made
the remarks, the lowest ratings of any prime minister on the eve of
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the denials is that the pronouncement was a
perfect summation of State Shinto, the official religion that drove
Japan's expansionism in Asia and its war with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mori may have denied that he was advocating a state religion or
deification of the emperor, as existed in the past, saying, ``That
is utterly contrary to my personal belief.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said it strained credulity for him to argue that his
phrase, uttered before a Shinto political group, was unrelated to
militarist Japan's wartime creed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he recognized the nuance of what he said, and tried
to show his sympathy for the people he was addressing,'' said
Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of politics at Tokyo University. ``He
tries to do this at whatever gathering. It may not have seemed like
a very serious statement, but it has become a very serious
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   To be properly understood, critics and historians say, the
``divine nation'' remarks must be seen in the light of recent
right-wing statements and initiatives that call for, among other
goals, moral indoctrination for youth, a clampdown on foreigners,
and a national holiday to honor the wartime emperor, Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   Late last summer, conservatives in the legislature won passage
of a law to legalize the flag and a national anthem that is a paean
to the emperor. Others have begun agitating for rearming the
country, potentially even with nuclear weapons. A deputy defense
minister, Shingo Nishimura, had to resign in the fall in a storm of
criticism after he made such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the conservatives' project is the revision of a
constitution written under American occupation and a dream of
reversion to a mythical state that is strong and unsullied by undue
foreign influences.
</P>
<P>
   That members of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed
since 1955, except for a period of less than two years, openly
contemplate such ideas is at once an expression of the party's
strength and its weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The party remains powerful because more than ever it lacks an
effective opposition. Even the diplomatic constraints of the Cold
War, when Japan was locked in an anticommunist alliance with the
United States and several Asian countries, have faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although many LDP members have a reactionary view of history,
they were not able to express themselves, because of the
overwhelming influence of the United States on the one hand and
because of the restraint required by the international situation in
East Asia on the other,'' said Yasuaki Onuma, a professor
international law at Tokyo University. ``However, with the sharp
decline of the Socialist Party and the end of the Cold War, the
feeling of the majority is that we have gone too far in keeping
silent on the issues of our relationships with others and national
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the constraints have loosened, the Liberal Democratic
Party has been weakened by a decade of economic decline as severe
as any advanced nation has experienced since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is no strong opposition, the party owes its
governing majority to an unusual and unpopular alliance with a
pacifist Buddhist-affiliated party. And nowadays, most voters are
skeptical independents.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this light, the appeals to the values and methods of the
past may simply reflect a party desperately reaching to the past
for answers to Japan's problems _ and to appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's plummeting poll numbers since the ``divine country''
remarks, however, strongly suggest that such a clumsy approach is
doomed to backfire.
</P>
<P>
   And the ruling class' nostalgia may cost it more than votes.
When a legislator states, as one did in Parliament this week, that
Hirohito ``built today's peaceful and prosperous Japan,'' the first
casualty is the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the historical record, as long as the leaders remain
prisoners of an unexamined past, other countries will continue to
look on Japan as an insincere, untrustworthy and potentially
threatening nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mori refusal to retract his statement harms Japan, and
understandably so, because for Westerners in particular, Pearl
Harbor caused Japan to be labeled as treacherous,'' said Herbert P.
Bix, an American historian at Hitsosubashi University in Tokyo, and
author of a coming biography of Hirohito. ``His explanation borders
on deceitfulness of the worst sort. Over and over again in Japanese
politics, you can see leaders speaking out of both sides of the
mouth, and the result is that Japan just isn't trusted.''

<P>
   Every few weeks, some Silicon Valley startup tries to lure Mary
Morse, a software engineer, away from Autodesk Inc. a
computer-aided design company in San Rafael, Calif. At least one of
them has dangled an options package that could have made her rich
by now.
</P>
<P>
   But Morse invariably says thanks, but no thanks. The reason she
is staying put, she says, is simple: She likes her bosses.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here for managers that they will ignore at
their peril in the current job market. Being a tough guy might have
worked a decade ago when corporate America was downsizing and
laying off workers by the millions. But that era, exemplified by
Albert J. ``Chainsaw Al'' Dunlap, the roving chief executive who
boasted about how many people he had fired in order to raise his
companies' stock price, is over.
</P>
<P>
   The American workplace has evolved into a kinder, gentler phase.
With unemployment at a 30-year low, bosses realize that they have
to do more than pay good salaries and lavish perks on their
employees if they want to keep them. They also have to be nice to
them.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes a Gallup Organization study that shows that most
workers rate having a caring boss even higher than money or fringe
benefits. In interviews with 2 million employees at 700 companies,
Gallup found that how long employees stay at companies and how
productive they are is determined by their relationship with the
immediate supervisor. ``People join companies and leave managers,''
said Marcus Buckingham, a senior managing consultant at Gallup and
the primary analyst for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's two-year career at Autodesk is Exhibit A for that
reality. She has worked under several managers so far, she said,
and they have all gone out of their way to please her. The first
one guided her through a six-month internship, accommodating her
college schedule and providing time off for finals. The second
sealed her loyalty to the company by insisting on paying her $5,000
more than she requested as her starting salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he said without saying it was, `You're more
valuable than even that and I'm going to give you what your
worth,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then that manager's supervisor approached her unexpectedly and
asked to be her mentor _ an offer that she says filled her with
``shock, amazement and delight.''
</P>
<P>
   She accepted, and the supervisor asked her to draw up a list of
short-term and long-term goals. Then, she provided her with a list
of training courses, both inside and outside the company, that
would help her meet those objectives. And finally, she contacted
Morse's boss to make sure he would give her the time off to take
the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Enter boss No. 3, David Lein, Autodesk's automation manager.
Lein, Morse said, summoned her to his office from time to time to
discuss her career hopes. After she completed a project for the
redesign of a large piece of computer code, he asked her what she
wanted to do next. When she said she wanted to be a software
engineer, he recommended classes and gave her the time off to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Lein got together with other managers to arrange
for her transfer to a testing position, even though she lacked the
experience that was supposedly required for the position. While not
technically a promotion, the job required more expertise than her
previous one and was a logical step to a higher-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   All the kindness she has received over the last two years, Morse
says, is literally worth a million dollars to her. Before she
joined Autodesk, and again nine months after her arrival, she was
wooed by a telecommunications company that specializes in
high-speed data transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, she says, the company had not yet gone public and
offered her 7,000 stock options at an exercise price of less than
$1 a share. She was tempted, but rejected the offer after she was
told that although she had career aspirations for software
development, the company would not honor them. The interviewer told
her, she said, ``If I hire you, you'll remain here in testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Had she accepted, she would be sitting on options worth $1
million at the current stock price. But she has no regrets. People
at the company that wanted to hire her tell her they are bored and
frustrated. ``The general feeling is that they are putting in their
time,'' waiting for their options to be vested so they can bail
out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And friends at other Silicon Valley firms complain to her that
they have trouble getting up in the morning, telling her, she says:
``This thing worked out great, but I'm miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Workplace specialists say Morse's experience is not unusual _
nor is the unhappiness of her acquaintances at other companies. The
No. 1 reason people quit their jobs, they say, is dissatisfaction
with their supervisors, not their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a tight labor market for employers to think though
the social contract they are striking with people,'' says Charles
A. O'Reilly III, visiting professor at the Harvard Business School
and co-author ``Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve
Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People,'' which is to be
published this year by the Harvard Business School Press. ``When
job opportunities are plentiful, people with crummy bosses leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are four times more likely to leave than are
people with nice bosses, according to a 1999 study conducted
jointly by Spherion, a staffing and consulting firm in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and Lou Harris Associates. In the survey, only 11
percent of employees who rated their supervisor's performance as
excellent said they were likely to look for a job in the next year,
while 40 percent of those who rated their supervisors' performance
as poor were likely to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are plenty of bosses out there with mean
streaks, especially in highly competitive industries like
movie-making or macho strongholds like oil. Scott B. MacKenzie, a
professor at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business who has
studied workplace behavior for several years, says ``jerks'' can
still rise to the top if they are stellar performers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, being nice to employees is not a magic potion against
defections. The big layoffs of the late 1980s and early '90s all
but destroyed the tradition of loyalty to the company and replaced
it with a new culture of job-hopping. ``With downsizing, companies
began saying, `Don't expect a long-term future here, but keep your
skills up-to-date,''' says Mark Roehling, a professor at the
Haworth School of Business at Western Michigan University.
Employees complied, he says, with the result that many will leave
as soon as a better offer comes along.
</P>
<P>
   What should a company that is plagued by defections do? Change
its ways, advises B. Lynn Ware, an industrial psychologist who
heads Integral Training Systems in Menlo Park, Calif. If a company
learns that a valued employee is disgruntled, it should discuss it
with him. ``You should say something like, `I really want you to
have a better work experience than you've had recently,''' Ware
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-economy companies are training managers in the art of
benevolence. Macy's West, a division of Federated Department
Stores, based in San Francisco, recently began a pilot program of
assigning mentors to new managers _ and telling all managers that
up to 35 percent of their compensation would be linked to how well
they retain the people under them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has apparently encouraged managers to be more
accommodating to employees' needs. Ellen Murrin, a group sales
manager for women's ready-to-wear clothing, for example, said she
was now more likely to grant requests for schedule changes and time
off than she used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are also pushing their managers to be
friendlier. An International Paper plant in Moss Point, Miss.,
holds morning training sessions on positive reinforcement, and
David Sulik, a paper-machine superintendent, says they have changed
his ways.
</P>
<P>
   He used to hover and watch for mistakes. As a compliment, he
would offer a pat on the back or a curt, ``Good job.'' Now, he has
cut back on the criticism and become more effusive in his praise,
even writing the occasional thank you note to an employee for an
exceptional performance. He also chats with workers more than he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they trust me more than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that trust can pay off. Lein, the manager at Autodesk who
went to bat for Morse, says that he too has had to resist
entreaties from other high-technology companies. He averages two
job offers a week, to say nothing of an avalanche of 200 e-mail
pitches from headhunters that he filters out with a software
program that spots telltale words.
</P>
<P>
   His reason for staying is similar to Morse's. When he looks
around Silicon Valley, he says, ``I see people burning out,
companies going under and never making it to the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   `` Maybe I'm a bit of an anomaly,'' he adds. ``Job satisfaction
and being challenged means as much to me as the money part of it _
just so as long as I feel rewarded.''

PROTESTER'S PIE GRAZES AGRICULTURE SECRETARY GLICKMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretary of agriculture, a former House member
from Kansas, had just begun to speak at the opening session of the
National Nutrition Summit here Tuesday when an animal rights
protester leaped onto the stage and threw a pie at him.
</P>
<P>
   The protester's message was loud and clear: ``Shame on you, Dan
Glickman, you meathead. Shame on you for promoting meat.'' But her
aim was off.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman ducked, and the pie _ tofu cream, according to members
of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, with which the
protester claimed association _ grazed the back of Glickman's
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   As Glickman peeled off his jacket to reveal a lilac colored
shirt, he didn't miss a beat: ``That was not a very balanced meal
she threw at me.'' Then he turned to former Sen. Bob Dole, who was
also on the stage, and said, ``Bob, I don't think we're in Kansas
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman was one of the speakers at the nutrition meeting,
convened 31 years after the original White House Conference on Food
Nutrition and Health, which was instrumental in starting many of
the government food assistance programs that are now familiar, like
Head Start and the school breakfast program.
</P>
<P>
   The pie thrower, Arathi Jayaram, 24, of Mansfield, Ohio, who
lives in northern Virginia, is a member of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. She was carried out by a member of Glickman's
security team with help from a guard assigned to Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, who was also on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Jayaram was reportedly charged with assault. She is being held
by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department and will be
arraigned on Wednesday morning. The charge carries a recommended
penalty of up to a year in jail, but there is no category in
federal sentencing guidelines for assault with a pie in a
disposable aluminum tin.

GRAVE EXHUMED OF MAN WHO CLAIMED TO BE JESSE JAMES &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Efforts to determine if the ``real'' Jesse
James is buried south of here in Granbury were delayed slightly
Tuesday when workers exhumed a grave and found a sealed, metal
coffin instead of a wooden box.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason we had thought it would be a wooden
container,'' said spokeswoman Mary Saltarelli.
</P>
<P>
   Saltarelli said the entire coffin must be removed and would be
opened at an enclosed location later. Previously, anthropologist
David Glassman from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos
had hoped to open the coffin in the grave and retrieve matter for
testing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Material from the coffin, hair, bones and teeth will be sent to
the University of California at Davis for DNA testing by Professor
David Glenn Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the Granbury site has been simmering for years, ever
since a man known as J. Frank Dalton claimed to be the true Jesse
James.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, who came to Granbury shortly after 1900, repeated his
claim often. He lived until 1951, at which time he would have been
104 if he were Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   However, scars on Dalton's body were consistent with James'
exploits and many believed him. The story eventually found its way
to Bud Hardcastle, a Purcell, Okla., used car dealer and amateur
historian.
</P>
<P>
   Hardcastle secured a power of attorney from Dalton's known
relatives and was granted a court order to exhume the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton's claims were at odds with historians, who believe James
was killed by Bob Ford in 1882 in St. Joseph, Mo. James Starrs, a
George Washington University professor, exhumed what has been held
to be James' grave in Kearney, Mo., in 1995 and tested material
then.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests, which compared DNA results with a known DNA profile
of a James family descendant, showed the body was that of a man
related to the James family.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the best that will be determined about any
gravesite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tests are exclusionary,'' said Smith, who will do the
testing on the Granbury material. ``We can tell you he wasn't Jesse
James or that he could be Jesse James, but not that he definitely
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will show whether he was a descendant.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes to begin tests within two weeks after
receiving the samples and should be finished by the end of June.

COMMENTARY: AFTER THE FALL, IN TOO MUCH OF A HURRY? 
</HEADLINE>
  By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poor little Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he could scamper away from the Clinton curse.
</P>
<P>
   But there was the curse, slouching towards Babylon. The day
before the biggest day of Rick Lazio's life _ his speech in Buffalo
accepting the Republican nomination for the Senate, with all the
cameras zooming in for a close-up of that boyish grin. Bam! Splat!
Thwack!
</P>
<P>
   The guy falls flat on his face at the Babylon Memorial Day
parade and cuts his lip so badly he has to get eight stitches, and
the lip gets so swollen it's hard to talk and smile, and
fuhgeddabout kissing babies with that scary kisser.
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman was already having a ball: ``Rick Lazio. One day
you're a busboy at the Olive Garden, the next day you're running
for Senate against Hillary Clinton. ... Rick Lazio. Isn't he that
Cuban kid's uncle?''
</P>
<P>
   So then Ricky has to take his big bow to the theme from
``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should just come out and ask Hillary if she's got one
of those tannis-root charms, the kind Ralph Bellamy and Ruth Gordon
made Mia Farrow wear in ``Rosemary's Baby.'' That gal has left way
too many spooky casualties in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, you never want a misstep to be upgraded to
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford was a college athlete. But when his stumbles were
lampooned by Chevy Chase, the humor resonated because Americans
deemed Ford politically clumsy. His first act as president had been
a pratfall _ pardoning Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter collapsed while jogging in black socks, it
crystallized the sense that he was a wimp. We were fine; he had
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   When a railing gave way and Bob Dole tumbled off a stage in
Chico, Calif., in '96, it reinforced the idea that his campaign was
in free fall and his time had passed.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Hampshire primary last winter, Gary Bauer plummeted
backward off a stage while flipping pancakes. Four days later his
campaign did a back flip offstage as well.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when Bill Clinton tore a tendon in the wee hours
while visiting the golfer Greg Norman in Florida in 1997, it had no
figurative echo. Everybody simply reckoned that the president had
been cavorting a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But when Little Ricky went tumbling down, the stature issue came
bubbling up.
</P>
<P>
   He looked like an eager puppy springing out of the gate and
going all splay-legged. Republicans fretted again: Is he ready for
the big show?
</P>
<P>
   It was the most overcaffeinated entry into a race since George
Bush announced Dan Quayle as his running mate in New Orleans.
Little Danny, another congressional pup itching for the sun, raced
up and hugged the startled Bush, looking, for one terrifying
moment, as if he were going to lick the older man's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had been leery of Little Ricky's gratingly unsubtle
ambition. Couldn't he at least thinly veil it? The New York GOP had
had to yank at the 42-year-old's leash after he noisily gnawed Rudy
Giuliani's leg before the mayor learned he was sick and dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   When the nomination suddenly fell into the Long Island
congressman's lap, he was off and running, fairly panting with
charm, as Dorothy Parker might put it. At the parade on Monday, he
was doing so much dashing and bounding and nuzzling and zigzagging,
you just wanted to call out, ``Down, boy, down.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think a face gushing blood would be a great excuse to get
out of a parade. But the dazed Lazio tried to keep going as though
nothing had happened until his wife, a nurse, made him go to the
hospital. When he rushed back, stitched and swollen, for a second
parade, sprinting and air-kissing, Giuliani patted him on the back.
(Down, boy, down.)
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has the self-promoting energy of Chuck Schumer and Bob
Torricelli without the craftiness. He came out swinging in Buffalo,
joking about getting a rematch with the pavement, pillorying
Hillary as the candidate of Hollywood and left-wing special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   He has already accomplished the impossible: He has made the
first lady, relentlessly ridiculed by conservatives as a
panting-for-power yuppie, look laid back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the underdog in this race,'' Ricky barked in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   (Down, boy, down.)

UAL, US AIRWAYS SET EASY DEPARTURE PLAN FROM MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Pa., Mass.)   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since last week, leaders at UAL Corp., parent of United
Airlines, and US Airways have said repeatedly that they are
committed to seeing their controversial $4.3 billion merger through
to completion. But it turns out that it would not be very taxing
for either side to walk away from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   According to a copy of the merger agreement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, US Airways would
have to pay $160 million to UAL if it breached the contract, while
UAL would be forced to pay $50 million to US Airways if it got cold
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, either company can terminate the agreement if the
merger is not completed by Dec. 31. The deal faces many regulatory
hurdles in Washington, making it likely there will be a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial bounds appear rather loose when compared with
other recent deals like America Online's proposed merger with Time
Warner Inc. In that case, AOL must pay Time Warner $5.4 billion if
it pulls out, while Time Warner is obligated to pay America Online
$3.7 billion if it walks away. There is also a second
multibillion-dollar breakup penalty if stockholders at either
company reject the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Merger experts said that breakup fees normally represented a
percentage of each company's equity and that the higher fees in the
case of the AOL-Time Warner merger merely reflected the higher
values of those two companies.
</P>
<P>
   But one week after the UAL-US Airways deal was first disclosed,
many in the airline industry wonder if the deal will ever be
completed. Most of the speculation centers on the next wave of
merger announcements that many analysts said were sure to come and
would make regulators and Congress reluctant to approve a merger
between the country's largest airline _ UAL _ and its sixth
largest, US Airways. At the top of the list are a possible deal
between AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, and Northwest
Airlines, and a merger of Delta Airlines and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, announced
Tuesday that he would join federal authorities and officials in New
York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in taking a hard look at the
UAL-US Airways deal. ``The merger of United and US Air would create
an airborne behemoth with huge implications for our consumers and
economy,'' he said. UAL and US Airways hope to win over state and
federal regulators by selling most of the US Airways' operations at
Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington to DC Air, a new
airline being formed by Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black
Entertainment Television and a US Airways board member.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   DC Air will receive seven gates at Reagan National and 222
coveted takeoff and landing slots at the airport, where the number
of daily flights is limited, for $141.2 million, according to the
memorandum of understanding between Johnson and UAL and US Airways
that was also filed with the SEC Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, UAL has agreed to lease maintenance sites, jets and
ticket counters to the fledgling airline. The memorandum also
states that ``United will provide interim employees for up to six
months to staff `open' positions, while DC Air hires and trains, if
needed, at United's cost.''
</P>
<P>
   UAL and US Airways executives said that DC air would quickly
become a strong competitor with the combined United-US Airways, but
others are not so sure. An analysis by Samuel C. Buttrick, an
airline analyst at PaineWebber, found that the number of airplane
seats flown from Reagan National would decrease by 15 percent after
DC Air began operating compared with what United and US Airways
each fly today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that there will be fewer seats at the outset
rather than more seats,'' Buttrick said. ``It is certainly hard to
see how that is good for the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that DC Air could expand its service from Reagan
National over time but that would not be easy given the
restrictions at the airport. Another hurdle facing the deal is the
approval of employees at both airlines. The leadership of the union
representing United's 10,000 pilots, who own about a quarter of
UAL's stock, will begin three days of meetings in Chicago on
Wednesday to discuss the deal. James E. Goodwin, UAL's chief
executive, is scheduled to address the group Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As Goodwin has previously stated, the merger agreement
guarantees that there will be no layoffs at the combined airlines
for two years. Nevertheless, it will be a tough audience. Last
week, Rick Dubinsky, the chairman of the United union's master
executive council who is also on UAL's board, criticized Goodwin
for pursuing the merger before first sealing a new contract with
the pilots. Those talks are expected to go on for months.

science joins art in the endless search for better flavor.
Blumenthal has allied himself with Peter Barham, top, a 49-year-old
physicist at the University of Bristol, with remarkable results. In
only a few years, the Duck has waddled to the top of several lists
of England's best restaurants. (Jonathan Player/The New York Times)

<P>
   BINT JBAIL, Lebanon _ The Hezbollah militia, known for its
rockets and bombs, is back in southern Lebanon in force _ this time
with an army of doctors, nurses, veterinarians, bulldozers,
agronomists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the last Israeli soldiers abandoned the rocky
hillside villages that they controlled for nearly 18 years, the
business of keeping the water pumping and the hospitals running for
an estimated 75,000 Lebanese civilians has been taken on by
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   In this ragged town of 13,000, which served as a military
headquarters for Israel and its Lebanese allies during their
occupation of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah workers have set up metal
dispensers filled with drinking water in the streets because a
pipeline that used to bring drinking water from Israel has been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Here and throughout the south, Hezbollah workers have also
bulldozed debris from the streets and widened the narrow roads.
They have sent in insecticide-spraying trucks to kill mosquitoes.
They are surveying the damaged and destroyed buildings to decide
how much material to provide for reconstruction. They drive from
village to village in nine modern mobile clinics and have sent in
doctors and nurses to run an additional nine stationary clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In Beit Jbail, the Hezbollah health organization has also taken
over the regional hospital, which was abandoned during the
withdrawal by the local Lebanese doctors who used to be paid by
Israel to run it. The new management quickly renamed the place,
which used to be called simply Beit Jbail Hospital, in honor of a
comrade who died in a guerrilla attack on the town's Israeli
military guard post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to take over,'' said Fouad Taher, who manages
another Hezbollah-owned hospital in Lebanon and was dispatched to
help run the one here. ``The government should take its normal
place. The only reason we took this hospital is that we knew the
people really needed these services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the power vacuum left by the sudden withdrawal of Israeli
troops and the flight of many of their allies in the South Lebanon
Army, Hezbollah has started to operate in the south much as it does
in the rest of Lebanon, as a kind of parallel government offering
social services, development loans and reconstruction aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still considered by the United States and other
nations to be a terrorist group that bombed embassies and kidnapped
Westerners in the 1980s with the help of radical patrons in Iran
and Syria, Hezbollah has developed a different image in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Its network of services and institutions has helped it become
one of the country's strongest political parties in recent years,
with nine representatives now in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When other Lebanese militias were forced to disarm in the past
decade, Hezbollah maintained its weapons, turning them on Israelis
and members of the South Lebanon Army. Hezbollah operations in the
south, first as a guerrilla movement attacking Israeli positions in
the occupied buffer zone and now as a rapid-reaction force to
maintain public order, are likely to further its political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, no one in the Lebanese power structure appears
willing or able to challenge Hezbollah, or the Party of God, which
is lauded by every faction and religious grouping here as the
liberator of national territory. The government, which is still
haggling with the United Nations over whether the Israeli
withdrawal is complete, has refused to send its army to the south,
although dozens of Lebanese policemen have taken up positions at
checkpoints and are directing traffic at intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which is the major power in Lebanon and has 30,000 troops
stationed elsewhere in the country, has done little but
congratulate Hezbollah, although Syria has acted to try to limit
the group's political power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, thousands of Lebanese, including mayors
and federal government officials, have crammed into the Beirut
sitting room of Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's general
secretary, to offer congratulations and to kiss his hands and
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah, who does not hold a government or parliamentary post,
has acted deferential toward the official government, saying his
organization has no intention of setting up a parallel or competing
structure in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah directors of the Bint Jbail hospital, for
instance, courteously showed the Lebanese minister of health, Karam
S. Karam, around the facility on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Karam, who was accompanied by a French delegation that had
arranged a training program for Lebanese doctors who were scheduled
to operate the hospital after the Israeli retreat, said he is
grateful that Hezbollah moved quickly.

 BINT JBAIL, Lebanon: moved quickly.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When the Israelis withdrew, it was chaotic,'' Karam said. ``So
those working in the hospital fled. Then thugs came in and started
taking things. The ones who came immediately to establish order
were Hezbollah. They are organized and they are fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Karam said, he is ready to take on the hospital. So when
he returned to Beirut, he paid a call on Nasrallah, who offered
reassuring words: ``He told me, `The minute you decide to take it
over, we will give you the keys,''' Karam recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah banners, meanwhile, are draped across countless
electric poles, buildings and even junk piles throughout the south
now. So are the banners of the Jihad-al-Binaa Association,
Hezbollah's reconstruction arm. Its engineers and architects are
making a survey of every building in the area, its insecticide
trucks are spraying, its veterinarians have examined livestock and
its water trucks have provided water.
</P>
<P>
   None of those services have been provided by the Lebanese
government, which began only three days ago to work on a new water
pipeline to villages once served by Israeli water.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, the Jihad-al-Binaa has been rebuilding houses in
Lebanon that were destroyed by Israeli bombs, as well as running
two agricultural extension centers and advancing money to farmers.
Like its parent organization, the reconstruction agency saw its
work as part of the battle with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the war against Israel, it was a weapon in the
struggle,'' said Ibrahim A. Ismail, the general manager of
Jihad-al-Binaa. ``We fought Israel through development of
Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail said the group's preliminary estimates show that 1,600
houses in the former buffer zone have been destroyed since 1978,
when Christian militias allied with Israel began attacking many
Muslim areas. Another 1,200, he said, may have been partially
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our survey of the houses, we will see if we can give
help,'' he added, ``although that is not our job. It's the
government's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's energetic efforts may have already paid off in terms
of reducing tensions among Lebanese in the south and particularly
among Christians, who had feared they would be the target of the
Muslim militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the withdrawal, Hezbollah clerics
visited many of the remaining priests and Christian leaders and
Hezbollah fighters helped stop some of the looting that took place
after Israel's allies fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came and talked to us and told us not to worry,'' said
Ibrahim Yunis, a schoolteacher in the small Christian village of
Dibel, near Beit Jbail, where two-thirds of the residents fled to
Israel during the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all what we were led to expect. The whole picture
has changed from black to white, from what we used to hear about
what Hezbollah would do to us to what we now are feeling.''

WITH EWING OR WITHOUT, KNICKS' ROAD GETS ROUGHER 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ With a heavily padded sneaker protecting the
sore tendon in his right foot, Patrick Ewing shot his requisite
number of free throws Tuesday, barely perspired and afterward
proclaimed, ``I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing did not declare himself ready for Wednesday's Game 5
of the Eastern Conference finals, he told a teammate before
practice that he expected to play at Conseco Fieldhouse in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The mere suggestion that Ewing is returning to the lineup after
the Knicks knotted the series at two games apiece brought all the
old Ewing questions to bear, including the most prominent one:
</P>
<P>
   With their franchise center soothing his own health concerns,
are the wounded yet recharged Knicks also fine?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done doing that,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said, bristling at
the idea that Ewing's return might tinker with his team's on-court
chemistry. ``Let the foolish remain foolish. I'm not even trying to
educate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are 5-1 against Indiana in complete postseason games
without Ewing the past two years. If Latrell Sprewell, Allan
Houston and Marcus Camby re-energized the Knicks with their offense
in Ewing's absence a year ago, Larry Johnson has picked up the pace
in Games 2, 3 and 4 of this playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is shooting 59 percent from the field in the past three
games, having hit 26 of 44 field goals and all five 3-point
attempts in Monday's stirring Game 4 victory at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take advantage of my opportunities when I can when
the big fella is playing,'' Johnson said Tuesday. ``When the big
fella is not playing, we have to have some low-post presence.
That's why I was able to move down there, get some good looks, good
touches. They really weren't doubling as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel like some Pacer killer,'' he added. ``We beat
these cats without him last year, but he doesn't bring us down. I
think he helps. With him, I think it would be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has not played since the first quarter of Game 2, when
acute peroneal tendinitis forced him to the bench. Without him, the
Knicks have averaged 94.5 points in the past two games, using their
transition game to combat a slow-footed and stupefied Indiana team.
</P>
<P>
   How the injury will affect Ewing's play is up for debate. Ewing
has said he is having trouble cutting and planting the injured
foot. He has struggled with his lateral movement all season, trying
to keep up with quicker big men.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits does not present those type of problems, but the
7-foot-4-inch Pacers center is determined to erase the memory of
his last six quarters against the Knicks, in which he has scored
only 18 points and has become almost a forgotten option in
Indiana's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is not the only Knick still battling an injury. Marcus
Camby's sprained knee, suffered in Game 3, has improved enough for
the Knicks reserve forward to play extended minutes in Game 5.
Sprewell said the slight fracture in his left foot will not hamper
his play.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is the only Knick who has missed games, and how soon he
recaptures his rhythm may mean the difference between a successful
night or a struggling return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful for the best,'' Van Gundy said. ``He has been
off for seven or eight days, so that is a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Knicks traveled to Indianapolis in much the
same fashion they did a year ago. A 2-2 series. Reduced
expectations swirling about because of health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Banged up and relying more on their resolve than their talent,
they shocked the Pacers and went on to win the series in six games.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how long those qualities can carry them this
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when things are inflicted upon us, or we inflict them
upon ourselves, we have great resiliency,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what the danger is? Everybody is stroking them
today about `Gritty, determined, bounce back.' And subconsciously,
if they're content with just getting even, and they buy into all
that hype, like the Little Engine That Could type of thing ...
</P>
<P>
   ``My first point to them today was, you can't be content with
just getting even. Everyone is going to give us every excuse for
losing. And the only people who buy into excuses are losers. So we
have to put all that aside and find a way. Getting even was the
first step. Now we have to find a way to win a game on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without Ewing, that may be the most grueling task. The
Knicks have yet to win at Conseco since it opened this season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Knicks need Ewing to win the series, Houston said:
``I don't know. I can't answer that question because he hasn't been
there. We won two games at home. If he had been there and we won
those games, nobody would have said anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If we win the championship, Patrick has to be
there.'' &QL;

COTTON SAYS HE'S READY FOR NEXT STEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As an expert on rude awakenings, Schea Cotton has
an advanced perspective in defining a basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a dream come true,'' Cotton, a former Long
Beach-area high school legend, said in reference to surviving the
wild ride that has led to this particular crossroads. ``The NBA has
always been my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But the journey that dragged this dream has offered enough
challenges to make Ulysses flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to persevere,'' Cotton said Tuesday morning after
joining Fresno prep hotshot DeShawn Stevenson in a pre-draft
workout for the Clippers at USC's Lyon Center. ``At one point, I
thought my career was at its pinnacle. I've seen the good and bad
on both sides of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The good included a ``Sports Illustrated'' feature before Cotton
led Mater Dei High to the state championship in his sophomore
season.
</P>
<P>
   The bad included invalidated test scores and questions about his
commitment to the on-court details required to reach that
celebrated potential.
</P>
<P>
   And now _ after Mater Dei, two tours at St. John Bosco, a letter
of intent to join his big brother, James, at Long Beach State,
another with UCLA, prep school in New England, a letter of intent
with North Carolina State, a sparkling-but-incomplete season at
Long Beach City College and a decent season at Alabama _ Cotton is
hoping the sound of his name being called in the first round of the
June 28 draft can drown out much of the whispering from the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear different things from different people,'' Cotton said
in regard to his future, ``but I've heard that I have a good chance
of going late in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Several scouts say the first round is possible, but also list
about 40 eligible prospects with first-round ability. The truth
will be easier to fathom following next week's pre-draft camp at
Chicago. That event could be crucial for Cotton, a devastating
baseline player in high school who averaged 15.5 points per game at
Alabama while continuing his evolution as a shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Most unofficial Cotton advisors would have prescribed another
season in Tuscaloosa. But the demands of a dream and his father's
fight with prostate cancer are credited for launching the explosive
left-hander into the draft pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of my family and my trust in God are the reasons
why I have persevered,'' said Cotton, who reports that his father,
James Sr., is doing a ``a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' basketball staff may no longer include assistant
coach Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league source, a representative for the NBA's
all-time leading scorer last week was informed Abdul-Jabbar would
not be retained as an assistant for next season. Abdul-Jabbar, who
was hired Feb. 18, was contacted by telephone Tuesday afternoon,
but he declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the Clippers officially removed interim head coach
Jim Todd as a candidate to become permanent head coach. Remaining
from last season's staff are assistants Dennis Johnson, still
believed to be a strong candidate to become the head coach, and Rex
Kalamian.

TONGUES WAG AND THE FINGERS POINT FOR THE PACERS  
 BY LIZ ROBBINS  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Larry Bird was laughing.
</P>
<P>
   His Indiana Pacers had just lost two games on the road to a MASH
unit eager to keep fighting. After the 91-89 defeat in Madison
Square Garden on Monday night, Jalen Rose and the reserve guard
Travis Best said the Pacers were too slow and their offense too
predictable against a Knicks team revitalized by injury and
adversity. They implied that Bird should make some changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different from when I played,'' Bird said Tuesday.
``Every time we lost, it was never my fault, it's the coach's
fault. I understand that, I'll take the heat, but I do expect them
to come out tomorrow night and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird challenged his players to be tougher in Wednesday night's
Game 5, especially where they have wilted this season _ in the
first quarter. He urged them to defend and to rebound, calling the
7-foot-4-inch center Rik Smits' one-rebound effort in Game 4 ``a
killer.'' And that was when Knicks center Patrick Ewing was on the
bench in a suit, sidelined for the second straight game by
tendinitis in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Without Ewing's presence in the paint, the Knicks have been more
spontaneous, setting the pace and outscoring Indiana, 45-22, in
fast-break points this series. Bird admitted his team lacked speed,
but said his players could compensate by being in the right spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look and see Reggie and Jalen running out,'' Bird said.
``They got to be in the paint there to pick up some loose
rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller may have had a team-high 24 points in Game 4, but
he had no rebounds. ``If they don't, we don't have a chance to
win,'' Bird said. ``And that's what I talked to these guys about.
Give yourself an opportunity to win by getting on the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Rose's comments, Bird believed the plays were not
the problem, but rather his players' lack of crisp execution.
``Obviously Jalen thinks we should just give him the ball, clear
out and let him go one on one,'' Bird said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 50, 60 different plays. I'm a firm believer you need
about 10, and you need to run them great every time you run them.
There can't be any flaws in them. If we do things by the numbers,
we'll score points.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, averaging a team-high 21.3 points in this series,
reiterated that the formula makes the Pacers too predictable. ``The
plays we run are pretty much the plays we've been running Larry
Bird's entire coaching career,'' he said, but then he agreed with
Bird. ``On the offensive end, we need to find a way to get easy
baskets. But by all accounts, guys just need to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose added, ``I don't think there is any reason for us to lose
confidence, to be tentative or to panic at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Having squandered a 2-0 lead, the Pacers say they are not
panicking, but they are sweating. Miller, averaging 20.3 points
this series, vowed to become more aggressive on offense, then said:
``The pressure is back on us because we have to win tomorrow on our
home court to shift the pressure back to them in Game 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird put pressure on the bench, which was missing in action, in
the last game especially. Since Austin Croshere's breakout
performance of 22 points in Game 1, he has scored a total of 12
points, and has been dismal from 3-point range. Best offers more
speed at point guard, and scored 12 Monday, but he has been
inconsistent in the series. Sam Perkins had no points in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are not hitting from the perimeter as they did the
first two victories. But the Knicks are shooting better without
Ewing, making an unconscious 10 for 14, for 71.4 percent, on Monday
night, as the Pacers were eight of 19 for 42.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The complexion of the game could change if Ewing returns
Wednesday. Miller said the team is preparing both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, they're tougher than anyone you want to meet, and if
you beat them at their best, you feel good about it,'' Bird said.

FRANCE TELECOM ACQUIRES ORANGE PLC: RIVALRY WITH VODEFONE
POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Hans Snook, chief executive of Orange PLC, Britain's
third-largest wireless telephone operator, stood before an audience
of financial analysts here six months ago extolling the benefits of
combining with the German conglomerate Mannesmann, which had bought
Orange for $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Snook made a similar presentation, only this time,
the interactive slide display he showed had a different company's
logo in the corner as Orange's new parent: France Telecom, the
former state-owned telephone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Orange to France Telecom for about $37.5 billion in
cash and stock by Vodafone AirTouch PLC, Mannesmann's new parent,
represents more than just another telecommunications deal. It
demonstrates the rapid pace of change in Europe's wireless
telephone market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been here before,'' Snook said Tuesday at a
news conference to announce the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Orange to Mannesmann in late October was the
catalyst for a string of mergers and acquisitions in European
telecommunications. Since that deal, Vodafone, the world's leading
wireless company, has bought Mannesmann for a record $183 billion,
which forced the sale of Orange to satisfy regulators worried about
Vodafone's dominance. NTT's Docomo of Japan took a 15 percent stake
in the Netherlands-based Royal KPN's mobile unit, KPN Mobile,
earlier this month, in part to make a combined bid for Orange,
executives from those companies said at the time. And Telefonica of
Spain and Royal KPN tried unsuccessfully to marry their businesses
recently to compete in a marketplace that has fashioned behemoths
like Vodafone, and now, France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   The deal catapults France Telecom into a new league, putting it
within competitive reach of Vodafone and possibly creating a
rivalry between them.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom plans to use Orange as its vehicle for competing
in the wireless market by combining France Telecom wireless unit,
Itineris, with Orange's operations, to create a wireless operator
in Europe projected to have 30 million customers by year's end,
second only to Vodafone's 35 million. Itineris is the largest
wireless company in France, with more than 10 million subscribers,
and operations in Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition of Orange and the creation of New Orange is a
major step in France Telecom's strategy to become a European leader
and global player,'' said Michel Bon, chief executive of France
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   The French company has faced a string of problems recently as it
sought to expand throughout the Europe. The most notable example of
its recent trouble was its losing bid for E-Plus Mobilfunk, the
German mobile phone company. France Telecom also failed to win a
third-generation mobile license in Spain, limiting its ability to
offer service there. And its alliance with Deutsche Telekom, the
giant German telecommunications company, unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   So combining with Orange is considered a major coup for France
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   But the real winner may be Snook and the company he founded
seven years ago. Orange started as the fourth entrant in Britain's
highly contested wireless market and not only became highly coveted
by its acquisitive rivals, but also has the highest growth rate in
Britain. Snook will run the combined wireless company and have
relative autonomy over its management.
</P>
<P>
   The combined wireless company, which will be called New Orange,
will be incorporated as a separate company based in London. France
Telecom expects to sell shares of 10 percent to 15 percent of New
Orange to the public within a year, valuing the company at 150
billion euros, or about $141 billion. It will be listed on
exchanges in London, Paris and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stock part of the deal means Vodafone will own about 10
percent of France Telecom, but the French company will have the
right to repurchase those shares. Under French law, no company can
own more than 10 percent of France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom will pay Vodafone about 55 percent of the
acquisition price in cash and the rest in France Telecom shares. In
addition, France Telecom will assume about $2.7 billion in debt and
the $6.2 billion cost of Orange's third-generation mobile license
in Britain that it won in a government auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's not cheap,'' said Jean-Louis Vinciguerra,
executive vice president and chief financial officer of France
Telecom. But he added, ``I think it is a reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is effectively paying 6,741 euros for each Orange
customer, significantly below the 9,517 euros that Mannesmann paid
for each Orange customer or the 9,198 euros that Vodafone paid for
each Mannesmann customer.
</P>
<P>
   Investors bid France Telecom stock up 4.5 euros, or 3.1 percent,
to 148.9 euros, or $138.71.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Rothschild &AMP; Cie. and Salomon Smith Barney advised France Telecom.
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and DLJ International advised Orange.
Vodafone was advised by Goldman, Sachs and UBS Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   The France Telecom-Orange deal was announced just as Vodafone
reported that its fiscal 2000 earnings rose 30 percent, exceeding
expectations. The company earned (PS)3.95 billion before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with (PS)3.05
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone shares rose 20.75 pence, to 302 pence, or about $4.53.
They have risen 25 percent in the last week. The company's American
depositary receipts, each representing 10 ordinary shares, rose
$4.4375, or 11 percent, to $46.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

PERCEPTION BLURS REALITY REGARDING JUAN GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The TV guy began the highlights of the
Rangers-Tigers game Monday with a shot of Juan Gonzalez in the
dugout. Juan didn't play, the announcer informed us, because of a
foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else is new?'' he glibly added.
</P>
<P>
   What else is new? Plenty, actually.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen in these parts, Gonzalez had just put the
finishing touches on yet another superb season.
</P>
<P>
   He batted a career high .326, hit 39 homers and drove in 128
runs last season. He was ninth in the league in batting, fifth in
RBI and fourth with a .601 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   If he wasn't quite embraced as a hero, he at least was
appreciated for his talent, for regularly getting key hits to drive
in Rangers runners, for being one of the best players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's new? Just this.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez was traded to the Tigers in the off-season, the
event apparently opened a rift in the space/time continuum.
</P>
<P>
   Juan's World used to be a happy place, a simple place. It was a
place where its chief citizen, when it came to matters of baseball,
merely wanted to work hard, drive in runs and win games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Juan's World is a place where up is down, left is right,
north is south. It's a place where perception replaces reality, a
place of misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the bon mot from the TV guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else is new?'' Yuk, yuk. Yep, we all know that Juan never
did like to play with pain, did he? We know that he always misses
bunches of games with injuries, real and imagined, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually that's wrong. It's a piece of misinformation, an
example of perception replacing reality.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Gonzalez never is going to see the word ``ironman''
before his name, but consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, the Rangers hard-nosed left fielder, will play with
pain, right? He's the type of guy who'll do anything to stay in the
lineup, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Sure he is. But since the start of the 1996 season, Greer has
played 608 games. Gonzalez has played 605.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we accept Greer's various nagging injuries at face value,
and question Juan's injuries?
</P>
<P>
   Common sense should be enough to realize that if there was any
way possible, Gonzalez would play against his old club to try and
prove it made a mistake by trading him.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking common sense, an intrepid journalist could find out that
Gonzalez has been bothered by a heel injury for a week. The
technical name is plantar fasciitis, an injury that has caused Mark
McGwire and Will Clark to miss long stretches of playing time in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gotten worse in the last few days,'' Tigers team
physician Terry Lock said. ``It can very easily become chronic.
That is one of the concerns about it. It tends to hang around and
be difficult to completely alleviate.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, there was another case of perception trumping
reality. A different TV station did a piece on the new Rangers'
right fielder, and a few fans were quoted as saying they liked him
better than the old right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Why, this one hustled, they said. And gosh, it looks like he
might even be a better player.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? A better player?
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler is a crowd pleaser who'll get his uniform dirty. He
appears to be playing hard, an effect Gonzalez never quite could
pull off.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone forget, the old right fielder twice was chosen
Most Valuable Player of the American League. He twice led the
league in homers. He had more RBI than games played from 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
   The misinformation and perception/reality difficulties even
appear to have infected the resident of Juan's World.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has talked to local reporters about his experiences in
Texas three times since the start of spring training. Twice, he had
nothing but good things to say about the organization and its fans.
The other time he ripped the organization for its treatment of
Latin-American players.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the curious case of his address next year. He can
become a free agent at the end of the season, and reportedly told
one of his former teammates he'll be back in Texas. But when
Detroit reporters asked him about those comments, he dismissed them
as ridiculous, which they are given Rangers GM Doug Melvin's
reluctance to overpay for one player.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates acknowledged Monday before the game
that something was amiss in Juan's World.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan may go down as one of the more misunderstood superstars
of his era in baseball, and that would be a darn shame because he
is truly a special person,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez indeed is an enigma, more so now than ever. But as
Oates said, he's also a special person.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to let misinformation and
perception/reality problems obscure the fact that he remains one of
the most talented players in the game, perhaps the best ever to
pull on a Rangers uniform.

MLS RULES NEED TO BE CLEARER, SET EARLIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Major League Soccer executive vice president
Ivan Gazidis spent several months working out the endless details
in obtaining acclaimed striker Luis Hernandez from Tigres of the
Mexican first division.
</P>
<P>
   Gazidis might be spending several more weeks simply explaining
how the deal worked.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, whose flowing blond locks and uncanny scoring touch
made him the brightest star in Mexico, was targeted by MLS
officials as a huge potential fan draw for a league that has few
marquee names. Los Angeles, with a large fan base of
Mexican-Americans, was the obvious market in which to place
Hernandez. Hernandez's debut, against D.C. United on May 20, drew a
season-high crowd of 40,303 to the Rose Bowl; his second home game,
Saturday against San Jose, drew only 17,831.
</P>
<P>
   Few deny that sending Hernandez to the Galaxy makes sense, but
it's difficult to make any sense of the process the league used to
send him to LA.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, MLS' single-entity structure is at the root of the
situation. The league controls player movements and allocations.
And league investors would help pay the reported $4 million it cost
to acquire Hernandez only if he was sent to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Galaxy already had filled its four roster spots for
foreign players. The Galaxy tried to trade with San Jose to open an
allocation spot, but the Earthquakes didn't want Costa Rican Roy
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   So, MLS created another way for the Galaxy to offer compensation
and acquire Hernandez. Los Angeles would have to give up several
other players to even out the deal, and hence the league created
the ``dispersal draft'' to add to the new MLS lingo this season,
along with the ``Superdraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the dispersal draft: players released as
compensation go into a pool and are picked by teams in reverse
order from a combination of last year's and this year's results.
That way, the have-nots have a little better chance of improving.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process has been confusing at best and bewildering at
worst. Even individuals close to the Hernandez deal, such as Los
Angeles coach Sigi Schmid, seemed perplexed. Schmid had to inform
two of his players, Joey Franchino and Clint Mathis, that they were
released to make room for Hernandez. When the Hernandez deal
stalled, Schmid admitted he had no idea what would happen to
Franchino and Mathis should the deal fall through completely.
</P>
<P>
   Gazidis attempted to explain yesterday how the deal worked, and
maintained that the league did the best possible job in making a
potentially unfair deal as equitable as possible.
</P>
<P>
   However, all of the confusion could have been avoided had MLS
clearly identified the rules that should apply when a situation
such as Hernandez's acquisition arise. And with all the hype this
season about the league's bumper crop of foreigners, such rules
should have been established, agreed upon and explained before they
had to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more underlying theme to the Hernandez saga: as
flawed as it has been perceived by many fans, it's the basic
concept of the single-entity system. Fans might not understand it
or like it, but, unless they start going to games in much bigger
numbers, the structure is here to stay.

TCU MEN'S TRACK TEAM SHARES UNIQUE BOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They're buddies and will hook up to catch
the occasional movie, but they're not joined at the hip 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   They come from different parts of the state and globe, and
several used to live in the same apartment complex But this isn't
``Melrose Place/ or the ``Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   But something in this group of sprinters clicked off the track,
like no other group that TCU coach Monte Stratton has coached. Five
Texans and three Caribbean-born Texas transplants are proving that
in the often individual world of track and field, this sum is
greater than the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Today those eight set out to do what they came to TCU for, build
onto the ``Flyin' Frog'' tradition of world-class sprinters at the
NCAA Outdoor Championships, which run through Saturday on the Duke
campus in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the easiest group of sprinters I've ever worked with
in terms of being able to get along and the chemistry among the
group,'' said Stratton, completing his fifth year at TCU.
``Sprinters are notoriously high-strung and temperamental, and this
group I'm not saying doesn't have some of that, but this is the
best group as a whole for doing their work, working with each other
and actually trying to be a team.''
</P>
<P>
   For senior Johnny L. Collins II, a Wyatt graduate, the reason
these eight have come together so easily comes down to one word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitudes,'' said Collins, who will compete in the 400 meters
and the 4x400 relay. ``We're good friends. Nobody is going to cop
out on you. Usually you get a group that's very cocky, a lot of
egos, with people that want to slack and don't want to face the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of leaders, and everybody handles their own load.
Don't nobody want to let nobody down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but all the warm-and-fuzzies don't
mean a thing if the speedsters can't back it up with times and
medals. They have, winning the Western Athletic Conference Indoor
title, finishing fourth at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March
and placing second at the WAC Outdoors this month. The relay team
of Roy Williams, Anthony Amantine, Kendrick Campbell and Johnny L.
Collins II won TCU's first indoor 4x400 national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more depth in the sprints, 100 through 400, than
anytime that I've been here,'' Stratton said. ``We haven't run a
national record yet, but we haven't run at nationals yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the objective to not only have the talent, which
is the hardest part to recruit, but once we get the talent to have
the talent with the attitude in each individual's mind that they
want to be part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   At the WAC Outdoors, Darvis Patton won the long jump and
200-meter titles. The 4x100 relay (Lindel Frater, Ricardo ``Flash''
Williams, Patton and Kim Collins) ran away from the field to post
their best time of the season at 38.56 seconds. Kim Collins also
claimed the 100-meter crown but pulled up short with an injured
right groin muscle in the 200-meters final.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Collins' injury casts some doubt on the Frogs' 4x100 chances
this week. Collins has already been pulled out of the 100 and 200,
and though Stratton is planning on running him in the 4x100
semifinals this afternoon, it's possible Campbell will sub for
Collins. Collins, who has had round-the-clock treatment for the
past 10 days, would then have two more days to get ready for
Saturday's 4x100 finals. TCU needs to finish in the top eight today
to reach the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team isn't letting the injury to the team's top
jokester get them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel confident, even though Kim is banged up,''
Amantine said. ``We know if he can't do it, we can always put
somebody else in and still handle our business.''
</P>
<P>
   With strong performances at the Texas Relays and Penn Relays,
the Frogs had risen to as high as fourth nationally in the
/Trackwire/ rating service. The same rating service projects TCU to
score 17 points and finish just out of the top 10 this week.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton's concern isn't team standings but how his team does in
its specialty, the sprints and relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sprints, it's just like it was indoors, a role of the dice.
If you're on, you're a hero. If you're not, you're an also-ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sprinters come from various backgrounds, each said
they found a comfort zone quickly upon their arrival at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Texas high school standouts Campbell and Patton were teammates
at Garden City College in Kansas. Amantine, a Houston native,
competed against those two in Kansas at Barton County College.
</P>
<P>
   For Jamaicans Frater and ``Flash'' Williams, Fort Worth has been
a home away from home. Starting with Raymond Stewart and Andrew
Smith in the mid-1980s and through recent stars such as Percival
Spencer a distinguished line of Jamaican sprinters have shined at
TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I was in Jamaica, I always wanted to be here,''
Williams said. ``A lot of Jamaicans pass through TCU, and they
always did well. Percy came here and did well, Raymond came here
and did well, just to name a few. I just feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   Frater, also competing in the 100 and 200, echoed those words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tradition here,'' Frater said. ``This is some place I
wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Outdoor Championships is some place all eight wanted to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to perform, do the things we've done all year
long and take care of our business,'' Johnny Collins said. ``We're
ready and prepared, and preparation don't come without reward.''

MICROSOFT JUDGE SHOULD CONSIDER CONSUMERS' BEST INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Regardless of how anyone feels about Microsoft, it's
becoming increasingly difficult to see how the presiding judge's
approach to restructuring the company will help consumers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts raise a compelling question: If antitrust law's
purpose is to protect consumers, why is Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson seeking a remedy that may harm rather than help consumer
interests? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Justice Department trustbusters recommended splitting
Microsoft into two companies, the judge counterproposed a three-way
split. Justice's lead attorney David Boies, however, responded that
this would be time-consuming and have ``disruptive effects,'' not
only on Microsoft, but also on the entire software industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when Justice initially responded to Jackson's finding that
Microsoft was guilty of monopolizing the operating-system market,
its remedy of splitting the company in two was met with skepticism.
Critics generally claimed a breakup wouldn't heighten competition
in ways that could be expected to benefit consumers. Instead, the
resulting competition between two or three separate companies
probably would lead to higher prices by ending the cross-subsidies
of some products Microsoft employs to sell other products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, says New York University economist Nicholas
Economides, a separate browser company would have to charge for its
product, which Microsoft currently doesn't do. This would make
Internet access more expensive, he contended in a recent analysis
in The Wall Street Journal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the operational context, Economides predicts a period of
difficulty in the aftermath of any breakup. Each ``Baby Bill,'' as
the proposed new companies are characterized, would produce
separate versions of Windows, which probably wouldn't be
compatible. Information technology managers thus would be forced to
go through a long period of adjusting and readjusting until one new
operating system became dominant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another curious aspect of the Microsoft case is Jackson's
apparent desire to get it over with as soon as possible. While
nobody likes to see legal action drag on interminably, the target
is one of the most important components of the economy. If mistakes
are made in haste that have long-range debilitating results for
this critical industry, it could be to the economic detriment of
all Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seems a reasonable expectation for the presiding
judge to acknowledge his limitations in this matter. Jackson is far
from being an expert in information technology matters, and may be
relying on old-economy instincts ill-suited to dealing with
new-economy problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economides points out that some observers favor a Microsoft
breakup based on the declining price of long-distance calls after
AT&AMP;T's dismantling. It's not a good analogy, he says, because the
various components of ``the old Ma Bell empire'' were separate
entities with plenty of managers to oversee the restructuring.
Microsoft, on the other hand, is an integrated company with fewer
than a couple of dozen senior executives. So the talent pool
wouldn't be sufficient to man the new companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the NYU prof admonishes, it would be good for those involved
in deciding Microsoft's fate to remember whose interests they're
supposed to be serving. &QL;

IS NOTHING SACRED? INTERNATIONAL DISCONTENT ERUPTS OVER A COW
PARADE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Calif., Ill., Ohio, Conn.) By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't long ago that Americans, if they thought of
Switzerland at all, had visions of alpine meadows, chocolate and
fondue. But that was before the public relations debacle unleashed
by the failure by Swiss banks to return Holocaust victims' money to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   So the Swiss government needed something to improve its image.
It embraced fiberglass cows.
</P>
<P>
   Three fiberglass cow forms, mass-produced, life-size and
decorated by local artists, were set up on Zurich streets as a cow
parade in 1998. Tourists flocked to see them. Chicago copied the
idea. New York plans to follow suit in June.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, it seemed, was on its way to reclaiming its status
as a quaint if boring paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the hapless Swiss and their fiberglass cows have
stumbled from one mishap to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The first 50 cows, shipped over by a Swiss government foundation
last fall to be painted by children in New York public schools,
turned out to be made of a material that, when exposed to flame,
transformed the glossy figures into roman candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flashed and was gone in an instant,'' said Daniel Blume,
who went out to a Queens warehouse run by the city school system to
break off a piece of the imported cows and burn it. ``Black soot
came off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cows were swiftly shipped back, and the Swiss government
organization that had backed the event, the Coordinating Commission
for the Presence of Switzerland Abroad (known as CoCo in
Switzerland), pulled out of the New York cow parade. CoCo, which
was given $30 million by the Swiss government last year to improve
the country's image after the banking scandal, said that it did not
want to endanger the lives of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cows will be used in other countries,'' said Jacques
Reverdin, the Swiss consul general in New York, ``but certainly not
in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The American partner in the firm set up to organize New York's
cow parade, for which some 500 fiberglass cows will be on display
in all five boroughs, walked out on his Swiss partners, calling the
Swiss cows ``junk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't actually making them in Switzerland, but in
Bosnia,'' said Blume, a shareholder in the Cow Parade Holdings
Corp., an American company. ``One smart bomb could have taken out
our whole operation. The resin was of poor quality, there were no
metal supports. They could fall over on people. When you flipped
the reclining cow upside down it was hollow. It looked like a
bathtub. Someone could get trapped inside.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Swiss and American companies began producing competing
cows. Those for New York are made by plants in Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness goes on. The Swiss accuse Jerome D. Elbaum, a
Hartford lawyer and president of Cow Parade Holdings, of stealing
the international copyright for the cow parade. He responds that
the Swiss were impossible to work with and owe him money. And he
accuses his Swiss rivals of placing a spy in the company, and says
the spy secretly formed his own company to try to steal his
business. He said he discovered the espionage in April, when he
hired a security officer to seize the computer used by the man he
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that there are now four companies set up to run
cow parades: the original Swiss and American company; the rival
firms created by the Swiss and Elbaum; and the firm founded by
Marcus Naef, the man Elbaum fired.
</P>
<P>
   Naef, who denies spying, is now in Miami working with city
officials there to create a parade with a theme of flamingos or
dolphins. Cincinnati plans yet another spinoff: a ``porker''
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forms like flamingos and hogs will not produce
significant or lasting art, because the shapes of the animals are
wrong,'' said Elbaum, whose company will run the New York event.
``Flamingos do not have a large surface. A flamingo does not lend
itself to art. Cows are benign. They immediately attract art. You
speak to artists, serious artists, and they only want to paint
cows.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Into the fray comes Roland Muller, the Swiss artist who designed
the cows two years ago. He said this week he was considering a
court order to halt the New York cow parade for failing to pay him
for the use of his prototypes of cows grazing, walking and
reclining.
</P>
<P>
   Muller also dismissed the legitimacy of the companies that are
locked in the battle to secure rights to worldwide cow parades,
saying none of them have the legal authority to market his
creations. The cows belong to him, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the only person who has the rights to these cows,'' said
Muller, interviewed by phone from his home in Nafels, an hour from
Zurich. ``I gave the Zurich Chamber of Commerce the right to use
the cows in their parade in Zurich and the right to comply with any
contracts under negotiation at the time of the signing. They had a
contract, for example, to sell four cows to Arnold Schwarzenegger.
This was OK
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was to be notified and compensated for all future
events,'' Muller continued. ``I only learned about the Chicago cow
parade from the papers and never received a cent. I did not know
about the Hamburg parade until it was held, and no one has
contacted me about the cow parades in Arnhem and Salzburg. The
rights to these cows belong to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The four companies reject Muller's assertion, although the
artist, who specializes in fiberglass animals, said he spent two
months designing the three cow forms in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I placed them in my garden and my house to make sure they
would work,'' he said. ``I made sure the curves were rounded. I
gave them character. I gave them feelings. I did extensive testing
around the shadows they created. I wanted people to react to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But to his critics a cow is a cow is a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No artist made these,'' Elbaum said. ``They are replicas of
cows. They are anatomically correct. Someone had to make the molds,
but they are not stylized cows. They are Holstein dairy cows in
three different positions.''
</P>
<P>
   All the fuss, it must be acknowledged, is not entirely about
cows, art or the Swiss image. It is about the profits that come
with the parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another illustration of the failure by the Swiss to
understand the Americans, how they do business and American
culture,'' said Peter Hossli, a Swiss reporter in New York who
first wrote about the cow troubles for the Swiss weekly Cash. ``The
Swiss do not grasp the shrewdness of the Americans and the drive
they have to get things done.

 NEW YORK: things done.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In Switzerland, business is based on customs and personal
relationships. In New York it is based on legalities. The Swiss
lost out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected the Zurich cow parade to be much more than a local
event. Muller got a modest sum, about $15,000, for the cow models.
</P>
<P>
   But when the cows hit the streets of Zurich and local artists
decorated each one, the parade was a sensation. It generated about
$1 million in sales in Zurich shops.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago businessman, Peter Hanig, who saw the Zurich parade
arranged for it to come to Chicago. City authorities there
estimated that 40 million people saw the 300 cows in that parade,
decked out in everything from coiled rope to NASA space suits. The
event, retailers estimated, brought in $10 million. And the 140
cows auctioned off raised $3.5 million for charity.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chicago parade, Swiss lawyers representing the
retailer association in Zurich called Elbaum, and together they
formed a company, Cow Parade Holdings A.G. Elbaum, they said, was
brought on to make sure future cow parades paid for the rights to
use the sculptures and stage the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought me in to create a business,'' he said. ``No one
knew what it represented. They were interested in profit, not in
the art, the charitable aspect or investing funds.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elbaum received the 50 flammable cows, he said, he broke
with his Swiss partners to form his own company, the Cow Parade
Holdings Corp. The Swiss then formed a new entity called Cow Parade
Worldwide Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elbaum was brought in to register the rights of the cows and
the parade for the Swiss firm,'' said Naef, reached by phone in
Miami. ``He then registered it to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Naef's company is UrbanParade Holdings G.m.b.H. Kurt
Blickenstorfer, who runs Cow Parade Worldwide Inc. in Zurich and
worked with Elbaum in the original Cow Parade Holdings A.G., no
longer speaks to his former partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes my eyes go red,'' Blickenstorfer said. ``Elbaum used
the excuse of the flaming cows to justify his stealing of four cows
out of the stock of 50 we shipped to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where those cows were shipped to or where they
are now,'' Blickenstorfer said. ``They have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad what has happened. It is as if we had a baby and
someone took it from us. We have no influence anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbaum, who insists that he controls worldwide rights to all cow
parades, says the New York event will go ahead as planned. Sponsors
are being solicited for cows at $7,500 a head, with $2,000 going to
pay an artist to paint the cow. Artists are busy at two Manhattan
locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers,'' he said, ``will have a wonderful cow parade.''

CHANG REACHES BACK FOR PAST GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ He certainly did not look like a burned-out baseliner on
Monday as he dashed over to slap a forehand at full stretch, then
scuttled across the clay and hit a winning backhand lob at full
stretch over Adrian Voinea's head.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chang still looks like the Michael Chang you remember.
He has the ankle supports, the bulging calf muscles and the bowl
cut that only a mother or a monk could love. He still appears to
have the desire, too _ slapping himself on the thigh before and
after the exhausting exchanges that determined the outcome of his
first-round victory over Voinea at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Why is Chang no longer considered a Grand Slam threat? Why is he
in the top 50 instead of the top 10? Why was he playing his first
round here on Court 3, the Roland Garros equivalent of Off
Broadway, when his American peers, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras,
were scheduled on Center Court? Why? Why? Why?
</P>
<P>
   They are questions Chang has asked himself; and they have
emerged in active minds here, especially as rain Tuesday washed out
play at the French Open, the first time that poor weather has ever
forced the postponement of an entire day's matches at Roland
Garros.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive answers are not easy to come by; tennis is the sum of
a dozen parts, some of which cannot be measured with a stopwatch or
a stringing machine. But Chang does know that he still wants to
play, and that Jim Courier's recent retirement at age 29 is not
giving him any ideas at 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a belief and a faith that some great things are
still going to happen in my career,'' Chang said. ``If I didn't
believe that, it makes no sense for me to be out there, and on top
of that, I know this is a period of time that God wants me to
persevere through. Whether that means something down the line _ if
it means another Grand Slam championship or not _ is really not for
me to decide. I think if I were to walk away from the game knowing
that I still had that desire or that hope I would have regret for
the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like it would be so against my personality to have
this struggle in tennis and just give up. I know it's not me, not
who I am, and that would probably affect other parts of my life. If
you quit once, it's so much easier to quit the second, third,
fourth time.''
</P>
<P>
   So Chang soldiers on, winning slightly more matches than he
loses, which is a huge swing from the 10-year stretch between 1989
and 1998 when he won 541 and lost 198.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the fact he's still out here; he could have packed it
in, and he hasn't,'' said Larry Stefanki, the Californian who
coaches Yevgeny Kafelnikov. ``In the locker room, Chang is Mr.
Personality. It seems like he is still fresh. He's not fried, like
Courier was. And with all the big matches he's won over the years,
that means he's still dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang's decline probably started when he lost in the semifinals
of the 1997 U.S. Open to Patrick Rafter, the eventual champion, in
straight sets. What made it traumatic was that Sampras and Agassi
had already been eliminated, and Chang, then ranked No. 2 in the
world, was the clear favorite for the title. Chang has not been
past the third round in a Grand Slam event since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that match was definitely a very critical match in my
career,'' Chang said. ``Something happened the rest of the year. I
know I was pretty tired after that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, injuries to his left knee and right wrist knocked him
back further, but he struck bottom last year, and finished the
season at No. 50. The consensus on the tour was that Chang had lost
at least a step and considering that speed has always been his
biggest asset, it was a step in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely was a lot slower,'' Chang said. ``I knew it. And
it was really annoying, too. It's like one of those dreams you have
when someone is chasing you. You're running as fast as you can, and
someone's trotting behind you, just out of range, trying to grab
onto you.''
</P>
<P>
   His lost speed was a product not only of the 1998 knee injury
but his decision to bulk up with weight training in an attempt to
lift his way to No. 1. He has now given up the heavy weights.
``After the U.S. Open last year, I realized that I could try to
become the strongest guy I could possibly be and I still wouldn't
be the strongest guy out there,'' he said. ``I didn't take into
consideration that the extra strength would make me slower, and it
hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   He may still be slower than at his peak, but Stefanki does not
believe foot speed was as instrumental in Chang's fall as lost
control. ``I think he tried to change his game,'' he said. ``The
guy is a grinder. He won the French by grinding, and they tried to
make him into a shot maker, to make him go for too much. You can't
turn a Mats Wilander into a Sampras. But they made that decision as
a family, and it cost them.''
</P>
<P>
   His family remains primordial with Chang. He and his older
brother Carl, who has coached him since 1991, own houses on Mercer
Island near Seattle, where they often share a fishing boat and
Michael does an occasional shift as a baby-sitter for Carl's
daughter, Katherine. Their parents, Betty and Joe, who live in
Southern California, remain part of the decision-making process,
and despite Michael's extended slump, Team Chang remains intact. At
Carl's suggestion, though, they have brought in Jay Bosworth, son
of the American stringing expert Warren Bosworth, to provide
counsel on this European swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sat down as a family and have looked at changing,''
Michael said of Carl's role.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Team Chang will have to settle for something not quite
as lofty: the second round at Roland Garros. &QL;

JUSTICES WILL RULE ON CASE OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS VS. CORPORATIONS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case pitting environmentalists against
corporations, the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to decide whether
federal regulators must consider the financial concerns of
businesses before requiring them to take expensive steps to reduce
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' action followed their decision last week to
consider whether the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its
authority under the 1990 Clean Air Act when it imposed strict
limits on the allowable levels of ozone, an essential part of smog.
A federal appeals court has ruled that the agency went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the balance in the court's first major environmental
case in several years &UR;  &LR; is whether the federal government can
tighten rules to reduce smog or if it must give greater
consideration to corporate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render by July 2001 its decision
on EPA's authority and the impact of business costs on agency
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake is a critical national program to protect our
children, the elderly and our communities from harmful air
pollution,'' said Vickie Patton, senior attorney of Environmental
Defense, referring to the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Conrad, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's litigation division, hailed as ``a great day for us''
the justices' willingness to consider whether EPA must weigh the
financial impact of its regulations on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the justices refused to hear the appeals of two
former state employees who claim Texas health agencies cheated the
federal government of millions of dollars. The court's refusal to
hear the cases leaves it to the U.S. Justice Department alone to
decide whether to pursue the workers' claims that the agencies
failed to comply with rules governing Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said the agency has
not decided whether to press ahead with lawsuits against the Texas
Health Department and the Texas Tech University Health Science
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's refusal, without comment, to hear the Texas
cases followed its May 22 decision that federal law bars states
from being sued by citizens who claim agencies have cheated the
U.S. government. The court's ruling, however, left unresolved
whether the government can sue states under the False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the EPA case, the justices agreed to consider the arguments
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking
Associations that the agency had a duty to consider the financial
impact its clean-air regulations would have on truckers and other
industries that contribute to smog.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will weigh the cost issue as part of their review
of a lower court decision that prevented EPA from enforcing its
regulations. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia ruled last year that the EPA interpreted the Clean Air Act
``so loosely'' as to give the agency more authority than Congress
intended it to have.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' ruling won't affect Houston's obligation to bring
ozone levels below an older, less stringent standard by 2007.

 &HT;    N.Y. underdog Lazio picks up GOP's colors
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ His opponent is usually painted as the ambitious
one, but Rick Lazio displayed some reach of his own here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans formally named Lazio their U.S. Senate nominee
at their biannual convention, ending a tumultuous 11-day period in
which the fourth-term Long Island congressman went from not even
being a candidate to competing in the country's most closely
watched Senate race. Plunging into the void created by New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's sudden withdrawal as the Republican
candidate and running against first lady HIllary Rodham Clinton,
the 42-year-old Lazio might have been expected to proceed a bit
tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhgeddaboudit! He came out swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the underdog in this race,'' Lazio told convention
delegates with a grin that suggested he wasn't very upset at all,
sizing up his opposition in Mrs. Clinton. ``She comes to New York
with the support of every left wing special interest group, from
Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite. But as I've said
before: `Bring 'em on.'''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. Entering the downtown hotel ballroom where he
was nominated to the stirring theme song from ``Rocky,'' Lazio
promised delegates that he would fight for his Senate seat ``house
by house.'' He then dashed over to the nearby Triple-A baseball
team's stadium to wave from high atop the grandstand as his newly
christened campaign bus was unveiled to hundreds of supporters and
a few bemused Buffalo Bisons players. A few hours later, Lazio left
town aboard the ``Mainstream Express'' for a three-day, nine-city
campaign swing around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fat lip he got from a tumble during a Memorial Day
parade was offered as further evidence of his good humor and
dedication to campaigning in the face of what many consider
daunting odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of pounding the pavement, but this is ridiculous,''
said Lazio, who received eight stitches Monday and then marched in
a second parade. ``I want a rematch!''
</P>
<P>
   Such enthusiasm clearly is music for New York Republicans, who
saw their hopes for a high-profile win over the first lady in the
Nov. 7 election seemingly diminished less than two weeks ago by
Giuliani's withdrawal due to health and marital problems. Lazio
quickly stepped up _ indeed, he had planned to run until New York
Gov. George Pataki persuaded him to give way to Giuliani last
August. But Mrs. Clinton clearly had a head start in terms of
fundraising, campaigning and, it seemed, voter sentiment: In a poll
taken before Giuliani dropped out, Mrs. Clinton led Lazio by 14
points in a hypothetical matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time the 400 delegates arrived here Tuesday, Lazio
had effectively closed the gap. He and Mrs. Clinton now are in a
statistical dead heat according to the same pollster, Zogby
International.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could have predicted he'd have such a
good week,'' said David Hansen, political director of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, whose organization was filming the
scene at the baseball stadium for future use in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What Lazio has done so far, and what he and fellow Republicans
continued to do at the convention Tuesday, was pound home the image
of the first lady as a carpetbagger pausing in New York just long
enough to pick up a Senate seat on her inevitable march to the Oval
Office. Seconding Lazio's nomination, fellow Republican congressman
John Sweeney was not the first speaker to assure delegates that
Mrs. Clinton was ``more interested in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, meanwhile, never mentioned his opponent by name or her
alleged ambition to someday run for president. Just minutes before
informing his audience that he rejected ``ripping into
challengers'' and ``politics of discord and division,'' however,
Lazio made sure they knew exactly where he was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, New York is not just a mailing address,'' Lazio said
to an outburst of cheers and laughter. ``It's my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lazio also used part of his 27-minute acceptance speech to
draw attention to his nearly eight years in Washington. Having
garnered bipartisan support for important legislation in areas such
as cancer treatment and senior citizen housing, he said, he would
do more of the same to protect Social Security, lower taxes and
expand access to affordable health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this may have been in response to the Clinton campaign,
which already has begun to depict Lazio as too inexperienced and
conservative to represent New York in the Senate. On the other
hand, his speech included no mention of either abortion or gun
control, issues on which he is to the right of Mrs. Clinton, and
even Giuliani to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among many delegates, there was an unmistakable sense of
satisfaction at having come up with the strongest candidate, not
just the one with the best name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Rudy's not running, because I don't think he would
have won,'' said Helen Kiggins, an attorney and delegate from
Syracuse, who sported a campaign button with a line drawn through
Mrs. Clinton's face. ``And I don't think people would have been as
excited to be here today.''

GRAZED BY PROTESTER'S PIE, AGRICULTURE CHIEF SERVES UP A QUIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretary of agriculture had just begun to
speak at the opening session of the National Nutrition Summit here
Tuesday when an animal rights protester leaped onto the stage and
threw a pie at him.
</P>
<P>
   The protester's message was loud and clear: ``Shame on you, Dan
Glickman, you meathead. Shame on you for promoting meat.'' But her
aim was off. Glickman ducked, and the pie _ either apple or tofu
cream, depending on who was asked _ grazed the back of his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   As Glickman, a former Democratic congressman member from Kansas,
peeled off his jacket, he didn't miss a beat: ``That was not a very
balanced meal she threw at me.'' Then he turned to former Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan., who was also on the stage, and said, ``Bob, I don't
think we're in Kansas anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman was one of the speakers at the meeting, convened 31
years after the original White House Conference on Food Nutrition
and Health, which was instrumental in starting many of the
government food assistance programs like Head Start and the school
breakfast program.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Glickman announced that the government had decided to
test two of the nation's most popular diets _ low carbohydrate and
low fat _ to see which is more effective and safer. Millions of
Americans have tried one of the diets or a variation, including the
high-protein, low-carbohydrate regimen developed by the
cardiologist Robert Atkins and the low-fat diet promoted by Dean
Ornish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pie thrower, Arathi Jayaram, 24, who lives in northern
Virginia, is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. She was carried out by a member of Glickman's security
team.
</P>
<P>
   Jayaram was charged with assault of a Cabinet official. The
charge carries a recommended penalty of up to a year in jail, but
there is no category in federal sentencing guidelines for assault

ROBERT P. CASEY, EX-GOVERNOR of PENNSYLVANIA, DIES AT 68  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert P. Casey, the governor of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1994,
whose strong opposition to abortion put him at odds with his
Democratic Party, died Tuesday in Scranton, Pa., where he lived. He
was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an infection.
</P>
<P>
   Casey helped to draw national attention to organ donations after
his life was saved by a rare heart and liver transplant in 1993,
when he was still governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Casey made his national reputation as an anti-abortion
politician. In 1992, he sought to give a speech against abortion at
the Democratic National Convention in New York but was turned down
by the party's leadership. Ron Brown, who was then the Democratic
national chairman, said of Casey's abortion stance: ``We have a
fundamental disagreement with him on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Goodman, the television critic of The New York Times,
wrote that Casey ``was not permitted on camera for fear that his
sour note on abortion would disturb the symphony of unity'' at the
convention, which was on its way toward nominating Bill Clinton of
Arkansas for president.
</P>
<P>
   In a book he wrote after he left office called ``Fighting for
Life'' (Word Books, 1996), Casey said that buttons depicting him as
the pope were sold at the convention by abortion-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was simply a case of anti-Catholic bigotry,'' he
wrote. ``What was going on here? What had become of the Democratic
Party I once knew?''
</P>
<P>
   Casey also complained of commentators who were quick to mention
his Catholicism. ``Because I'm pro-life,'' he wrote, ``my religion
is always thrown in there like some little code word to the reader
saying `Watch out for this guy. He's a Catholic. He's one of those
people.'''
</P>
<P>
   As governor he signed a law in 1989 imposing a 24-hour waiting
period for abortions in Pennsylvania. Planned Parenthood sued, and
the law ended up being argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in
1992. The Court upheld the waiting period even as it affirmed the
right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Casey was told that he had a life-threatening disease,
amyloidosis, which caused his liver to produce an abnormal protein
that built up in the walls of his heart, weakening it. Four years
earlier he had quadruple bypass surgery after a heart attack, and
although he recovered, his health continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he received a murder victim's heart and liver in an
experimental operation that took 15 hours at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   He got the organs just hours after his name was put on a waiting
list for donor organs. By comparison, the United Network for Organ
Sharing said the median wait for a liver transplant was 67 days and
for a heart transplant 198 days.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Armitage, who performed the heart transplant, said
Casey received the organs because his ``life was in imminent
danger'' and that the operation was his last chance to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was barred by state law from seeking a third term. After
he left the statehouse in Harrisburg, he resumed his law practice
and became a public advocate for organ donations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Patrick Casey was born in the Jackson Heights section of
Queens, N.Y., on Jan. 9, 1932. His family moved when he was young
to Scranton, where his father, Alphonsus, worked as a coal miner
before becoming a lawyer at the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   Casey attended Holy Cross College on a basketball scholarship,
graduating in 1953, and then went on to George Washington
University Law School, where he earned his law degree in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was elected state senator and auditor general but was
defeated three times in the Democratic primary when he ran for
governor. He finally won his party's nomination for governor in
1986 and was expected to lose to the Republican candidate, William
W. Scranton 3rd, who was then the lieutenant governor and who
carried an illustrious name in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the smart guys said I would lose,'' Casey said. ``I was 17
points down in August and the other guy was the son of a former
governor, son of an ambassador. He had $1 million. I didn't have a
penny. But I never doubted I would win.''
</P>
<P>
   He won narrowly, his victory ascribed to a commercial that said
that Scranton's ``only real job was lieutenant governor, and they
gave him that because of his father's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey was a popular governor and was re-election in 1990,
defeating his Republican opponent by more than 1 million votes, the
largest margin in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his differences with his party over abortion, Casey
remained a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Republican Party is concerned, the business of
government is business,'' he said in an interview with The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette shortly before leaving office. ``That's
their agenda. That's their opening act, and their closing act and
their in-between act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the executors of business policy. I mean, look at the
agenda. Do they talk about children's health insurance? Hell, no.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview in The Washington Times, Casey described
himself as a conservative Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Van Dyk, a longtime Democratic analyst, disagreed with
that definition. ``I wouldn't call Bob Casey a conservative
Democrat,'' he said.`` I would call him a moderate-to-liberal
Democrat who has a conservative stance on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey tried to establish universal health care for every
resident of Pennsylvania, but failed. He did sign a bill providing
health insurance for children whose families were too poor to pay
for it but whose incomes were too high to be eligible for public
medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1988, a Casey plan that required most residents to
separate their trash for recycling was approved, making
Pennsylvania the largest state to require recycling. He also got
the Legislature to approve a hazardous-site cleanup law.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Ellen Theresa Harding;
four daughters, Margi McGrath, Mary Ellen Philbin, Kate Brier, Erin
Walsh,; four sons, Robert Jr., Christopher, Patrick and Matthew;
and numerous grandchildren.

   FOR BUSH, GREEN PASTURES OUT WEST
</P>
<P>
   Some are lush and others are arid, but all of the stops on Gov.
George W. Bush's four-day trek through the West will prove fertile
_ with money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, reaped an
estimated $100,000 for his campaign at a luncheon in Denver on
Tuesday and was expected to raise $300,000 for the Republican
National Committee and $125,000 for the state Republican Party in
New Mexico at a reception in Albuquerque on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, after visits to Arizona and Nevada as well, Bush
should collect $350,000 for his campaign, $200,000 for state
Republican organizations and about $2 million for the national
committee, campaign officials said. They said Bush would raise $1.3
million in regulated ``hard money'' for the committee and at least
several hundred thousand dollars in largely unregulated ``soft
money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AD ADVISORY
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush is turning to an executive of one of the
nation's best-known advertising agency, Young &AMP; Rubicam, for
creative suggestions on television commercials. Jim Ferguson, the
advertising agency's chief creative officer, has accepted an
unpaid, advisory role in the campaign, said Stuart Stevens, a
Republican consultant and a member of Maverick Media, the
advertising arm of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tremendous respect for what these guys do, and there
are skills they have that are almost uniquely suited to a
presidential campaign,'' Stevens said. Ferguson will assemble an
informal group of people in New York who may be asked to help write
Bush's television commercials, Stevens said. Ferguson, through an
assistant, declined to comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRAISE FROM McCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's recent statements on arms-control policy,
missile defense and trade with China have drawn hearty praise from
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. In an op-ed article in Tuesday's Wall
Street Journal, McCain applauded Bush for embracing
internationalist positions that benefit America's interests. Now if
only more Republicans in Congress would follow Bush's lead, McCain
lamented, citing the Senate's vote to reject setting a deadline to
withdraw ground troops from Kosovo. Only 15 Senate Republicans,
including McCain, backed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   GORTON TAKES TO THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., formally began his re-election
campaign with a five-day bus tour of the state. Gorton, 72, vowed
to make the rising cost of prescription drugs a centerpiece of his
campaign. He has introduced a bill that would bar drug
manufacturers from charging Americans more for prescriptions than
they charge patients in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the issue is a smoke screen for Gorton's failure
to take on corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   A September primary will determine Gorton's Democratic opponent.
That race pits the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn,
against former Rep. Maria Cantwell, an Internet executive.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Jon S. Corzine acknowledged Tuesday that he had
paid at least $200,000 for a lawyer who had private investigators
conduct an inquiry into Jim Florio, his opponent in the Democratic
primary for Senate, and members of Florio's campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   After an article in The Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday
reported on the inquiry, Corzine, former chairman of Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co., said he ordered his lawyer in February to investigate his
complaints that his wife and children had received prank telephone
calls earlier in the year and saw photographers trying to take
pictures through the windows of the family home in Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said that when he discovered about a month ago that his
lawyer, Stanley Arkin, had hired a private investigating company to
check out members of Florio's staff, he ordered the inquiry to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   But Florio, angered by what he called an invasion of privacy,
said Tuesday that the questions posed by the investigators were
clearly intended to dig up salacious details about his personal
life in an effort to smear his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he had received complaints from several staff
members and former employees who had been asked for personal
``dirt'' about him and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Florio demanded an apology from Corzine
and said his rival's Wall Street values and his free-spending
campaign, which has already laid out more than $30 million, were
bringing a new level of incivility to New Jersey's rough-and-tumble
politics. `` Corzine will pay anything, say anything, and now we
find out, do anything, regardless of what is acceptable to get
elected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's admission that he used a private investigator has
prompted the latest flare-up in a bitter battle for the Democratic
nomination for the U.S. Senate. Corzine has shattered all records
for spending in a primary, and much of that money has paid for a
series of advertisements attacking Florio's record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's campaign has also been true to his reputation for
combativeness, and in a series of news conferences, faxes and
television ads, Florio has accused Corzine of everything from
raiding employees' pension funds to taking part in a pipeline deal
that benefits the ruling party in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a common, and accepted, practice for political
candidates to assign staff members to research their rivals, the
use of private investigators is controversial because such
investigators are not directly supervised by campaign staff members
and often pride themselves on using intimidation or deception to
gain information.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of political candidates and their surrogates
have turned to private investigators in recent years, from
President Clinton and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to scores of local
officials. But many government watchdog groups say it is a practice
best avoided, because private investigators are often difficult to
control and the public regards many of them as unscrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets close to the old dirty-trick situation from
Watergate,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center
for Public Integrity. ``You get a group of people skulking around
in the process. You don't know who they are, what they're getting
paid or what they'll do to get information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public perceives it as over the line, an invasion of
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he first heard complaints several months ago, when a
former employee called to report that a private investigator had
asked for ``anything negative about Jim Florio.'' Since then,
George E. Norcross 3rd, a South Jersey political leader and
important ally of Florio, said he was told by several state
Democratic Party officials that the Corzine campaign had hired
private detectives to follow him. George Zoffinger, Florio's
campaign treasurer, said he too had been warned by friends in the
Corzine campaign that he was being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who work for Corzine who told me to watch out
because I'm on the enemies list and they were going to send the
private eyes after me,'' said Zoffinger, the commerce commissioner
during Florio's term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he did not publicly complain about the
investigations earlier because he wanted to find documented
evidence that the Corzine campaign had hired a private security
company. When the Corzine campaign released its spending report
with the Federal Election Commission last week, it showed $200,000
in payments to Stanley S. Arkin, a prominent New York lawyer, and
Corzine's aides have since confirmed that part of the money paid
for private detectives. Florio said the use of private detectives
was ``despicable'' and ``disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin did not return calls requesting comment. James Mintz,
owner of the private security concern contracted by the Corzine
campaign, also did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine aides denied that the investigators had put anyone
under surveillance, saying that their inquiry was aimed solely at
determining whether Florio's supporters had been harassing the
Corzine family.

RULING ENDS LONG DISPUTE OVER CHRISTMAS TREE FARM...FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Santa Claus has to peek through the trees
these days.
</P>
<P>
   You can see him if you drive slowly down a gravel road southeast
of Kansas City. The giant Santa used to tower over the scotch
pines, but the limbs now reach his red cap and hide his smile.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting, because if this Santa could talk, what a tragic tale of
Christmas he could tell.
</P>
<P>
   The war on Christmas Tree Lane was fought at his feet. Hayride
wagons and mechanical tree wrappers now sit abandoned like
burned-out tanks on a battleground. Orphaned trees, long neglected,
fight for growing room on crowded hills.
</P>
<P>
   A family was destroyed. People died over the 20 years, including
the man who planted the first tree in 1957. A vibrant fellow who
commanded a submarine in World War II and was a champion wrestler,
Oscar Urquhart, died timid and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   A circuit judge recently ruled in the two-decade battle over
ownership of Christmas Tree Lane in rural Cass County, just off
Missouri 7 between Pleasant Hill and Harrisonville. The business
was one of the first and largest ``pick and cut'' farms in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Who won?
</P>
<P>
   Elvin Douglas, an attorney in the case, chuckled and shook his
head at the question. Three boxes of legal files stand as testament
to the struggle's duration.
</P>
<P>
   Then Douglas turned grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody won,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not Oscar and Genie Urquhart, who started the farm. Not Genie's
daughter, Jackie Miller, who fought them for the land. And not
Carolyn and Leonard Whiting, friends of the Urquharts who took up
the fight against Miller, but who are now at odds with Genie
Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision was a wash _ both sides were awarded similar
amounts. And that may be the biggest tragedy of all, said Robert
Gentry, Miller's son.
</P>
<P>
   Had the judge deemed one side a clear winner, the feud that tore
his family apart may have made some sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family worked that land for more than a century, and now
it's all gone,'' Gentry said by telephone from his home in Oxford,
Ohio. ``I used to spend summers there when I was a boy. It was a
fun and exciting time when they started planting the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Americana. To have it degenerate the way it did was so
sad and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny...it was all over Christmas trees, and a Christmas tree
is kind of a holy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Urquhart was worthy of family legend.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1906, he joined the Navy at 17 and served as a submarine
commander in the South Pacific in World War II. He was a champion
wrestler and a deep-sea diver who specialized in underwater
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   After Oscar left the Navy in 1954, he and his wife, Genie,
retired to the Cass County farm where he was born. They had a dream
to build the largest Christmas tree farm in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, they planted the first trees on the 120-acre spread.
Gentry remembers those early days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seemed to be so much going on back then,'' said Gentry,
who grew up in San Diego. ``I couldn't wait for summer to arrive so
I could get to the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The first trees were harvested in 1963. Before long, a trip to
Christmas Tree Lane was an annual rite for many area families.
</P>
<P>
   Business boomed in the 1970s. The hills were green with scotch
pines. And every year, thousands more were planted.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, though, Oscar Urquhart was tired and ailing.
So the couple persuaded Genie's daughter, Jackie Miller, to take
over the business. According to court records, the couple sold the
farm to Miller with the agreement that they would all share the
profits and the Urquharts would stay in their home.
</P>
<P>
   But Genie Urquhart began to worry that her daughter was
attempting to squeeze her and her husband out. In 1981, the
Urquharts sued Miller, contending that they owned half the business
and should get half the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Miller disagreed and contended she was sole owner.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in 1984 ruled in favor of the Urquharts. The judge's
order divided the farm into two 60-acre tracts, separated by a
gravel road that bisected the property.
</P>
<P>
   The Urquharts received the northern half with the condition they
not sell trees. Miller received the southern half.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year Miller sued, again insisting the entire farm
was hers.
</P>
<P>
   As the case went back and forth, an irreparable rift in the
family developed.
</P>
<P>
   Though only a few hundred yards separated their homes, they
never spoke. Not even when Miller worked on trees in her mother's
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '80s, sales at Christmas Tree Lane began to falter.
According to court records, 6,117 trees were sold in 1988, but only
4,391 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Urquharts were ready to leave. Then age 84,
Oscar was in failing health and suffered severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a neighbor, Carolyn Whiting, and her sister, Bonnie
Wesemann, entered the picture. They said they loved the Urquharts
like family and offered to take up the fight against Miller.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, 1990, the Urquharts conveyed the north 60 and all
rights to Whiting and Wesemann, who used the name BCC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble escalated on Thanksgiving 1991 when Whiting and Wesemann
began to sell trees from the northern half of the farm, an act
which, a judge would say later, violated the 1984 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides manned the roads and tried to direct tree shoppers to
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty Cass County deputies were hired to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   The two businesses went head to head through 1994, when BCC
ended its operation. By that time, Wesemann had sold her interest
in BCC to Whiting's husband, Leonard Whiting.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear who won the tree wars. According to court records,
both sides lost money over those years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller quit after the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   She was always reluctant to talk about her parents but in 1995
said: ``They're living somewhere in Oklahoma. We don't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a trial was held in Cass County Circuit Court in
Harrisonville. Judge William Roberts combined all the lawsuits into
a single case.
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, he announced his rulings. He awarded damages
of $103,184 to the Whitings and $107,651 to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have appealed. Genie Urquhart isn't involved in the
litigation anymore, but she's not happy, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now 89 and living in Duncan, Okla., with another daughter, she
contends that the Whitings never paid her what they agreed to when
they acquired the north 60. According to Urquhart, BCC agreed to
pay her $180,000 for the property, but has paid only $66,000.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, the Whitings' attorney, agreed that the $180,000 had
not been fully paid but said the price was based on the Whitings
collecting money from Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitings have paid Genie what they have been required to
pay,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Genie Urquhart has not talked to her daughter in more than 20
years. Oscar Urquhart died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a strong, strong man, and I have no doubts he would
still be alive if not for all of this,'' Genie Urquhart said. ``I
know it killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitings initially declined to comment for this article, but
later Carolyn Whiting sent a fax to The Kansas City Star that said
in part: ``One thing that I've learned in life is, you cannot
control how people feel or what they say. Life is so very short,
you cannot worry about things you cannot change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Miller, whose husband also died over the course of the
fight, could not be contacted.
</P>
<P>
   John Milholland, the attorney who fought her fight the longest,
also has died. Her current attorney, Kevin Anderson, was out of
town and could not be contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, the older of Miller's two sons, said his mother had
health problems and recently underwent a leg amputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tough, tenacious woman...just like my grandmother,''
Gentry said. ``Those were the qualities that made Christmas Tree
Lane successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the end, those were the qualities that destroyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Miller, Gentry said, still lives with her other son in
the red gingerbread house at the edge of Christmas Tree Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the south about a quarter mile, Santa peeks through the
trees.

KNIGHT SAYS HE DID NOT APOLOGIZE TO PRESIDENT OF INDIANA  
 BY JOE DRAPE  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a nationally televised interview Tuesday, Bob Knight said he
met privately with Indiana University's president, Myles Brand, to
discuss behavioral guidelines and not to apologize for embarrassing
behavior on the eve of a trustees board meeting earlier this month.
He also refused to acknowledge grabbing a former player by the
throat despite a widely broadcast videotape showing that he did and
insisted he did not need professional counseling for anger
management.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public remarks since Brand's May 15 announcement
that Knight would remain the Hoosier coach under ``zero tolerance''
guidelines, the coach conceded he had a problem with his temper,
but said he was confident that he could keep it under control.
Knight also said he was ``never close'' to resigning at any point
in the seven-week investigation of his behavior that galvanized
public opinion within Indiana and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Knight promised he would adjust his behavior and said he was
doing so for his players as well as for the support shown by Brand,
who he said made a tough but fair decision to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an obligation to that president, Myles Brand, to show
he was right,'' said Knight in a live interview on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, however, appeared to contradict Brand about what
occurred at a May 13 meeting at the president's home in
Bloomington. Brand had said he was leaning toward firing Knight but
was swayed by how ``contrite and apologetic'' the coach was about
several incidents _ including intimidating a secretary in the
athletic department with foul language and by throwing a vase, as
well as arguments and physical altercations with colleagues and
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said he did not go to the two-hour meeting to apologize
and indicated that Brand wanted him to remain at Indiana; he wanted
to stay so the discussion was focused on future guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had not viewed the videotape of a 1997 practice
that shows Knight grabbing former player Neil Reed by the throat.
The incident ignited the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't choked anybody. I've never choked anybody,'' said
Knight, though the investigation by two Indiana University trustees
concluded that Knight grabbed the former player for 2.3 seconds, as
well as engaged in a a ``pattern of inappropriate behavior'' that
had embarrassed the university.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the strict guidelines, the university fined
Knight $30,000 and suspended him for three regular-season games in
the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Knight also insisted Tuesday that he did not need professional
counseling for anger management, though he reiterated an
acknowledgment, contained in an earlier written apology, that his
temper had often gotten the best of him. He said he had been
working on it with the help of his wife, Karen, and said he did not
anticipate a future incident that would lead to his termination. &QL;

ROBERT FRYER IS DEAD AT 79; A PRODUCER OF BROADWAY HITS

 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Fryer, the producer or co-producer of many
Broadway hits including ``Wonderful Town,'' ``Auntie Mame'' and its
musical adaptation ``Mame,'' ``Sweet Charity,'' ``Chicago'' and
``Noises Off,'' died on Sunday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was
79 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said the
producer Martin Richards.
</P>
<P>
   A distinguished man of the theater, Fryer not only presented
shows, he also often invented them, or at least brought together a
subject and artists who could transform an idea into a success. His
shows won dozens of Tony awards in various categories, and he
himself won three as producer _ for ``Wonderful Town,'' ``Redhead''
(with Lawrence Carr) and ``Sweeney Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Wonderful Town,'' in 1953, Fryer bought the rights to the
play ``My Sister Eileen'' by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and
to the original Ruth McKenney stories on which the play was based.
Then he told George Abbott that Rosalind Russell had agreed to star
in the musical, and he told Russell that Abbott would be the
director. Neither had yet been signed, but both agreed to do the
musical, as did Leonard Bernstein as composer, and Betty Comden and
Adolph Green as lyricists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful Town,'' which ran for 559 performances on Broadway,
won a Tony award as best musical and a Tony for Russell as best
actress in a musical. In 1959 Fryer produced a television version,
again starring Russell. Since then the show has been revived
frequently, most recently at City Center in the Encores series, a
production that may reopen next season on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer's role was similar with his first production, ``A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn'' in 1951. He and Abbott acquired the rights to
the Betty Smith novel, Arthur Schwartz and Dorothy Fields wrote the
score, and Shirley Booth became the star. Both Russell and Booth
returned to work again for Fryer, Russell in ``Auntie Mame,'' Booth
in ``Desk Set'' and ``By the Beautiful Sea.'' Gwen Verdon, another
Fryer star, was in ``Redhead'' and ``Sweet Charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fryer was best known for musicals, he also produced
plays: ``Advise and Consent,'' two by Neil Simon (``California
Suite'' and ``Biloxi Blues'') and three by Michael Frayn (``Noises
Off,'' ``Wild Honey'' and ``Benefactors'').
</P>
<P>
   For many years, his career focused on Broadway, but he was also
a film producer, including ``The Boston Strangler,'' ``The Prime of
Jean Brodie'' (with Maggie Smith), ``Mame'' (with Lucille Ball) and
``The Shining.'' From 1971 to 1988 he was the director of the
Ahmanson Theater at the Los Angeles Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer was born in Washington, graduated from Western Reserve
University in Cleveland and served with the U.S. Army during World
War II. He is survived by a sister, Eleanor Massell, of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He began his theatrical training with Richard Aldrich and
Abbott. After working at CBS television as casting director, he
moved to Broadway, where he often produced in collaboration with
Lawrence Carr.

2 CHEMISTS WIN AWARD FOR UNLOCKING VITAMIN MYSTERY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two chemists who decoded the blueprints for the
manufacture of many of nature's most beneficial products, including
vitamin B-12, are co-recipients of the 2000 Welch Award.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M University Professor Ian Scott, 72, and University of
Cambridge Professor Emeritus Alan Battersby, 75, were instrumental
in unlocking secrets of biosynthesis and bio-organic chemistry _
how nature makes products _ and learning how to re-create that work
in the test tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``These insights set the stage for further efforts to mimic
nature and produce vitamins, antibiotics and other beneficial
products in a shorter time and with less cost in terms of both
money and impact on the environment,'' said Richard J.V. Johnson,
chairman of the Welch Foundation and chairman and publisher of the
Houston Chronicle. ``The work of Drs. Battersby and Scott truly
embodies the spirit of the Welch Award: basic research in chemistry
that contributes to the betterment of humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welch Award, one of chemistry's most prestigious prizes,
goes to chemists whose lifetime contributions in basic research
have had a positive influence on mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The two chemists' selection will be announced at a luncheon
Wednesday at Texas A&AMP;M in College Station. They will share the
award's $300,000 prize and will receive a gold medallion at a
banquet in Houston in October.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scott and Battersby, who've never worked together, said the
award was a great recognition not only of their own work but of the
field of bio-organic chemistry, which straddles the border between
chemistry and biology and has never received the recognition of
many other chemistry branches. Nevertheless, the two scientists'
work previously earned them the Tetrahedron Prize, another
chemistry award, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a friendly competition that lasted nearly 30 years, Scott and
Battersby pursued the decoding of vitamin B-12, a large,
complicated molecule that assists essential biochemical processes
but cannot be made in the body. The two scientists worked on
parallel tracks, which Scott compared to ``going up a mountain from
two sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biosynthesis of B-12 is such a difficult feat, it was
great to have independent confirmation,'' said Scott, who was born
in Glasgow, Scotland, and came to A&AMP;M in 1977. ``What was
interesting was that even though neither of us knew where to start,
we both ended up doing many of the same experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of B-12 involved identifying 22 steps and 22 genes,
the most of any vitamin. People unable to absorb B-12 suffer
pernicious anemia, which slows the rate at which healthy red blood
cells form and thus prevents oxygen from being transported
efficiently around the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying how a living system makes a molecule is like building
a cathedral,'' said Battersby, who has continued his research since
his retirement in 1992. ``B-12 was the biggest challenge, but the
entire field is like a supermarket with fundamental chemical
problems stacked on its shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Scott also discovered a second process nature uses to make B-12.
The two pathways evolved 2 billion years apart.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the discovery by Scott and Battersby, scientists are
now able to increase the speed and production of B-12. And, in
principle, they say, it should lead to the creation of almost any
kind of molecule _ so scientists will no longer have to damage
ecosystems to make products.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scott and Battersby began studying synthetic organic
chemistry in Great Britain in the early 1960s. Scott studied
penicillin and anti-tumor agents, Battersby morphine and other
alkaloids.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based Welch Foundation, established in 1954 by the
estate of Houston oilman Robert A. Welch, has provided more than
$411 million to support basic research in chemistry.

CITY BLOCKS FURNITURE STORE'S OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECILIA CHAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Reeds had to cancel the long-planned
Memorial Day weekend opening of its Canwood Street furniture outlet
after the city refused to issue a certificate of occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   The point of contention is whether owners of the furniture store
must pay the estimated $100,000 cost of burying some nearby power
lines, said David Merrihugh, a Westlake Village attorney
representing Reeds.
</P>
<P>
   Merrihugh said the store owners had been told they could join an
assessment district rather than pay for the work, while city
officials say owners knew years ago they would have to take down
the poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it smacks of extortion,'' said Dru Wickman, an owner
of the furniture company. ``They didn't tell us anything until one
week before we attempted to get final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspector was out numerous times to inspect the property.
They could have asked us to do this when we had the streets ripped
up. They had ample time, and they told us one week before
occupancy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Agoura Hills City Attorney Craig Steele said the condition
was included in a permit issued to owners three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has, throughout the course of the project, bent over
backward to help them through the process,'' Steele said. ``It's an
important project to the city and one we want to see open, but at
the same time there is a law in the city that says utilities need
to be put underground, and that is a condition not complied with
and what they need to do before they can get moving.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there also were other reasons why city officials did not
issue a certificate allowing Memorial Day weekend opening of the
60,000-square-foot building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way that building was available for occupancy,''
Steele said. ``The store is not finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agoura Hills store will replace one in Thousand Oaks.
Wickman said 15 more employees were hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't start them until we open it up. It's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The company already has another store in Agoura Hills: a design
showroom on Roadside Drive.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Reeds owners and Agoura Hills
officials have clashed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the City Council said a bronze sculpture
proposed for the Canwood store would not meet a city art
requirement. City officials said the piece was too commercial for
the Art in Public Places program, in which developers of a building
larger than 30,000 square feet must donate an artwork.

DEVILS STUN STARS, 7-3, TO TAKE OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Stanley Cup finals began Tuesday
night in Continental Arena with a three-hour party for the New
Jersey Devils and their giddy fans. Breaking open a 1-1 tie early
in the second period, the Devils surged to a stunning 7-3 victory
over the Dallas Stars, the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott scored twice for the Devils and so did Petr Sykora.
The Devils got a goal from Ken Daneyko, a veteran Devils defenseman
who had not scored in the post-season since 1995. They got one from
Scott Stevens, another veteran defenseman who is better known for
his heavy hits. And they got one from Sergei Brylin.
</P>
<P>
   They scored six times on 18 shots against Ed Belfour, the Dallas
goalie, who was replaced by Manny Fernandez in the third period. So
loose were the Devils with a six-goal lead that they allowed the
Stars to score two goals in a 12-second span in the eighth minute
of the third period to cut the margin to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of this four-of-seven series will be played here on
Thursday night. In that both teams are known for defense and good
goaltending, their next meeting might produce a much different sort
of performance. But the Stars might not be at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher, the Dallas captain and rugged defenseman, left
the game in the third period with what was called a leg injury. His
status is uncertain. Aside from the Dallas goal scorers _ Darryl
Sydor, Jon Sim and Kirk Muller _ Hatcher was one of few Stars who
was effective Tuesday night. With tactics that bordered on
legality, he made contact with several Devils and left them in
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Another Devil in pain was John Madden, who left the game late in
the third period with what appeared to be a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lineup for the Devils was Sergei Nemchinov, a
versatile, veteran forward who missed Game 7 of the previous series
against Philadelphia after suffering a 40-stitch cut in his face in
Game 6. Nemchinov played left wing next to center Scott Gomez and
right wing Alexander Mogilny.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 1-0 lead at 7:22 of the first period on
Arnott's first goal, a backhander from close range that completed a
deft play with linemates Sykora and Patrik Elias, who got the
assists.
</P>
<P>
   After Arnott took a faceoff in the right-wing circle, the three
forwards worked the puck counter-clockwise around the zone, behind
the net and out front again, with a series of backhanded passes
that left Dallas defenseman Sergei Zubov between coverages. It was
Arnott's fifth goal of the playoffs. His line was New Jersey's most
productive in the seven-game elimination of Philadelphia in the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny had a difficult defensive shift and it resulted in a
Dallas goal that tied the score at 1-1 at 13:13. After Mogilny
failed to clear the zone on right wing at the blue line, the Stars
worked the puck behind goalie Martin Brodeur's net with Mike Keane
controlling it. Then Jere Lehtinen passed to Sydor, who drilled a
low slap shot from the left point past both Mogilny's blocking
attempt and Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the period, Elias left the ice after being cross-checked
in the back by Hatcher, who caught Elias from behind while his
partner, Richard Matvichuk, distracted Elias from the front. No
penalty was called. Nor did the referees react, shortly thereafter,
to an exchange of sticks to the body between Zubov and New Jersey's
Claude Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   Elias returned for the start of the second period and the Devils
got the next three goals to take a 4-1 lead. Daneyko scored his
first of the playoffs at 2:52 by firing from the left side, near
the blue line. The puck passed Madden, the rookie center from the
University of Michigan who had won the faceoff before screening
Belfour and jumping above the path of the puck at the last instant.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils went up by 3-1 at 10:28 when Sykora scored, set up by
Elias, who dropped Belfour to the ice with a right-to-left move
across the crease, cut past the goal line and flipped a backhanded
pass onto Sykora's stick. Arnott got the other assist. A few
moments before the goal, Brodeur had protected the one-goal lead by
stopping Mike Modano on a slap shot and Brett Hull on a rebound in
quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the period, Hatcher leveled Madden with a thundering
elbow to the head that the referees allowed to pass without
punishment. Perhaps they also did not see Madden lying on the ice,
dazed, because they allowed play to continue around his sprawled
body.
</P>
<P>
   After the Devils went ahead 4-1 _ on a slap shot by Stevens at
16:04 _ the first penalty of the game was called when Hatcher
slashed Sykora at 18:20.

TOYOICHI TANAKA, 54, CREATOR OF `SMART' GELS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.) By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toyoichi Tanaka, a biophysicist whose fascination with polymer
compounds led him to create the ``smart'' gels that are having an
important impact on chemistry, medicine, agriculture and other
fields, died on May 20 in Wellesley, Mass., where he lived. He was
54.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka suffered a fatal heart attack while playing tennis,
according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
had been on the faculty since 1975 and a full professor of physics
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 Tanaka blended fluid and polymer to create a gel with
revolutionary implications. His subsequent pioneering research on
such smart gels has led to their use in ways as diverse as
toxic-waste cleanup and the release of insulin in the body.
</P>
<P>
   A gel is a polymer, a long chain of monomers, or molecules, that
are cross-linked like a web of fibers. The links allow the gel to
absorb water within them, giving it elasticity and fluidity.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka's smart gels expand and contract with even tiny changes
in temperature, light, a solvent or other stimuli. Their ability to
undergo huge though reversible changes in volume allows new systems
to be created that can envelop and release materials.
</P>
<P>
   These gels can be engineered to clean up oil spills, for
instance, or to hold and release fragrances in cosmetics.
Scientists are also looking at their potential to act as artificial
muscles in patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of it,'' Tanaka once said. ``Depending on
what a gel interacts with, it will have different behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka was exploring the idea that gels might provide clues to
the origin of life. ``By understanding the phase transitions of
gels,'' he said, ``we can better understand protein functions, the
molecular basis of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyoichi Tanaka was born in Nagaoka, Japan. He received his
bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Tomoko Tahira Tanaka; a
son, Kazunori, of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Ayako, of Wellesley
Hills; and his parents, Toyosuke and Shizu, and sister, Noriko, all
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka helped found GelMed Inc. of Bedford, Mass., and a
companion company, Gel Sciences Inc., in 1992 and, more recently,
Buyo-Buyo Inc. The intention was to explore the medical, cosmetic,
commercial and industrial potential of gels. Among other things, he
wanted to use smart gels to build artificial muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A muscle just expands and contracts,'' he said, ``and that's
what these gels are quite good at.''

EDITORIAL: DEMANDING NEW ELECTIONS IN PERU
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 31:
</P>
<P>
   The national howl of protest against President Alberto
Fujimori's illegitimate re-election victory in Peru is a welcome
sign of the country's political health, but it also poses a danger.
Fujimori or his backers in military intelligence may feel cornered
and strike back with violence. To prevent bloodshed, the
international community must strongly support the protesters' goal
of a legitimate election to choose a democratic government in Peru,
and prepare to isolate Fujimori if he refuses or uses violence.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment the most important outside voice belongs to the
Organization of American States, which holds a meeting on Peru
today and will doubtless discuss Peru in its annual general
assembly meeting on Sunday. The OAS should demand new and fair
elections, and offer its services to help Fujimori and his
principal opponent, Alejandro Toledo, agree on the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Historically when the OAS faced this situation, it would execute
a graceful diplomatic punt. In many ways the organization is more
timid and disorganized than a few years ago, when democracy seemed
to be ascendant in Latin America and leaders paid more attention to
the OAS But there is still some hope that it will stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   The most positive indication is the resolve of the group's
election observer mission, the first to be very critical of an
important OAS member. The mission, led by the respected former
Guatemalan foreign minister Eduardo Stein, declined even to monitor
last Sunday's runoff election, saying that an inadequate vote
tabulation method and a biased campaign environment meant the
election could not possibly be a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   Stein will present his report to the OAS today. The members at
the meeting _ every country in the hemisphere save Cuba _ can then
vote to invoke Resolution 1080, which enables the region's foreign
ministers to take political action against a member whose democracy
is interrupted. The other members could withdraw their ambassadors
from Peru, for example, though this has never been done.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that the OAS will back democracy in Peru are helped
by an unusually direct warning from State Department officials that
the United States does not see the election as valid and that
Fujimori will suffer internationally as a result. But Brazil's vote
is also crucial, and the last statement from that country was
tepid. The democratic credentials of Brazil's president, Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, will suffer if Brazil maintains this attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is gambling that Washington will quickly resume its
cooperation with Lima, which has been an ally in fighting cocaine
and terrorism. He is also hoping the OAS will undercut Stein's
observer mission and go back to its blander ways. But if the
hemisphere returns to diplomacy-as-usual, Fujimori will have a
license to intensify repression in Peru.

   BUFFALO, N.Y _ New York Republicans Tuesday unanimously selected
Rep. Rick A. Lazio of Long Island as the party's candidate for
U.S.Senate in a convention punctuated with campaign attacks _ in
speeches, on bumper stickers and on lapel buttons _ on the
Democrats' Senate candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio seized the platform and promised a hard-hitting campaign,
borrowing heavily on Democratic themes and speeches as he accused
Clinton of engaging in what he described as ``the politics of
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who 10 months ago was forced to the sidelines of the
Senate race by party leaders to make way for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, found himself at the center of state Republican attention
_ and curiosity _ as the party met to choose its challenger to
Clinton. Lazio was selected by acclamation at a convention that was
scripted right down to the last speech to second his nomination by
delegates, and he set out to introduce himself both to New York
voters and to delegates who just one week ago probably expected to
be nominating Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to representing the needs, concerns and values
of the people of New York, I have one advantage that she will never
have: I can be myself, I am a New Yorker,'' Lazio said in his
27-minute acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the dominant themes used by Republican
officeholders and party leaders on Clinton throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see for me, New York isn't just a mailing address, it's my
home,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said that he would present himself to New York voters as a
moderate Republican with ``a vision guided by mainstream principles
and compassionate instincts,'' and he stressed his Congressional
votes in favor of environmental protection, expanding public
housing, and funding research on breast cancer and cervical cancer.
He attacked Clinton for seeking to identify him with the ideology
of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, asserting that it was
symptomatic of what he called the ``divisive'' political techniques
practiced by Democrats since President Clinton was elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in the opposition camp think that they have a winning
strategy in repeating Newt Gingrich's name a thousand times between
now and November,'' Lazio said. ``Well, let me share with you my
winning strategy: Let the other side pursue a politics of discord
and division, I will unite all of New York behind a positive vision
for our great state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio invoked, almost to the word, turns of phrases have been
used by both Clinton and the President about Republicans, perhaps
aiming to pre-empt Clinton's attacks on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow the politics of division to dim New York's
awesome potential,'' Lazio said. ``I have a goal, of course, and
it's winning the race for the United States Senate. But, more
important, I want to be worthy of winning. I want to bring New
Yorkers together.''
</P>
<P>
   Two circumstances _ both beyond the Lazio's control _ seemed to
detract from the Republican convention: the absence of Giuliani,
who withdrew from the race on May 19 because of his cancer, and
Lazio's own blemished countenance in the form of swollen, stitched
lip that resulting from a fall while marching in a Memorial Day
parade on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's absence was notable, because he was the only major
elected Republican in the state not on hand for the event. He spent
the day in New York City without, unusually, any public schedule.
Republicans said that Giuliani and Republican Party leaders decided
last week it would be better if the mayor did not attend the
convention and risk overshadowing Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican delegates paid tribute to Giuliani in a brief
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, described Lazio's
convention acceptance speech as ``recycled insults and rhetoric
that doesn't match his record. Time and time again Rick Lazio has
voted against New York's working families in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in Buffalo, Lazio, his wife, Patricia, and New York Gov.
George E. Pataki unveiled Lazio's campaign bus: The Mainstream
Express.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notable contrast between the Republican
convention Tuesday and the Democratic convention in Albany two
weeks ago was that the Democrats refrained from any attacks on
Giuliani, who had recently made his illness public and had yet to
decide whether to campaign for Senate..
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clinton was in the bull's-eye today, the target for
delegates, party leaders and Lazio himself. Within five minutes of
the opening of the convention, William D. Powers, the state
Republican Party leader, was chastising Clinton for failing to
apologize for an incident in which people attending the Democratic
convention reportedly harassed members of the police honor guard at
the Democratic convention. Mrs. Clinton wrote a letter to the
Police Department deploring the incident, an aide said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki railed on Clinton for failing to pay state income taxes
since she moved to New York, possibly foreshadowing a a theme
Republicans plan to use in the campaign ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention lasted for precisely two hours in a
ballroom at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Buffalo.

FINLEY TO FACE ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND -- Chuck Finley admitted these last couple of days
have been a bit strange, watching the team for which he played 14
seasons on the other side of the field in the opposing dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Finley's vantage point moves to the mound, where he'll
start against the Angels for his new team, the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably be a little weird,'' said Finley, who signed a
three-year, $27 million contract with the Indians on Dec. 16.
``When they step in the box, I'll have a story to go with every
single one of them. I still have a lot of friends over there. But a
line has to be drawn. I'm out to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said he is still getting used to his new surroundings.
While his wife and two daughters have remained in Newport Beach,
Finley is staying in a downtown Cleveland hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it'll ever feel like home, but I know this is
the right place for me,'' he said. ``I knew it was time for me to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still getting acclimated to this team, but it's been
pretty smooth. This is a big baseball town. They're very serious
about winning. They don't take losing lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have been hit hard with injuries this season,
ringing familiar to Finley, who watched so many Angels teams
decimated by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen plenty of stuff like this,'' he said. ``This is like
a baby ward compared to over there. We had guys having heart
transplants over there. Not only were guys out, they were out four
to five months with something broken or something that needed to be
reattached.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about this team is we have a lot more to pull from.
In Anaheim we were pretty tapped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley still talks regularly with some Angels players. Monday
night, he had dinner with Darin Erstad and Troy Percival. And while
they were out, they called Gary DiSarcina, who is home recovering
from shoulder surgery. ``DiSar said he's running out of pain
pills,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels signed shortstop Kevin Stocker to a major league
contract for the rest of the season. Stocker, who was released by
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on May 25, will join the team Friday in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker is expected to take over the starting spot at shortstop
from Benji Gil, who will move back into a utility role or be
released, depending on whether or not the club would rather use
Keith Luuloa in the utility role. Gil made his 12th and 13th errors
of the season in Tuesday's game vs. the Indians and is hitless in
his last 23 at-bats, his average down to .185.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker made 11 errors while hitting .263 with two homers and
eight RBIs in 40 games this season for the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that with DiSarcina gone for the balance of the
season, we had an opening for a four-month period here,'' Angels GM
Bill Stoneman said. ``I don't want to diminish Benji's
contributions at all, but here's a guy who's a candidate to come in
here and play shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy was given the day off Tuesday, meaning not only was
he not in the starting lineup, but he also didn't take batting
practice. He won't start tonight's game either, in an effort by
manager Mike Scioscia to get his rookie second baseman to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy hit .318 with three homers and 20 RBIs in April, but in
May he's hitting .192 with no homers and five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Troy Glaus went through a similar phase in his first
full season in the big leagues, hitting .341 with five homers and
16 RBIs in April, and falling to .130, one homer, five RBIs in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want him to clear his head a little bit and let him
relax,'' Scioscia said. ``He's really been pushing. He needs to
take a step back and catch a breath. It's a good time for it. He's
a rookie still adjusting to playing every day in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea as well,'' Kennedy said. ``I'm just
trying to think too much about everything. Everything is happening
so fast, I've got to slow things down and try to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The club his encouraged by the progress of pitchers Tim Belcher
(elbow surgery), Ken Hill (torn muscle in ribcage) and Jason
Dickson (strained hip). Belcher will throw a simulated game today
and begin a rehab assignment for Triple-A Edmonton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson threw in the bullpen Tuesday and felt good, and is
expected to begin a rehab assignment soon. Hill is probably a few
weeks away from going on a rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS AT CLEVELAND
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4:05 at Jacobs Field
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: ESPN; KLAC-570, XPRS-1090
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Seth Etherton (0-0, 5.40 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Cleveland's Chuck Finley (3-4, 4.04). Finley has pitched in
more games than any other pitcher in Angels history (436 games),
but he'll make appearance No. 1 against them tonight. Finley also
holds club records in wins (165), starts (379) and innings pitched
(2,675).

2 BUTTERFLIES: ONE SPARKLES, ONE SUCCUMBS  
 BY DAVE ANDERSON  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They are known as ``butterflies'' for
their style, but their wings are their padded legs. Instead of
fluttering, these masked butterflies spread those wings, crouch,
sprawl, dive. Anything to stop the puck.
</P>
<P>
   They are the two goaltenders in the Stanley Cup final _ Martin
Brodeur for the Devils, Ed Belfour for the defending champion
Stars. And for all the speculation about the scorers, the
defensemen, the power plays and the penalty-killers, the eventual
winning team surely will possess the hotter goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   And in last night's opener, Brodeur was the hot goaltender when
he had to be as the Devils rolled, 7-3. Belfour was not even
lukewarm before he was benched early in the third period after
surrendering six goals. You would have thought the Devils' pucks
were made in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   With two spectacular saves a split-second apart on Mike Modano
and Brett Hull midway in the second period, Brodeur turned the
game. Had either of those two snipers scored, the Stars would have
pulled into a 2-2 tie. Instead, moments after those two spectacular
saves, Petr Sykora lifted the Devils to a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But going into this playoff final, the goaltender's stats for
three previous rounds had been virtually identical: Brodeur had a
1.77 goals-against average, Belfour's was 1.81. Brodeur had allowed
30 goals, Belfour 31. Brodeur had a .923 save percentage, Belfour's
was .931. Brodeur had two shutouts, Belfour had three. Each had a
12-5 won-lost record.
</P>
<P>
   And, equally important, each's name has been engraved on the
Stanley Cup once _ Brodeur's in 1995, Belfour's a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In hockey, a goaltender is always a team's most important player
because he is its constant on the ice. The forwards and the
defenseman change every minute or so, but the goaltender is always
out there in front of his 6-by-4-foot net.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if a baseball team could use its ace pitcher in every
game. Imagine a World Series with Pedro Martinez pitching every
game for the Red Sox or Randy Johnson pitching every game for the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young,'' Brodeur said, alluding to the 1995
playoffs when the Devils swept the Red Wings in the final, ``you
don't pay attention to details, you just go with it. Everything
falls into place and you play the game. When you're older, you have
more responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur is 28 now, one of the bigger goaltenders at 6 foot 2 and
205 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the league better than he did in 1995,'' said Jacques
Caron, the Devils' goaltender coach. ``He knows who to look for.
For this series he knows that Brett Hull has a quick release, that
Mike Modano shoots from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was shaky occasionally earlier in these playoffs.
Belfour was more consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belfour's in a zone now,'' Caron said before Tuesday night's
shelling. ``He was the difference in the Stars beating Colorado in
the Western Conference final. He has great determination. He's like
Tony Esposito was with the Blackhawks years ago, a reflex
goaltender, but he's more mobile than Tony was. Martin is more of
an angle goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who has his own Web site, is more compact at 5-foot-11
and 192 pounds, and at 35, he has more experience than Brodeur and
a more impressive resume: winner of the Vezina Trophy as the
National Hockey League's best goaltender in both 1991 and 1993 with
Chicago, first-team All-Star in both 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In last Saturday night's seventh-game victory in Dallas, the
crowd chanted, ``Bel-four's Bett-er,'' meaning better than Patrick
Roy, the Avalanche goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who grew up in Montreal, idolized Roy, then with the
Canadiens. Belfour, out of Carman, Manitoba, joined the Blackhawks,
where he was tutored by the Soviet legend, Vladislav Tretiak, then
the Chicago goaltender coach. He wears Tretiak's No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the other Blackhawk goaltender was Dominik Hasek,
but Hasek was traded to Buffalo by Mike Keenan, then the
Blackhawks' general manager and coach before becoming the Rangers'
coach in 1993. Keenan had asked Tretiak which goaltender to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek went on to win the Hart Trophy twice as the NHL's most
valuable player and five Vezina trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour bested Hasek in last year's cup final, but Tuesday night
Belfour turned cold. Martin Brodeur was the hot butterfly.

EDITORIAL: THE LATEST GUN KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 31: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two outbreaks of gun violence just before the Memorial Day
weekend _ the brutal massacre that left five dead at a Wendy's
fast-food restaurant in the Flushing section of Queens and the
killing of a middle school teacher apparently by a 13-year-old
student in a classroom in Lake Worth, Fla. _ showed once again the
high price America pays for having too many guns that are too
easily available.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida student is said to have obtained the .25-caliber
semiautomatic handgun used in the shooting from an unlocked drawer
of his grandfather's bureau. Florida, like 17 other states, has a
child-access prevention law on the books that requires gun owners
to lock up their weapons. If the grandfather is found culpable, he
will deserve severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But even where child access laws exist, their effectiveness is
often undermined by the absence of any requirement that would-be
gun owners be familiar with the rules for safe storage of weapons.
That is one of the virtues of moving to a national gun licensing
system in which such a requirement could be imposed. The further
tragedy is that this killing could probably have been prevented had
all handguns been required to have safety locks that prevented
their firing except by an authorized user.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate effect of the killings at the Wendy's in Queens
has been to ratchet up fears of violent crime at neighborhood
fast-food outlets and stores throughout New York City. Some
politicians, including Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican Senate
candidate, have responded by calling on the Queens district
attorney, Richard Brown, to seek the death penalty against two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the idea is to prevent future gun horrors, the death
penalty is the wrong remedy. Its deterrent effect is unproved, and
the nation is just beginning to grapple with the unfairness and
inaccuracy of many death sentence convictions. Instead of
reflexively calling for the death penalty, Lazio and others could
play a more constructive role by tightening the nation's gun laws
to deny violent thugs inappropriate access.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects now in custody for the multiple murders have
criminal records that presumably would have prevented them from
passing a Brady background check had they attempted to purchase
their weapons from a licensed gun dealer. Yet one of the suspects
told police that they had no trouble buying a .380-caliber
semiautomatic on the street in the Jamaica section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, meanwhile, small but important steps on gun control
remain stuck in a House-Senate conference committee, largely
because of hard lobbying by the National Rifle Association. These
latest high-profile gun tragedies argue for passing that
legislation and moving on to stronger measures. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 31: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bickering this election year between Democrats and Republicans
over a drug benefit for Medicare enrollees has been shrill. But
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., two
influential leaders on health care, announced a set of principles
last week that, by blurring the distinction between the parties,
might yield compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden and Thomas agreed that any Medicare drug benefit should be
a universal benefit to which the elderly are legally entitled. That
might seem innocuous. But Wyden's efforts will be opposed by
Democrats who want to head into November with no agreement. Thomas
will win little applause in the Republican caucus for embracing the
proposition that what America needs is another federal entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thomas was right to declare the principle because the
existing Medicare entitlement, lacking a drug benefit, is seriously
deficient. Indeed, Thomas points to a Republican plan to show that
the idea of a universal entitlement is in sync with party policy
even if the words rub the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, every Medicare enrollee would be offered a
drug policy whose premiums and other costs would be heavily
subsidized or eliminated for low-income families. The government
would pick up all of an enrollee's drug costs above a ceiling, say
$2,000 a year. The White House plan focuses on subsidizing initial
drug outlays, which Congressional Democrats would amend by adding
catastrophic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals differ on important details. The White House, for
example, would have the agency that runs Medicare negotiate with
one benefit company per region to organize coverage for most
enrollees. Most Republicans and some Democrats like Wyden want a
new Medicare board to negotiate with competing drug-benefit
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the pros and cons of specific proposals, the Wyden-Thomas
agreement serves as a worthy guideline for policy. But the
agreement's enduring feature may be that, by showing that serious
Democrats and Republicans can agree on important principles, it
dulls the posturing that has so far kept Congress from doing
anything serious.

PHILLIPS LANDS IN JAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Troubled former professional football player
Lawrence Phillips landed in the Beverly Hills jail over the holiday
weekend on suspicion of beating his girlfriend, authorities said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Baldwin Park High School, Phillips, 25, is
scheduled for arraignment this morning in the Beverly Hills branch
of Los Angeles County court. He is being held on $500,000 bail and
suspected of domestic violence and carrying a concealed weapon. If
convicted he could face time in state prison, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not identify the victim. Phillips remains in custody
in the Beverly Hills jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers responded to a call of domestic violence in the 9000
block of Burton Way at 4:15 a.m. Saturday morning,'' said Beverly
Hills police Lt. Ed Kreins. ``The victim, age 25, identified
herself as Phillips' girlfriend. She declined medical treatment but
was given first aid by officers on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was not at the residence when officers arrived for the
initial call, Kreins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the officers got there the suspect was not there,''
Kreins said. ``At that time they identified the suspect as Lawrence
Phillips.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers were again called to the scene several hours
later. Phillips was arrested at that time, Kreins said. He was
taken into custody without incident.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil
Garcetti said Tuesday that his office was not familiar with the
particulars of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who grew up in a West Covina group home, has had
several brushes with the law. While a student at the University of
Nebraska, he was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his
girlfriend. In subsequent years he has been arrested for driving
under the influence and battery in separate cases.

VETERANS AND REPORTERS WONDER WHAT DROVE A SOLDIER TO LIE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 4th graf to make it read `regiment,' not `division')  By MICHAEL MOSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. _ Edward Daily had all the trappings of an
American war hero: comrades who remembered his courage on the front
lines, combat records attesting to his swift rise in rank, orders
awarding him medals for valor.
</P>
<P>
   His exploits, including a rescue of a soldier under fire and his
capture by the North Koreans, were amply supported by Army
documents and the testimony of men who said they recalled fighting
alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   When The Associated Press began investigating whether the Army
unit he was assigned to _ the Seventh Cavalry Regiment _ killed
hundreds of South Koreans nearly 50 years ago, Daily, who is 69,
seemed an ideal guide into difficult terrain.
</P>
<P>
   He had written three books on the unit _ a proud, historic
regiment once led by George Armstrong Custer _ had organized its
veterans group and swapped stories at its reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Daily gave the AP reporters a list of ex-soldiers' telephone
numbers. And he admitted his own role in the atrocity at the
village of No Gun Ri, saying he had slaughtered civilians on orders
from his commanders and was still haunted by the sound of ``little
kids screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the confession, his presence at No Gun Ri _ in fact, most of
Daily's military record _ appears to be invented or imagined. And
fellow veterans now say that Daily, in phone calls, chats at
soldiers' reunions and barroom reminiscences, managed to airbrush
himself into their own fragile memories of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   As AP reporters tried to track down the story of what happened
at No Gun Ri, Daily made his own calls to fellow veterans, several
veterans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to inform me how things happened,'' said Norman
Tinkler, 69, a veteran of the Seventh Cavalry who told the news
service that he had emptied a machine-gun belt on defenseless
people. Tinkler stands by his account, but said he cannot recall
whether the AP or Daily called him first.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Daily's life reveals a man who loved to hear other
men's war stories, and who went to extraordinary lengths to create
his own legend in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So embedded is Daily in the memories of some veterans that they
still find it difficult to believe he was not with them at No Gun
Ri. ``I know that Daily was there,'' insisted Eugene Hesselman,
another key witness in the original Associated Press account. ``I
know that. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Millard Gray, of Fort Cobb, Okla., said he believed for years
that Daily rescued him on the battlefield _ until a buddy pointed
out that he would not have been able to recall anything immediately
after being pummeled by a concussion grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who was not quoted by the AP, said he now realizes that
his memory of Daily pulling him out of a foxhole came from Daily.
``I didn't know the difference,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Daily says he does not dispute Army documents that
show he was not at No Gun Ri, but rather spent most of the war as a
mechanic and clerk behind the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember it vividly,'' Daily said in an interview at
his home here on Monday _ Memorial Day, which he spent in
seclusion. ``But they are saying I was with a different company.
I've seen their documents. How do you deny that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel,'' he said, ``like I'm in a dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily denied fabricating or altering any records. ``No, no,
no,'' he said. Asked to explain how he came to show friends
citations for some of the Army's highest medals, including the
Distinguished Service Cross, Daily said ``I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment further on the records, citing the Army's
continuing No Gun Ri investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The AP won the Pulitzer Prize this spring for its article on the
incident at the South Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri. The news service
has stood by its account in the days since questions emerged about
Daily's war record, saying a host of other witnesses, including
South Koreans, confirm that an atrocity took place. In addition,
the AP has cited Army records that ordered other units in Korea to
prevent civilians from crossing American defense lines.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Hanley, a reporter who worked on the AP project, said
that as many as 20 veterans confirmed some or all of Daily's
account, and that the reporting team found sources outside Daily's
sphere of contacts. He acknowledged that Daily was a valuable
source for the AP, turning over a list of ex-soldiers phone numbers
early in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talked to each other in this investigation,'' Hanley
said of the veterans. ``This is why it was important that we try to
not get a grapevine going.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may have been an impossible task to determine whether
Daily was harvesting memories or creating them.
</P>
<P>
   The citation he showed friends for the Silver Star, which
praised Daily for ``bravely'' commanding his platoon under fire and
rescuing another soldier appears to have been fabricated; Army
records show he did not receive the medal or the promotion to which
it refers.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with the Army's continuing inquiry
of the alleged massacre, investigators have obtained a falsified
letter claiming Daily had been taken prisoner of war. There are
fabricated letters awarding him medals that he actually did not
win, including the Silver Star, they say.
</P>
<P>
   There are two versions of the regiment's Christmas-dinner
roster, one with Daily's name typed at the bottom of the list _
slightly crooked at that. A group photo of the regiment he showed
to friends is also suspect: Daily's head, marked with an arrow and
the word ``me,'' appears to be super-imposed on another man.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is close to concluding that its troops fired on
civilians at No Gun Ri, but that the number killed remains
unproven. And people familiar with the inquiry say the Army thus
far has found only one man who makes the crucial contention that
there were orders to slaughter the civilians as they huddled in a
railroad-trestle culvert at No Gun Ri: Edward Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Daily's assertions about his record were not universally
accepted by his peers. He joined an association for winners of the
prestigious Distinguished Service Cross, a medal military records
show he never received. In 1991, Morris G. Worley, the
administrator of the association, concluded that Daily had
falsified his supporting documents and kicked him out. After
discovering other false claimants as well, Worley now sends for the
military records of anyone wanting to join the group.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why would Ed Daily, a Kentucky native who worked in steel mills,
sold used cars and had a fondness for war antiques, falsely confess
to an atrocity? Some observers believe there is a rise in the
number of people who are exaggerating their military histories.
Most want to remake themselves into heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But others are moved to claim a dishonor, psychologists say,
like people who falsely confess to crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not uncommon when a serious murder occurs for a couple
of folks to drop by and say, `I did it,''' said Jonas Rappeport, a
forensic psychiatrist now retired in Baltimore. ``The purpose of
this seems to be self-importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Down, a 68-year-old former steelworker and veteran of the
Seventh Cavalry, is one of Daily's staunchest supporters. He helped
Daily organize their veterans' group, and he thinks its members
should back him no matter what the reality of his war experience.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans who have come to doubt the massacre story regard
Daily in terms they cannot explain. ``I have the feeling now that
Daily was a con man, although I don't know why he was,'' said
William Hoffman, 74, of Fairfax, Va., an former Seventh Cavalry
platoon leader who retired from the Army and then worked as an
executive with Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else could a nice guy who has been so strong in promoting
the Seventh Cavalry and organizing the reunions and coming to them
and giving speeches do this? I'm still puzzled.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in Covington, Ky., in 1931, Edward Lee Daily was 17 when he
met an Army recruiting sergeant with ``medals plastered all over
his chest,'' Daily wrote in a short memoir he would give to his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who divorced when he was 10, signed the teen-ager's
papers, Daily said. When given a choice of assignments, he picked
the cavalry and described it as seemingly preordained. ``Strangely,
my eyes kept focusing on that big yellow and black patch with the
horse head on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily also wrote about becoming an expert marksman with the
Seventh Cavalry Regiment, then jumping into the opening days of the
Korean War in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, military records show, Daily went from serving as a
clerk to a mechanic in the lusterless 27th Ordnance Maintenance
Company, only joining the Seventh Cavalry for a few weeks the
following year _ eight months after No Gun Ri allegedly occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the states after the war, Daily found work in a steel
mill, ran a truck-stop cafe, and in 1978 signed up as a salesman
with Heuring Chevrolet in Valparaiso, Ind. ``He was the top
salesman out of 25,'' said Craig Heuring, now general manager.
``Every customer loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Married with a son, Daily seemed to have erased Korea from his
mind, his former wife, Hilda Daily, said. ``It was a shock to me,''
she said of the AP report. ``He never talked about the war.''
</P>
<P>
   But after his life took a hard turn starting in the mid-1980s _
his marriage broke apart, his work suffered, and, Daily said, he
stepped up his mental-health therapy _ the war became a cornerstone
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   The war was nearly all Daily talked about with Fred and Lois
Carlen, who handled the photographs for his books in their
Valparaiso photography shop. ``He liked war relics, and it was so
funny to see Ed come in with this big sword,'' Mrs. Carlen said,
recalling an antique sabre.
</P>
<P>
   Daily began focusing on Korea after a 1986 reunion of cavalry
veterans. ``If you guys will get me stories, I'll put them together
and we'll put them in a book,'' Daily told attendees, according to
Down.
</P>
<P>
   At this and other reunions, the best stories emerged in the bar,
and Daily had a knack for injecting himself into the conversation,
veterans said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Snuffy'' Gray, 74, a former second lieutenant who spent
five years with the Seventh Cavalry, recalled a reunion at Fort
Meade, Md., in 1996. ``Daily asked me, `Who is that?' I said,
`That's Johnny De Borde, my mortar observer.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Gray said, Daily walked up to De Borde and
said: ``How in the hell are you? It's been a long, long time,
buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he hugged me,'' De Borde recalled Monday. ``I had not seen
Daily before in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone assumed he was there,'' Gray said of Daily's account
of No Gun Ri. ``No one questioned it. He wove such a damn web.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily's own recollections of his invented combat experiences
became grippingly real. In 1993, William McKown, the regiment's
food service technician who spent 24 years in the Army and now
lives in Englewood, Fla., returned to South Korea with a small
group of veterans that included Daily. They were riding in a
minibus, McKown said, ``alongside this river we were defending and
this ravine went by, and Ed called out, `That's where I was
captured.''' No evidence has surfaced that Daily was indeed
captured.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion over Daily's record stems from a 1973 fire
which destroyed many files at the National Personnel Records Center
in St. Louis. Veterans were invited to help reconstruct their
records and Daily appears to have enhanced his own history with
material provided by others in the unit for use in his books on the
Seventh Calvary. Daily said he does not recall any details about
submitting documentation to the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone could be persuaded they had fought side-by-side
with Daily, including Tinkler, the machine gunner. Tinkler did not
attend the unit's reunions and said he was startled to receive a
phone call from Daily one day asking if he remembered how he
bandaged Tinkler when he got shot in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `hell no, I don't remember,''' Tinkler recalled. ``I
wasn't remembering too much at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily was, without question, a linchpin in efforts to preserve
and honor the memory of the Seventh Cavalry and served as its
president in the early 1990s. In 1993, he attended a peace ceremony
in South Dakota with members of the Lakota Sioux tribe to help make
amends for the massacre at Wounded Knee by the Seventh Cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daily has this thing about apologizing,'' says David Hughes,
72, of Colorado Springs, a former Seventh Cavalry officer who
believes the Associated Press exaggerated what might have occurred
at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Daily passed up at least one opportunity to confess his role in
No Gun Ri before the AP interviewed him. For more than a decade, he
spent two hours in group therapy every two weeks at the Veterans
Administration hospital in Nashville, according to David Shepard, a
clinical pharmacist who helped run the sessions. Daily continues to
receive disability payments from the VA for neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good member _ very supportive, very verbal. He talks,
which is good,'' Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did Daily mention a massacre. Still, Shepard said he
was ``shocked'' earlier this month when allegations surfaced that
Daily's war record had been embellished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the rock of the earth, in my opinion,'' Shepard said. ``I
never saw him to be someone who would stretch the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daily went on the road to help other veterans who suffer from
post traumatic stress syndrome. In the fall of 1998, James Kerns,
70, a former sergeant living in Piedmont, S.C., said Daily invited
him to a workshop in Columbia, S.C., where Daily opened the session
by talking about the affliction.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kerns said, he had not yet been contacted by the
AP, but its reporters had begun asking others, including Daily,
about No Gun Ri. While at the workshop, Kerns said, Daily asked him
about the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had orders, but it wasn't the same order I
had,'' Kerns said. Kerns then told the AP that he was instructed to
hold the civilians in place to protect the regiment's position, and
that any firing was aimed over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1998, said Tinkler, the machine-gunner, Daily brought up
No Gun Ri in their conversations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I remembered who did the shooting, and I said yes,
I was the one. And he said, who gave the orders, and I said there
was no one gave the orders,'' Tinkler said.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkler confirmed his quotes in the AP article _ that he shot at
the civilians on his own accord, fearful that they were shielding
enemy soldiers. Tinkler now says he cannot be sure who called him
first, Daily or the AP. Hanley of the AP said he was convinced that
the news agency contacted Tinkler first.
</P>
<P>
   Daily confirmed speaking with fellow veterans about No Gun Ri
but said that, for the most part, they called him to ask about the
AP's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, eyewitness accounts are all the Army has in its attempt
to verify the AP account. As many as 12 investigators at the
Pentagon's archives in College Park, Md., have been sifting through
thousands of paper-filled gray file boxes since last fall; a new
batch arrives in their room, 24 boxes to the cart, several times a
day. Thus far, people familiar with the Army investigation said, no
paper trail has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the veterans. The officers who are said to have
given the orders are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans who might have carried them out cannot be found.
Others are reluctant to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkler recently received a letter from the Army asking him to
meet with its investigators. ``What will I tell them? Not damn
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily declined to address the question of why he would confess
to a massacre he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Burns, a Vietnam veteran, was a consultant on ``Stolen
Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its
History,'' (Verity Press, 1998) an expose of soldiers who
exaggerated their war records. Burns said it has become more common
in recent years for ex-soldiers to falsely claim dishonor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do that because there is a movement in this country, the
victim-hero thing. `People will feel sorry for me that I killed
children and women, and they will understand me,''' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Daily may have been undone by a one-time admirer.
Robert Bateman, a teacher at West Point, was commanding the Seventh
Cavalry Regiment in Texas in the mid-1990s when Daily came to
visit. Bateman had him sign his regiment flag, called a guidon.
Daily sent him Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   But within days of the AP article, Bateman, his suspicions
aroused, filed the first Freedom of Information Act request for
Daily's personnel records, according to archive records. Within
weeks, the AP and other news organizations were filing their own.
</P>
<P>
   They received a one-page synopsis showing Daily was not with the
Seventh Regiment at No Gun Ri. It took several more months for this
information to emerge this spring in news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Daily called on his veteran friends to try to
convince them he was for real. Hesselman met him in November at the
Skyline Chili's restaurant in Erlanger, Ky., where, he said, Daily
opened a folder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some proof he was promoted to first lieutenant, with a
battlefield commission,'' Hesselman said. ``He showed me a copy of
the order. I'm going by what he showed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I put too much faith in what he's telling me,''
Hesselman 't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Seventh Cavalry veterans remain bitter about Daily's
efforts. ``He deflowered our moment in time with a horrible
story,'' says De Borde.
</P>
<P>
   Other friends think Daily should simply move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed likes the limelight, he always did,'' said his friend Down.
``But I'd say to him now, `Ed, you've had your run. It's time for
you to get an old hound dog or two and sit on the porch and relax
like everyone else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his home, standing beneath a 200-year-old maple tree,
Daily said he was inclined to take that advice. He said he was
sleeping very little. His phone rang so much he disconnected it. He
turned down an invitation to speak to veterans at a Memorial Day
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done. I'll never write again,'' he said. ``I've lost my
dedication. It's dog-eat-dog out there, and I'm mentally drained.''

EDITORIAL: WORK-RELEASE FOR BATTERED WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 31: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under New York state law, prisoners convicted of violent crimes
are not allowed into the work-release program. In 1995 Gov. George
Pataki, concerned about crimes committed by inmates on
work-release, made violent offenders ineligible for the program.
While that prohibition makes sense in most cases, there should be
an exemption allowed for battered women who have been convicted of
violent crimes against their abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the State Assembly passed a sensible bill that would
allow convicted battered women to participate in work-release at
the discretion of the state corrections commissioner. It died in
the Senate, but earlier this year the Senate crime victims and
corrections committee passed the measure. The Legislature should
approve the bill promptly, and Pataki should sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of domestic violence are generally different from other
violent offenders. Many of these women had no previous criminal
records, and are not likely to be repeat offenders. Many were
retaliating for years of physical, sexual and psychological abuse
by their tormentors. Work-release is a crucial step for these women
in making the transition from prison back into society.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give the state corrections commissioner the
authority to grant work-release on a case-by-case basis to victims
of domestic violence, including men who have been battered. The
commissioner could reject anyone who has a history of violence or
is judged to be a threat to public safety. There are probably fewer
than 100 inmates, the vast majority of them women, who could become
eligible for work-release under this bill. It would give these
prisoners, who have been victims of prolonged violence themselves,
a chance to rebuild their lives.

EDITORIAL: DEMANDING NEW ELECTIONS IN PERU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to rewrite last two grafs)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 31:
</P>
<P>
   The national howl of protest against President Alberto
Fujimori's illegitimate re-election victory in Peru is a welcome
sign of the country's political health, but it also poses a danger.
Fujimori or his backers in military intelligence may feel cornered
and strike back with violence. To prevent bloodshed, the
international community must strongly support the protesters' goal
of a legitimate election to choose a democratic government in Peru,
and prepare to isolate Fujimori if he refuses, or uses violence.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment the most important outside voice belongs to the
Organization of American States, which holds a meeting on Peru
today and will doubtless discuss Peru in its annual general
assembly meeting on Sunday. The OAS should demand new and fair
elections, and offer its services to help Fujimori and his
principal opponent, Alejandro Toledo, agree on the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Historically when the OAS faced this situation, it would execute
a graceful diplomatic punt. In many ways the organization is more
timid and disorganized than a few years ago, when democracy seemed
to be ascendant in Latin America and leaders paid more attention to
the OAS. But there is still some hope that it will stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   The most positive indication is the resolve of the group's
election observer mission, the first to be very critical of an
important OAS member. The mission, led by the respected former
Guatemalan foreign minister, Eduardo Stein, declined even to
monitor last Sunday's runoff election, saying that an inadequate
vote tabulation method and a biased campaign environment meant the
election could not possibly be a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   Stein will present his report to the OAS today. The members at
the meeting _ every country in the hemisphere save Cuba _ can then
vote to invoke Resolution 1080, which enables the region's foreign
ministers to take political action against a member whose democracy
is interrupted. The other members could withdraw their ambassadors
from Peru, for example, though this has never been done.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that the OAS will back democracy in Peru waned on
Tuesday when a State Department spokesman backed away from
unusually direct criticism of the election an American official had
voiced the day before. Brazil's vote is also crucial, and the last
statement from that country was tepid. Brazil's president, Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, a defender of democracy, should take the lead in
helping to restore it in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is gambling _ perhaps successfully _ that Washington
will quickly resume its cooperation with Lima, which has been an
ally in fighting cocaine and terrorism. He is also hoping the OAS
will undercut Stein's observer mission and go back to its blander
ways. But if the hemisphere returns to diplomacy-as-usual, Mr.
Fujimori will have a license to intensify repression in Peru.

MENDOZA LOSES HIS GRIP, SO YANKS LOSE A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ramiro Mendoza likes to work fast when he is
pitching, and Tuesday he seemed as if he wanted to work even faster
on a brisk night. Mendoza lined up on the extreme left side of the
rubber, blew warm air into his right hand, tossed pitches and then
quickly returned to his original position to start again.
</P>
<P>
   But the ball felt slippery to Mendoza and he could not throw
strikes and he could not get comfortable. Usually, Mendoza does not
have trouble enticing the umpire to lift his right arm and does not
have problems performing as relaxed as someone whipping a tennis
ball around the yard. Except for Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The normally precise and normally poised Mendoza was neither as
he walked a career-high six batters, did not last beyond the fifth
inning and just plain sputtered as the Oakland Athletics tamed the
Yankees, 7-4.
</P>

   Mendoza followed up a 7-0 shutout over the White Sox last
Thursday, the first time he had started in 18 days, by searching
for strikes while pitching on the normal four days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the bullpen and the ball felt good,'' said Mendoza
after the game. ``I go to the mound and the ball felt slick. I
didn't have control today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was startling to see Mendoza deteriorate into such an
undependable pitcher. Even more than Orlando Hernandez or Andy
Pettitte, Mendoza consistently throws strikes. He does not fool
around, he uses a nasty sinker to induce groundballs and he had
walked only eight batters in 33 innings, an average of 2.4 per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium because Mendoza
could not get solid grips with the temperature in the upper 50s and
almost matched his season total for walks in one sloppy game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem comfortable out there,'' said Manager Joe
Torre. ``He was inconsistent. Too many pitches were belt-high.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's last two walks in the fifth helped lead to the runs
that enabled Oakland to tie the score, and Chuck Knoblauch's
throwing error allowed the A's to score the tie-breaking run. With
runners on first and second, Knoblauch moved to his left to corral
Ben Grieve's grounder between first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch bobbled the ball as he tried to pivot to second, his
throw was low and it bounced off Derek Jeter's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have caught it,'' said Jeter. ``I should have caught
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's team-leading eighth error loaded the bases for the
A's and the struggling Mendoza could not maintain the 4-2 lead. An
infield groundout scored in the third run and Matt Stairs lashed a
two-run single into center to drive in two more runs, put the A's
ahead, 5-4, and end Mendoza's sluggish start.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza threw 87 pitches and 43 were balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not help the situation by going one for 11 with
runners in scoring position, and Ricky Ledee's single in the second
did not even knock in a run. It loaded the bases with no outs, but
Kevin Appier struck out Scott Brosius and got Knoblauch to ground
to short and into a double play. Instead of burying Appier, the
Yankees might have buried themselves by only scoring once in that
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza walked Terrance Long to start the game and that
symbolized his night as he walked batters in four of the five
innings he pitched. Still, he survived for a while because he
secured double plays to end the first and the second.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made a strong throw on the double play in the first,
but Randy Velarde spiked Knoblauch in the left leg. When Knoblauch
returned to the dugout, he cringed while a trainer treated his leg.
Apparently, Knoblauch was not in too much pain because he led off
by lining Appier's 1-1 fastball over the left field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez hit a liner in the second that soared by the
314-foot sign in right field for his first homer in 65 at bats,
giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the A's used a walk and two doubles to tie it, 2-2, Bernie
Williams doubled in a run in the third and Jeter continued his
torrid hitting by drilling a homer to center that put the Yankees
ahead, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the ball never felt right to Mendoza, he did not throw
strikes and he did not hold the lead.
