Court delays hearing to free Anwar on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim's
hearing on an appeal to free him on bail was adjourned till next
week to allow his defense lawyers more time to prepare their case.
	   Anwar's lawyers on Saturday told the three-member Court of
Appeal they needed at least 24 hours to study a new court ruling
that could potentially disqualify any further attempts to free
Anwar on bail.
	   The higher court moved the hearing to Dec. 5.
	   Anwar's bail application has been turned down by a lower court
once and an appeal against it also failed. Trial Judge Augustine
Paul said Anwar's lawyers weren't able to prove that he would not
tamper with witnesses if released on bail.
	   Anwar currently is facing trial on 10 charges of abuse of power
and sexual misconduct, charges he denies and calls politically
motivated.
	   He was arrested Sept. 20 under a special security law only hours
after organizing a mammoth rally in the capital. During that
protest, he called for sweeping government reforms and the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after deeming him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.
	   Earlier, Anwar's lawyers said they would ask the court to free
him on bail because he was not well. Anwar suffers from a stomach
disorder that causes intense heartburn, family members have said.

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Suspected separatist guerrillas blew up a
major crude oil pipeline in northeastern India early Saturday,
police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but
police said the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom was
suspected in the remote-controlled explosion at Jagiroad in a
remote part of Assam state, 70 kilometers north of the state
capital Gauhati.
	   Engineers were trying to plug the rupture in the 1,500 kilometer
(930 miles) pipeline, owned by the state-run Oil India Limited,
officials said.
	   Supplies of crude from the oil-rich Assam state to other parts
of the country had been cut off, OIL officials said. The pipeline
feeds three large refineries in eastern India.
	   Further north, a bridge along a major national highway was blown
up by the militants late on Friday night at Dhola, 100 kilometers
(62 miles) north of Gauhati, officials said. A local politician of
the state's ruling Asom Gana Parishad party was gunned down in a
village close to where the pipeline was blown up, police said.
	   The ULFA, outlawed on Nov. 27 in 1990, the year when the
military moved into the state to fight the guerrillas, has since
observed Nov. 27-28 as protest days when it carries out attacks on
vital public installations.
	   The guerrillas had blasted another oil pipeline in Assam on
Thursday night, gunning down five guards in the area.

Thailand can't woo Saudi Arabia back to the Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's attempts to convince Saudi
Arabia to participate in the upcoming 13th Asian Games have failed,
the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
	   Thai Olympic Committee Chairman Gen. Chettha Thanajaro told the
Bangkok Post he sent a last-minute plea to his Saudi counterpart
but has received no response.
	   ``I have done my best. We have to respect their decision,'' he
told the Post.
	   Saudi Arabia's sudden withdrawal from the Dec. 6-20 Games has
dismayed the hosts who remain skeptical about the reasons offered
for the pull-out last week.
	   Saudi sports authorities said the Games conflicted with national
centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   But observers point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai
authorities to solve two, decade-old criminal cases involving their
nationals: the theft of jewels from a Saudi crown prince and the
murder of three Saudi diplomats in Bangkok.
	   The cases are widely believed to involve people high up in the
power hierarchy, who in Thailand rarely face prosecution.

Police van collides with Korean Air jet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A police van collided with a Korean Air jet at
Chek Lap Kok airport, causing minor damage to the plane early
Saturday morning, local media reported.
	   The van accidentally backed into the stationary Boeing 747
during a special police exercise shortly before 5 a.m., damaging
the outer shell of the plane's No. 1 engine, government-run Radio
Hong Kong quoted an Airport Authority spokesman as saying.
	   No one was injured and the plane took off for Seoul at 9:30 p.m.
after minor repairs.
	   Police have launched an investigation into the accident.
	   The accident is the latest in a string of snags since Hong
Kong's U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport opened in July. A costly fiasco
erupted during its early operations as computer breakdowns and
system problems crippled both passenger and cargo services.
	   Last month, a Boeing 747 cargo jet burst two tires during taking
off, closing the first runway and delaying about 100 flights.
	   Chek Lap Kok was built on reclaimed land off a remote outlying
island, replacing the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport, located in a
congested Kowloon neighborhood.

Afghan staff member of U.N. Food Program killed by Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Afghan employee of the United
Nations was shot and killed by Taliban troops when they overran
central Bamyan in August, according to a World Food Program
statement Saturday.
	   Sayed Essa, a guard at the WFP warehouse, was shot as he fled
advancing Taliban forces, a WFP statement said.
	   The WFP learned about Essa's killing this week during the first
visit by a U.N. mission to Bamiyan since its international staff
left the area because of fighting in early August.
	   Bamiyan _ the capital of Bamiyan province _ is 130 kilometers
(80 miles) northwest of the capital, Kabul.
	   ``Mr. Essa was apparently killed in Taliban crossfire when he
himself was making his way to the mountains,'' the statement said.
	   After the Taliban took control of the city, a total blockade was
imposed, making road travel and radio communication impossible, it
said.
	   The WFP is the U.N.'s front-line agency in the fight against
hunger and has operations in 76 countries around the world.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A local official in southern Vietnam has
been accused of making 457 hours of long-distance calls to his
girlfriend at the government's expense.
	   Tran Ngoc Van, chief of the Dong Nai provincial committee for
population and family planning, was found to have called the same
number in Hanoi repeatedly, with total costs of 89 million dong
(dlrs 6,400) over three years, a committee official said Saturday.
	   Van will have to reimburse the money if he is proven to be
responsible, she said. Vietnam's annual per capita income is only
about dlrs 340.

Zimbabwe crawls to 45 for 1 in cricket test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Grant Flower was twice dropped and
once caught off a no-ball as Zimbabwe crawled to 45 for one in its
first innings at lunch on the second day of the first cricket Test
against Pakistan Saturday.
	   Flower, who completed 2000 Test runs when on nine, was unbeaten
on a chancy 12. Murray Goodwin was not out on 20.
	   A fiery opening spell by left-arm paceman Wasim Akram had Flower
in all sorts of trouble after Pakistan was bowled out for 296 in
its first innings.
	   Akram had Gavin Rennie leg before in the second over for two
before Pakistan let Flower off the hook twice.
	   Some sloppy fielding by Pakistan saw Flower dropped by
wicketkeeper Moin Khan, who needlessly dived in front of waiting
Inzamamul Haq in the first slip. The ball popped out of his right
hand off Waqar Younis.
	   Akram then had Flower caught in the third slip by Azhar Mahmood
but saw umpire George Sharp declaring a no-ball. Flower could have
been out once again shortly before lunch, but this time Ijaz Ahmed
could not hold onto the catch at gully.
	   Akram bowled an unchanged nine-over spell and gave away 18 runs
for the wicket of Rennie.
	   Earlier, Heath Streak polished off Pakistan's tail, claiming
three wickets in space of 11 deliveries with the second new ball
after the home team resumed at the overnight total of 272 for six.
	   Yousuf Youhanna added only one to his overnight 74 before
captain Alistair Campbell had him caught in the first slip off
Streak.
	   Youhanna, dropped on one Friday, hit 13 fours and faced 164
balls during his 229 minutes of stay at the wicket.
	   Henry Olonga had Wasim Akram's (10) off stump cartwheeling
before Streak trapped Mushtaq Ahmed (0) and Waqar Younis (6)
trapped leg before and wrapped up Pakistan's innings in 33 minutes
for 296.
	   Streak was the most successful Zimbabwean bowler with four
wickets for 93 while Mpumelelo Mbangwa finished with three for 40.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon, a day after a two
Israeli were killed in a guerrilla roadside bombing.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
between the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 28 kilometers
(17 miles) southwest of this southern market town.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the early
morning attack, said the officials. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The Israeli air assault came a day after two Israeli soldiers
were killed in a roadside bombing claimed by Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas near the Lebanese-Israeli border. Two Israeli
soldiers were killed on Wednesday also.
	   The casualties raised to seven the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in southern Lebanon in 10 days.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to
Europe and retuned home for a meeting with Cabinet ministers and
army generals scheduled for Sunday to review the Lebanon policy.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would only pull Israeli troops out of
southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to attacks
by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group, Hezbollah.
	   Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government is unwilling to
give such a guarantee.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militiamen from the zone Israel set up in
1985 to protect its northern territories from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

Army deserter kills six in Tehran rampage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian army deserter stole a gun,
hijacked a van and shot to death six people including three
policemen, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The soldier, identified as Siavosh Rahmani-Aqdam, fled after the
shootings on Thursday in southern Tehran, and police have mounted a
manhunt, IRNA said.
	   Describing Rahmani-Aqdam as a ``deserter and a known hooligan,''
IRNA said he hijacked a van at gun point minutes after stealing a
gun. IRNA did not say where he stole the gun from.
	   Later, in an ``act of mania,'' the soldier shot dead six people
and wounded several others, some of them critically, IRNA said.
	   It gave no other details.

Malaysia's economy falls into recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia sank into recession, with
its once-booming economy contracting more severely than most
forecasts, the government said Saturday.
	   The Malaysian economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter, a
dramatic fall from grace for a country that grew at a rapid pace
for the last decade and expanded 7.8 percent in 1997.
	   Economists had expected a contraction of between 7 percent and 8
percent. The gross domestic product shrank 6.8 percent in the
second quarter.
	   Central bank governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said Malaysia
will have to lower its official GDP forecast for this year from the
current 4.8 percent contraction.
	   But Ali Abul said the economy had bottomed out, although it will
continue to shrink in the fourth quarter.
	   There were ``signs of improved consumer sentiment'' as well as
of a ``revival'' in investment activities, he said.
	   He said car purchases and bank loans were also up.
	   Last month, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad proposed a 1999
budget which he said would help the economy grow up to 1 percent
next year by calling for a series of tax cuts for favored
industries.
	   Unlike other Asian nations pummeled by financial turmoil,
Malaysia has rejected the policies of spending cuts and high
interest rates promoted by the International Monetary Fund and
Western governments.
	   Market observers say that Malaysia's economic performance over
the next six months will be a crucial barometer to gauge Mahathir's
policies.
	   On Saturday, Ali Abul said the stock market was showing signs of
recovery. Share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have
surged by about 90 percent since Sept. 1.
	   Ali Abul credited the government's decision to impose capital
controls in October that curbed flows of speculative funds.
Analysts say Malaysia's move to lower interest rates has also
helped.

Pavin holds third-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Stephen Leaney says he has
no fears of going head to head with American star Corey Pavin in
Sunday's final round of the ANZ Players Championship at Royal
Queensland.
	   Hungry to clinch his first victory in almost two years, Pavin on
Saturday fired his third sub-par round of 71 following rounds of 69
and 66.
	   The 1995 U.S. Open winner finished a tough day where he started
_ in the lead _ albeit with only a one-shot advantage.
	   Leaney (67-73-67) was only one behind on 12 under, with
Australia's Peter O'Malley (71-68-69) next on 11 under and
Australian David McKenzie (69-70-71) and American Todd Demsey
(70-68-71) a further shot back at 10 under.
	   Pavin, who felt Saturday's calm conditions exposed the course to
a low round, lost his cool at times.
	   He slammed his club down in frustration after hitting his
approach into the eighth green where he made one of his two bogies.
	   ``It made me mad,'' said the 39 year-old American who wants to
end his two-year slump.
	   But he quickly regained his composure, fighting back from his
distracting bogey to post successive birdies at the ninth and the
difficult 411-meter par four 10th, which got his round going again.
	   Leaney said he would not be distracted by being paired with
Pavin in the final round Sunday.
	   ``I know he won the U.S. Open but he hasn't won for two years,''
said Leaney. ``I've got past (being over-awed) after playing
against Greg Norman and a lot of other great players.'' (djp)

Opposition Congress Party takes early lead in crucial provincial
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Counting of ballots began Saturday in
legislative elections in four of India's 26 states, a test of
public mood that could bring unwelcome news to the eight-month-old
Hindu nationalist government.
	   Although too early to show a trend, the first results supported
exit polls that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party would lose badly
in the important states of New Delhi and Rajasthan. A tough battle
was predicted in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. The BJP did
not contest in the fourth state, Mizoram in India's remote
northeast.
	   The outcome has no bearing on the federal government of Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But a serious loss of prestige could
stoke infighting in his shaky 19-party coalition and embolden the
opposition Congress Party to try to unseat him if it wins enough
defectors from the ruling alliance.
	   More than 600 seats were contested in the voting Wednesday by
about 5,000 candidates from dozens of political parties. The
Congress governed Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram, and the BJP
controlled New Delhi and Rajasthan.
	   An early winner in New Delhi was Sheila Dixit, who will become
chief minister of the state government if Congress wins.
	   ``This is a massive negative vote against the BJP. The voters
are running away from them,'' Congress Party joint secretary Jairam
Ramesh said on the private STAR television network.
	   The BJP shrugged off suggestions that the outcome would indicate
discontent with Vajpayee's government.
	   ``These elections are state elections. The results will not have
any effect on the Vajpayee government,'' BJP spokesman Venkaiah
Naidu said. ``My government is stable. I don't expect any political
fallout.''
	   The election was the first political test for the BJP since it
took office eight months ago.
	   But it also was a key electoral test for the Congress Party's
new leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of slain former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three
prime ministers.
	   Congress has said it will not make an immediate attempt to
topple the government when Parliament convenes Monday for a
three-week winter session. But it has said it would not ``shirk the
responsibility'' if Vajpayee's coalition collapsed on its own.
	   Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since she
emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police broke up a spate of brawls
among teen gangs Saturday while security officers blocked hundreds
of college students from staging an anti-government protest.
	   The private Sonora radio station said hundreds of students from
rival high schools fought in the streets in at least six locations
in Jakarta after classes ended at lunch time.
	   There were no reports of serious injuries or arrests.
	   The fights do not appear to be connected with the political
turmoil in Indonesia. But they are a sign of the growing
lawlessness among the nation's young.
	   Also on Saturday police and troops blocked a convoy of 10 buses
carrying students near Indonesia's Foreign Ministry.
	   Earlier, police vowed to arrest college student activists who
allegedly abducted and roughed up a plainclothes officer during
another protest.
	   Several students pushed the officer into a taxi near Jakarta's
main police station on Friday night and later dumped him, bound and
gagged, on a toll road, said Maj. Gen. Nugroho Jayusman, police
chief in Jakarta.
	   About 200 students had marched to the station to protest against
the shooting deaths of nine students in clashes with the military
earlier this month.
	   The fighting broke out during a controversial government
assembly on political reforms.
	   Students say President B.J. Habibie, who took office after riots
and protests dislodged his authoritarian predecessor Suharto in
May, is stalling on pledges to democratize Indonesia.
	   Plainclothes police often infiltrate student protests and
sometimes are caught by protesters and beaten.
	   The officer who was abducted Friday was unharmed and flagged a
taxi, returning to report to his commander at the police station.
	   There were no arrests.
	   Dozens of student protesters lingered outside the station for
hours, taunting a line of riot officers with slogans such as
``Police are criminals.''
	   The students, many of whom had arrived on buses from the nearby
city of Bandung, lounged in the street and ate packets of rice
while soldiers with sticks and shields watched them in silence. The
last demonstrators left Saturday afternoon.
	   Many students want Suharto to be tried on charges of corruption
and human rights abuses, and on several occasions have tried to
march to his house in an affluent neighborhood of the capital.
Police and soldiers have blocked them.

Four hostages freed in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three policemen and a woman being held hostage in
Chechnya have been freed from captivity, a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   The three policemen were kidnapped from Dagestan's Tarumovsky
district on the border with Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said, citing Lt. Viktor Medveditskov of the Russian Interior
Ministry. It did not say when the officers were taken hostage.
	   The news agency did not release the woman's identity or details
of her kidnapping.
	   Chechnya, a breakaway region in Russia's southwest, fought a
bloody independence war in 1994-96. Since then, there has been a
wave of crime and kidnappings.
	   Government officials say that over 700 people, including Russian
soldiers, local civilians, and a number of foreigners, are still
being held in the region.

Collapse of paper recycler leaves piles of waste
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ About 5,000 tons of paper are piling up around
Hong Kong following the collapse of a paper recycler earlier this
month, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Schools have been told to dump 40 tons of paper that was
originally intended for recycling by failed Concordia Paper, the
South China Morning Post reported.
	   ``It's sad news, but there's no alternative but to stop the
program,'' the director of Better Environment Hong Kong, Steve
Choi, was quoted as saying.
	   ``There's no export market and now there's no local recycler _
paper is just piling up at the port,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, 10 potential buyers were in talks to buy the
recycling factory, Alan Tang of its receiver, KPMG Peat Marwick,
told the Post.
	   Concordia Paper closed after the price of recycled paper
plummeted, making it unable to cover the costs of collecting and
handling the paper. More than 400 workers lost their jobs at the
company.
	   A commentary in the newspaper criticized the government and
private businesses for not doing enough to support recycling.
	   ``Even before the collapse of Concordia, the abysmal state of
recycling ... was a problem crying out for attention,'' the
commentary said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three policemen and a woman being held hostage in
Chechnya have been freed from captivity, a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   The four were seized by a band of Chechens on Sept. 19 in
Dagestan's Tarumovsky district on the border with Chechnya, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing Lt. Viktor Medveditskov of the
Russian Interior Ministry.
	   Medveditskov said the four were released without the payment of
a ransom.
	   Chechnya, a breakaway region in Russia's southwest, fought a
bloody independence war in 1994-96. Since then, there has been a
wave of crime and kidnappings.
	   ``The crime situation in the northern Caucasus region has been
further aggravated by the economic crisis,'' Medveditskov told
ITAR-Tass. He said the region ``has become the place of almost half
of the terrorist acts presently committed in Russia.
	   Government officials say that over 700 people, including Russian
soldiers, local civilians, and a number of foreigners, are still
being held in the region.

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon, a day after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a guerrilla roadside bombing.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
between the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 28 kilometers
(17 miles) southwest of this southern market town.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air raid,
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The missile attack occurred hours after an ambush by Hezbollah
guerrillas on Israeli soldiers who were trying to retrieve a
disabled military vehicle near the Lebanon-Israel border, the
Hezbollah said in a statement. It did not mention any casualties.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the ambush, which
Hezbollah said took place just before midnight.
	   On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside
bombing near the border claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
Two Israeli soldiers also were killed on Wednesday.
	   The casualties raised to seven the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in southern Lebanon in the last 10 days.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militiamen from a occupied zone in southern
Lebanon that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territories from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Following the recent Israeli casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu cut short a trip to Europe and retuned home for a meeting
with Cabinet ministers and army generals scheduled for Sunday to
review the Lebanon policy.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would only pull Israeli troops out of
southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to attacks
by Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group.
	   Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government is willing to give
such a guarantee.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Leading members of China's vibrant underground
Protestant churches have appealed to the government to stop
persecuting their followers, a rights group reported Saturday.
	   In a pair of open letters, leaders of four churches in central
Henan and Anhui provinces laid out disputes with official
Protestant churches and their government supervisors, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
	   The underground, or ``house'' church leaders decried limits on
evangelizing, age restrictions on preachers and prohibitions
against ties with overseas churches, the Hong Kong-based group
cited the letters as saying.
	   ``For these reasons, the great majority of religious believers
recognize house churches and don't follow the official church,''
the group paraphrased the letter as saying.
	   The letters demanded the government stop ``beating, confronting,
fining, detaining in labor camps and otherwise persecuting''
underground Protestants and release those being held.
	   China's Communist Party-led government requires all Protestant
groups be part of the umbrella, non-denominational China Christian
Council. The council estimates its churches have 11 million
followers, but some missionaries claim there are now 100 million
Chinese Protestants.
	   Amid the surging religious activity come signs of increased
government suppression.
	   Police broke up two house church meetings in Henan in late
October and early November, arresting 140 people from all parts of
China, including two people from Taiwan.
	   The warden of Henan's Fengcheng Prison admitted Wednesday 70 of
the believers were still in jail.
	   A rights group said one woman known as a leading evangelist in
the underground church, Cheng Meiying, was released Nov. 21 after
suffering beatings that left her mentally disabled.

Afghan opposition fires several rockets on Kabul, four wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Eight rockets hit the Afghan capital
on Saturday, wounding at least four people, witnesses said.
	   The rockets, apparently fired by the northern-based anti-Taliban
alliance, hit the combined military and civilian airport and nearby
civilian neighborhoods.
	   The airport was sealed off shortly after the assault, making it
impossible to know the damage.
	   The injuries occurred in a nearby neighborhood. One man said he
was on his way to the hospital to donate blood for his wife, who
was to have surgery, when the rocket landed and he was wounded.
	   ``My wife has to undergo a major operation today. . . And I had
to arrange blood (donation) for her, but I got wounded myself,''
said Abdullah, who like most Afghans uses only one name.
	   There was no immediate comment from Taliban officials or from
the opposition in positions barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north
of the capital of Kabul.
	   The rockets apparently were intended to stop Taliban jet
fighters from taking off from the airport. In recent days dozens of
jet fighters have taken off from Kabul heading north toward the
front line in Kunduz and Baghlan provinces.
	   The Taliban Islamic militia, which rules almost 90 percent of
Afghanistan, are Sunni Muslims and are mostly Pashtun _ the
majority ethnic group of Afghanistan.
	   The opposition, which comprise mainly religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras, controls
the remaining 10 percent of the country.

South Korea's Lee ties Harada for lead in Meiji Nyugyo Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SADOHARA, Japan (AP) _ South Korea's Lee Young-me shot a
2-under-par 70 Saturday to tie Kaori Harada of Japan for a
two-stroke lead in the third-round of the 60 million yen (dlrs
500,000) Meiji Nyugyo Cup.
	   Lee walked away with four birdies _ including a pair on the
final two holes _ and two bogeys over the 6,379-yard (5,805-meter),
par-72 Hibiscus Golf Club course en route to a 10-under 206 total
in the Japan LPGA Tour's season-ending tournament.
	   Overnight leader Harada, winner of two events this season, led
single-handedly for most of the round until bogeying on the 18th
hole.
	   Fellow Japanese Hisako Takeda followed the leaders with a 68 for
208.
	   South Korean Lee Oh-soon shot a 73 for 210 and was tied in
fourth with Japan's Michiko Hattori, who turned in a 69 for 210.
	   Taiwan's Tseng Hsiu-feng, in four-way race for sixth place, came
up with a 71 for 211.

Primakov says Russia will meet IMF conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that
his government was prepared to comply with conditions set by the
International Monetary Fund for the resumption of aid to Russia's
ailing economy.
	   Primakov said he hoped to reach an agreement soon with the IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus, who was scheduled to come to
Moscow on Dec. 1, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Speaking to the legislative assembly in the southern Russian
city of Belgorod, Primakov said his government was prepared to
fulfill the fund's conditions because Russia badly needs the next
dlrs 8 billion installment of an IMF loan.
	   ``This money will allow us to clear some foreign debts and to
inject 85 billion rubles into the economy,'' Primakov said.
	   The IMF has insisted on seeing a sound economic program by the
Russian government, and signs that is has been implemented, before
releasing any more of the dlrs 22.6 billion aid package that has
been frozen since August.
	   An IMF delegation left Moscow earlier this week with no promise
that it would resume an existing loan, and Primakov was critical of
some of the fund's methods of granting loans.
	   ``We should comply with their conditions, but not because we are
overly obedient,'' Primakov said, according to Interfax.
	   ``I find myself irritated when young boys come (to Moscow) and
start imposing their conditions,'' he said. ``They have read many
books but they don't know life as it is or the actual situation in
Russia.''
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, after succumbing to the global economic troubles that
started in Asia, which prompted Russia to default on loans and
devalue the ruble in August.
	   The government says more foreign aid is crucial for getting the
economy on track.
	   ``This does not mean that we may be dictated which steps we must
make and which measures to take,'' The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Primakov as saying. ``But we have to listen to what they are
saying. We need to get the tranches of dlrs 8 billion promised to
Russia.''
	   Meanwhile, Primakov said, the government will have to print more
money to meet its obligations.
	   ``If we switch on the money-printing presses, and this is
something we cannot avoid, we should do our best to keep the money
emission under control,' the prime minister said, according to
Interfax. ``Otherwise, uncontrolled money printing will lead to a
serious rise in inflation.''

Congo dominates African summit in Paris

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The war in Congo was set to dominate the final day
of a Paris summit of African leaders, with the quest for peace
still elusive as debate resumed Saturday.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday urged African
leaders - especially those at war in Congo - to renounce violence
and accept compromise to achieve peace.
	   A meeting between Annan and the warring parties in Congo was
possible Saturday, but the prospects of a significant breakthrough
remained in doubt.
	   Speaking to the summit Friday, Annan said many African conflicts
are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' and that the Congo
conflict poses the continent's greatest challenge.
	   French President Jacques Chirac urged African nations to do
their own peacekeeping - a departure from past practices that put
the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders are focusing on
security issues.
	   All eyes were on Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila, who
crosses paths here with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader, who support rebels waging an
insurgency in the Congo.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention
following the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by human rights
groups, ruled Friday that Kabila cannot be pursued for human rights
violations because he benefits from customary immunity accorded
heads of state in office.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.
	   Though concrete solutions to the Congo crisis were unlikely to
emerge, summit participants said they hoped for progress.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo in December.
	   Rwanda's leader said he was ready to meet Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila has not been optimistic, saying a pullout of Rwandan
and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition for
substantive peace talks.
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks Saturday with Chirac.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said there had been
some progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his adversaries,
with each of the parties presenting their views.
	   The French president stressed the need for Africans to take more
responsibility for settling conflicts.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of
responsibility for Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A pro-independence politician got into a
brawl Saturday with opposition supporters during a campaign rally
for next month's elections, leaving several people injured.
	   Among those injured was Chen Ming-chiu, a candidate for the
Taiwan Independence Party, a radical party that advocates Taiwan's
formal independence from China.
	   The fight broke out when Chen unfurled banners at the Changhua
Rail Station in central Taiwan, denouncing Hsu Hsin-liang of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party as a ``partner'' of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, police said.
	   Chen's tiny radical party has accused Hsu and his party of
soft-pedaling independence in an effort to appease China. Beijing
views Taiwan as a part of China.
	   The fighting broke out before Hsu, former DPP chairman, arrived
to campaign for Yao Chia-wen, the party's candidate for the
legislative elections.
	   Television footage showed Chen's bleeding face as he walked away
after the brawl. Yao's daughter, Yao Yu-ching, was also injured
when she was hit in the head by a baseball bat, police said.
	   Police would not say immediately how many people were involved
in the violence.
	   Campaigns have heated up elsewhere in Taiwan ahead of the Dec. 5
balloting in legislative and mayoral races.
	   About 1,000 supporters of the New Party, another opposition
group, marched through Taipei streets blaming the government for a
spate of financial woes, including a bank run early this week.
	   The New Party's candidate for Taipei mayor, Wang Chien-shien,
also vowed to push for legislation to make lashing a punishment for
rapists and other offenders targeting violence on women. The party
supports reunification with China.
	   DPP leaders paraded across the island on a van converted to look
like the Titanic, hoping to capitalize on the movie's success in
Taiwan.
	   The ruling Nationalist Party said it will hold a mass rally in
southern Kaohsiung Saturday night. President Lee Teng-hui was
expected to attend in a ``Star Wars'' captain costume.

Final death toll in Indian train accident at 208

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Authorities loaded wooden coffins with
corpses into open trucks Saturday and cleared away the last of the
wreckage from a two-train collision that killed 208 people.
	   Two days after one of the worst accidents in recent history,
about 80 bodies remained unidentified and unclaimed. Video cameras
filmed the corpses and belongings to show later on national
television in an effort to locate relatives.
	   Police said they would hold the bodies in a mortuary in Patiala
for a few days, then any remaining corpses would be cremated
together. Patiala is 124 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of New
Delhi.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
uncoupled from the Frontier Mail and toppled into the path of the
oncoming train on a parallel track.
	   Train cars crumpled on top of one another, pinning dead and
injured under tons of sheared metal. It took more than 24 hours to
move giant cranes through the surrounding wheat fields to untangle
the cars.
	   No survivors have been found since Thursday.
	   The national railways began an investigation into what caused
the last four cars of the Frontier Mail to separate from the rest
of the train.
	   Citing preliminary findings of the Railway Board, The Pioneer
newspaper reported Saturday that a crack in the rails may have
caused the cars to decouple. Metallurgical tests were being
conducted to see whether poor quality steel or fatigue could have
caused the crack, it said.
	   India has around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the
largest rail network under one management in the world. The worst
was three years ago when one train rammed into the back of another,
killing 358 people.
	   Most accidents are blamed on human error or outdated equipment.
	   The railways complain about the high expense of modernizing and
maintaining more than 37,200 miles (59,800 kilometers) of track and
the 14,000 trains that run every day.
	   Train travel is the most common form of long distance
transportation and fares are kept low for most of the 12 million
passengers who ride the trains each day.

Jiang's visit to Japan marred by protests, failures

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Protesters heckled Chinese President Jiang Zemin
during his speech at a Japanese university Saturday, disrupting a
visit already marred by an apparent failure to wring key
concessions from his hosts.
	   Three protesters were arrested after scuffling with security
guards in the hall at Tokyo's Waseda University, police said. One
demonstrator unfurled a banner reading: ``Down with the Jiang
regime.''
	   Jiang ignored them, raising his voice over their shouts.
	   Outside, scores of students protested human rights abuses and
China's nuclear weapons program. Several of the protesters, who
shouted slogans and carried anti-Chinese placards, were dragged
away by police.
	   While Jiang is scheduled to stay in Japan until Monday, Japanese
media have already begun to offer a dour assessment of what his
visit has accomplished.
	   They cite his inability to obtain a written apology from Tokyo
for its brutal invasion of China in the 1930s or to get Japanese
leaders to promise they won't support the United States in a future
crisis near Taiwan.
	   ``Can we say that President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan has
been a `success'? To be a bit pessimistic, we don't think so,''
Japan's conservative Sankei newspaper said in a front page
editorial Saturday.
	   Jiang urged his audience at Waseda not to forget Japan's
militaristic past.
	   ``Thirty-five million Chinese soldiers and civilians were either
killed or injured, and China suffered economic losses worth more
than 600 billion dollars,'' he said.
	   The Chinese president was accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, a Waseda graduate.
	   There has been much speculation that Jiang was disappointed over
Japan's refusal to issue a clear written apology for its wartime
aggression against China.
	   Thursday's declaration mentioned Japan's ``remorse'' for the
war. But it did not use the word ``apology,'' which was offered in
a statement to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung during his visit
to Tokyo last month.
	   Although Japanese media reports have said that the decision not
to sign the communique was highly unusual, Jiang and Japanese
officials played down its significance.
	   ``Chinese and Japanese officials never considered the option of
signing the joint communique,'' Jiang said curtly at a news
conference later Saturday.
	   On Thursday, Obuchi also gave a vaguely worded answer to Jiang
on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province.
	   Obuchi said Japan does not support Taiwanese independence and
reassured Jiang that Japan's security arrangement with the United
States was only for defense.
	   ``Japan has given a clear, adequate statement'' opposing
Taiwanese independence, Jiang told reporters. ``I want Japan to
observe its promises.''
	   Jiang left Tokyo on Saturday night for visits to two northern
Japanese cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

Opposition Congress Party takes early lead in crucial elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with early results; adds quotes, byline. Has moved to
some points.
 &UR; By ARTHUR MAX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Counting of ballots began Saturday in
legislative elections in four of India's 26 states, a test of
public mood that could bring unwelcome news to the eight-month-old
Hindu nationalist government.
	   The outcome has no bearing on the federal government of Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But a serious loss of prestige could
stoke infighting in his shaky 19-party coalition and embolden the
opposition Congress Party to try to unseat him if it wins enough
defectors from the ruling alliance.
	   Early trends supported exit polls that predicted the ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party would be routed in the important states of
New Delhi and Rajasthan, where the Congress Party was headed for a
comfortable majority.
	   The battle was closer in the Congress-ruled central state of
Madhya Pradesh, but first results indicated Congress surprisingly
would hold on to the state government with marginal gains.
	   Congress was headed for a defeat in the remote northeastern
state of Mizoram. But the contest was deemed less important because
the BJP did not contest it.
	   More than 600 seats were contested in the voting Wednesday by
about 5,000 candidates from dozens of political parties.
	   ``The results are surprising. If the trends continue, it is
definitely a win for the Congress,'' admitted V.K Malhotra, a
member of the federal parliament and a senior leader of the BJP, on
the private STAR television network.
	   An early winner in New Delhi was Sheila Dixit, who will become
chief minister of the state government if Congress wins.
	   ``This is a massive negative vote against the BJP. The voters
are running away from them,'' Congress Party joint secretary Jairam
Ramesh said on the private STAR television network.
	   The BJP shrugged off suggestions that the outcome would indicate
discontent with Vajpayee's government.
	   ``These elections are state elections. The results will not have
any effect on the Vajpayee government,'' BJP spokesman Venkaiah
Naidu said. ``My government is stable. I don't expect any political
fallout.''
	   But Salman Khursheed, a Congress leader, claimed the results had
national implications. ``This can't be put aside as a local
issue,'' he said. ``This is an approval signal from the people.''
	   The election was the first political test for the BJP since it
took office eight months ago.
	   But it also was a key electoral test for the Congress Party's
new leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of slain former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three
prime ministers.
	   Congress has said it will not make an immediate attempt to
topple the government when Parliament convenes Monday for a
three-week winter session. But it has said it would not ``shirk the
responsibility'' if Vajpayee's coalition collapsed on its own.
	   Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since she
emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.

Woods stands nine shots back in Casio World Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBUSUKI, Japan (AP) _ Tiger Woods, in his first Japan PGA Tour
tournament, shot a 1-under-par 71 Saturday to stand nine shots
behind third-round leader Naomichi `` Joe'' Ozaki in the Casio
World Open.
	   Woods, top-ranked in the world, shot a trio of bogeys, but also
chipped in two birdies and an eagle for a 2-under 214 total.
	   ``I would like to shoot a good number tomorrow, post it and see
what happens,'' he said.
	   Even though he was not in top form, Woods continued to draw big
crowds and loud cheers from spectators ringing the fairways.
	   Ozaki, the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on the Japan tour
and the leader after the first round on Thursday, shot a 67 for an
eleven-under 205. He chipped in five birdies without a single bogey
at the 7,105-yard (6,467-meter), par-72 Ibusuki Golf Club course.
	   Brian Watts of the United States, runner-up at the British Open,
turned in a 67 for 206, tying him for second with Japan's
Toshimitsu Izawa, who fired a 68.
	   Overnight leader and Japan Open champion Hidemichi Tanaka shot a
72 for 209 and was tied with three others for fourth.
	   The 150 million yen (dlrs 1.25 million) event offers a top prize
of 27 million yen (dlrs 225,000).

Young Chinese writer tried for subversion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese writer putting together a book on
democracy has been put on trial for plotting to overthrow the
government, a human rights group reported Saturday.
	   Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court held a one-day trial
Friday for Liu Xianli, but issued no verdict, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
	   The 28-year-old writer from eastern Anhui province traveled to
Beijing in March to interview Xu Wenli, one of China's most
prominent dissidents, and other democracy campaigners, for a book,
``Chinese Democrats' Heartfelt Wishes,'' the group said.
	   But police detained Liu in mid-March and he has been in custody
ever since, the group said.
	   Although the trial was ostensibly open to the public, several
dissidents were refused permission to attend and the six people in
the public gallery were all sent by the authorities, the
Information Center said, citing Liu's lawyer, Xu Wanlin.
	   Despite signing U.N. treaties on civil and political rights,
China's Communist Party leaders have kept tight control on dissent.
Attempts by dissidents to set up an opposition political party have
been met by swift arrest.
	   A member of the would-be China Democracy Party's Liaoning
province branch, Liu Shizun, was questioned by police for six hours
Saturday, the Information Center said.
	   Xie Wanjun, who tried to set up a party branch in eastern
Shandong province, was taken away by police on Friday, the group
said. Xie vowed last week to travel to Beijing to protest police
harassment since his release from 15 days in detention in
September.

Australian pacemen ambush England for 112
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The Australian pace quartet led by Glenn
McGrath ambushed England for 112 in the second cricket test on a
quick and bouncy WACA pitch Saturday.
	   After McGrath maintained his hold on the England batting with
three top- order wickets, Jason Gillespie (2-23) and then Damien
Fleming (5-46) demolished the lower order in the first hour after
lunch.
	   England followed up its poor batting form in the field, grassing
three catches as Australia took a stranglehold of the test to score
150 for three at stumps.
	   Skipper Mark Taylor provided the backbone of the Australian
reply with a chancy 61 in three hours before edging an outstanding
delivery from Dominic Cork six overs before stumps.
	   Taylor shared 81 with Michael Slater (34), and 34 in almost an
hour with Justin Langer (15), before part-time off spinner Mark
Ramprakash separated the pair.
	   Mark Waugh and night watchman Gillespie were unbeaten on 19 and
five respectively.
	   After McGrath's first 11-over spell left England gasping for
breath at lunch on 76 for six, Fleming systematically flushed out
the lower order in a 36-ball spell.
	   Having started the batting carnage with the wicket of opener
Mark Butcher in the fourth over of the test, Fleming took 4-20
after lunch.
	   Fleming, who burst in to test fame with a hat-trick against
Pakistan in Rawalpindi in 1994-95, was sidelined by a shoulder
injury and poor form until picked for the recent tour of Pakistan.
	   Except for Mark Ramprakash, who hit a gritty 26 in 90 minutes,
and skipper Alec Stewart's top score of 38, the rest batted
cluelessly on a traditionally bowler-friendly surface.
	   McGrath heightened England's crisis by sending Atherton back and
the in-form Nasser Hussain fell in identical circumstances just
four overs later to leave England on 19 for three.
	   McGrath (3-37) reached a personal milestone with Atherton wicket
_ his 50th Ashes scalp _ and the 12th time he has dismissed the
former captain in the last nine tests.
	   The lanky fast bowler also inflicted a cut on Ramprakash's chin
that required six stitches. It was the second time an English
batsman was left bleeding here after Butcher suffered a cut above
his right eye in an early tour match against Western Australia last
month.
	   Having been saved by thunderstorms in the first test in
Brisbane, England failed to do its Ashes chances any good with a
yet another deplorable batting performance.
	   Even the inclusion of a seventh batsman failed to save visitors.
	   Batsman John Crawley, who replaced off spinner Robert Croft,
lasted 17 balls for his four and Graeme Hick, drafted in for an
injured Graham Thorpe, was dismissed for a second ball duck.
	   It was only the fourth time in Mark Taylor's 46-test captaincy
that he has won the toss and sent a team in to bat.

Mugabe bans national strikes by presidential decree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government, facing the threat of
civil unrest over the nation's crumbling economy, has banned
national strikes, a state-controlled newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The development, reported in The Herald, came as the main labor
federation was planning its fifth massive strike in the past year.
The strike was to be held next Wednesday.
	   The Herald said President Robert Mugabe used presidential powers
to prohibit ``collective job action,'' amending existing labor
laws.
	   Civil unrest is the largest threat to Mugabe's hold on power.
The announcement of the decree came as Mugabe was attending a
summit of African leaders in Paris.
	   Labor groups and employers who encourage workers to strike face
sweeping penalties under the presidential order, The Herald said.
	   Companies and labor unions could have their trading or
registration licenses canceled and it would then be illegal for
them to receive revenue.
	   The order also said also organizers of mass strikes in companies
or labor groups faced a fine of up to 100,000 Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 3,000) and could be imprisoned for unspecified periods.
	   It empowered employers to immediately fire workers who joined
mass action without going through existing procedures for firing
staff that need government approval.
	   The Herald described the Mugabe's order as a ``temporary
measure.''
	   Officials of the Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions, the
country's main labor federation, said the group would urgently
challenge the decree's constitutional legality in the Harare High
Court on Monday.
	   The constitution guarantees free expression and rights to strike
within labor laws.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary-general of the main labor
federation, was traveling to the western resort town of Victoria
Falls on Saturday for a meeting with employers and was not
available for comment.
	   Two one-day national strikes earlier this month shut down the
economy after negotiations between the government and labor groups
on demands for wage increases to meet steep price increases broke
down.
	   The labor federation accuses the government of economic
mismanagement and widescale corruption and has also criticized
Mugabe for deploying 8,000 Zimbabwean troops to support embattled
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Military operations in the Congo are estimated to be costing
Zimbabwe at least dlrs 500,000 a day as inflation at home soared to
about 40 percent and health and education services deteriorated
sharply.
	   A 67 percent hike in gasoline prices last month triggered
rioting in Harare during a boycott of commuter transport. One
person died in those disturbances.
	   A 25 percent rise in the price of corn meal, the staple food,
led to food riots in January that left at least six people dead
after army troops were deployed to quell civil unrest for the first
time since independence in 1980.
	   The government blames price increases on an 80 percent slide in
the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar in the
past year.

Turkish diplomats fly to Rome to relay criminal file of rebel
</HEADLINE>
leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Diplomatic couriers flew to Italy on
Saturday to hand over a thick criminal file of a Kurdish rebel
leader, wanted by Turkey for trial, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan because he could
face death penalty in Turkey for capital crimes.
	   The file includes photographs, video cassettes and details of
crimes committed by Ocalan and his guerrillas, said Haldun Otman, a
diplomat, before his departure.
	   Germany has also issued arrest warrants for Ocalan on charges of
murder and terrorism, but Bonn made clear Friday that it has no
intention of extraditing Ocalan, fearing unrest among Germany's
many Turkish Kurds.
	   Instead, Germany and Italy hope to extricate Europe from growing
Kurdish-Turkish tension by arranging for the trial of a Kurdish
rebel leader in an international court, an idea opposed by Turkey.
	   ``Ocalan should be extradited to Turkey and be tried in ordinary
courts,'' daily Turkiye quoted Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday as saying.
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been waging a
guerrilla war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has claimed 37,000 lives.
	   The dossier also consists of details of a draft bill, Turkey has
prepared to defuse Italian objections, to lift the death penalty in
Turkey. Despite issuing death sentences Turkey has not carried out
any execution over a decade.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12, upon arrival from
Moscow.

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ French Embassy employees
on Saturday were picking up debris after an explosion rocked the
embassy compound in this central African capital city.
	   There were no known injuries from the Friday afternoon blast, a
French diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The heavily guarded embassy complex appeared to have sustained
only minor damage, with just a few windows shattered by flying
debris visible from the street. French officials, however, did not
allow reporters inside and declined to describe the damage.
	   The blast happened just outside the main embassy walls near the
banks of Bangui's Oubangui River.

Marsh strengthens lead, Aoki seeks win for 5th straight year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SADOHARA, Japan (AP) _ Australia's Graham Marsh strengthened his
lead Saturday, shooting four birdies for a 3-under-par 69 in the 50
million yen (dlrs 417,000) Japan Senior Open.
	   The 54-year-old Marsh, a victor of 25 Japan PGA events who is so
far winless on the Japan Senior Tour, led the pack with a 12-under
204 total, five strokes ahead of Isao Aoki's 209.
	   Aoki, 56, seeking the title for an unprecedented fifth straight
year, shot two bogies for a 2-under-par 70. He is Japan's second
most winningest golfer with 73 career victories, following Masashi
``Jumbo'' Ozaki's 109 wins.
	   Close behind Aoki at 210 was fellow countryman Toru Nakayama,
who turned in a 4-under-par 68 on the 6,754-yard (6,146-meter),
par-72 Ube Country Club course.
	   Taiwan's Hsieh Min-nan and Teruo Sugihara of Japan vied for
fourth place, both shooting 69 for a total 211.
	   No one has ever won the same professional golf tournament five
consecutive times. And if Aoki pulls ahead of Marsh to win on
Sunday, it will be an international record.
	   In the Japan Senior Open last year, Aoki became the only golfer
in Japan to win the same event for the fourth straight year.
	   In the United States, only Walter Hagen and Laura Davies have
won the same tournament four years in a row.
	   Davies did it in the 1997 Standard Register Ping. Hagen won the
PGA Championship four straight years beginning in 1924.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After gaining an extra week to decide whether to
allow the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on charges including
genocide, Britain's government faced continuing pressure from Chile
Saturday to let the former dictator come home.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
	   Fourteen trials were already pending and Pinochet had no
immunity from prosecution, said Insulza, who was himself an exile
during Pinochet's rule in Chile. ``These processes are going on and
I fully expect they will result in justice,'' he said.
	   On Friday, a magistrate granted a one-week extension _ until
Dec. 11 _ for Home Secretary Jack Straw to decide whether to permit
extradition proceedings to begin.
	   Pinochet, 83, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year rule,
remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he is
recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British police on
Oct. 16.
	   There was fresh evidence of strains in Chile's relations with
Britain. The Ministry of Defense said it has canceled plans for the
frigate HMS Sutherland to appear at a naval fair in the Chilean
port of Valparaiso, and the Foreign Office said it was temporarily
closing its consular office in the city. Four other British
consulates and the embassy in Santiago remain open.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
ordered Pinochet to appear in court on Dec. 11 to hear Straw's
decision, ``subject to any medical reports.''
	   ``There must be time given for proper consideration,'' Parkinson
told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet on Friday.
``It is in some respects quite a historic decision to make.''
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled Wednesday that Pinochet
could not claim immunity as a former head of state.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met Insulza on Friday, said he
assured the Chilean that Pinochet's arrest and subsequent actions
by the British government were not politically motivated, but were
a matter of law.
	   ``We both expressed our shared commitment to maintaining good
relations between our two countries,'' Cook said.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Straw would make the
decision independently.
	   ``He will not be seeking the views of Cabinet colleagues,'' said
a spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
prime minister does not expect to be consulted on this at all.''
	   Pinochet is receiving psychiatric care for stress-related
disorders, which his lawyers might cite in a bid to have him found
mentally unfit to stand trial, The Times reported Friday, citing
unidentified sources.
	   Straw, whose department is responsible for justice issues, has
wide discretion to decide whether to send the Spanish extradition
request through the courts _ or to allow Pinochet to go free.
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew President Salvador Allende. Allende died in
the coup.

Philippines won't block Cambodia's membership in ASEAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines will not block
Cambodia's entry into the regional group, Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, but will not push for it either, a senior Philippine
official said Saturday.
	   Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said the Philippines will not
oppose a consensus among ASEAN members to take in Cambodia.
	   ASEAN includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   But the Philippines, like Thailand, will not push for it because
a coalition government has not yet been formed in Cambodia, Baja
said.
	   ``As of now, there is no coalition government. We will not stand
in the way if there is a consensus,'' Baja said.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said last week it
was unlikely that Cambodia would become a member in time for the
ASEAN summit in Vietnam on Dec. 15-16.
	   Cambodia's entry into ASEAN was postponed last year following
Premier Hun Sen's ouster of Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in
a violent coup.
	   A resolution of the crisis and the formation of a viable
government were set as preconditions before ASEAN would consider
admitting Cambodia as its 10th member.
	   Siazon said ASEAN foreign ministers would hold an emergency
meeting in Singapore once a coalition government is formed.
	   Baja said Cambodia's membership depends heavily on Vietnam, this
year's summit host, and Singapore, the chairman of the ASEAN
standing committee. He did not elaborate.

Albanian president signs constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian President Rexhep Meidani signed
the nation's first post-communist constitution Saturday,
proclaiming it effective immediately.
	   Thanking international officials for supporting the referendum
process, Meidani called the country's new constitution ``the symbol
of Albania's European future.'' The document outlines civil,
democratic and human rights in the country of 3.2 million, which
emerged from communism in 1991.
	   According to Albania's Central Voting Commission, slightly more
than half of the country's registered voters participated in the
election last weekend, and an overwhelming 93 percent voted in
favor of the constitution.
	   But Sali Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, has
said his party would refuse to recognize the constitution as
legitimate. He called on his supporters Saturday to gather in the
capital's main square to protest against adopting the new
constitution.
	   In the run-up to the elections, Western officials in the region
encouraged Albanians to vote in favor of the document, which they
see as necessary for strengthening the Balkan nation's fragile
democracy.

South Africa gains slender lead

 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on 268 led the
West Indies by seven runs Saturday on the first innings at lunch on
the third day of their first test match.
	   A poor shot by Mark Boucher set South Africa back early on at
Wanderers Stadium, and gave legspinner Rawl Lewis his first test
wicket. He swept unnecessarily and top edged a catch to Brian Lara.
When captain Hansie Cronje was bowled by Curtly Ambrose to give the
West Indian his first wicket in this test, the writing was on the
wall for South Africa.
	   But veteran offspinner Pat Symcox had other ideas, and he
shielded first Allan Donald for a while, and then test debutant
David Terbrugge to push the South Africans past the West Indies
first innings total.
	   Symcox declined the opportunity of many singles, frustrating the
West Indies efforts at having a bowl at Terbrugge, and when he was
eventually run out for 20, a niggling 25-run last-wicket
partnership was brought to an end and Terbrugge had scored just
three runs off only 10 balls faced.
	   Courtney Walsh was unable to advance his West Indies record test
haul beyond 379, after the four wickets he took Friday, but Ambrose
looked sharper than he had on the second day, and his two wickets
gave his figures even more respectability.
	   The West Indies had to survive just two overs before lunch.

 &UR; Saudi considering sending small team to Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia is considering sending
a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out
unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday.
	   Saudi Arabia's top sports official, Prince Faisal bin Fahd, is
studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at least send
a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The plea to reconsider was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah,
president of the Olympic Council of Asia. Sheik Ahmad, a member of
the Kuwaiti royal family, is a friend of Prince Faisal.
	   Saudi Arabia's sudden announcement Wednesday that it is
withdrawing its 105-member team shocked hosts Thailand, who remain
skeptical about the official reasons offered.
	   Saudi sports authorities said the Games conflicted with national
centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   But observers point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai
authorities to solve two, decade-old criminal cases involving their
nationals: the theft of dlrs 20 million worth of jewels from a
Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi diplomats in Bangkok.
	   The cases are widely believed to involve people high up in the
power hierarchy, who in Thailand rarely face prosecution.
	   Saudi Arabia has in the past said relations would only be
normalized when the two cases were solved.
	   Thai newspapers reported Saturday that attempts to convince
Saudi Arabia to participate in the upcoming 13th Asian Games have
failed.
	   Thai Olympic Committee Chairman Gen. Chettha Thanajaro told the
Bangkok Post he sent a last-minute plea to his Saudi counterpart
but has received no response.
	   ``I have done my best. We have to respect their decision,'' he
told the Post.
	   The withdrawal has thrown the Games' schedules into disarray.

Swiss prosecutors move against Russian mafia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NAOMI KOPPEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ For decades Switzerland has been a residence of
choice for the world's richest people, offering privacy, a bit of
skiing and not too much of a tax burden on the good old numbered
bank account.
	   The trial of Russian businessman Sergei Mikhailov, starting
Monday, is the first major Swiss attempt to draw the line against
Russians who obtained their wealth through organized crime.
	   Russians who made their money in the heady post-Communist years
have flocked to buy villas on the so-called Swiss Riviera of Lake
Geneva around Montreux and to secure their fortunes in Swiss banks.
	   Swiss officials say they don't have a breakdown of the Russians
who have come to Switzerland since the fall of communism, but that
they issued residence permits to 5,695 former Soviets by the end of
1996, more than double the figure for 1991, when the Soviet Union
collapsed.
	   Among the new residents, according to Jean Ziegler, an outspoken
critic of the Swiss establishment, are top figures in the
increasingly powerful Russian mafia.
	   ``There are three stages of Russian mafia penetration,''
Ziegler, a university professor and member of parliament, told The
Associated Press.
	   ``When the Soviet Union broke up, Switzerland was the laundering
place for immense fortunes. Then mafia leaders started sending
their families to Switzerland, putting their children in expensive
private schools.
	   ``Now we are in the third stage where some of the mafia dons are
transferring their operational headquarters to Switzerland _ and
that is deadly dangerous,'' Ziegler says.
	   Geneva prosecutors say Mikhailov is head of the Moscow-based
Solntsevskaya crime organization, linked to the worldwide network
of the mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov _ known as Yaponchik _
who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in New York last
year.
	   Geneva prosecutors arrested Mikhailov more than two years ago on
charges of money laundering and membership in a criminal
organization, as well as violations of the strict Swiss property
laws.
	   The money-laundering charges, however, have been dropped because
of the difficulty of obtaining evidence from Russia, Geneva
officials said. Mikhailov maintains that he is an ordinary
businessmen, though he admits to being ``very, very, very rich.''
	   Mikhailov faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in prison.
	   While the 40-year-old has been held since his arrest in the
prison of Champ-Dollon in Geneva, Swiss officials say that has done
little to curb his activities. In March his Swiss lawyer was
arrested after he was caught leaving the prison with letters from
Mikhailov which had not passed through the censor.
	   Although ostensibly letters to Mikhailov's mistress, they are,
Geneva authorities claim, just one of the many ways in which
Mikhailov has continued to run his organization from his prison
cell.
	   The prosecution's main witness is former Moscow police officer
Nikolai Oporov. He resigned from his job and received political
exile in Switzerland following threats to his life and is now under
heavy guard pending the trial.
	   Another probable prosecution witness, Vadim Rozenbaum, who was
due to be interviewed by the investigating judge, will not be
giving evidence _ he was assassinated in the Netherlands in July
1997. No one has ever been charged in the case.
	   Rozenbaum headed a Soviet cooperative in the late 1980s, and
Mikhailov spent 19 months in detention at the time on charges of
extorting money from him, but the charges were dropped for lack of
evidence.
	   While Oporov is the only Russian enlisted for the prosecution,
lawyers for Mikhailov are expected to call up to 25 Russians.
	   A total of 90 witnesses have been called, so the trial is
expected to last two weeks, longer than the usual three or four
days typical in Switzerland.
	   Ziegler says whatever the outcome of the Mikhailov trial, the
only way to make a dent in the Russian mafia is to make sweeping
changes to the banking system.
	   ``Switzerland shouldn't allow the opening of Russian banks here,
as more than 70 per cent are in the hands of the mafia, and we
should be much more careful with residence permits,'' Ziegler said.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah comment in new final grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon, a day after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a guerrilla roadside bombing.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
between the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 28 kilometers
(17 miles) southwest of this southern market town.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air raid,
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The missile attack occurred hours after an ambush by Hezbollah
guerrillas on Israeli soldiers who were trying to retrieve a
disabled military vehicle near the Lebanon-Israel border, the
Hezbollah said in a statement. It did not mention any casualties.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the ambush, which
Hezbollah said took place just before midnight.
	   On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside
bombing near the border claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
Two Israeli soldiers also were killed on Wednesday.
	   The casualties raised to seven the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in southern Lebanon in the last 10 days.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militiamen from a occupied zone in southern
Lebanon that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territories from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Following the recent Israeli casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu cut short a trip to Europe and retuned home for a meeting
with Cabinet ministers and army generals scheduled for Sunday to
review the Lebanon policy.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would only pull Israeli troops out of
southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to attacks
by Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group.
	   Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government is willing to give
such a guarantee.
	   ``We will not act as border police for Israel and will not give
(it) security guarantees,'' Ammar Musawi, a Hezbollah
representative in Parliament, said in an interview broadcast
Saturday.
	   Musawi also threatened to hit back at Israel if it strikes at
Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation to guerrilla attacks.
	   ``The resistance will not stand idle if the infrastructure and
civilians are targeted,'' he told the Lebanese Broadcasting
Corporation television.
	   Avigdor Kahalani, the Israeli public security minister, had
called on Israel Friday to attack Beirut and knock out electricity
and water services there.

Remains of primates found in 40-million-year-old formation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The discovery of fossilized primate
remains in a 40-million-year-old rock could lead to a better
understanding of when man first appeared in Asia, members of a
Myanmar-Japanese team said Saturday.
	   The remains of the primates, with an upper jaw and teeth still
intact, were found earlier this month in the Pondaung region of
northwestern Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Col. Than Tun, leader of the Myanmar team, told reporters the
remains were a ``vital find,'' complementing the discovery at
Pondaung last year of the left and right lower jaws of an
amphipithecus primate.
	   The latest finds were of pondaungia and amphipithecus primates,
he said.
	   Until the Pondaung findings, it was believed that primates from
which man evolved first appeared in Southeast Asia at a later date.
	   Scholars from the United States and France have also conducted
surveys in the Pondaung region.

 &UR; England will battle to stay in the test: Gooch
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Coach Graham Gooch conceded England will
battle to stay competitive in the second cricket test after being
bowled out for 112 by Australia on the opening day Saturday.
	   Sent in to bat on a fast and bouncy WACA pitch, England lasted
39 overs to be shot out soon after lunch. Australia replied with
150 for three at stumps.
	   ``It was not a 112 pitch,'' was the England coach's first
reaction to the side's pathetic batting display. ``We lacked the
resolution to bat on a not too difficult pitch. We struggled to
cope with the bowling.''
	   ``It was good accurate bowling, there was no extravagant swing.
Unfortunately, we were not equal to it. They got the ball in the
business area.
	   ``It will be hard slog from here, but we will try and fight to
stay in the game by restricting Australia to something
reasonable.''
	   Gooch felt everything possible was done by the support staff to
get the side prepared for the test.
	   ``We can't be happy,'' said Gooch. ``It is not a competitive
score. We were not equal to it.''
	   Damien Fleming, the chief Australian destroyer with 5-46 in his
eighth test, said Australia had carried the upper hand it gained in
Brisbane into the second test.
	   England was saved by the weather in the first of the five tests
as it faced defeat after being set 348 to win at the Gabba.
	   Fleming, who went wicketless in Brisbane, said he worked on a
few technical flaws in his action, and was rewarded.
	   ``I worked in the nets and felt much better and simply carried
it into the test,'' said Fleming.

Ministers, senior officials owe millions to national bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Senior ministers, prominent officials and
top Kenyan businessman are among debtors who owe billions of Kenyan
shillings to the national bank and to a number of troubled or
recently collapsed banks, according to lists published Saturday.
	   In a list released late Friday by the Central Bank of Kenya,
senior Cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott and Raymond Moi, son of
President Daniel arap Moi, were among the ministers, members of
parliament and powerful businessmen with shares in companies owing
huge commercial debts to several failed and failing institutions,
newspaper reports said.
	   The central bank report followed Thursday's presentation in
parliament of a list of 87 companies, whose shareholders also
include senior politicians and businessmen, which owe more than 8.4
billion Kenyan shillings (about dlrs 140 million) to the National
Bank of Kenya, according to the reports.
	   Minister of Local Government Sam Ongeri, Minister of Public
Works Kipkalya Kones and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly
Joab Amino were among the highest debtors, the independent Daily
Nation newspaper said.
	   Copies of the lists could not be attained Saturday.
	   The disclosure provoked sharp criticism by opposition members of
the National Assembly who called on the government to fire the
bank's managers and take action to recover the funds, the East
African Standard newspaper said.
	   One legislator said the scandal was likely just the ``tip of the
iceberg'' in high-level corruption.
	   ``For how long will over-burdened Kenyans continue to finance
the lifestyles of a few thieves,'' Beth Mugo, a member of
parliament for the Dagoretti Party, was quoted in the Standard as
saying.
	   Kenya has been plagued by financial corruption to such an extent
that in 1997, the International Monetary Fund suspended a dlrs 220
million loan because it said the government had refused to tackle
high level corruption. The national bank, which is in financial
crisis, has long been seen as a milking fund for politicians and
well-connected businessmen.
	   Thursday's list of National Bank debtors was presented to
parliament by Assistant Minister of Finance Charles Kirui, in order
to explain why the government had advanced Kenyan shillings 2
billion (about dlrs 33 million) to the bank last week.
	   Opposition legislator David Mwenje of the Embakasi party was
cited in the Standard as saying the injection to the national bank
``was tantamount to printing paper money'' and was an abuse of
public funds.
	   In the list released Friday by the Central Bank of Kenya, dozens
of companies and individuals were named as debtors to 12 different
banks, owing more than Kenyan Shillings 13.2 billion (about dlrs
2.2 million) in total.
	   Minister of Regional Cooperation Nicholas Biwott, a close
advisor to Moi who is viewed as Kenya's second-most powerful man,
was listed as owing Kenyan shillings 708 million (about dlrs 11.8)
to Trade Bank, according to the East African Standard and the Kenya
Times.
	   The Daily Nation said Raymond Moi and partner Sanjivan Ruprah in
Simba Airlines, owe Heritage Bank Kenyan shillings 52 million
(about dlrs 866,000).
	   Both banks, which have since collapsed, have sued and the cases
are still pending, the Nation said.
	   Two other Cabinet ministers were also listed, as was a woman
judge and prominent businessman Kamlesh Pattni, who has been
embroiled in several large-scale financial scandals, also appeared
on the list, the Standard said.

Reappointment of Hariri as prime minister hits snag
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZEINA KARAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to
win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he failed to
receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile
Lahoud.
	   Hariri is still the front-runner to form the next government but
Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted sources as saying that
Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the 128 members in
Parliament declared their support for him during a meeting with
Lahoud Friday.
	   According to the constitution, a president must begin his term
by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet through a decree
issued after consulting with Parliament members.
	   A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came
through after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. Hariri had even
scheduled Friday a traditional meeting between the prime
minister-designate and former prime ministers, but that was
canceled.
	   The state-run National News Agency said that while only 62
deputies told Lahoud they supported Hariri, the rest refused to
divulge their choice or left it to the president to decide.
	   A TV station owned by Hariri said he won the backing of at least
100 deputies.
	   The delay reflects the tug-of-war among the power brokers in the
country.
	   Under a formula aimed at preventing the recurrence of the
1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite
Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister and a Shiite
Parliament speaker.
	   While the Christian Lahoud may have no objection to appointing
the Sunni Hariri, it is possible that Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri's 19 Shiite supporters in the legislature are holding out to
emphasize their value.
	   The leading An-Nahar and other newspapers said the delay could
last for days. But in the end, it is Hariri that is most likely to
be renamed on the strength of his record in office.
	   Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, has almost single-handedly
created a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country
destroyed by the civil war. He is also credited with stabilizing
the currency and restoring confidence in the postwar economy.
	   But his government under former president Elias Hrawi were
dogged by accusations of corruption.
	   Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed
three times during the extended term of former President Elias
Hrawi. He has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since
Lahoud succeeded Hrawi on Tuesday.
	   Lahoud, a general who as army commander rebuilt the military
from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October, has pledged
in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the
corruption-plagued administration.

Ethiopian man's hand cut off for stealing in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities on Saturday
chopped off the right hand of an Ethiopian man for stealing at
Islam's holiest site in Mecca, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Jamal Abdu Afkari was convicted of pick pocketing worshipers
praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal point of
Muslim prayers.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   Afkari's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of Mecca
in western Saudi Arabia, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
	   This was the sixth amputation this year. Over the past few
months, two Saudis, two Egyptians and an Afghan man have had their
right hands cut off for pick pocketing.
	   Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a
public square.
	   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 26 people. Last year
124 people were executed.

South Africa gains slender lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on 268 led the
West Indies by seven runs Saturday on the first innings at lunch on
the third day of their first test match.
	   A poor shot by Mark Boucher set South Africa back early on at
Wanderers Stadium, and gave legspinner Rawl Lewis his first test
wicket. He swept unnecessarily and top edged a catch to Brian Lara.
When captain Hansie Cronje was bowled by Curtly Ambrose to give the
West Indian his first wicket in this test, the writing was on the
wall for South Africa.
	   But veteran offspinner Pat Symcox had other ideas, and he
shielded first Allan Donald for a while, and then test debutant
David Terbrugge to push the South Africans past the West Indies
first innings total.
	   Symcox declined the opportunity of many singles, frustrating the
West Indies efforts at having a bowl at Terbrugge, and when he was
eventually run out for 20, a niggling 25-run last-wicket
partnership was brought to an end and Terbrugge had scored just
three runs off only 10 balls faced.
	   Courtney Walsh was unable to advance his West Indies record test
haul beyond 379, after the four wickets he took Friday, but Ambrose
looked sharper than he had on the second day, and his two wickets
gave his figures even more respectability.
	   The West Indies had to survive just two overs before lunch.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The governing Bharatiya Janata Party was
headed for a rout in legislative elections in key states on
Saturday, an apparent rebuke by the public for the 8-month-old
Hindu nationalist government.
	   The outcome has no bearing on the federal government of Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But a serious loss of prestige could
stoke infighting in his shaky 19-party coalition and embolden the
opposition Congress Party to try to unseat him if it wins enough
defectors from the ruling alliance.
	   Early results and trends showed the Congress Party ousting the
sitting BJP government in the important states of New Delhi and
Rajasthan, where it may win as many as three-fourths of the
assembly seats in each state.
	   The battle was closer in the Congress-ruled central state of
Madhya Pradesh, but first results indicated Congress surprisingly
would hold on to the state government.
	   Regional parties were poised to dislodge the ruling Congress
Party in the remote northeastern state of Mizoram. But the contest
was deemed less important because the BJP did not contest it.
	   More than 600 seats were contested in the four states in the
voting Wednesday by about 5,000 candidates from dozens of political
parties.
	   A painful increase in the price of vegetables and staple foods
hurt the BJP in the weeks before the election, wiping out any
remaining credit it may have earned for its highly popular decision
to conduct nuclear explosions last May.
	   The election was the first political test for the BJP since it
took office eight months ago.
	   But it also was a key electoral test for the Congress Party's
new leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
torchbearer of the dynasty that gave India three prime ministers.
	   Congress has said it will not make an immediate attempt to
topple the government when Parliament convenes Monday for a
three-week winter session. But it has said it would not ``shirk the
responsibility'' if Vajpayee's coalition collapsed on its own.
	   Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since she
emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.

	   HAKKARI, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish military helicopter crashed
near this southeastern city on Saturday killing 17 soldiers, the
Anatolia news agency said.
	   The type of the helicopter and the cause of the crash was not
immediately clear.
	   The agency said the chopper was on a mission at the time of the
crash near the town of Cukurca, on the Iraqi border.
	   Turkish troops have been fighting autonomy seeking Kurdish
guerrillas in the region. The rebels have downed Turkish military
helicopters in the past.
	   Military officials were not available for comment.
	   The conflict has claimed nearly 37,000 lives since 1984.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon, a day after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a guerrilla roadside bombing.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
between the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 28 kilometers
(17 miles) southwest of this southern market town.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air raid,
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The missile attack occurred hours after an ambush by Hezbollah
guerrillas on Israeli soldiers who were trying to retrieve a
disabled military vehicle near the Lebanon-Israel border, the
Hezbollah said in a statement. It did not mention any casualties.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the ambush, which
Hezbollah said took place just before midnight.
	   On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside
bombing near the border claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
Two Israeli soldiers also were killed on Wednesday.
	   The casualties raised to seven the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in southern Lebanon in the last 10 days.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militiamen from a occupied zone in southern
Lebanon that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territories from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Ethiopian man's hand cut off for stealing in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities on Saturday
chopped off the right hand of an Ethiopian man for stealing at
Islam's holiest site in Mecca, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Jamal Abdu Afkari was convicted of pick pocketing worshipers
praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal point of
Muslim prayers.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   Afkari's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of Mecca
in western Saudi Arabia, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
	   This was the sixth amputation this year. Over the past few
months, two Saudis, two Egyptians and an Afghan man have had their
right hands cut off for pick pocketing.
	   Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a
public square.
	   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 26 people. Last year
124 people were executed.

Anwar accuses prosecution lawyers of framing him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Saturday accused two prosecutors of trying to cajole a
potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes by him.
	   In a document filed Saturday in High Court, Anwar asked the
court to remove senior government lawyers Abdul Gani Patail and
Azahar Mohamed from his corruption and sexual misconduct trial.
	   ``I believe that their continuing to be prosecutors in my trial
will pervert the administration, and will result in a travesty of
justice,'' Anwar said in a five-page affidavit handed out to
reporters by his wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   His current trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will
be tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of
sexual misconduct, at a later date.
	   He denies the charges, calling them part of political vendetta
orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   In the affidavit, Anwar said that the two prosecutors tried to
convict him by negotiating a plea bargain with his former tennis
partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
	   Anwar said Abdul Gani and Azahar indicated that they would
indict Nallakaruppan under a lesser charge if he was prepared to
lie about how Anwar committed sexual offenses with ``various
married and unmarried women.''
	   Anwar said the two people went of ``out of their way to get
Nallakaruppan to fabricate evidence in order to prefer more charges
against me for other alleged sexual offenses.''
	   Abdul Gani and Azahar could not be reached for comment.
	   Last month, Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah said that once
Anwar's trial ends, more sex-related charges would be leveled
against him based on new evidence against Anwar and Nallakaruppan.
	   A businessman, Nalla was indicted shortly before Anwar's arrest
and charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition. He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book ``Fifty
Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was still in power.
	   Nalla and Anwar have denied the allegations, and Anwar has
accused authorities of conspiring to destroy his political career.
	   One of Nalla's lawyers, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, said earlier this
week he planned to drop out of the case to take the stand as a
defense witness.
	   Meanwhile, a higher court on Saturday put off a request to free
him on bail after Anwar's lawyers said they needed more time to
study a new court ruling that could potentially disqualify any
further attempts to free Anwar on bail.
	   The higher court moved the hearing to Dec. 5.

Rebels dig in, brace for defense in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ Threatened by a government
counteroffensive, Congolese rebels on Saturday appeared to have
halted a four-month advance into the heart of Congo and instead dug
in to brace for air strikes against them.
	   ``We're avoiding confrontation to cut losses,'' said rebel Capt.
Baudeoin, who only gave his first name. ``The enemy is putting
pressure on us, and we're resisting.''
	   Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally, has deployed
troops, tanks, helicopters and jet fighters in eastern Congo to aid
the Congolese army counteroffensive at Kabalo, a key railway
junction 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of the eastern rebel
stronghold at Goma.
	   This is the first time the rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
have had to stop their march across the eastern half of Congo since
the war began Aug. 2.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, instead
demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for
the insurgents.
	   Both countries say they will continue fighting as long as Congo
remains unstable, and accuse Kabila of enlisting among his army's
ranks thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Baudeoin said his troops on Thursday forced back
government-allied tanks when they tried to take the Nzofu Bridge
over the Congo River, 14 kilometers (8 miles) west of Kabalo, which
guards the entrance to the town.
	   He admitted losses among his troops, and said Zimbabwean
soldiers had also been killed in the fighting. He did not say how
many died, but said the foreigners had been promptly buried, while
their identity cards and green and red berets had been kept for
record.
	   One of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Defense cards carried the
photo and the name of Godfriy Masamwa, a private.
	   On Friday, Zimbabwean MiG-21 fighter jets retaliated by dropping
bombs on the abandoned hamlets surrounding Kabalo, but caused no
casualties.
	   One 50-kilogram bomb landed in the sand in between huts made of
mud bricks, creating a huge crater. Another cluster bomb destroyed
railtracks in front of the abandoned, white railway building, which
has not been in use since Kabalo fell to the rebels last month.
	   Most of the population has fled into thick tropical forest to
avoid almost daily air raids since Kabila and his allies, which
also include Angola, Namibia and Chad, launched their
counteroffensive in the east.
	   Rebel commanders dismissed the danger posed by the government
offensive, saying the aircraft were flying too high for fear of
being hit by ground fire.
	   Bombing runs were too imprecise and insignificant to make a
difference, he said.
	   Faced with the rainy seasons' muddy roads and swelling lakes and
rivers, and the threat of air strikes, the rebels have been forced
to adopt new tactics of moving at night and resting by day, often
waiting for the rains to stop.
	   ``We had to change our behavior,'' Baudeoin said.
	   Army convoys from the airstrip at Nyunzu, bringing in fresh
supplies of ammunition and weapons to front-line positions 150
kilometers (90 miles) away, have been avoiding main roads, instead
inching in dark for hours through narrow bush tracks.
	   During the day, soldiers dodge open areas, moving quickly,
avoiding forming columns across rice fields and looking for cover
in banana trees.
	   Baudeoin said most of the rebel attacks during the night
targeted enemy artillery positions they had located during daylight
hours and spots where Zimbabwean Mi-24 transport helicopters drop
off soldiers close to the front-lines.

New Zealand urges Philippines not to go ahead with execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ New Zealand has urged the Philippines
not to carry out its first execution in 22 years, joining the
Vatican, the European Union and Canada in their appeals.
	   Amid growing fears about rising crime, legislators in 1994
brought back the death penalty, which had been abolished in 1987.
	   But no execution has been carried out. Leo Echegaray, a poor
carpenter convicted of raping his step-daughter, is the first among
more than 800 death-row inmates scheduled for execution.
	   Foreign Undersecretary Leonides Caday said Saturday that New
Zealand Ambassador Graeme Charles Waters called on him last week to
express his concern.
	   Waters reminded him that the Philippines had signed an
international protocol that requires signatories to work for a
world-wide end to the imposition of death penalties, he said.
	   Caday said he told Waters the Philippines signed the protocol
two years ago but did not ratify it.
	   Franklin Ebdalin, foreign affairs assistant secretary for legal
affairs, said the Philippines only made a commitment but ``didn't
guarantee we'd abolish the death penalty.''
	   President Joseph Estrada, who has earlier turned down the
appeals from the Vatican and other countries to cancel the
execution, said the execution would serve as a lesson to child
rapists.
	   Many Filipinos believe the death penalty will deter crime and
that crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and human rights say there is no proof
that the death penalty deters crime.
	   More than 450 _ or more than half of those on death row _ have
been convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   Pablito Andan, who was convicted of rape and murder, is also
scheduled to be executed this year but is appealing his sentence.
	   At least five others whose sentences have been upheld by the
Supreme Court may be executed next year.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping, rape and drug-trafficking.

Problems remain in South Africans first-ever voter registration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Turnout for registration for
the 1999 elections has been very low, with problems persisting in
the compilation of South Africa's first all-race voters list,
officials said Saturday.
	   Only slightly more than 235,000 of the 12.7 million eligible
voters in the northern half of South Africa registered Friday, the
first day of three days of registration for northern South Africa.
The 12 million potential voters in the southern half of the country
are to register next weekend.
	   Hundreds of registration sites remained closed because civil
servants were not showing up to staff them, and voters were still
being directed to the wrong sites.
	   Even President Nelson Mandela registered at the wrong site
Friday. The Independent Electoral Commission repeated the error
when it directed Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to the wrong voter
registration point.
	   The mistake was discovered in time and Mbeki will go to the
proper site when he returns Sunday from a conference in Paris, said
Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African National Congress.
	   Many farmworkers and domestic workers could be excluded from
voting in next year's election because they don't know they have to
register. The South African Press Association reported that many of
hundreds of laborers in North West Province who were preparing
fields for planting said they were unaware they needed to register.
	   IEC chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu said he was not overly
concerned about the low turnout for voter registrations.
	   ``For the fact that we had quite a difficult start, the number
doesn't depress me greatly,'' he told reporters. ``I did not expect
five million on the first day.''
	   No date has been set yet for the 1999 election, the first since
the 1994 all-race balloting which marked the end of apartheid.

Sloppy Pakistan fielders let Zimbabwe recover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Neil Johnson struck his maiden century
and revived Zimbabwe's hopes on the second day of the first cricket
Test against Pakistan Saturday.
	   A shoddy Pakistan fielding that saw them dropping four catches
allowed the visitors to move to 218 for seven in their first
innings in reply to Pakistan's 296 when stumps were drawn for the
day, 13 overs before schedule due to fading light.
	   The most crucial blow for Pakistan came late in the last session
when Johnson was dropped on 99 by Azhar Mahmood in the second slip
which denied paceman Wasim Akram his 350th Test wicket and brought
up the century for Johnson.
	   Johnson, the 28-year-old left-hander, playing in only his second
Test after migrating from South Africa and getting his citizenship
just before the first Test against India last month, dominated the
seventh wicket stand of 103 with Heath Streak (22), who was bowled
by leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed.
	   Streak also got a life when Saeed Anwar dropped an easy catch at
mid-on with Zimbabwe at 149 for six and Streak batting on eight.
	   Johnson was unbeaten on 107 with the help of 16 fours which
featured three successive off paceman Waqar Younis one over. He
faced 115 balls during his 162 minutes of stay at the wicket.
	   Akram and Younis shared three wickets each conceding 49 and 52
runs respectively.
	   ``I am delighted that I have scored a century in front of one of
the best bowling attacks in the world (Wasim Akram and Waqar
Younis),'' Johnson said.
	   ``It's a great moment for me and I will never forget it. The
wicket is pretty good and although it helps the seamers the ball
comes on to bat nicely,'' Johnson said.
	   Paceman Younis, back from his elbow injury which forced him to
sit out in the series against Australia, had recked the top order
with three wickets in space of four deliveries which had reduced
the Zimbabweans to 63 for four.
	   Younis had Grant Flower caught by Mahmood before he removed
Murray Goodwin (29) and Andy Flower off successive deliveries.
Johnson denied Younis the hat-trick and together with Streak
	   Akram then further compounded Zimbabwean misery when he had
Alistair Campbell leg before and bowled Craig Wishart (3) as the
right-hander left the delivery which came back sharply.
	   Ealier, Grant Flower was twice dropped and once got caught off a
no-ball as Zimbabwe crawled to 45 for one at lunch.
	   Flower, who completed 2000 Test runs when on nine, made 15
before Mahmood had finally caught in the slips of Younis.
	   A fiery opening spell by left-arm paceman Akram had Flower in
all sorts of trouble after Pakistan was bowled out for 296 in its
first innings.
	   Akram had Gavin Rennie leg before in the second over for two
before Pakistan let Flower off the hook twice.
	   Some sloppy fielding by Pakistan saw Flower dropped by
wicketkeeper Moin Khan, who needlessly dived in front of waiting
Inzamamul Haq in the first slip. The ball popped out of his right
hand off Waqar Younis.
	   Akram then had Flower caught in the third slip by Azhar Mahmood
but saw umpire George Sharp declaring a no-ball. Flower could have
been out once again shortly before lunch, but this time Ijaz Ahmed
could not hold onto the catch at gully.
	   Earlier, Heath Streak polished off Pakistan's tail, claiming
three wickets in space of 11 deliveries with the second new ball
after the home team resumed at the overnight total of 272 for six.
	   Yousuf Youhanna added only one to his overnight 74 before
captain Alistair
	   Campbell had him caught in the first slip off Streak.
	   Youhanna, dropped on one Friday, hit 13 fours and faced 164
balls during his 229 minutes of stay at the wicket.
	   Henry Olonga had Wasim Akram's (10) off stump cartwheeling
before Streak trapped Mushtaq Ahmed (0) and Waqar Younis (6)
trapped leg before and wrapped up Pakistan's innings in 33 minutes
for 296.
	   Streak was the most successful Zimbabwean bowler with four
wickets for 93 while Mpumelelo Mbangwa finished with three for 40.

Japan, South Korea sign fisheries accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korea signed an agreement Saturday
that sets new fishing boundaries and quotas, easing tensions over
rights to waters around disputed islands.
	   The pact permits vessels from Japan and South Korea to fish
within 200 nautical miles (230 miles, 370 kilometers) of each
country's shores _ the limit for exclusive fishing rights under the
1994 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
	   Japan and South Korea are less than 400 nautical miles (460
miles, 740 kilometers) apart and both had claimed exclusive rights
in overlapping areas.
	   The two nations agreed to set up a joint fishing zone around
disputed islets, located about 35 nautical miles (40 miles, 64
kilometers) from the shores of both countries.
	   The islets, called Takeshima in Japan and Tok-do in Korea, are
surrounded by fertile fishing grounds and have been the source of
persistent acrimony between the two countries.
	   The signing during a meeting of Cabinet ministers from both
countries in the southern city of Kagoshima, formalized the accord
reached in September, a Japanese government official said.
	   Kagoshima is 985 kilometers (616 miles) southwest of Tokyo on
Japan's southernmost main island.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and his Korean
counterpart Hong Soon-young inked the agreement in a ceremony also
attended by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and South Korean
Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil.
	   Tempers flared between the neighbors in January after Japan said
it wanted out of a 1965 treaty that had set exclusive fishing
rights within 12 nautical miles (14 miles, 22 kilometers).
	   Under the new accord, both sides also agreed to reduce their
fishing catches in each other's waters.

	   PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan presided a
meeting of the leaders of the countries at war in the Congo on
Saturday in an effort to persuade them to renounce violence.
	   The meeting took place on the sidelines of a summit of African
leaders in Paris that focused on security and ways to achieve peace
on the continent.
	   Annan gathered together Congolese leader Laurent-Desire Kabila,
as well as the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are supporting
rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The heads of Zimbabwe and
Burkina Faso also took part, the French presidential press service
said.
	   The purpose of the talks was to try to work out some framework
for peace negotiations between the warring parties.
	   The war in Congo dominated the final day of a Paris summit of
African leaders.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders - especially those at
war in Congo - to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Speaking to the summit Friday, Annan said many African conflicts
are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' and that the Congo
conflict poses the continent's greatest challenge.
	   French President Jacques Chirac urged African nations to do
their own peacekeeping - a departure from past practices that put
the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders confronted the
issue of how to tame wars raging across the continent.
	   All eyes were on Kabila, who finally sat down with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention
following the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by human rights
groups, ruled Friday that Kabila could not be pursued for human
rights violations because he benefits from customary immunity
accorded heads of state in office.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.
	   Summit participants said they hoped for progress in the Congo
crisis.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo in December.
	   Kabila in the past has not been optimistic, saying a pullout of
Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition
for substantive peace talks.
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks Saturday with Chirac.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said Friday that there
had been some progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his
adversaries, with each of the parties presenting their views.
	   The French president stressed the need for Africans to take more
responsibility for settling conflicts.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of
responsibility for Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.

Former political prisoner vows to fight Singapore's security law
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Chia Thye Poh spent 22 years in prison, without
ever being charged or tried, enduring solitary confinement in dark
cells and painful force-feedings during his hunger strike.
	   But Chia vowed to continue to fight to abolish the Singapore law
that put him in prison _ the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge or trial for anyone the
government suspects is a subversive threat.
	   ``I hope that what happened to me will never happen to anybody
else, ever,'' he said Saturday in an interview at his parents' home
in northern Singapore.
	   The frail, bespectacled Chia, 57, appeared relaxed and
optimistic, although it has been just two days since the
Singapore's Home Ministry pronounced him a completely free man.
	   He has also won back his right to free speech.
	   Chia _ one of the world's longest-held political prisoners
according to Amnesty International _ showed emotion, when asked
about the years lost in prison.
	   ``Without any charge, any trial, the best part of my life was
taken away just like that,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   His arrest came in October 1966. Then 25, Chia, a physicist and
a member of Parliament from the now defunct socialist Barisan
Party, was imprisoned under the Internal Security Act.
	   The authorities wanted him to sign a statement confessing he was
a communist, but he refused to do so.
	   ``I was never a threat to the state. My activities were always
legal and constitutional,'' Chia said.
	   ``Today, I don't ask for apologies, but I would like to see that
the Internal Security Act is abolished.''
	   Singapore has frequently been criticized abroad for its hard
line against any challenges that might upset the political
stability in this prosperous Southeast Asian nation.
	   In 1989, Chia was released from prison but confined to a
fortress on the tourist island of Sentosa, near Singapore.
	   Starting in 1992, the restrictions were gradually eased. Chia
was allowed to work in downtown Singapore as a translator for eight
hours a day and eventually to live again in the main part of the
city-state.
	   Last year, the government allowed Chia to travel to Germany on a
one-year Hamburg Foundation Fellowship.
	   Still, he was prohibited from making public statements without
the government's permission.
	   While he was in prison, he was at times put in dark cells and
solitary confinement, Chia recalled. He was repeatedly force-fed
during a hunger strike in the 1970s, he said.
	   ``They would handcuff me backwards, and then force-feed me
through the nose ... It was very painful,'' he said.
	   When his lawyer, T.T. Rajah, was sent to prison, also under the
Internal Security Act, in the mid-70s, he felt desperate.
	   He had no lawyer for several years until another Singapore
opposition leader, lawyer J.B. Jeyaretnam, took up his case.
	   Hope that one day he would be free was what sustained him during
all those years, Chia said.
	   ``I knew that the government, no matter how long they keep me,
one day will have to let me go,'' he said.
	   The Ministry of Home Affairs said Chia was no longer likely to
threaten Singapore's security. But it warned, that should he do so,
``he will be dealt firmly under the law.''
	   Chia is still interested in politics but has no plans, as of
yet.
	   ``I think I am still being watched,'' he said.

Saddam son's commandos crack down in Karbala after attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein's eldest son,
Odai, sent commandos to the southern city of Karbala during a
crackdown following the assassination attempt on Saddam's deputy,
Babil newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The newspaper, published by Odai, said 39 ``saboteurs and
agents'' were arrested in the crackdown that took place 72 hours
after the bid on Izzat Ibrahim's life on Monday.
	   It did not say how many of the tough and lightly armed commandos
from Saddam's Fedayeen took part or how long the operation lasted.
	   Karbala is in the southern Shiite Muslim heartland, which has
long been a source of opposition to Saddam.
	   Fedayeen is a paramilitary force of about 40,000 run by Odai. To
emphasize their ferocity, its commandos are often shown on
television, butchering cats, dogs and wolves and then eating their
raw meat.
	   They wear black masks on duty and their rough training is geared
towards defending the country in a crisis.
	   Ibrahim escaped without injuries when an unidentified assailant
hurled two grenades while he was attending a religious ceremony in
Karbala, a Shiite holy city 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of
Baghdad.
	   Several of Ibrahim's bodyguards and bystanders were wounded.
Witnesses said the lone attacker was killed by Ibrahim's bodyguards
on the spot.
	   ``Babil has learned that heroes from Saddam's Fedayeen ....
stormed hideouts of saboteurs and agents 72 hours after the vicious
aggression on Mr. Izzat Ibrahim,'' the report in Babil said.
	   It said the decision to send the commandos was taken by Odai.
	   Babil did not say whether the 39 arrested people were involved
in the assassination attempt but described them as those ``who had
sold themselves to the enemy.''
	   Ibrahim is Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command
Council. He also serves as a deputy commander of the Iraqi armed
forces.
	   The attempt on Ibrahim was the first reported on a senior Iraqi
official since December 1996, when gunmen shot Odai about 10 times
while he waited in his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.
	   No one has so far claimed responsibility for the attack on
Ibrahim but Babil's report hinted that foreign agents were behind
it _ a reference to Iran.
	   Iraqi dissidents abroad claim Baghdad falsified the news about
the assassination attempt to increase its repression of Shiite
Muslims in southern Iraq.
	   Shiites are in a slight majority in Iraq but Saddam and most of
his officials are Sunnis.

Leader of Karenni rebels dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ The leader of one of the last ethnic
rebel groups fighting the Myanmar government has died and was
buried on a frontier hilltop, his followers said Saturday.
	   Pyar Reh, 58, who was chairman of the Karenni National
Progressive Party, died Thursday from kidney failure at his border
hideout.
	   The Karenni are among a welter of ethnic minority groups in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, who for decades fought for greater
autonomy from the authoritarian central government.
	   After cease-fire pacts were cut with most, the Karenni, Karen
and Shan are the last main groups still waging guerrilla war in
remote areas along the Thai-Myanmar border.
	   The Karenni rebels had signed a cease-fire agreement in early
1995 but were soon back fighting, saying the government had failed
to honor terms of the pact.
	   Witnesses who attended the funeral said Pyar Reh was buried in a
simple Christian ceremony opposite Thailand's Mae Hong Son
Province, some 650 kilometers (404 miles) northwest of Bangkok.
	   The witnesses said hundreds of representatives from other ethnic
groups gathered to honor the Karenni leader.

Ukraine commemorates victims of 1930s famine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma and top officials
Saturday laid flowers at a monument to mark a newly established
commemorative day for millions of Ukrainians who lost their lives
in the famine of the 1930s.
	   Kuchma signed a decree on Friday declaring a day of mourning for
the victims of the 1932-33 famine that historians say claimed up to
6 million lives.
	   The famine was a result of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's
repressions when millions were sentenced to death or years of hard
labor in concentration camps.
	   Ukrainian and Western scholars have said the famine was planned
by Soviet authorities who confiscated massive amounts of grain from
peasants, leaving them with virtually no food to survive.
	   Ceremonies and concerts commemorating those years are to be held
annually in Ukraine during November, the presidential press service
said.
	   Soviet leaders denied the famine in Ukraine even occurred until
a few years before the Soviet Union's collapse, when newspapers
first published stories about the mass starvation.

Paisley slams Blair, Trimble at Democratic Unionist Party
</HEADLINE>
conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Rev. Ian Paisley, the
Protestant politician committed to thwarting April's compromise
accord on Northern Ireland, heaped scorn on its key backers
Saturday at his party's annual conference.
	   About 400 supporters of the evangelist's Democratic Unionist
Party gathered at a hotel near Omagh _ the religiously mixed town
where a car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents
slaughtered 29 people in August.
	   In his keynote address Paisley ridiculed Ulster Unionist Party
leader David Trimble, the Protestant leader who shared this year's
Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic leader John Hume.
	   ``Time and time again David Trimble has reneged on his promises
and capitulated to the sellout of our province,'' said Paisley, who
urged hard-liners within Trimble's party ``to resist his
treachery'' and oust him.
	   Paisley accused Tony Blair _ who on Thursday became the first
British prime minister to address the Irish parliament in Dublin _
of scheming to destroy Northern Ireland's 77-year union with
Britain.
	   ``He is the greatest aider and abetter of its destruction that
Dublin and the IRA have ever had,'' Paisley said.
	   Party activists debated the agreement's provision for allowing
early paroles for convicted members of the IRA and armed
pro-British groups. More than 200 of an eligible 450 have already
walked free. The conference unanimously passed a motion calling for
them all to be locked up again.
	   ``Not one bullet has been handed over since the Good Friday
agreement,'' Paisley said in reference to the accord's call for
outlawed paramilitary groups to destroy their weapons stockpiles by
mid-2000.
	   ``Yet while Tony Blair is cheered in Dublin, these filthy
murderers go free, laughing as they quit the jail,'' he said.
	   Paisley boycotted the Northern Ireland negotiations because the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party had been allowed to participate.
	   In Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly elected in June
under terms of the accord, Paisley's anti-agreement bloc won 25
seats to Trimble's 28 _ too few for Paisley to block progress
outright, but sufficient to make compromise-minded Protestants
nervous about moving ahead quickly. Trimble has since refused to
form a key section of the accord, a multi-party administration
involving Sinn Fein, until the IRA starts disarming.
	   Paisley, 72, a member of the British and European parliaments,
founded his party in 1971 to resist efforts by the Ulster Unionists
to share power with the province's Catholic minority. He also
founded his own church, the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster,
that takes a stronlgy anti-Catholic line.

Riot police surround mosque in massive show of force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police armed with
clubs and shields surrounded a mosque in downtown Kuala Lumpur late
Saturday, ready to crack down on any anti-government protests.
	   A helicopter with a bright searchlight hovered over Kampong
Baru, a densely populated neighborhood where demonstrators have met
weekly to demand an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year rule.
	   About 300 men in army fatigues gripped four-foot (120
centimeter) rattan canes as they stationed themselves at the
intersections of the area's narrow streets.
	   Another few dozen plainclothes policemen, milling around with
other officers in regular attire, lurked in an alley behind the
Kampong Baru mosque. A water cannon truck stood by in case of
trouble.
	   But witnesses said that fewer than 100 people were seen in the
mosque for evening prayers.
	   Last Saturday, police used water cannons to disperse hundreds of
protesters who jammed the streets after evening prayers at the
mosque.
	   The capital has seen dozens of anti-government protests that
have drawn thousands to the streets after Mahathir sacked his
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar's arrest 18 days later sparked angry protests that have
sometimes turned violent. Police and Cabinet ministers have warned
of a crackdown if the rallies continue.

Report: rebels kill seven, wound 28 in attack on convoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels in northwestern Uganda
simultaneously attacked a civilian convoy and an army detatchment,
killing seven people, wounding 28, and abducting six others, a
newspaper said Saturday.
	   The attack by rebels of the Lords Resistance Army on the
civilian convoy occurred Friday morning in the village of
Awii-Anaka, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of the
capital Kampala, the government-owned New Vision newspaper said.
	   The rebels burned a bus and a pickup truck, while another bus
and two other pick-ups managed to escape, the newspaper cited State
Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma as saying.
	   Two people were shot, the others were burned to death, and 28
people were injured, the report said.
	   The newspaper said four rebels were killed.
	   Division Commander Brig. Katumba Wamala said 30 rebels divided
into three groups, two attacking the convoy, while another attacked
a nearby army unit.
	   He said the simultaneous attack was to engage the army so the
rebels could hit the busses, the newspaper said.
	   There was no indication on soldier casualties.
	   Katumba said the rebels abducted 10 people but the army released
four. Another six are still being held, he said.
	   The Lords Resistance Army has been waging a 12-year insurgency
in northwestern Uganda aimed at destabilizing the government of
President Yoweri Museveni.
	   They frequently abduct children and teenagers to serve as
bearers, warriors or sex slaves.

	   PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan presided at a
meeting of the leaders of the countries at war in the Congo on
Saturday in an effort to persuade them to renounce violence. The
meeting took place on the sidelines of a summit of African leaders
in Paris that focused on security and ways to achieve peace on the
continent. Annan gathered together Congolese leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila, as well as the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are
supporting rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The purpose of the
talks was to try to work out some framework for peace negotiations
between the warring parties. (FRANCE-AFRICA SUMMIT)
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon, a day after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a guerrilla roadside bombing.
Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills between
the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 28 kilometers (17
miles) southwest of this southern market town. There were no
immediate reports of casualties from the air raid, said Lebanese
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. On Friday,
two Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing near the
border claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah. The casualties
raised to seven the number of Israeli soldiers killed in southern
Lebanon in the last 10 days. Sensing the growing popular pressure
to get troops out of Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Friday promised a thorough review of Israel's policy

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that
his government was prepared to comply with conditions set by the
International Monetary Fund for the resumption of aid to Russia's
ailing economy. Primakov said he hoped to reach an agreement soon
with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, scheduled to come to
Moscow on Dec. 1, the Interfax news agency reported. Speaking to
the legislative assembly in the southern Russian city of Belgorod,
Primakov said his government was prepared to fulfill the fund's
conditions because Russia badly needs the next dlrs 8 billion

economic program by the Russian government, and signs that is has

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Protesters heckled Chinese President Jiang Zemin
during his speech at a Japanese university Saturday, disrupting a
visit already marred by an apparent failure to wring key
concessions from his hosts. Scores of students protested human
rights abuses and China's nuclear weapons program. Japanese media
have offered a dour assessment of what his visit has accomplished.
They cite his inability to obtain a written apology from Tokyo for
its brutal invasion of China in the 1930s or to get Japanese
leaders to promise they won't support the United States in a future
crisis near Taiwan. (JAPAN-CHINA)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police broke up a spate of brawls
among teen gangs Saturday while security officers blocked hundreds
of college students from staging an anti- government protest. The
private Sonora radio station said hundreds of students from rival
high schools fought in the streets in at least six locations in
Jakarta after classes ended at lunch time. There were no reports of
serious injuries or arrests. The fights do not appear to be
connected with the political turmoil in Indonesia, but are a sign
of the growing lawlessness among the nation's young. Also on
Saturday police and troops blocked a convoy of 10 buses carrying
students near Indonesia's Foreign Ministry. Students say President
B.J. Habibie, who took office after riots and protests dislodged
his authoritarian predecessor Suharto in May, is stalling on
pledges to democratize Indonesia. (INDONESIA-PROTEST)

World Bank delegation to visit Ukraine for loan talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank will send a delegation to
Ukraine next week to review ongoing projects in the former Soviet
republic and discuss new loans, the bank's Kiev office said
Saturday.
	   Paul Siegelbaum, the bank's director for Ukraine and Belarus,
was scheduled to arrive in Kiev Dec. 1 for five days of talks with
top government officials, including President Leonid Kuchma, Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy
Tyhypko.
	   The bank resumed its cooperation with Ukraine in September,
granting the country dlrs 950 million in new loans for several
projects.
	   Cooperation was suspended in March following the International
Monetary Fund's decision to freeze aid to Ukraine because of the
country's stalled economic reforms.
	   The government took steps toward reform, and the IMF approved a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan in September, making the resumption of World
Bank aid possible.
	   Ukraine already has received more than dlrs 1 billion from the
World Bank since it became a member in 1992.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon

 &UR; Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with background on Netanyahu considering
withdrawal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Saturday raided
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon, a day after two
Israeli soldiers were killed in a guerrilla roadside bombing.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on the hills
between the villages of Siddiqine and Jebal al-Butom, 28 kilometers
(17 miles) southwest of this southern market town.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air raid,
said the Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The missile attack occurred hours after an ambush by Hezbollah
guerrillas on Israeli soldiers who were trying to retrieve a
disabled military vehicle near the Lebanon-Israel border, the
Hezbollah said in a statement. It did not mention any casualties.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the ambush, which
Hezbollah said took place just before midnight.
	   On Friday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside
bombing near the border claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
Two Israeli soldiers also were killed on Wednesday.
	   The casualties raised to seven the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in southern Lebanon in the last 10 days.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militiamen from a occupied zone in southern
Lebanon that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territories from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Sensing the growing popular pressure to get troops out of
Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to
Europe for a meeting with Cabinet ministers and army generals
scheduled for Sunday to review the Lebanon policy.
	   Netanyahu said he would only pull Israeli troops out of southern
Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to attacks by
Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group.
	   Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government is willing to give
such a guarantee.

Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng takes third round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng shot a 2-under-par 69
Saturday to take a one stroke lead over compatriot Wang Ter-chang
after the third round of the U.S. dlrs 300,000 Perrier Hong Kong
Open Golf Championship.
	   Hsieh, in second place overnight, notched five birdies on the
6,727-yard, par-71 Composite Course of the Hong Kong Golf Club for
a total of 10-under-par 203.
	   The 36-year-old Hsieh, who won the Hong Kong title in 1988, said
he was confident of winning the tournament for a second time
because of his ``performance in the last couple of days.''
	   Wang, who won the 1992 Philippines Open, fired a 68 Saturday as
periodic rain fell for the third straight day.
	   One stroke behind at 205 were four players _ American Mark
Brooks, South Korean Kang Wook Soon, Swaziland's Paul Friedlander
and Rodrigo Cuello of the Philippines.
	   Brooks, the 1996 PGA Championship winner, shot a 69 on Saturday
and Friedlander had a 68. Both Cuello and Kang fired a 5-under-par
66.
	   Overnight leader Anthony Wall of England dropped to 33rd after
managing only a 6-over-par 77 for a three-round 210.
	   American John Daly, the 1991 PGA Championship winner, had a 70
to finish on 18th place with eight other players on 208.
	   Defending champion Frank Nobilo of New Zealand also shot a 70 to
tie for 54th with four other players at 213.

Swede Elofsson beats Dahlie in cross country World Cup start
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUONIO, Finland (AP) _ Per Elofsson, a world junior champion,
out-classed cross country great Bjorn Dahlie of Norway in the start
of the World Cup season Saturday.
	   Elofsson, 21, took the men's 10-kilometer freestyle with a
15.5-second margin over Dahlie, finishing in 23 minutes, 48.5
seconds on a quite demanding track.
	   Elofsson went out 30 seconds behind Dahlie _ an eight-time
Olympic gold medalist _ and was not afraid to challenge the
Norwegian's pace. The Swede notched the best intermediate time at
6.1 kilometers and barely seemed tired at the finish.
	   The two top skiers were far ahead of the rest. Sami Repo of
Finland took third, 44 seconds behind Elofsson with another Swede,
Mathias Fredriksson, only 0.8 seconds behind.
	   Reigning World Cup champion Thomas Alsgaard of Norway was only
27th.
	   The women's 5-kilometer freestyle was tighter with Katerina
Neumannova of the Czech Republic winning from Stefania Belmondo of
Italy by only half a second.
	   Nina Gavrilyuk in third topped five Russian women in the top 10.
The race temperature was O C (32 F) in Muonio, the northernmost
site ever used in the World Cup, some 200 kilometers (330 miles)
north of the Arctic Circle.

Appeals court orders new trial in one of Craxi corruption

convictions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian appeals court overturned one of the
corruption convictions against former premier Bettino Craxi and
ordered a new trial, news reports said Saturday.
	   Craxi was one of several people convicted of taking kickbacks
linked to the merger and quick breakup of Montedison, a privately
owned chemical giant, and the state-owned ENI chemical group. The
short-lived new enterprise was called Enimont.
	   Many political and business leaders profited from the deal.
Prosecutors alleged that the deal produced dlrs 92 million in
kickbacks that was divided among Italian political parties. Craxi,
head of the Socialists, was convicted in 1997 and sentenced to four
years in prison.
	   Craxi, who is living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia, was
convicted in several other corruption cases. Declared a fugitive
from justice by Italian courts, he has repeatedly proclaimed his
innocence and said he is the victim of a political vendetta.

Rebels dig in, brace for defense in eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ Under threat from a government
counteroffensive, Congolese rebels on Saturday appeared to have
halted a four-month advance into the heart of Congo and instead dug
in to brace for air strikes.
	   ``We're avoiding confrontation to cut losses,'' said rebel Capt.
Baudeoin, who only gave his first name. ``The enemy is putting
pressure on us, and we're resisting.''
	   Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally, has deployed
troops, tanks, helicopters and jet fighters in eastern Congo to aid
the Congolese army counteroffensive at Kabalo, a key railway
junction 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of the eastern rebel
stronghold at Goma.
	   This is the first time the rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
have had to stop their march across the eastern half of Congo since
the war began Aug. 2.
	   In Paris, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan presdided at a
meeting of Kabila and the leaders of Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe,
in an effort to persuade them to renounce violence. The Burkina
Faso leader also attended.
	   The meeting took place on the sidelines of a summit of African
leaders in Paris that focused on security and ways to achieve peace
on the continent.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, instead
demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for
the insurgents.
	   Both countries say they will continue fighting as long as Congo
remains unstable, and accuse Kabila of enlisting among his army's
ranks thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Baudeoin said his troops on Thursday forced back
government-allied tanks when they tried to take the Nzofu Bridge
over the Congo River, 14 kilometers (8 miles) west of Kabalo, which
guards the entrance to the town.
	   He admitted losses among his troops, and said Zimbabwean
soldiers had also been killed in the fighting. He did not say how
many died, but said the foreigners had been promptly buried, while
their identity cards and green and red berets had been kept for
record.
	   On Friday, Zimbabwean MiG-21 fighter jets retaliated by dropping
bombs on the abandoned hamlets surrounding Kabalo, but caused no
casualties.
	   Most of the population has fled into thick tropical forest to
avoid almost daily air raids since Kabila and his allies, which
also include Angola, Namibia and Chad, launched their
counteroffensive in the east.

U.N. Convoy comes under sniper fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Snipers opened fire on a U.N. World Food
Program convoy in northwestern Rwanda, injuring a Rwandan soldier
and a woman bystander, an agency spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   WFP spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said the convoy of eight U.N
and five Rwandan military escort trucks came under sniper fire 2
kilometers (1.25 miles) south of the northwestern town of Ruhengeri
Friday.
	   The convoy was returning from bringing food aid to some of the
650,000 Rwandans in camps in the northwest who have been displaced
by fighting between the rebels and the army.
	   Ruhengeri, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of the capital
Kigali, and the eastern Gisenyi region have been plagued by rebels
trying to destabilize the Tutsi-dominated government.
	   The current government took control of Rwanda in July 1994,
ending the Hutu government-sponsored genocide of more than 500,000
Tutsis and moderate hutus.
	   Quintaglie said sniper-fire critically injured a soldier in one
of the escort vehicles who was hit in the head. A woman bystander
was also injured, although it was not clear Saturday whether she
was hit by gunfire.
	   She said sniper-fire was not a usual threat in the troubled
region and WFP was suspending its operations in the northwest for
one day Monday.
	   ``We want to meet with local officials to determine whether this
was an isolated incident or an ongoing problem,'' Quintaglie said.
	   Quintaglie said WFP was one of the few U.N. agencies operating
in the northwest of the country and takes all precautions, like
travelling with military escorts, when entering the area.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels in northwestern Uganda have
attacked a civilian convoy and an army detatchment, killing seven
people, wounding 28, and abducting six others, a newspaper said
Saturday.
	   The attack by rebels of the Lords Resistance Army on the
civilian convoy occurred Friday morning in the village of
Awii-Anaka, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of the
capital Kampala, the government-owned New Vision newspaper said.
	   The rebels burned a bus and a pickup truck, while another bus
and two other pick-ups managed to escape, the newspaper cited State
Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma as saying.
	   Two people were shot, the others were burned to death, and 28
people were injured, the report said.
	   The newspaper said four rebels were killed.
	   Division Commander Brig. Katumba Wamala said 30 rebels divided
into three groups, two attacking the convoy, while another attacked
a nearby army unit.
	   He said the simultaneous attack was to engage the army so the
rebels could hit the busses, the newspaper said.
	   There was no indication on soldier casualties.
	   Katumba said the rebels abducted 10 people but the army released
four. Another six are still being held, he said.
	   The Lords Resistance Army has been waging a 12-year insurgency
in northwestern Uganda aimed at destabilizing the government of
President Yoweri Museveni.
	   They frequently abduct children and teenagers to serve as
bearers, warriors or sex slaves.

Egyptian human rights group to reject all foreign donations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian human rights group said Saturday
it will return a British Parliament donation of dlrs 25,000 after a
newspaper alleged the payment was in return for falsely reporting
about police brutality on Christians.
	   The Egyptian Organization of Human Rights has also decided to
reject all foreign donations, either government or voluntary
agencies, Mahmoud Qandiel, a lawyer with the group, told The
Associated Press.
	   He said British Parliament's Human Rights committee has sent the
check in October as a second payment for a two-year long women's
legal aid program, he said. The check will soon be sent to the
British Embassy as proof of EOHR's neutrality, he said.
	   A furor was sparked after the EOHR reported that police while
investigating a murder of two Coptic Christians in the southern
town of el-Kusheh in August rounded up hundreds of Copts and beat
them in a bid to extract false confessions.
	   The report said police feared the culprits were Muslim and were
anxious to pin the blame on Christians to prevent religious strife
in the Christian majority town.
	   During interviews with The Associated Press, many villagers
confirmed they were tortured.
	   The government denied widespread torture in el-Kusheh and said
only 14 people were detained. The Interior Ministry says
foreign-funded rights groups are maligning Egypt.
	   Besides Britain, EOHR gets donations from organizations such as
the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, the European Fund for
Human Rights, the Swedish Church Mission and Oxfam.
	   ``Organizations like EOHR do very good work here (in Egypt) and
that is why we support them,'' British Embassy spokesman Ed Webb
said.
	   Qandiel said the decision to return the money was taken by
EOHR's 15-member board, which met Thursday to discuss the
accusations by an independent weekly newspaper, Al-Osboa.
	   ``Dlrs 25,000 for treason,'' said a front page headline in its
Nov. 23 edition.
	   Calling it a ``flagrant conspiracy on Egyptian national
security,'' Al-Osboa said EOHR took the money ``in return for a
fabricated report (about) persecution during the el-Kusheh village
incidents.''
	   Two days later, Prosecutor General Raga el-Araby launched an
investigation and questioned the paper's chief editor, Mustafa
Bakry, who is believed to have close links with Interior Ministry
officials.
	   Qandiel said the prosecutor is expected to question the EOHR
soon, but no date was set yet.
	   He said rejecting foreign donations will severely hamper EOHR's
work since local donations are scarce.

	   HAKKARI, Turkey (AP) _ A military helicopter crashed in
southeastern Turkey near the Iraqi border, killing 15 soldiers, the
Anatolia news agency reported on Saturday.
	   The agency said it crashed on Friday near the town of Cukurca
while on a reconnaissance mission. Turkish troops have been
fighting autonomy-seeking Kurdish guerrillas in the region.
	   Anatolia said the cause of Friday's crash was not known and
military officials were not available for comment. Earlier in the
day, Anatolia had said 17 people died in the crash.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Diplomatic couriers flew to Italy on
Saturday to hand over a thick criminal file of a Kurdish rebel
leader, wanted by Turkey for trial, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan because he could
face death penalty in Turkey for capital crimes.
	   The file includes photographs, video cassettes and details of
crimes committed by Ocalan and his guerrillas, said Haldun Otman, a
diplomat, before his departure.
	   Germany has also issued arrest warrants for Ocalan on charges of
murder and terrorism, but Bonn made clear Friday that it has no
intention of extraditing Ocalan, fearing unrest among Germany's
many Turkish Kurds.
	   Instead, Germany and Italy hope to extricate Europe from growing
Kurdish-Turkish tension by arranging for the trial of a Kurdish
rebel leader in an international court, an idea opposed by Turkey.
	   ``Ocalan should be extradited to Turkey and be tried in ordinary
courts,'' daily Turkiye quoted Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday as saying.
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been waging a
guerrilla war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has claimed 37,000 lives.
	   The dossier also consists of details of a draft bill, Turkey has
prepared to defuse Italian objections, to lift the death penalty in
Turkey. Despite issuing death sentences Turkey has not carried out
any execution over a decade.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12, upon arrival from
Moscow.

Cyprus insists on deploying Russian missiles on its soil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ The S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that
Cyprus has bought from Russia will be deployed in Cyprus as planned
despite Turkish threats and Greek disapproval, the Cypriot foreign
minister said Saturday.
	   The minister, Yiannakis Cassoulides, made the comments on his
return from a Greek-Cyprus summit in Athens where the two countries
failed to agree on the final destination of the missiles.
	   The Greek government is against the deployment of the missiles
in Cyprus to avoid being dragged into hostilities with Turkey,
which has threatened to use military force to prevent the
deployment.
	   A Turkish action will automatically involve Greece under its
joint defense pact with Cyprus.
	   During the Athens summit Friday, Greek Premier Costas Simitis
proposed setting up the missiles on the Greek island of Crete. But
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides refused to budge.
	   The media in Greece and Cyprus described the talks as ``stormy''
	   Cassoulides said the matter will be discussed by the National
Council, the Greek Cypriot policy making body, which had initially
decided last summer on basing the missiles in Cyprus.
	   Cassoulides said that decision ``is still valid.''
	   Simitis, the Greek premier, also acknowledged that the final
word rests with Cyprus. ``In this case, and any other case, the
Cyprus government will decide and there will be consultations with
Greece before hand.''
	   Cyprus has been criticized by the United States and the European
Union for its stand. The missiles are expected to delivered in a
month or two.
	   Cassoulides said Cyprus is ready to cooperate with the
international community for the reduction of tensions on the island
through its demilitarization proposal, which is rejected by Turkey,
and intensified efforts for the island's reunification.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied its
northern third in 1974. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the
north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops
there.

Report: Crew responsible for Tajik airliner crash in Emirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Crew error was responsible
for last year's crash of a Tajik airliner in the Emirates that
killed 85 people, the civil defense announced Saturday.
	   The final report of the 11-month investigation concluded that a
number of errors by the crew resulted in the Dec. 15 crash, said
the civil defense report carried by the official Emirates News
Agency.
	   Investigators found evidence that the crew was fatigued and had
personal problems, said the report. It also blamed the pilot for
not following traffic controllers' instructions.
	   The pilot ``did not maintain the height indicated during the
last contact with traffic control and continued to descend to the
ground without meaning to,'' the agency reported.
	   It also said the aircraft experienced turbulence prior to the
crash.
	   The investigation found that all the aircraft's engines and
equipment were operating normally, the agency said.
	   The sole survivor of the crash was the navigator of the
Tupolev-154 airliner, which was flying from Khudzhand in northern
Tajikistan when it crashed in the emirate of Sharjah, one of the
seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates.

U.N. convoy comes under sniper fire in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Snipers fired on a U.N. World Food Program
convoy in northwestern Rwanda, injuring a Rwandan soldier and a
bystander, an agency spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   The convoy of eight U.N and five Rwandan military escort trucks
came under sniper fire about two kilometers (one mile) south of the
northwestern town of Ruhengeri Friday, agency spokeswoman Michele
Quintaglie said.
	   The convoy was returning from bringing food aid to some of the
650,000 Rwandans in camps in the northwest who have been displaced
by fighting between the rebels and the army.
	   Quintaglie said a soldier in one of the escort vehicles was
critically injured. A woman bystander was also injured, although it
was not clear whether she was hit by gunfire.
	   Ruhengeri, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of the capital
Kigali, and the eastern Gisenyi region have been plagued by rebels
trying to destabilize the ethnic Tutsi-dominated government.
	   The current government took control of Rwanda in July 1994,
ending the Hutu government-sponsored genocide of more than 500,000
Tutsis and moderate hutus.
	   Quintaglie said WFP was one of the few U.N. agencies operating
in the northwest of the country and takes all precautions, like
traveling with military escorts, when entering the area.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo on Saturday
agreed to a cease-fire to end the fighting between rebels and
forces loyal to Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila, French
President Jacques Chirac said Saturday.
	   Chirac told a news conference at the end of a summit of African
leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had reached a
consensus to stop this war.''
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime in December before a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The Secretary General has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.

Iran says Norway's request to upgrade ties under consideration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Saturday it is considering an
official request from Norway to upgrade diplomatic ties strained
three years ago over Tehran's death threat against author Salman
Rushdie.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said Tehran
detected ``a transformation in the Norwegian outlook'' on Iran, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   It quoted him as saying that Norway had submitted an official
request to exchange ambassadors.
	   Norway withdrew its ambassador to Iran in July 1995, leaving
diplomatic representation at a lower level. Iran recalled its
ambassador the previous year to protest what it called Oslo's
hostile attitude.
	   Norway has repeatedly protested against an Iranian religious
edict ordering the death of Rushdie and anyone connected with his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, issued the
edict in 1989, saying Rushdie's book blasphemed Islam.
	   Relations between the countries worsened when Rushdie's
Norwegian-language publisher, William Nygaard, was shot and
severely wounded in Oslo in 1993, with suspected Iranian
involvement.
	   A statement from the foreign ministry in Oslo said Norway was
ready to appoint a new ambassador to Tehran after Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi in September guaranteed that his government
would not support any steps to carry out the death order against
Rushdie.
	   The announcement came after a meeting between Norwegian and
Iranian foreign ministry officials in Oslo. The statement said Iran
was considering a similar upgrading of diplomatic relations with
Norway.
	   Norway has been a strong supporter of Rushdie, a regular visitor
to the Scandinavian nation.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Snipers opened fire on a U.N. World Food
Program convoy in northwestern Rwanda, injuring a Rwandan soldier
and a woman bystander, an agency spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   WFP spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said the convoy of eight U.N
and five Rwandan military escort trucks came under sniper fire 2
kilometers (1.25 miles) south of the northwestern town of Ruhengeri
Friday.
	   The convoy was returning from bringing food aid to some of the
650,000 Rwandans in camps in the northwest who have been displaced
by fighting between the rebels and the army.
	   Ruhengeri, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of the capital
Kigali, and the western Gisenyi region have been plagued by rebels
trying to destabilize the Tutsi-dominated government.
	   The current government took control of Rwanda in July 1994,
ending the Hutu government-sponsored genocide of more than 500,000
Tutsis and moderate hutus.
	   Quintaglie said sniper-fire critically injured a soldier in one
of the escort vehicles who was hit in the head. A woman bystander
was also injured, although it was not clear Saturday whether she
was hit by gunfire.
	   She said sniper-fire was not a usual threat in the troubled
region and WFP was suspending its operations in the northwest for
one day Monday.
	   ``We want to meet with local officials to determine whether this
was an isolated incident or an ongoing problem,'' Quintaglie said.
	   Quintaglie said WFP was one of the few U.N. agencies operating
in the northwest of the country and takes all precautions, like
travelling with military escorts, when entering the area.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protest taking place without incident

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian President Rexhep Meidani signed
the nation's first post-communist constitution Saturday,
proclaiming it effective immediately.
	   Thanking international officials for supporting the referendum
process, Meidani called the country's new constitution ``the symbol
of Albania's European future.'' The document outlines civil,
democratic and human rights in the country of 3.2 million, which
emerged from communism in 1991.
	   According to Albania's Central Voting Commission, slightly more
than half of the country's registered voters participated in the
election last weekend, and an overwhelming 93 percent voted in
favor of the constitution.
	   But Sali Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, has
said his party would refuse to recognize the constitution as
legitimate.
	   On Saturday, he called a rally in the capital's main square to
protest adopting the new constitution. About 2,000 people attended
the demonstration, which took place without incident.
	   In the run-up to the elections, Western officials in the region
encouraged Albanians to vote in favor of the document, which they
see as necessary for strengthening the Balkan nation's fragile
democracy.

	   Earlier, Annan presided at a two-hour meeting, including Kabila,
as well as the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are supporting
rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The heads of Zimbabwe and
Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been held in a tense but not hostile
environments.
	   The purpose of the talks on the sidelines of an African summit
that focused on security was to try to work out some framework for
peace negotiations between the warring parties.
	   The war in Congo dominated the final day of a Paris summit of
African leaders.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders - especially those at
war in Congo - to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Speaking to the summit Friday, Annan said many African conflicts
are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' and that the Congo
conflict poses the continent's greatest challenge.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A police van collided with a Korean Air jet at
Chek Lap Kok airport, causing minor damage to the plane early
Saturday morning, local media reported.
	   The van accidentally backed into the stationary Boeing 747
during a special police exercise shortly before 5 a.m., damaging
the outer shell of the plane's No. 1 engine, government-run Radio
Hong Kong quoted an Airport Authority spokesman as saying.
	   No one was injured and the plane took off for Seoul at 9:30 p.m.
after minor repairs.
	   Police have launched an investigation into the accident.
	   The accident is the latest in a string of snags since Hong
Kong's U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport opened in July. A costly fiasco
erupted during its early operations as computer breakdowns and
system problems crippled both passenger and cargo services.
	   Last month, a Boeing 747 cargo jet burst two tires during taking
off, closing the first runway and delaying about 100 flights.
	   Chek Lap Kok was built on reclaimed land off a remote outlying
island, replacing the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport, located in a
congested Kowloon neighborhood.

Canaletto painting stolen from noble Venetian family is recovered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Police have recovered a painting by
Canaletto valued at dlrs 2.5 million that was stolen last month
from the palace of one of Venice's oldest noble families, Italian
media reported Saturday.
	   Venetian police said they tracked down the thieves by monitoring
their cellular telephone. They did not identify the suspects by
name but said they were veteran thieves.
	   The painting, a scene of a grain warehouse on the edge of one of
Venice's famed canals, was the jewel of the Giustiniani family
collection. It was taken the night of Oct. 21, along with several
lesser works.
	   Canaletto (Giovanni Antonio Canal) was the most famous painter
of Venetian scenes of the 18th century and his works hang in many
of the world's major museums. The stolen painting was signed by the
artist and is one of Canaletto's well-known works.

	   French President Jacques Chirac on Friday urged African nations
to do their own peacekeeping - a departure from past practices that
put the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders confronted the
issue of how to tame wars raging across the continent.
	   All eyes were on Kabila, who finally sat down with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention
following the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by human rights
groups, ruled Friday that Kabila could not be pursued for human
rights violations because he benefits from customary immunity
accorded heads of state in office.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.

Cancer-stricken Tampa Bay center retires, moves into coaching
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore sports to slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ The John Cullen comeback story is over.
	   The Tampa Bay Lightning center, who missed all of last season
while battling cancer, announced his retirement on Friday.
	   Cullen, 34, will remain with the team as an assistant coach.
	   ``My goal was to come back and play; to make it back after a
bone marrow transplant and all the radiation I had, and I did it,''
said Cullen, who was pointless in four games with the Lightning
this season. ``The greatest thing was just to get back, but the
greatest thing of all is being healthy.''
	   After making the Tampa Bay opening game roster, Cullen was
reassigned to Cleveland of the IHL on Oct. 26.
	   Cullen returned to his Tampa area home last Sunday after coming
down with bronchitis. The nine-year NHL veteran said he wrestled
with the issue of retiring during the past week.
	   ``I've been going crazy all week, deciding what to do,'' Cullen
said. ``I knew my shot to return was slim. It was a tough decision,
but I'm comfortable with it.''
	   Cullen said that being with his family in the Tampa area was a
major factor. The two-time All-Star also said he still has some
side effects, including a diminished conditioning level, from his
extensive cancer treatments.
	   ``If I didn't get cancer, there's probably a good chance I'd
still be playing,'' Cullen said. ``I missed a year and I'm not the
same physically as I was.''
	   Cullen scored 187 goals and had 550 points in 621 career games.

	   Summit participants said they hoped for progress in the Congo
crisis.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo in December.
	   Kabila in the past had not been optimistic, saying a pullout of
Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition
for substantive peace talks.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said Friday that there
had been some progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his
adversaries, with each of the parties presenting their views.
	   The French president stressed the need for Africans to take more
responsibility for settling conflicts.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of
responsibility for Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.

Hassan: Palestinian peace essential for regional stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Addressing the Parliament for the first
time in 28 years, Crown Prince Hassan said Saturday that a
settlement to the Palestinian conflict was essential to regional
peace and stability.
	   Addressing the opening of Parliament's 52nd regular session,
Hassan said the ``restoration of the Palestinian right to land,
resources and a state is a cornerstone for our security and that of
the whole region.''
	   Many members of the royal family _ including King Hussein's
children _ attended the function which is yet another effort by the
state to showcase Hassan in a country which knew only Hussein as
its leader in the last 45 years.
	   The prince is acting as regent while King Hussein is receiving
cancer treatment in the United States.
	   It was Hassan's first address to Parliament since 1970 and the
fourth since he was named crown prince in 1965 at the age of 18.
	   Both Houses of Parliament _ the 80-member elected Lower House
and the 40-member, royally appointed Senate _ met jointly to hear
Hassan outline the government policy in a traditional speech from
the throne, the constitutional opening of all legislative sessions.
	   The speech followed a 30-minute ceremony during which a 21-gun
salute boomed as Hassan inspected a guard of honor outside the
domed Parliament building in the Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   In his speech, Hassan said Jordan will consolidate relations
with Arab and Muslim governments.
	   Domestically, he promised to strengthen ``the foundations of a
civil society'' ruled by institutions under a liberalization
program launched in 1989.
	   Hassan, Jordan's economic strategist, also promised to improve
living conditions in a country barren of natural resources and
burdened by dlrs 6.1 billion in foreign debts.
	   He pledged continued economic reforms with reduced public
spending, increased exports, privatization of state firms, active
role for the private sector and increased foreign investment.
	   He also promised to fight poverty and unemployment and to
introduce more social and health programs to help the poor and
``provide social justice for all the sons of this nation.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Residents of Kabul shuttered their
businesses and ran for cover Saturday as more than 20 rockets shook
the Afghan capital, wounding at least five people, witnesses said.
	   It was the fiercest attack on Kabul in recent months by
opposition forces loyal to former military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood. His soldiers are positioned about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
outside the city.
	   Most rockets hit the combined military and civilian airport. Jet
fighters of the Taliban militia took off from the airport
throughout the day.
	   The airport was sealed-off shortly after the assault, making it
impossible to know the damage.
	   Some rockets landed in civilian neighborhoods wounding at least
five people and forcing several markets to close, witnesses said.
	   One man said he was on his way to the hospital to donate blood
for his wife, when a rocket landed and he was wounded.
	   ``My wife has to undergo a major operation today ... And I had
to arrange blood (donation) for her, but I got wounded myself,''
said Abdullah, who like most Afghans uses only one name.
	   Most opposition groups have been routed by the Taliban in recent
months. Massood, defense minister in the ousted government of
president Burhanuddin Rabbani, is the last opposition leader
offering an active resistance.
	   Opposition forces claimed they captured two strategic districts
in northern Kunduz province on the frontier with the central Asian
state of Tajikistan.
	   ``Our forces have now launched an attack from three sides on
Kunduz city,'' said an opposition spokesman who identified himself
only as Abdullah.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the opposition claim or
any comment from the Taliban militia.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are
mostly Pashtun _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan. They
rule almost 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   The opposition, which comprises mainly religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras, controls
the remaining 10 percent of the country.

South Africa beats Pakistan to win blind cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A record 376 between brothers Rury Field
and Scott Field propelled South Africa to a 10-wicket victory over
Pakistan and victory in the blind cricket tournament Saturday.
	   Pakistan was put to bat and its batsmen notched up 372 for 5 in
40 overs. South Africa retaliated with 376 for no loss in 37.1
overs.
	   The Field brothers made light of Pakistan's formidable total.
Rury cracked his record sixth century in eight matches, notching up
a total of 193 runs. His brother scored 159.
	   Earlier, Pakistani opener Masoon Jan knocked a brilliant 145.
Masood and Noor Queresh scored 254 runs for the opening wicket,
with Queresh scoring 82. Abdul Razak chipped in with 62 runs and
Amir Ishfaq was unbeated at 27.
	   Pakistan and South Africa, Australia, England, New Zealand, Sri
Lanka and host India _ all countries with teams among the
international elite of the sighted cricket world _ were competing
for the Kanishka Trophy.
	   Players who range from the partially sighted to the totally
blind use special balls that emit a rattle to help batsmen direct
their bats and fielders determine where the catch can be made.
Bowlers shout ``ready?'' and wait for a ``yes'' from batsmen before
responding with a shouted ``play'' and flinging the ball.
	   Blind cricket tournaments were being played in Sri Lanka as
early as the 1940s. The Indian tournament is the first
international championship for the blind.
	   Balaji Damodar of India was adjudged best batsman in the
tournament while Kevin Murraof New Zealand was named the best
bowler.

Report: Crew responsible for Tajik airliner crash in Emirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Crew error was responsible
for last year's crash of a Tajik airliner in the Emirates that
killed 85 people, the civil defense announced Saturday.
	   The final report of the 11-month investigation concluded that a
number of errors by the crew resulted in the Dec. 15 crash, said
the civil defense report carried by the official Emirates News
Agency.
	   Investigators found evidence that the crew was fatigued and had
personal problems, said the report. It also blamed the pilot for
not following traffic controllers' instructions.
	   The pilot ``did not maintain the height indicated during the
last contact with traffic control and continued to descend to the
ground without meaning to,'' the agency reported.
	   It also said the aircraft experienced turbulence prior to the
crash.
	   The investigation found that all the aircraft's engines and
equipment were operating normally, the agency said.
	   The sole survivor of the crash was the navigator of the
Tupolev-154 airliner, which was flying from Khudzhand in northern
Tajikistan when it crashed in the emirate of Sharjah, one of the
seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates.

South Africa gains slender lead before rain cuts short West Indies
</HEADLINE>
match &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rain cutting day's play short &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on 268 led the
West Indies
	   by seven runs Saturday on the first innings at lunch on the
third day of their first test match before rain cut the day's play
short.
	   The West Indies had batted their way to 20 without loss when
play was called off after just 4.2 overs had been bowled after
lunch.
	   Play will resume half-an-hour early Sunday at 10 a.m. (0800
GMT), and continue half-an-hour after the scheduled 5:30 p.m. (1530
GMT) close. The same will apply to the final day Monday in an
attempt to make up some of the approximately four hours lost
Saturday.
	   A poor shot by Mark Boucher set South Africa back early on at
Wanderers Stadium, and gave legspinner Rawl Lewis his first test
wicket. He swept unnecessarily and top edged a catch to Brian Lara.
When captain Hansie Cronje was bowled by Curtly Ambrose to give the
West Indian his first wicket in this test, the writing was on the
wall for South Africa.

Lawmaker vows to stop shopping festival, brands it morally corrupt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A fundamentalist Muslim lawmaker has vowed to stop
a shopping festival planned in February, saying a stagnant economy
cannot be improved by singers and moral corruption, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Organizers from private and public sectors have said the
shop-till-you-drop extravaganza would feature music concerts and
dance troupes, a rarity in this conservative Muslim country.
	   ``National economy cannot be activated by a singer from here,
and a singer from there,'' Parliament member Muabarak al-Duwailah
said in comments published by Al-Watan daily.
	   Several religious organizations have criticized the planned
event as a cause for corruption. Music concerts in Kuwait need to
be approved by authorities, and when they are, audiences are
forbidden from dancing.
	   The festival, the first of its kind in Kuwait, is aimed at
giving a shot in the arm of an economy ailing from low oil prices.
	   Al-Duwailah said fundamentalists will continue to pressure the
government to intervene and cancel the festival, al-Watan reported.
	   If government ministers do not cooperate, Islamists will have to
take other steps, al-Duwailah said. He did not elaborate.
	   Fundamentalists form the second largest bloc in the non-partisan
50-member Parliament after government supporters.

Egyptian human rights group to reject all foreign donations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian human rights group said Saturday
it will give back a dlrs 25,000 donation from the British
Parliament, after a newspaper alleged it was payment for falsely
reporting about police brutality on Christians.
	   The Egyptian Organization of Human Rights has also decided to
reject all foreign donations, either from governments or voluntary
agencies, Mahmoud Qandiel, a lawyer with the group, told The
Associated Press.
	   He said the British Parliament's Human Rights committee had sent
the check in October as a second payment subsidizing a two-year
women's legal aid program. The check will soon be returned to the
British Embassy as proof of EOHR's neutrality, he said.
	   A furor was sparked after the EOHR reported that police rounded
up hundreds of Copts in the southern town of el-Kusheh in August
and beat them in a bid to extract false confessions in the
investigation of a murder of two Coptic Christians.
	   The report said police feared the culprits were Muslim and were
anxious to pin the blame on Christians to prevent religious strife
in the Christian majority town.
	   During interviews with The Associated Press, many villagers
confirmed they were tortured.
	   The government denied widespread torture in el-Kusheh and said
only 14 people were detained. The Interior Ministry says
foreign-funded rights groups are maligning Egypt.
	   Besides Britain, EOHR gets donations from organizations such as
the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, the European Fund for
Human Rights, the Swedish Church Mission and Oxfam.
	   ``Organizations like EOHR do very good work here (in Egypt) and
that is why we support them,'' British Embassy spokesman Ed Webb
said.
	   Qandiel said the decision to return the money was taken by
EOHR's 15-member board, which met Thursday to discuss the
accusations by an independent weekly newspaper, Al-Osboa.
	   ``Dlrs 25,000 for treason,'' said a front page headline in its
Nov. 23 edition.
	   Calling it a ``flagrant conspiracy on Egyptian national
security,'' Al-Osboa said EOHR took the money ``in return for a
fabricated report (about) persecution during the el-Kusheh village
incidents.''
	   Two days later, Prosecutor General Raga el-Araby launched an
investigation and questioned the paper's chief editor, Mustafa
Bakry, who is believed to have close links with Interior Ministry
officials.
	   Qandiel said the prosecutor is expected to question the EOHR
soon, but no date was set yet.
	   He said rejecting foreign donations will severely hamper EOHR's
work since local donations are scarce.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire to end the fighting between rebels and forces loyal
to Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila, French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had
reached a consensus to stop this war.''
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime in December before a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The Secretary General has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   Earlier, Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of officials,
including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are
supporting rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The heads of
Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.''
	   He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to
establish dialogue.
	   ``Every party has made progress toward a greater
rapprochement,'' he said.
	   The purpose of the talks on the sidelines of an African summit
that focused on security was to try to work out some framework for
peace negotiations between the warring parties.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders _ especially those at
war in Congo _ to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Speaking to the summit Friday, Annan said many African conflicts
are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance'' and that the Congo
conflict poses the continent's greatest challenge.
	   Chirac on Friday urged African nations to do their own
peacekeeping _ a departure from past practices that put the burden
on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders confronted the
issue of how to tame wars raging across the continent.
	   All eyes were on Kabila, who finally sat down with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention
following the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by human rights
groups, ruled Friday that Kabila could not be pursued for human
rights violations because he benefits from customary immunity
accorded heads of state in office.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.
	   Summit participants said they hoped for progress in the Congo
crisis.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo in December.
	   Kabila in the past had not been optimistic, saying a pullout of
Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition
for substantive peace talks.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said Friday that there
had been some progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his
adversaries, with each of the parties presenting their views.
	   The French president stressed the need for Africans to take more
responsibility for settling conflicts.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of
responsibility for Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.

Cyprus insists on deploying Russian missiles on its soil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALEX EFTY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ The S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that
Cyprus has bought from Russia will be deployed in Cyprus despite
Turkish threats and Greek disapproval, the Cypriot foreign minister
said Saturday.
	   The minister, Yiannakis Cassoulides, made the comments on his
return from a Greek-Cyprus summit in Athens where the two countries
failed to agree on the final destination of the missiles.
	   The Greek government is against the deployment of the missiles
in Cyprus to avoid being dragged into hostilities with Turkey,
which has threatened to use military force to prevent the
deployment.
	   A Turkish action will automatically involve Greece under its
joint defense pact with Cyprus.
	   During the Athens summit Friday, Greek Premier Costas Simitis
proposed setting up the missiles on the Greek island of Crete. But
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides refused to budge.
	   The media in Greece and Cyprus described the talks as ``stormy''
	   Simitis, the Greek premier, also acknowledged that the final
word rests with Cyprus. ``In this case, and any other case, the
Cyprus government will decide and there will be consultations with
Greece before hand.''
	   Cyprus has been criticized by the United States and the European
Union for its stand. The missiles are expected to delivered in a
month or two.
	   Cassoulides said Cyprus is ready to cooperate with the
international community for the reduction of tensions on the island
through its demilitarization proposal, which is rejected by Turkey,
and intensified efforts for the island's reunification.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied its
northern third in 1974. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the
north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops
there.

Albanian president signs constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian President Rexhep Meidani signed
the nation's first post-communist constitution Saturday,
proclaiming it effective immediately.
	   Thanking international officials for supporting the referendum
process, Meidani called the country's new constitution ``the symbol
of Albania's European future.''
	   The document outlines civil, democratic and human rights in the
country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in 1991.
	   According to Albania's Central Voting Commission, slightly more
than half of the country's registered voters participated in the
election last weekend, and an overwhelming 93 percent voted in
favor of the constitution.
	   Sali Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, has
said his party would refuse to recognize the constitution as
legitimate.
	   On Saturday, he called a rally in the capital's main square to
protest adopting the new constitution. About 2,000 people attended
the demonstration, which took place without incident.
	   In the run-up to the elections, Western officials in the region
encouraged Albanians to vote in favor of the document, which they
see as necessary for strengthening the Balkan nation's fragile
democracy.

Lawmaker vows to stop shopping festival, brands it morally corrupt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A fundamentalist Muslim lawmaker has vowed to stop
a shopping festival planned in February, saying a stagnant economy
cannot be improved by singers and moral corruption, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Organizers from private and public sectors have said the
shop-till-you-drop extravaganza would feature music concerts and
dance troupes, a rarity in this conservative Muslim country.
	   Several religious organizations have criticized the planned
event as a cause for corruption. Music concerts in Kuwait need to
be approved by authorities, and when they are, audiences are
forbidden from dancing.
	   The festival, the first of its kind in Kuwait, is aimed at
giving an economy ailing from low oil prices a shot in the arm.
	   ``National economy cannot be activated by a singer from here,
and a singer from there,'' Parliament member Muabarak al-Duwailah
said in comments published by Al-Watan daily.
	   Al-Duwailah said fundamentalists will continue to pressure the
government to intervene and cancel the festival, al-Watan reported.
	   If government ministers do not cooperate, Islamists will have to
take other steps, al-Duwailah said. He did not elaborate.
	   Fundamentalists form the second largest bloc in the non-partisan
50-member Parliament, after government supporters.

Economic crisis and mistrust leave Russian charities strapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MOSB105 &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MYTISHI, Russia (AP) _ Each time the church door swings open,
chants and the heavy perfume of melting candles spill into the
snowy courtyard. A beggar leans on a walking stick, reaching out
his hand for a few coins.
	   Much of life at St. Vladimir's revolves around this courtyard,
the center of the church's social action campaign.
	   While worshippers bow and pray before icons inside, 200 or so
down-and-out folks eat in the soup kitchen each day. The church
outside Moscow also has 30 homeless men doing construction work on
its buildings.
	   Like other welfare efforts in Russia, St. Vladimir's is
struggling to cope with the three-month-long financial crisis:
sharply rising costs and shrinking financial support; frozen bank
accounts; and the ever-widening ocean of need.
	   But it is more seriously hampered by the mistrust most Russians
hold for charities, which keeps donations low and most charity work
small-scale and local.
	   ``If a person isn't honest, he assumes no one else is either,''
said St. Vladimir's administrator Andrei Fomichev.
	   Charity's bad name in Russia dates from Soviet times, when
workers had ``contributions'' automatically deducted from their
wages and put in huge, centralized funds. They never saw their
money doing any good.
	   ``So Russians don't believe in organizations. They believe in
helping their friends and family, and the occasional bum or
babushka on the street,'' said Jenny Hodgson, co-director of the
British-based Charities Aid Foundation.
	   The tradition of giving in Russia was further tarnished by some
embezzlement scandals in recent years. Some so-called charities
seemed more interested in the tax breaks on imported humanitarian
goods than in distributing aid.
	   As a result, just 2 percent of the income for Russian
non-governmental organizations comes from private contributions,
Hodgson said. By contrast, individual donations provide 90 percent
of U.S. charities' budgets, she said.
	   Most of the 50,000 charities active in Russia avoid the news
media and labor largely in obscurity because of the public
mistrust.
	   ``In Russia, people look askance at charity appeals. They
consider them some sort of scheme,'' said Svetlana Ivanchenko, a
lawyer who works at Novy Dom (New Home), an organization that
offers job referrals and legal and psychological counseling to the
homeless.
	   Amid all the suspicion, many charities do all they can to avoid
even the perception of abuse. St. Vladimir's asks donors to
directly pay specific bills on the church's behalf, or provide
tools and machinery that can keep its construction and feeding
programs going.
	   The private Russian Aid Fund has taken a similar approach during
its two-year existence, coordinating the delivery of more than dlrs
620,000 worth of aid but avoiding any contact with donated money,
director Lev Ambinder said.
	   The fund was born out of the Soviet tradition of letters to the
editor highlighting corruption, injustice and just plain need.
	   ``With a letter, you could get a powerful bureaucrat fired, get
someone an apartment, restore someone their job if they were fired
unfairly,'' said Ambinder, who worked as a correspondent for a
number of newspapers across Soviet Russia.
	   Each month, Ambinder and his assistant pore through hundreds of
letters in their attic office at the publishing house that puts out
Domovoy (House-Spirit), a slick monthly magazine aimed at well-off
women. They choose the most compelling letters, call local welfare
agencies to verify the contents, and publish about 10 in each
issue.
	   The letters are written on behalf of individuals or families: a
child who needs money for a prohibitively expensive operation; a
paraplegic who wants a computer so he can make a living as a
bookkeeper; food and clothing for children orphaned by a mine
disaster.
	   Ambinder had expected that with the economic crisis, ``we would
take a serious hit and all this would end.''
	   But while Domovoy is now giving the fund just two pages instead
of four because of a drop in advertising revenues, Ambinder hasn't
seen a falloff in contributions.
	   Almost all of the donations are made anonymously, he said.
	   That aspect is part of Russia's Orthodox Christian tradition.
	   ``According to our faith, every act of charity will be blessed
by God, and he will forgive our sins in return,'' said Father
Yevmeny, the priest who heads St. Vladimir's homeless program.
	   ``But we also have this understanding: If you do a good deed and
then tell everyone what you did, the good deed evaporates.''

Serbs and ethnic Albanians clash at border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Violence between Yugoslav army and
ethnic Albanians on the border between Serbia's Kosovo province and
Albania has flared anew, Serbian sources said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo-based Media Center, close to Serbian authorities said
two incidents between Albanian arms smugglers and Yugoslav army
border guards occurred Friday, further threatening a shaky October
truce.
	   According to the center, the border guards intercepted a group
of smugglers, alleged to be supplying ethnic Albanian separatists
in Kosovo with weapons, late Friday. The Albanians were forced to
flee, leaving behind some 20 automatic rifles and a large quantity
of ammunition.
	   In another incident Friday, about 10 armed Albanian extremists
tried to cross illegally into Kosovo, a southern province of
Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes up the Yugoslav
federation. The group opened fire on the border guards, who fired
back forcing the rebels to return to Albania.
	   Nobody was injured in either incident, both of which occurred
some 70 kilometers (about 40 miles) southwest of the province's
capital Pristina, the center said. The report could be
independently confirmed.
	   The center also said Serbian authorities, joined by
international peace monitors, visited the border area the same day,
where they found a number of ``shelters and bunkers,'' allegedly
prepared for new attempts for illegal crossing of the border by
Albanian extremists into Kosovo.
	   Neighboring Albania has generally been supportive of Kosovo's
majority ethnic Albanians in their struggle for independence, and
most weapons for the rebels have come from across their border.
	   There have been fears that Kosovo could explode in a new round
of fighting if the solution is not reached by the time the snow
melts. Clashes that began following a Serb crackdown on the
separatists last February claimed hundreds of lives and forced more
than 300,000 people from their homes.

 &UR; Romanian fascist Legion members mark anniversary of leader's death
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TANCABESTI, Romania (AP) _ Hundreds of elderly veterans of
Romania's pro-Hitler Legion snapped a fascist salute and sang hymns
in an icy oak grove near Bucharest Saturday to mark the 60th
anniversary of their leader's death.
	   Relatives and followers of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, known as
``the Captain,'' sponsored Saturday's gathering in the woods where
Codreanu was executed some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of
Bucharest. It was the largest fascist turnout here since WWII.
	   ``The Captain had a divine gift and he was respected for his
honesty and his profound Orthodox faith,'' said Dumitru Tache
Funda, 82, a former Legionnaire who knew Codreanu.
	   About 300 people attended the gathering, conducted as a
Christian Orthodox ceremony. Twelve teenagers dressed in green
shirts, the traditional Legionnaire uniform, joined the ceremony,
carrying green candles and flags.
	   The Legion terrorized Romania during World War II and killed
political leaders, including two premiers. Numbering as many as 1.5
million, the Legionnaires tried to seize power in 1941 but their
revolt was quelled.
	   About 1,000 veteran Legionnaires are still honorary members of
the group today. The Legion's youth wing has 70 members but many
more sympathizers, a youth leader said.
	   ``I became a Legionnaire because I respect the values promoted
by its people, the truth and honesty, in a world marked by lies and
corruption,'' said Iacob Bogdan, 21, a student in medicine.
	   After years of oppression under the communists, who took power
in 1946 in Romania and imprisoned tens of thousands of Legionnaires
as anti-Soviet, the Legion's pre-WWII role is now being cast in a
positive light.
	   Until communism collapsed in 1989, mere mention of the movement
was strictly forbidden and Romania's current constitution still
outlaws communist and Legion organizations.
	   Codreanu, a lawyer, led the Legion for 11 years until he was
killed in 1938 on the orders of King Carol II. Carol's henchmen
also killed three of Codreanu's brothers.
	   Romania was allied with Nazi Germany during WWII until King
Michael helped stage a coup against Antonescu in August 1944 taking
Romania over to the Allies.

Serbs and ethnic Albanians clash at border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Violence between the Yugoslav army
and ethnic Albanians on the border between Serbia's Kosovo province
and Albania has flared anew, Serbian sources said Saturday.
	   The Kosovo-based Media Center, close to Serbian authorities,
said two incidents between Albanian arms smugglers and Yugoslav
army border guards occurred Friday, further threatening a shaky
October truce.
	   According to the center, the border guards intercepted a group
of smugglers, alleged to be supplying ethnic Albanian separatists
in Kosovo with weapons, late Friday. The Albanians were forced to
flee, leaving behind some 20 automatic rifles and a large quantity
of ammunition.
	   In another incident Friday, about 10 armed Albanian extremists
tried to cross illegally into Kosovo, a southern province of
Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes up the Yugoslav
federation. The group opened fire on the border guards, who fired
back, forcing the rebels to return to Albania.
	   Nobody was injured in either incident, both of which occurred 70
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of the province's capital Pristina,
the center said. The report could be independently confirmed.
	   The center also said Serbian authorities, joined by
international peace monitors, visited the border area the same day,
where they found a number of ``shelters and bunkers,'' allegedly
prepared for illegal crossings by Albanian extremists into Kosovo.
	   Neighboring Albania has generally been supportive of Kosovo's
majority ethnic Albanians in their struggle for independence, and
most weapons for the rebels have come from across their border.
	   There have been fears that fighting could renew in Kosovo if a
solution is not reached by the time the snow melts. Clashes that
began following a Serb crackdown on the separatists last February
claimed hundreds of lives and forced more than 300,000 people from
their homes.

`Love Boat' kept at port in drug probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ The cruise ship made famous by the
long-running television show ``The Love Boat'' was stranded in port
Saturday after two crew members were accused of carrying 25
kilograms (56 pounds) of heroin.
	   The two Filipino cabin attendants have been charged in the case
and two other unidentified men were detained for questioning,
police said.
	   The Pacific Princess was used as the setting for the popular
1977-86 American show ``The Love Boat'' _ where lonely passengers
found romance.
	   The drugs were discovered Thursday after the cruise ship Pacific
Princess arrived at this port near Athens from Istanbul, Turkey, as
part of a two-week cruise in the Mediterranean.
	   Carrying some 600 passengers, mostly Americans, the ship had
been due to sail on to the Greek island of Rhodes. It was awaiting
permission to leave Piraeus from a public prosecutor handling the
case.
	   Gwyn Hughes, spokesman for the London-based P&AMP;O Cruises, which
owns the Pacific Princess, said a few passengers had returned home
on their own. But most were ``enjoying their stay in Athens,'' he
said.
	   ``We are awaiting the court process which we expect to be sorted
out by Monday morning at the latest,'' Hughes said by telephone
from London.

Clashes erupt as Palestinians demonstrate for prisoner releases
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians held wide-spread demonstrations,
some of which turned violent, throughout the West Bank and east
Jerusalem Saturday calling for the release of relatives and
neighbors in Israeli jails.
	   In east Jerusalem, Israeli police on horse-back fired
rubber-coated bullets, tear gas and beat back a crowd of 450
Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to prevent the protesters
from marching towards Jerusalem's walled Old City. Several
Palestinians and journalists were injured from being clubbed by
police. Israeli police said nine Palestinians were detained.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted between
Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards an
Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers who stones. Troops
responded with tear gas and rubber-bullets before Palestinian
police arrived on the scene and pushed their citizens back from the
Israeli-controlled area. A group of Palestinians burned one Israeli
flag. There were no injuries reported.
	   In five other Palestinian-controlled cities throughout the West
Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters called on Israel to
set free so-called security prisoners, and lambasted the
Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails.
	   ``We went out in the past to demonstrate against the Israelis to
release our sons, but this time its different. There is an
agreement. We came today to raise our voice to the Palestinian
Authority to get the agreement implemented,'' said Khalid Abu
Mihsin, whose son Jamal was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for
being part of a terror cell behind the murder of an Israeli.
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israel agreed to
release 750 Palestinians in three stages. One week ago, Israel
released the first group which included 150 common criminals,
setting off criticism and disappointment from both the Palestinian
public and officials who had expected the release of Palestinians
held for political or militant activities.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release an prisoners who had committed murder or militant acts.
	   The prisoner issue is a sensitive one for Palestinians since
most families have had a brother of father arrested at one time or
another during the 30 years of Israeli occupation and had hoped the
peace process with Israel would mean the release of prisoners.
	   A statement from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet,
which met until late Friday, said the issue of prisoner releases
was ``top priority,'' and ``will not be subjected to compromise.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat would
raise the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton when he goes to
Washington next week.
	   At Saturday's demonstrations however, held under the banner ``no
peace without prisoner release,'' most of the anger was lobbed at
Arafat's Palestinian Authority and in some cases, at Erekat
directly.
	   In the city of Nablus, some 250 Palestinian demonstrators
including mothers of prisoners carrying photos of their sons,
chanted, ``Tell Erekat we are fed up with statements.''
	   Similar protests were held in the Gaza Strip last week and
Palestinians said weekly demonstrations would grow until all
prisoners were released.

Rebels dig in, brace for defense in eastern Congo

	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ Threatened by a government
counteroffensive, Congolese rebels on Saturday appeared to have
halted a four-month advance into the heart of Congo and instead dug
in to brace for air strikes against them.
	   ``We're avoiding confrontation to cut losses,'' said rebel Capt.
Baudeoin, who only gave his first name. ``The enemy is putting
pressure on us, and we're resisting.''
	   Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally, has deployed
troops, tanks, helicopters and jet fighters in eastern Congo to aid
the Congolese army counteroffensive at Kabalo, a key railway
junction 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of the eastern rebel
stronghold at Goma.
	   This is the first time the rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
have had to stop their march across the eastern half of Congo since
the war began Aug. 2.
	   The rebels, disaffected members of the government and army, are
fighting to topple Kabila, whom they charge with the same
corruption, nepotism and ethnic intolerance as Mobutu Sese Seko,
the former Zaire's dictator he ousted in May 1997.
	   Rwanda and Uganda complain that Kabila has neglected eastern
Congo, from where rebels from their countries launch cross-border
attacks.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, instead
demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for
the insurgents.
	   Both countries say they will continue fighting as long as Congo
remains unstable, and accuse Kabila of enlisting among his army's
ranks thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Baudeoin said his troops on Thursday forced back
government-allied tanks when they tried to take the Nzofu Bridge
over the Congo River, 14 kilometers (8 miles) west of Kabalo, which
guards the entrance to the town.
	   He admitted losses among his troops, and said Zimbabwean
soldiers had also been killed in the fighting. He did not say how
many died, but said the foreigners had been promptly buried, while
their identity cards and green and red berets had been kept for
record.
	   One of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Defense cards carried the
photo and the name of Godfriy Masamwa, a private.
	   On Friday, Zimbabwean MiG-21 fighter jets retaliated by dropping
bombs on the abandoned hamlets surrounding Kabalo, but caused no
casualties.
	   One 50-kilogram bomb landed in the sand in between huts made of
mud bricks, creating a huge crater. Another cluster bomb destroyed
railtracks in front of the abandoned, white railway building, which
has not been in use since Kabalo fell to the rebels last month.
	   Most of the population has fled into thick tropical forest to
avoid almost daily air raids since Kabila and his allies, which
also include Angola, Namibia and Chad, launched their
counteroffensive in the east.
	   Rebel commanders dismissed the danger posed by the government
offensive, saying the aircraft were flying too high for fear of
being hit by ground fire.
	   Bombing runs were too imprecise and insignificant to make a
difference, he said.
	   Faced with the rainy seasons' muddy roads and swelling lakes and
rivers, and the threat of air strikes, the rebels have been forced
to adopt new tactics of moving at night and resting by day, often
waiting for the rains to stop.
	   ``We had to change our behavior,'' Baudeoin said.
	   Army convoys from the airstrip at Nyunzu, bringing in fresh
supplies of ammunition and weapons to front-line positions 150
kilometers (90 miles) away, have been avoiding main roads, instead
inching in dark for hours through narrow bush tracks.
	   During the day, soldiers dodge open areas, moving quickly,
avoiding forming columns across rice fields and looking for cover
in banana trees.
	   Baudeoin said most of the rebel attacks during the night
targeted enemy artillery positions they had located during daylight
hours and spots where Zimbabwean Mi-24 transport helicopters drop
off soldiers close to the front-lines.

Interior Minister supports giving Islamic religion official status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Granting the Islamic religion government
status could help set a national standard for introducing Islamic
teaching in public schools, Interior Minister Otto Schily was
quoted as saying in a news magazine report Saturday.
	   Schily, according to Focus, supports giving Islam the same
``official'' status as the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches,
which receive government funds. Their followers pay so-called
``church taxes'' and their children can take voluntary religious
classes in public schools.
	   The new center-left Social Democrat-Greens coalition government,
elected in September, is eager to develop new policies
acknowledging the multi-ethnic quality of modern Germany. It has
proposed relaxing citizenship laws to make it easier for foreign
nationals to become Germans.
	   Schily's comments followed a controversial ruling by a Berlin
court last month giving the Islamic Federation, representing 12 of
the city's 70 mosques, the right to organize Islamic religious
instruction for public school students.
	   Liberal Muslims who find the Islamic Federation too radical
opposed the ruling. A lawmaker of Turkish descent has urged the
government to set a standard for Islamic curriculum nationwide to
avoid giving control to a single group that might support
fundamentalism.
	   Schily said a government-recognized Islamic movement could
introduce Islamic teaching in public schools while at the same time
make sure Muslim children also are learning the German language and
laws.
	   The Berlin court ruling also was opposed by Germans resistant to
``multiculturalism'' who argue it clashes with western, Christian
traditions.
	   Schily emphasized that Islamic laws and customs should never
take precedence over German culture, saying that Muslim residents
should learn German. Germany's largest minority population is its 2
million Turks.
	   ``It cannot be that a Turkish minority in Berlin can demand that
street signs ... be written also in Turkish,'' he said.

Protesters interrupt Jiang's speech at Japanese university
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS; UPDATES with Jiang's arrival in Sendai

 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin again urged Japan to
come to grips with its wartime past on Saturday, but his speech was
interrupted by students protesting his nation's human rights
record.
	   Three protesters were arrested after scuffling with security
guards in the auditorium at Tokyo's Waseda University, where Jiang
was delivering a speech.
	   One demonstrator unfurled a banner reading: ``Down with the
Jiang regime.''
	   Jiang ignored them, raising his voice over their shouts.
	   ``Thirty-five million Chinese soldiers and civilians were either
killed or injured, and China suffered economic losses worth more
than 600 billion dollars,'' he said in his speech.
	   Sitting near the Chinese president was Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, a Waseda graduate.
	   Outside, scores of students protested the treatment of Chinese
dissidents and Beijing's nuclear weapons program. Several of the
protesters, who shouted slogans and carried anti-Chinese placards,
were dragged away by police.
	   While Jiang will travel in northern Japan until Monday, Japanese
media have already begun to raise doubts about what his visit _ the
first ever by a Chinese head of state _ has accomplished.
	   There has been much speculation that Jiang was disappointed by
Japan's refusal to issue a clear written apology for its wartime
aggression against China.
	   ``Can we say that President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan has
been a `success'? To be a bit pessimistic, we don't think so,''
Japan's conservative Sankei newspaper said in an editorial
Saturday.
	   Since arriving Wednesday, Jiang has taken every opportunity to
remind Japanese that they must apologize for the atrocities
committed before and during World War II, if they hope to build
better relations with China.
	   A joint communique issued Thursday mentioned Japan's ``remorse''
for the war. But it did not use the word ``apology,'' which Japan
had offered South Korea in writing during President Kim Dae-jung's
visit to Tokyo last month.
	   Although Japanese media reports have said that the decision not
to sign the communique was highly unusual, Jiang and Japanese
officials played down its significance.
	   ``Chinese and Japanese officials never considered the option of
signing the joint communique,'' Jiang said at a news conference
later Saturday.
	   On Thursday, Obuchi also gave a vaguely worded answer to Jiang
on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province.
	   Obuchi said Japan does not support Taiwanese independence and
reassured Jiang that Japan's security arrangement with the United
States was only for defense.
	   ``Japan has given a clear, adequate statement'' opposing
Taiwanese independence, Jiang told the news conference. ``I want
Japan to observe its promises.''
	   Later Saturday, Jiang arrived and attended a reception in the
northern city of Sendai.
	   On Sunday, he will visit a monument to Chinese writer Lu Xun,
who studied in that city. He will then visit farms on the northern
Japanese island of Hokkaido.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has earmarked dlrs 3 billion for
imports of essential foodstuffs over the next four months, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
	   It quoted Mostafa Matavar-Zadeh, a legislator from the
southwestern city of Khorramshahr, as saying that the Iranian
government intends to purchase dlrs 1.6 billion worth of wheat,
rice, vegetable oil and sugar by the end of the Iranian year on
March 20.
	   An additional dlrs 1.4 billion has been allocated for imports of
meat, chicken, chemical fertilizers, tea, corn, fish, soya bean and
powdered milk, he said at a trade fair Saturday in the Saudi

	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire to end the fighting between rebels and forces loyal
to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, French President Jacques
Chirac said.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had
reached a consensus to stop this war.''
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime in December before a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The Secretary General has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   Earlier, Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of officials,
including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are
supporting rebels waging an insurgency in Congo. The heads of
Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.'' He did not refer to whether the rebels in
Congo had been consulted, or what their position now would be.
	   He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to
establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a
greater rapprochement,'' he said.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his
renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his
regime's 18 months in power have seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion,
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
	   The purpose of the Paris talks on the sidelines of an African
summit on security was to try to work out some framework for peace
negotiations between the warring parties.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders _ especially those at
war in Congo _ to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Annan said many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of
intolerance'' and that the Congo conflict poses the continent's
greatest challenge.
	   Chirac on Friday urged African nations to do their own
peacekeeping _ a departure from past practices that put the burden
on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Thirty four African leaders attended the 20th French-African
summit which addressed the issue of how to tame wars raging across
the continent.
	   All eyes were on Kabila, who finally sat down with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention
following the decision by Britain's House of Lords to reject
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by human rights
groups, ruled Friday that Kabila could not be pursued for human
rights violations because he benefits from customary immunity
accorded heads of state in office.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.

Hassan: Palestinian peace essential for regional stability

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Addressing the Parliament for the first
time in 28 years, Crown Prince Hassan said Saturday that a
settlement to the Palestinian conflict was essential to regional
peace and stability.
	   Addressing the opening of Parliament's 52nd regular session,
Hassan said the ``restoration of the Palestinian right to land,
resources and a state is a cornerstone for our security and that of
the whole region.''
	   Many members of the royal family _ including King Hussein's
children _ attended the function which is yet another effort by the
state to showcase Hassan in a country which knew only Hussein as
its leader in the last 45 years.
	   The prince is acting as regent while King Hussein is receiving
cancer treatment in the United States.
	   It was Hassan's first address to Parliament since 1970 and the
fourth since he was named crown prince in 1965 at the age of 18.
	   Both Houses of Parliament _ the 80-member elected Lower House
and the 40-member, royally appointed Senate _ met jointly to hear
Hassan outline the government policy in a traditional speech from
the throne, the constitutional opening of all legislative sessions.
	   The Lower House elected Abdul-Hadi Majali as speaker. Majali,
58, leads the pro-government Constitutional Party, which has 17
seats _ the largest single bloc in Parliament.
	   In his speech, Hassan said Jordan will consolidate relations
with Arab and Muslim governments.
	   Domestically, he promised to strengthen ``the foundations of a
civil society'' ruled by institutions under a liberalization
program launched in 1989.
	   Hassan, Jordan's economic strategist, also promised to improve
living conditions in a country barren of natural resources and
burdened by dlrs 6.1 billion in foreign debts.
	   He pledged continued economic reforms with reduced public
spending, increased exports, privatization of state firms, active
role for the private sector and increased foreign investment.
	   He also promised to fight poverty and unemployment and to
introduce more social and health programs to help the poor and
``provide social justice for all the sons of this nation.''

Italy, Yugoslavia advance to Men's Worlds final

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Italy and the 1996 Olympic
bronze medalist Yugoslavia beat their opponents Saturday, advancing
to the Men's World Volleyball Championships final.
	   Italy defeated Brazil 15-10, 13-15, 15-11, 10-15, 15-10, while
Yugoslavia downed this year's World League champion Cuba 15-3,
15-12, 14-16, 15-10.
	   Brazil, after losing the first set, overcame an 8-2 deficit in
the second set as Nalbert Bitencourt led a rally for eight straight
points. Leading at 13-11, Max Pereira scored a kill and then a
block point for Brazil to win the set.
	   Led by Andrea Giani and Andrea Sartoretti, the Italians were on
the offensive in the third set, and Brazil found its rhythm in the
fourth.
	   In the final set, Italy blocked out and served away the
Brazilians with Sartoretti scoring the match point.
	   ``It was a very balanced and competitive game,'' said Brazilian
head coach Radames Lattari Filho. ``I think Italy won because the
team has more experience.''
	   Italy is seeking to become the first men's team ever to win
three consecutive world titles, having won in 1990 and 1994.
	   ``Usually we have more concentration,'' said Italian team
captain Andrea Gardini. ``But we played very well today ... and I'm
very happy about the win over such a very strong team.''
	   In the other semifinal game, Yugoslavia made a furious start and
was on the way to a straight-set victory, but missed five match
points in the third set.
	   ``We were just sleeping in the first set,'' said Cuban captain
Ihosvany Hernandez. In the third and fourth sets, poor reception
and an extremely strong Yugoslavian block led to an unexpected
one-sided game, he said.
	   ``In the third set my players got nervous for the first time in
this tournament, but this is human,'' said Yugoslavian head coach
Zoran Gajic.
	   Dula Mester scored the last point for Yugoslavia to advance to
the final.
	   Cuba takes on Brazil for third place on Sunday.
	   In a consolation round Saturday for fifth through eighth places,
the 1996 Olympic semifinalist Russia beat Bulgaria 15-13, 15-2,
15-7.
	   Bulgaria led 10-7 at one point in the first set before the
taller Russians came back with effective attacks and blocks, and
tightened defense.
	   Serguei Tetioukhine led Russia with six points and nine
side-outs, followed by Igor Choulepov's six and seven. Alexei
Kazakov led the squad with six block points.
	   ``The Russians played better than we did in the second and third
sets,'' said Bulgarian head coach Gueorgui Vassiloev. ``Russia's
block was too high to break through.''
	   In a full-set duel of nearly three hours, the Olympic champion
Netherlands rallied after losing the first two sets to defeat Spain
13-15, 16-17, 15-12, 15-10, 15-10. In every set, the Netherlands
had a chance to win.
	   Russia and the Netherlands will play Sunday for 5th vs. 6th
place, and Spain and Bulgaria for 7th and 8th.
	   The United States defeated Argentina in the first game for the
9-12 playoffs 15-10, 15-11, 11-15, 13-15, 15-9.
	   ``We won, but it was tough to keep up our level after so many
games,'' said U.S.-libero Eric Sullivan.
	   Ukraine beat Canada in the other game in straight sets.
	   Ukraine and the United States will face off for ninth place,
while Canada and Argentina for 11-12. The 24-team competition
started on Nov. 13.

	   LONDON (AP) _ After gaining an extra week to decide whether to
allow the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on charges including
genocide, Britain's government faced continuing pressure from Chile
Saturday to let the former dictator come home.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
	   Fourteen cases were already pending and Pinochet had no immunity
from prosecution, said Insulza, who was himself an exile during
Pinochet's rule in Chile. ``These processes are going on and I
fully expect they will result in justice,'' he said.
	   The lawsuits pending in Chile were filed mostly by victims of
repression or their relatives, the Communist Party, the National
Association of Journalists, the National Association of Registered
Nurses and the National Federation of School Teachers. All relate
to killings or disappearances.
	   All the suits are being handling by Santiago Judge Juan Guzman,
who has said he plans to question Pinochet in December _ if he
comes home.

	   LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) _ Bjarte Engen Vik had little problems
defending his first place in the K120 jumping competition when he
won the 15-kilometer cross country race in the World Cup Nordic
Combined opener Saturday.
	   At the start line the Norwegian was 1 minute and 21 seconds

third in Friday's jumping competition. At 6K Manninen had taken 20

	   Manninen finally captured third, 1:13.3 behind Engen Vik, but he
was beaten by Ladislav Rygl of the Czech Republic. Rygl was eighth
in the jumping, but with the fastest cross country time, he took
second, 1:07.5 behind.
	   Second in the jumping, Dmitriy Sinitzyn from Russia, followed
Manninen for most of the cross country race, but Manninen was 1.1

Prosecutor hears Maradona, Coppola; manager alleges plot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ After meeting with Diego Maradona, a Turin
prosecutor spoke Saturday with the soccer legend's manager, who
claimed ``a plot'' was behind the 1991 drug ban that ended the
Argentine's Italian League career.
	   The manager, Guillermo Coppola, has indicated he will seek
damages for an allegedly botched drug test that led to Maradona's
15-month suspension while he was playing for Serie A club Napoli.
	   The test was done at the Acqua Acetosa laboratory, Italy's
scandal-ridden drug-testing facility that was shut down last month.
	   ``There was, without a doubt, a plot against Diego,'' Coppola
told reporters, ``and the facts we have today demonstrate that.
There was a plot by the big sports authorities, not just in Italy
but also internationally.''
	   Prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello, who is investigating the use of
performance-enhancing substances in Italian soccer, also reportedly
questioned Maradona and Coppola about how the player was treated
for injuries when he was with Napoli.
	   Maradona met with Guariniello for two hours Friday night,
shortly after setting foot in Italy for the first time since
leaving when the suspension for cocaine use was imposed in March
1991.
	   ``I have always told the truth, yelling my innocence in the
doping incident,'' Maradona wrote in a letter published Saturday on
the front page of the Naples newspaper Il Mattino. ``Finally, after
many years of bitterness, I have been given the chance to speak
officially about the matter. ... I have many questions and I would
like some answers.''
	   Maradona, who led Napoli to its only two league titles, was to
appear on a glitzy variety show on RAI state television Saturday
night.
	   A confessed cocaine addict, the 38-year-old has long maintained
his innocence, saying he often took his own private tests before
matches to be sure he would not fail the league's tests. He charged
the suspension was revenge for Argentina's victory over Italy in
the 1990 World Cup semifinals.
	   He was hit with another doping suspension at the 1994 World Cup,
testing positive for what world soccer's governing body, FIFA,
called a ``cocktail'' of stimulants.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians held wide-spread demonstrations,
some of which turned violent, throughout the West Bank and east
Jerusalem Saturday calling for the release of relatives and
neighbors in Israeli jails.
	   In east Jerusalem, Israeli police on horse-back charged a crowd
of about 40 Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to prevent them
from marching towards Jerusalem's walled Old City. The protesters
threw stones and empty bottles at police, and police responded with
rubber-coated bullets and tear gas. Several Palestinians and
journalists were injured from being clubbed by police.
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said that demonstration
organizers had refused police requests to apply for a permit.
Ben-Ruby said that nine police officers were injured and nine
Palestinians were arrested.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted between
Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards an
Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers with stones. Troops
responded with tear gas and rubber-bullets before Palestinian
police arrived on the scene and pushed their citizens back from the
Israeli-controlled area. A group of Palestinians burned one Israeli
flag. There were no injuries reported.
	   In five other Palestinian-controlled cities throughout the West
Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters called on Israel to
set free so-called security prisoners, and lambasted the
Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails.
	   ``We went out in the past to demonstrate against the Israelis to
release our sons, but this time its different. There is an
agreement. We came today to raise our voice to the Palestinian
Authority to get the agreement implemented,'' said Khalid Abu
Mihsin, whose son Jamal was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for
being part of a terror cell behind the murder of an Israeli.
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israel agreed to
release 750 Palestinians in three stages. One week ago, Israel
released the first group which included 150 common criminals,
setting off criticism and disappointment from both the Palestinian
public and officials who had expected the release of Palestinians
held for political or militant activities.
	   ``We didn't spend our time at Wye Plantation discussing the
release of those car thieves and criminals,'' Palestinian Cabinet
Secretary Nabil Shaath said late Friday night. ``We discussed the
release of those who participated in the Palestinian struggle.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release prisoners who had committed murder or militant acts.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Turnout for registration for
the 1999 elections has been very low, with problems persisting
Saturday in the compilation of South Africa's first all-race voters
list.
	   There are 12.7 million potential voters in the northern half of
South Africa but election officials said they knew of only 235,000
who had registered on Friday, the first of three days of
registration for northern South Africa. Two-thirds of registration
stations still had not reported results.
	   The 12 million potential voters in the southern half of the
country are to register next weekend.
	   IEC chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu said he was not overly
concerned about the low turnout.
	   ``For the fact that we had quite a difficult start, the number
doesn't depress me greatly,'' he told reporters. ``I did not expect
five million on the first day.''
	   Hundreds of registration sites remained closed because civil
servants were not showing up to staff them, and voters were still
being directed to the wrong sites.
	   Still, the effort was running more smoothly than on Friday, when
even President Nelson Mandela registered at the wrong site.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission almost repeated the error
when it directed Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to the wrong voter
registration point. The mistake was discovered in time and Mbeki
will go to the proper site when he returns Sunday from a conference
in Paris, said Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African
National Congress.
	   Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Johann Kriegler told
reporters in the capital, Pretoria: ``The overall picture is better
than I though it was, and very much better than I had anticipated
it would be.''
	   However, many farmworkers and domestic workers could be excluded
from voting in next year's election because they don't know they
have to register. The South African Press Association reported that
many of hundreds of laborers in North West Province who were
preparing fields for planting said they were unaware they needed to
register.
	   No date has been set yet for the 1999 election, the first since
the 1994 all-race balloting which marked the end of apartheid.

	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ Under threat from a government
counteroffensive, Congolese rebels on Saturday appeared to have
halted a four-month advance into the heart of Congo and instead dug
in to brace for air strikes.
	   The halt came as the countries at war in the Congo agreed to a
cease-fire to end the fighting between rebels and forces loyal to
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, French President Jacques Chirac
said.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had
reached a consensus to stop this war.''
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime in December before a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   Earlier, a rebel captain said the halt was the result of
stepped-up pressure from government forces.
	   ``We're avoiding confrontation to cut losses,'' rebel Capt.
Baudeoin, who only gave his first name. ``The enemy is putting
pressure on us, and we're resisting.''
	   Zimbabwe,Kabila's main ally, has deployed troops, tanks,
helicopters and jet fighters in eastern Congo to aid the Congolese
army counteroffensive at Kabalo, a key railway junction 300
kilometers (185 miles) south of the eastern rebel stronghold at
Goma.
	   This is the first time the rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
have had to stop their march across the eastern half of Congo since
the war began Aug. 2.
	   The rebels, disaffected members of the government and army, were
fighting to topple Kabila, whom they charge with the same
corruption, nepotism and ethnic intolerance as Mobutu Sese Seko,
the former Zaire's dictator he ousted in May 1997.
	   Rwanda and Uganda complain that Kabila has neglected eastern
Congo, from where rebels from their countries launch cross-border
attacks.
	   Kabila has refused so far to negotiate with the rebels, instead
demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw their support for
the insurgents. It was unclear if the rebels on the ground had
accepted the cease-fire.
	   Earlier, Baudeoin said his troops on Thursday forced back
government-allied tanks when they tried to take the Nzofu Bridge
over the Congo River, 14 kilometers (8 miles) west of Kabalo, which
guards the entrance to the town.
	   He admitted losses among his troops, and said Zimbabwean
soldiers had also been killed in the fighting. He did not say how
many died, but said the foreigners had been promptly buried, while
their identity cards and green and red berets had been kept for
record.
	   On Friday, Zimbabwean MiG-21 fighter jets retaliated by dropping
bombs on the abandoned hamlets surrounding Kabalo, but caused no
casualties.
	   Most of the population has fled into thick tropical forest to
avoid almost daily air raids since Kabila and his allies, which
also include Angola, Namibia and Chad, launched their
counteroffensive in the east.

Japan, South Korea sign fisheries accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 5th-7th grafs with other issues discussed;
minor edit to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korea signed an agreement Saturday
that sets new fishing boundaries and quotas, easing tensions over
rights to waters around disputed islands.
	   The pact permits vessels from Japan and South Korea to fish
within 200 nautical miles (230 miles, 370 kilometers) of each
country's shores _ the limit for exclusive fishing rights under the
1994 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
	   Japan and South Korea are less than 400 nautical miles (460
miles, 740 kilometers) apart and both had claimed exclusive rights
in overlapping areas.
	   The signing during a meeting of Cabinet ministers from both
countries in the southern city of Kagoshima formalized the accord
reached in September, a Japanese government official said.
	   Also Saturday, leaders of the two countries pledged to work
together on security with the United States on fears about North
Korea, as well as to go ahead with talks on a new investment
treaty.
	   South Korean Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil proposed setting up a
dlrs 300 billion fund to help Asian nations hit hard by the recent
regional crisis, but Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi had no
immediate response, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Kim also reiterated a request for Japanese Emperor Akihito to
make his first state visit to the country in 2000, Kyodo said.
	   Under the fishing accord, the two nations agreed to set up a
joint fishing zone around disputed islets, located about 35
nautical miles (40 miles, 64 kilometers) from the shores of both
countries.
	   The islets, called Takeshima in Japan and Tok-do in Korea, are
surrounded by fertile fishing grounds and have been the source of
persistent acrimony between the two countries.
	   Tempers flared between the neighbors in January after Japan said
it wanted out of a 1965 treaty that had set exclusive fishing
rights within 12 nautical miles (14 miles, 22 kilometers).
	   Under the new accord, both sides also agreed to reduce their
fishing catches in each other's waters.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and his Korean
counterpart Hong Soon-young inked the agreement in a ceremony in
Kagoshima, 985 kilometers (616 miles) southwest of Tokyo. Kim and
Obuchi also took part in the ceremony.

Clashes erupt as Palestinians demonstrate for prisoner releases

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians demanding the release of relatives
in Israeli jails held widespread demonstrations Saturday throughout
the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Some turned violent.
	   In east Jerusalem, Israeli mounted police charged a crowd of
about 40 Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to prevent them
from marching towards Jerusalem's walled Old City.
	   The protesters threw stones and empty bottles at police, who
responded with rubber-coated bullets and tear gas. Several
Palestinians and journalists were injured after from being clubbed.
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said that demonstration
organizers had refused police requests to apply for a permit.
Ben-Ruby said that nine police officers were injured and nine
Palestinians were arrested.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted between
Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards an
Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers with stones.
	   Troops responded with tear gas and rubber-bullets before
Palestinian police arrived on the scene and pushed Palestinians
back from the Israeli-controlled area. There were no injuries
reported.
	   In five other Palestinian-controlled cities throughout the West
Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters lambasted the
Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails.
	   ``We went out in the past to demonstrate against the Israelis to
release our sons, but this time its different _ there is an
agreement,'' said Khalid Abu Mihsin, whose son Jamal was sentenced
to life in prison in 1993 for being part of a terror cell behind
the murder of an Israeli.
	   ``We came today to raise our voice to the Palestinian Authority
to get the agreement implemented.''
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israel agreed to
release 750 Palestinians in three stages.
	   The first group, released a week ago, included 150 common
criminals, prompting criticism and disappointment from both the
Palestinian public and officials who had expected the release of
Palestinians held for political or militant activities.
	   ``We didn't spend our time at Wye Plantation discussing the
release of those car thieves and criminals,'' Palestinian Cabinet
Secretary Nabil Shaath said late Friday night. ``We discussed the
release of those who participated in the Palestinian struggle.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release prisoners who had committed murder or militant acts.
	   The prisoner issue is a sensitive one for Palestinians since
most families have had a brother of father arrested at one time or
another during the 30 years of Israeli occupation.
	   A statement from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet,
which met until late Friday, said the issue of prisoner releases
was ``top priority,'' and ``will not be subjected to compromise.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat would
raise the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton when he goes to
Washington next week.
	   In the city of Nablus, some 250 Palestinian demonstrators
including mothers of prisoners carrying photos of their sons,
chanted, ``Tell Erekat we are fed up with statements.''

Moya beats Henman to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Moya winning &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Carlos Moya beat Tim Henman 6-4, 3-6,
7-5 on Saturday to become the first Spaniard to reach the final of
the season-ending ATP Tour World Championship in 22 years.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, turned the match in the middle
of the third set, when he broke Henman's serve to tie the score at
3-3.
	   In the second semifinal, top-ranked Pete Sampras played Alex
Corretja, the second Spaniard in the last four.
	   Moya became the first Spaniard to reach the final since Manuel
Orantes won what was then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston.
	   Although not known for his prowess on indoor courts, Moya
reached the semifinals of the championship last year in his first
appearance in the tournament and now has advanced to his first
final.
	   Ranked No. 4 in the world, Moya broke Henman's service in the
seventh game and that allowed him to take the first set.
	   Henman, who will move up two spots to a career-high ranking of
No. 7 in final season rankings that come out Monday, broke Moya's
serve for the first time for a 2-0 lead in the second set.
	   The first Briton to reach the semifinals of the event, Henman
survived a scare in the seventh game, when he saved four break
points. He held serve to win the set and tie the score.
	   Henman broke Moya's serve again at the start of the decisive
set. But Moya pulled back in the sixth game and fought off three
more break points in his next two service games.
	   With Henman serving to stay in the match, Moya whipped a
backhand passing shot to gain a match point. He hit a tremendous
return winner past Henman to clinch the match after two hours and
20 minutes.
	   After wrapping up the top spot in the world rankings for a
record six consecutive season, Sampras can pull even with Ivan
Lendl in winning the season-ending tournament for the fifth time.
	   Sampras, the two-time defending champion in the dlrs 3.5 million
tournament, did not drop a set in three round-robin matches.
	   ``He's playing amazingly, he's just unbeatable,'' said Moya, one
of Sampras' victims in the round-robin portion.
	   Sampras accomplished his main goal of the year _ holding the No.
1 for the sixth consecutive year _ when Marcelo Rios dropped out
Thursday because of a back injury. That ruined Rios' hopes of
challenging Sampras for the No. 1.

Turks demonstrate in favor of Kurdish rebel leader's extradition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ More than 15,000 Turks demonstrated in several
German cities Saturday urging Italy to extradite a Kurdish rebel
leader to face trial in Turkey on charges of murder and terrorism.
	   Protest marches in Berlin, Bonn, Munich and Nuremberg came one
day after Germany and Italy agreed to push for establishing an
international court to hear charges against Abdullah Ocalan, whose
outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, has fought a 14-year war
for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.
	   Ocalan's fate has been a subject of debate since police arrested
him Nov. 12 in Italy on arrival aboard a flight from Moscow. A Rome
court freed him Nov. 20, rejecting a Turkish warrant because
Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where
they face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan also faces murder and terror charges in Germany, which
does not have the death penalty, but Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on Friday ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of Kurdish
unrest.
	   About one-fifth of Germany's 2 million Turkish residents are
Kurds, and Germany has seen numerous protests since Ocalan's arrest
_ Turks demanding his extradition to Turkey and Kurds demanding his
freedom. About 11,000 Kurds protested in Bonn on Friday as
Schroeder met with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer met with D'Alema in Rome on
Saturday, presumably to discuss Ocalan's case.
	   The Kurdish leader, who has requested asylum in Italy, is now
under police surveillance at a Rome villa. Judges ordered him to
stay in Rome until Dec. 23 while Germany decided whether to seek
extradition. What happens next depends on his asylum request and on
the establishment of an international court.
	   Turkish protests Saturday were peaceful. Police estimated about
6,500 protesters in Munich; 5,000 in Nuremberg; and 3,500 in both
Berlin and Bonn.

Ukraine's energy authorities refuse to stop Chernobyl reactor for
</HEADLINE>
repairs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian energy officials have refused to
shut down the only operational reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant for repairs, saying they need its power for the winter,
a news report said Saturday.
	   The National Electricity Dispatching Center rejected Chernobyl
authorities' request to shut down reactor No. 3 until a reactor at
Ukraine's other nuclear power plant is restarted to offset the
closure, the UNIAN news agency reported.
	   The refusal followed more than a month of disagreement between
Ukrainian nuclear safety authorities and energy officials over
whether to stop the troubled reactor.
	   Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration ordered Chernobyl
officials earlier this month to stop the reactor as of Dec. 1 after
an inspection showed that some of its safety equipment was close to
the end of its operational life.
	   But the order was immediately protested by the Energy Ministry,
which said the reactor was needed until spring to ensure enough
electricity during the fall and winter.
	   Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov said earlier this week that
his ministry would be forced to cut off electricity in entire
regions if even one nuclear reactor is stopped.
	   Deputy Energy Minister Hennadiy Yaroslavtsev said Saturday the
shutdown of the Chernobyl reactor would be possible only after a
reactor at the Yuzhnaya nuclear power is restarted, according to
UNIAN.
	   He said that operators at Yuzhnaya are currently preparing to
restart the reactor. It has been idle for more than a month because
the plant lacked the money to import new safety equipment for it.
	   Western nations have demanded the shutdown of the Chernobyl
reactor amid growing worries over its safety, and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development has agreed to grant dlrs 118
million for upgrading it.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, when its other unit was shut down in conformance with the
Ukrainian government's pledge to fully close the plant by 2000.
	   There have been frequent malfunctions at the reactor recently
despite lengthy repairs between July, 1997 and May, 1998.
	   One Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident, while another was stopped
after a 1991 fire.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Italian League's disciplinary committee
has penalized Empoli two standings points for attempting to
influence a referee, dealing the club a big blow in its battle to
avoid relegation.
	   Empoli can appeal Friday night's decision.
	   The committee ruled that referee Stefano Farina was approached
by someone with ties to Empoli owner Fabrizio Corsi ahead of the
team's Oct. 25 match against Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   Farina offered to withdraw from working the game, and a
replacement refereed the 3-0 Sampdoria victory.
	   ``It is an incredible sentence, just crazy,'' Empoli general
director Fabrizio Lucchessi said. ``There was not a piece of proof.
Farina's word counted more than anything else.''
	   The ruling dropped Empoli two places to 17th in the 18-team
Serie A. The bottom four teams at the end of the season are demoted
to Serie B.

<SLUG> Italy to invest dlrs 3 billion to reduce carbon dioxide emissions </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will offer financial incentives worth dlrs 3
billion in the next five years to encourage industry to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions, Environmental Minister Edo Ronchi, said
Saturday.
	   Ronchi said the incentives are intended to stimulate even
greater spending by the private sector.
	   He spoke at a national conference on the environment and energy,
unveiling a government plan to coordinate its efforts to cut carbon
dioxide emissions with those of industry, unions, consumer and
environmental groups.
	   At the 1997 worldwide environmental conference in Japan, Italy
agreed to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 by 6.5 percent
from 1990 levels.
	   Ronchi made it clear at the conference that the government will
encourage the use of natural gas. He has already gotten a ``carbon
tax'' through parliament that makes it more attractive as fuel for
power plants by raising taxes on coal and fuel oil.
	   Italy held its last national energy conference in 1987 amid a
heated national debate on nuclear power. A referendum the same year
banned nuclear power in Italy.

Prospect of another secession referendum at stake in Quebec
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ With the rest of Canada watching warily, Quebec
voters make a momentous choice Monday between an incumbent
provincial leader who favors independence and an underdog
challenger seeking to end the threat of secession.
	   If Premier Lucien Bouchard's Parti Quebecois wins the election,
he has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving Canada whenever he
calculates that the separatists will prevail. Some militants in his
party already have an unofficial motto: ``A country for the year
2000.''
	   Bouchard, though demonized in much of English-speaking Canada,
is immensely popular in mostly French-speaking Quebec. The man with
the difficult task of unseating him is Jean Charest, who left
federal politics in March to become leader of the Quebec Liberal
Party.
	   Charest, one of the few Canadian politicians who can match
Bouchard's charisma, jumped ahead in early opinion polls and was
hailed in other provinces as the potential savior of Canadian
unity.
	   But Charest's lead evaporated, and poll after poll in recent
days suggests that the Parti Quebecois is poised to maintain a
comfortable majority in the 125-seat legislature. In the last
election, in 1994, the popular vote was split almost evenly, but
the separatists won 77 seats because their support is spread more
evenly across the province.
	   Bouchard has tried to calm anxiety in English-speaking Canada
about the consequences of a Parti Quebecois victory.
	   ``I'm not the Great Satan,'' he said Friday. ``I like Canada.
... But it happens in Quebec that some people like me think we
would be much better off if we could manage our own things.''
	   Quebec's first referendum on secession was in 1980, and the
separatists were crushed by a 60-40 margin. Three years ago, they
tried again, and rattled the nation by receiving 49 percent of the
vote.
	   The separatists' near-victory was due in large part to Bouchard.
He lost his left leg and nearly died from a flesh-eating disease in
late 1994 yet recovered to spearhead a separatist surge in the
referendum campaign.
	   Bouchard wants no more defeats. He says his government will work
to create ``winning conditions'' for the next referendum by
completing a drive to erase Quebec's budget deficit and build
confidence in the economy.
	   By refusing to commit to holding a referendum at all costs,
Bouchard has managed to appeal to many middle-of-the road
Quebeckers who like the Parti Quebecois as a feisty provincial
government but do not want to secede from Canada. Polls show many
French speakers who will vote for Bouchard's party do not want
another referendum and would oppose secession.
	   Wooing these voters, Bouchard has floated a variety of proposals
less radical than unilateral independence _ a major
decentralization of the current federal system, or a Quebec-Canada
partnership comparable to the European Union.
	   ``From one day to the next, you never know which Lucien Bouchard
will show up,'' columnist Lysiane Gagnon wrote Saturday in
Montreal's La Presse.
	   Charest, however, says Bouchard's ambiguity is a smokescreen
meant only to increase his chances of victory on Monday.
	   ``From that moment on, there will be an irreversible process to
separate Quebec from Canada,'' Charest said.
	   Charest, 40, is 19 years younger than Bouchard, and an eloquent
orator in French and English. But the skills which served him well
in federal politics have been less useful in Quebec, where
provincial politicians are expected to do battle with the federal
government.
	   ``Mr. Charest is a proud Quebecker,'' said Montreal radio
commentator Jean Lapierre. ``Nonetheless, since he first arrived on
the provincial scene ... he has been unable to touch the Quebec
soul.''
	   Charest began the campaign by emphasizing economics, saying the
specter of another referendum was scaring away investment. He
promised big cuts in Quebec's taxes _ the highest in North America
_ and assailed Bouchard for damaging the health system while
pursuing a balanced budget.
	   But economics never became a defining issue. Bouchard made
tax-cut promises of his own, and polls suggested that most voters
do not blame him for the often painful process of erasing the
deficit.
	   Charest can count on support from Quebec's English-speaking
minority and from non-francophone immigrants _ based mostly around
Montreal and together comprising about 17 percent of Quebec's 7.1
million population.
	   But polls indicate that Bouchard has maintained a large lead
among the francophone majority. With fatherly ads emphasizing
trust, he also appears to have made progress among women, who
traditionally have given an edge to the Liberals.
	   The wild card in the election is the No. 3 party, Democratic
Action, whose 28-year-old leader, Mario Dumont, is its only
representative in the legislature. Though the party is unlikely to
win many seats, polls suggest that it could capture 10 percent of
the vote, perhaps diverting crucial anti-separatist support from
Charest.

Norris looks to equal Robinson record in Boudouani bout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Terry Norris will look to fight himself into
boxing's record books on Monday by capturing a world title in the
same division for a fifth time.
	   The American fighter, from Lubbock, Texas, will equal the record
of boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson if he can take the WBA super
welterweight crown from defending champion Laurent Boudouani of
France, who is making the fourth defense of the title he won in
1996 with a fifth round knockout of Julio Vasquez.
	   In a distinguished career, 31-year-old Norris has fought no
fewer than 24 world title bouts, and beaten 16 world champions _
including the likes of Sugar Ray Leonard, John Mugabi and Don
Curry.
	   But ``terrible'' Terry (47-8) has been labeled a fading force
since losing his last two fights, to Keith Mullings in December
1997 for the WBC super welterweight crown, and to Dana Rosenblatt
last September for the second-tier IBA title.
	   ``People who think that I am finished will see the truth on
Monday,'' Norris told reporters at a news conference. ``Boudouani
is a good fighter, but I know his style. We will once again see
terrible Terry in action.''
	   Norris is no stranger to France, having defended his WBC title
against Rene Jacquot in Annecy back in 1990, and again versus Jorge
Castro in Paris a year later.
	   His duel with Boudouani (37-1-2) is probably his last shot at a
lucrative payday to cap his long career _ possibly against unbeaten
WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya.
	   ``I have never seen Terry as hungry as he is now,'' his manager
Scott Woodworth told The Associated Press. ``It is not so much
winning a fifth title that is motivating him. He just wants to
prove all his critics wrong.''
	   Boudouani, also 31, has won his two fights this year, both title
defenses against Panama's Guillermo Jones.
	   ``It will be a tough fight of course. We all know about Norris'
titles and his trophies, but he has no chance,'' Boudouani said.
	   ``I will keep the belt,'' the Frenchman said. ``In the ring, he
will just be the sideshow.''

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's Hindu nationalist government may
have been handed a rebuke this week by voters in state legislative
elections, according to vote counting on Saturday.
	   The outcome of Wednesday's elections has no bearing on the
federal government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who
leads the Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   But a serious loss of prestige could stoke infighting in his
shaky 19-party coalition and embolden the opposition Congress Party
to try to unseat him if it wins enough defectors from the ruling
alliance.

Bad weather, world commodity prices push Guyana into slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Bad weather and declining commodity
prices have ended Guyana's seven straight years of robust growth
and slowed the economy, said Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo.
	   Exports have declined and the growth in Gross Domestic Product
is expected to reach 1.8 percent this year, down from original
projections of 3.2 percent, Jagdeo said at a press briefing Friday
evening.
	   Exports of sugar, still the country's principal foreign currency
earner, dropped by 10 percent and timber and other forest products
dropped 23.9 percent, he said.
	   Guyana suffered an extended drought last year that damaged a
variety of crops and was blamed on weather patterns caused by El
Nino.
	   The South American country also relies on exports of gold and
bauxite, and prices for such commodities have been low this year,
in part due to the worldwide economic slowdown.
	   Jagdeo said inflation was 4 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After gaining an extra week to decide whether to
allow the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Spanish charges
including genocide, Britain's government faced continuing pressure
from Chile Saturday to let the former dictator come home.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview. ``These processes are going on and I fully expect they
will result in justice.''
	   Fourteen cases were already pending and Pinochet had no immunity
from prosecution, said Insulza, who was himself an exile during
Pinochet's rule in Chile.
	   The lawsuits pending in Chile were filed mostly by victims of
repression or their relatives, the Communist Party, the National
Association of Journalists, the National Association of Registered
Nurses and the National Federation of School Teachers. All relate
to killings or disappearances.
	   All the suits are being handling by Santiago Judge Juan Guzman,
who has said he plans to question Pinochet in December _ if he
comes home.
	   ``I can assure you that the cases are going to be prosecuted. I
can never say that somebody is going to be condemned until the
trial is over, of course,'' Insulza said at a news conference
Saturday.
	   He added: ``I must remind you that there are several people in
jail in Chile for violations of human rights, condemned for
violations of human rights. So some cases have been opened,
accused, tried and condemned.''
	   On Friday, a magistrate granted a one-week extension _ until
Dec. 11 _ for Home Secretary Jack Straw to decide whether to permit
extradition proceedings to begin.
	   Pinochet, 83, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year rule,
remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he is
recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British police on
Oct. 16.
	   There was fresh evidence of strains in Chile's relations with
Britain. The Ministry of Defense said it has canceled plans for the
frigate HMS Sutherland to appear at a naval fair in the Chilean
port of Valparaiso, and the Foreign Office said it was temporarily
closing its consular office in the city. Four other British
consulates and the embassy in Santiago remain open.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
ordered Pinochet to appear in court on Dec. 11 to hear Straw's
decision, ``subject to any medical reports.''
	   ``There must be time given for proper consideration,'' Parkinson
told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet on Friday.
``It is in some respects quite a historic decision to make.''
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled Wednesday that Pinochet
could not claim immunity as a former head of state.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met Insulza on Friday, said he
assured the Chilean that Pinochet's arrest and subsequent actions
by the British government were not politically motivated, but were
a matter of law.
	   Straw, whose department is responsible for justice issues, has
wide discretion to decide whether to send the Spanish extradition
request through the courts _ or to allow Pinochet to go free.
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew President Salvador Allende. Allende died in
the coup.

	   HAKKARI, Turkey (AP) _ A military helicopter went down in
southeastern Turkey near the Iraqi border, killing 15 soldiers, the
Anatolia news agency reported on Saturday.
	   The Germany based pro-Kurdish DEM news agency said Kurdish
rebels down the helicopter, which it identified as a U.S.-made
Sikorsky, often used for troop transport.
	   Turkish authorities said the helicopter was on a reconnaissance
mission and went down for unknown reasons, Anatolia said.
	   Kurdish rebels, fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey
since 1984, have downed Turkish military helicopters in the past.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will urge
U.S. President Bill Clinton to restore military aid to Pakistan and
end sanctions imposed to punish Pakistan for its nuclear program,
the foreign secretary said Saturday.
	   On Sharif's priority list during next week's meeting with
Clinton in Washington will be the revival of defense cooperation,
access to advanced technology and the promotion of trade and
investment, Shamshad Ahmed told reporters at a briefing in the
capital.
	   Sharif also will be seeking a resolution to the longstanding
dispute over the sale of F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan.
	   Washington blocked the delivery of the aircraft to Pakistan
along with all military aid to Pakistan in 1990 to protest
Islamabad's nuclear program.
	   Ahmed said the cutoff has eroded the country's conventional
defense capabilities, while neighboring India has continued to buy
``sophisticated weapons from all sources (to) disturb the strategic
balance'' in South Asia.
	   ``We would want the U.S. to redress this situation,'' he said.
	   The United States earlier this month eased some sanctions on
Pakistan and India, supporting a one-time International Monetary
Fund deal for Islamabad to salvage its shattered economy.
	   ``Coercion and sanctions are irrelevant to South Asia's security
scenario and certainly cannot serve the interest of
nonproliferation,'' said Ahmed.
	   Sharif's visit to the United States begins on Dec. 2.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Swiss Defense Minister Adolf
Ogi arrived in Sarajevo Saturday to meet local officials, donate
mine-clearing trucks and examine the Bosnian peace process.
	   Ogi is to meet Haris Silajdzic, co-chairman of the Bosnian joint
government and members of the Swiss Headquarters Support Unit,
which helps the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe in its peace efforts in Bosnia.
	   On Saturday, the first of his two-day trip, Ogi opened a
suburban Sarajevo primary school that had been renovated by the
Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
	   Before his departure Sunday, Ogi is to donate 15 trucks for
United Nations land mine clearing efforts, on behalf of the Swiss
government, said OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc.
	   Switzerland has provided money, vehicles and staff to support
mine clearing efforts in Bosnia since 1997.
	   During Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, Switzerland accepted more than
20,000 refugees. Switzerland promotes the safe return of refugees
who fled the conflict.

Clashes erupt as Palestinians demonstrate for prisoner releases

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians held wide-spread demonstrations,
some of which turned violent, throughout the West Bank and east
Jerusalem Saturday calling for the release of relatives and
neighbors in Israeli jails.
	   In east Jerusalem, Israeli police on horse-back charged a crowd
of about 40 Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to prevent them
from marching towards Jerusalem's walled Old City. The protesters
threw stones and empty bottles at police, and police responded with
rubber-coated bullets and tear gas. Several Palestinians and
journalists were injured from being clubbed by police.
	   Police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said that demonstration
organizers had refused police requests to apply for a permit.
Ben-Ruby said that nine police officers were injured and nine
Palestinians were arrested.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted between
Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards an
Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers with stones. Troops
responded with tear gas and rubber-bullets before Palestinian
police arrived on the scene and pushed their citizens back from the
Israeli-controlled area. A group of Palestinians burned one Israeli
flag. There were no injuries reported.
	   In five other Palestinian-controlled cities throughout the West
Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters called on Israel to
set free so-called security prisoners, and lambasted the
Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails.
	   ``We went out in the past to demonstrate against the Israelis to
release our sons, but this time its different. There is an
agreement. We came today to raise our voice to the Palestinian
Authority to get the agreement implemented,'' said Khalid Abu
Mihsin, whose son Jamal was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for
being part of a terror cell behind the murder of an Israeli.
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israel agreed to
release 750 Palestinians in three stages. One week ago, Israel
released the first group which included 150 common criminals,
setting off criticism and disappointment from both the Palestinian
public and officials who had expected the release of Palestinians
held for political or militant activities.
	   ``We didn't spend our time at Wye Plantation discussing the
release of those car thieves and criminals,'' Palestinian Cabinet
Secretary Nabil Shaath said late Friday night. ``We discussed the
release of those who participated in the Palestinian struggle.''
	   A statement released by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office Saturday said that the Palestinians were trying
to create a crisis in the peace talks by making new demands to
which Israel never agreed.
	   Netanyahu said in the statement that no ``artificial crisis''
would change his refusal to release prisoners who committed murder
or militant acts.
	   The prisoner issue is a sensitive one for Palestinians since
most families have had a brother of father arrested at one time or
another during the 30 years of Israeli occupation and had hoped the
peace process with Israel would mean the release of prisoners.
	   A statement from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet,
which met until late Friday, said the issue of prisoner releases
was ``top priority,'' and ``will not be subjected to compromise.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat would
raise the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton when he goes to
Washington next week.
	   At Saturday's demonstrations however, held under the banner ``no
peace without prisoner release,'' most of the anger was lobbed at
Arafat's Palestinian Authority and in some cases, at Erekat
directly.
	   In the city of Nablus, some 250 Palestinian demonstrators
including mothers of prisoners carrying photos of their sons,
chanted, ``Tell Erekat we are fed up with statements.''
	   Similar protests were held in the Gaza Strip last week and
Palestinians said weekly demonstrations would grow until all
prisoners were released.

Bad weather, world commodity prices push Guyana into slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Bad weather and declining commodity
prices have ended Guyana's seven straight years of robust growth
and slowed the economy, the country's finance minister has said.
	   Exports have declined and the growth in Gross Domestic Product
is expected to reach 1.8 percent this year, down from original
projections of 3.2 percent, Bharrat Jagdeo said at a press briefing
Friday evening.
	   Exports of sugar, still the country's principal foreign currency
earner, dropped by 10 percent and timber and other forest products
dropped 23.9 percent, he said.
	   Guyana, an English-speaking country on South America's northern
coast, suffered an extended drought last year that damaged a
variety of crops and was blamed on weather patterns caused by El
Nino.
	   The country also relies on exports of gold and bauxite, and
prices for such commodities have been low this year, in part due to
the worldwide economic slowdown.
	   Jagdeo said inflation was 4 percent.

Italy to invest dlrs 3 billion to reduce carbon dioxide emissions

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will offer financial incentives worth dlrs 3
billion in the next five years to encourage industry to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions, Environmental Minister Edo Ronchi, said
Saturday.
	   Ronchi said the incentives are intended to stimulate even
greater spending by the private sector.
	   He spoke at a national conference on the environment and energy,
unveiling a government plan to coordinate its efforts to cut carbon
dioxide emissions with those of industry, unions, consumer and
environmental groups.
	   At the 1997 worldwide environmental conference in Japan, Italy
agreed to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 by 6.5 percent
from 1990 levels.
	   Ronchi made it clear at the conference that the government will
encourage the use of natural gas. He has already gotten a ``carbon
tax'' through parliament that makes it more attractive as fuel for
power plants by raising taxes on coal and fuel oil.
	   Italy held its last national energy conference in 1987 amid a
heated national debate on nuclear power. A referendum the same year
banned nuclear power in Italy.

Belarus says its ruble to be tied to market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus has revised its currency policies,
creating a system that effectively acknowledges the black market in
hard currency.
	   Under guidelines issued by the National Bank on Friday,
commercial banks will be allowed to buy foreign currency with their
Belarusian rubles between Nov. 28 and Jan. 10 at rates established
on the street.
	   The street rate is slightly lower than the official rate set by
the National Bank.
	   However, banks will be allowed to sell only 5 percent of their
hard currency to Belarusian citizens _ down from 70 percent
previously. Belarusians will have to apply in writing for hard
currency, explaining the reason they need it.
	   The National Bank said the change was an effort to bring more
hard currency into the economy, allowing the state to buy imported
food, medicine and other goods. The government is also interested
in raising its hard currency stocks so it can repay its debts to
Russia.

Barcelona stages spectacular centennial during disappointing
</HEADLINE>
season &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Celebrating one hundred years of soccer
but kicking itself for a disappointing season, FC Barcelona
inaugurated its centennial festivities this weekend amid promises
of future success, nostalgia for past glories and touches of
bitterness.
	   Club chairman Josep Nunez wrote an open letter calling on fans
to put aside their disappointment at last week's elimination from
the European Champions League _ the team's second consecutive exit
in the early stages of Europe's top competition.
	   ``There are league championships every year, but a centennial
only comes once,'' Nunez wrote in the name of one of the world's
most famous soccer teams.
	   The festivities kick off Saturday at the club's historic Camp
Nou stadium _ inaugurated in 1957 with a capacity for 90,000
spectators and later enlarged to hold 120,000 _ prior to
Barcelona's 12th-round Spanish league match against Atletico de
Madrid.
	   The spectacle, designed by the same people who put together the
opening and closing ceremonies of the 1992 Olympics, includes the
projection of historic triumphs onto a giant canvass spread over
the pitch.
	   An editorial in Barcelona-based daily newspaper La Vanguardia
said the celebrations should both ``help to show how relative
fortunes are,'' and ``fire the spirit needed to overcome the
failures.''
	   V.I.P. invites include relatives of the Swiss businessman Joan
Gamper who founded the club in January 1899, Spanish Princess
Cristina and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes.
	   Among the notable absences Johan Cruyff _ coach of the ``dream
team'' that included players such as Romario an Michael Laudrup and
won four consecutive Spanish league titles and Barcelona's only
European Champions' Cup in 1992.
	   Spanish newspapers quoted Cruyff's representative Juame Roures
that the venerated ex-coach and former Dutch star ``was not
invited.''
	   Cruyff, whose reign at Barcelona was followed by a spectacular
season with Ronaldo under Bobby Robson, recently added his weight
to be pressure bearing down on fellow Dutchman and Barcelona's
current coach Louis Van Gaal.
	   Last season, Van Gaal's first, Barcelona made up for its
European disappointments by topping the domestic league and winning
the King's Cup, although traditional rival Real Madrid stole the
limelight by claiming a record seventh European Champions Cup.
	   Barcelona currently lies at No. 3 in the Spanish league with 19
points, one ahead of Madrid at No. 4.
	   But Madrid still has a chance of clinching an eighth Champions
Cup, and doing so at the Camp Nou which was chosen to host the
final.
	   Van Gaal's colorless style has only sharpened criticism of how
the season is panning out for the Catalan superteam that supporters
are fond of describing as ``more than a football club.''
	   Writing in Saturday's edition of leading daily El Pais, novelist
and political commentator Manuel Vazquez Montalban pulled few
punches.
	   ``Barca is still more than just a club, it is also a
disenchantment, a separation, a heart-cooling and an absurdity,''
he wrote.
	   Montalban, like other life-long Barcelona supporters, are also
unhappy about what they fee is Van Gaal's unprecedented reliance on
foreign players.
	   ``Every time I hear the lineup read over the Camp Nou loud
speakers I suddenly feel that someone has switched the stadium and
country and changed my underwear and skin without me realizing
it,'' he wrote.
	   Not that the players, who alienate fans like Montalban, will be
participating in the centennial celebrations, beyond donning a new
vintage-style kit. Van Gaal has banned them from even watching the
fireworks for fear they might lose concentration for the match
against 6th-placed Atletico.

Mayor welcomes Army and hopes for economic boost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The mayor of the south coast town of
Salinas said Saturday he hopes his town's economy will be helped
when the U.S. Army South comes to Puerto Rico.
	   Camp Santiago, a National Guard training area, is located on the
foothills overlooking the Caribbean Sea in Salinas, and the area
will become busier once the Army South relocates, said Mayor
Basilio Baerga.
	   About 800 soldiers and civilians will be based in Puerto Rico
once the unit makes its move from Panama. They will be based at
Fort Buchanan in the San Juan area, where the Army is spending dlrs
36 million to renovate and expand buildings.
	   But Baerga said in a radio interview Saturday that he expects
his town to get spillover benefits from training activities.
	   ``That is my opinion and that of the business people who are
awaiting the arrival of the Army South,'' said Baerga.
	   Baerga said he disagrees with pro-independence factions in
Puerto Rico who would like to remove all military installations
from the island.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
ruling party and military rebels have agreed to form a ``government
of national unity,'' news reports said.
	   The formation of the new government in this small west African
country is in line with the terms of a peace agreement signed Nov.
2 by President Jose Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane
Mane ending five months of civil war.
	   It was not clear when the new cabinet _ made up of 10 ministers
and 7 secretaries of state _ would take office, or who would head
it, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported late Friday.
	   Previous reports had expected that Vieira, who has governed the
tiny former Portuguese colony for 18 years, would take charge.
	   But this now appears unlikely after a no-confidence motion
against him was approved earlier Friday by an overwhelming majority
of the National Popular Assembly, Guinea-Bissau's parliament.
	   A Nigerian-led regional force is due to arrive in the former
Portuguese colony later this month to oversee implementation of the
peace pact that also calls for presidential elections no later than
March.

OPEC's head calls for a cutback of 1.5 million barrels a day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ OPEC member states should reduce their
production by up to 1.5 million barrels a day in order to boost oil
prices, the cartel's new president said in remarks published
Saturday.
	   ``We don't have the right to let oil prices deteriorate to dlrs
10 a barrel. This is not acceptable and is not in the interest of
our countries' economies,'' Youcef Yousfi told the leading Arabic
newspaper, Al-Hayat.
	   Oil prices have fallen steadily since last year and hit historic
lows in London and New York last week.
	   Speaking in Vienna, where the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries elected him as its president on Thursday,
Yousfi said the state of the market demanded immediate action.
	   ``Everybody knows there is a huge surplus in oil markets and, in
order to reach a balance in this market, we should withdraw one
million to 1.5 million barrels a day,'' Yousfi told the
London-based newspaper.
	   ``This reduction should take place as soon as possible.''
	   Yousfi, who is Algeria's oil minister, said his country believed
that OPEC heads of states should hold a summit to decide on a
long-term strategy because ``these problems can only be solved on
the political level.''
	   ``We've found a supportive response to our bid for a political
solution,'' Yousfi said, adding that if an OPEC summit cannot be
arranged, the cartel should meet at foreign minister level.
	   OPEC has agreed to two production cutbacks since prices began
falling last year, but the downward slide has continued.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter of 1998 has
been dlrs 12.33, a substantial fall from the average price of dlrs
18.03 in the third quarter of 1997.
	   OPEC members produce a total of 26.9 million barrels a day. They
are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
ruling party and military rebels are reportedly preparing to form a
government of national unity.
	   It was not clear when the new 17-member cabinet would take
office, or who would head it, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported late Friday.
	   The formation of the new government in this small west African
country is in line with the terms of a peace agreement signed Nov.
2 by President Jose Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane
Mane, ending five months of civil war.
	   Previous reports had expected that Vieira, who has governed the
tiny former Portuguese colony for 18 years, would take charge.
	   This now appears unlikely after a no-confidence motion against
him was approved earlier Friday by an overwhelming majority of the
National Popular Assembly, Guinea-Bissau's parliament.
	   A Nigerian-led regional force is due to arrive in the former
Portuguese colony later this month to oversee implementation of the
peace pact that also calls for presidential elections no later than
March.

OPEC's head calls for a cutback of 1.5 million barrels a day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to CLARIFY that cutback figure is collective

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ OPEC member states should reduce their
combined production by up to 1.5 million barrels a day in order to
boost oil prices, the cartel's new president said in remarks
published Saturday.
	   ``We don't have the right to let oil prices deteriorate to dlrs
10 a barrel. This is not acceptable and is not in the interest of
our countries' economies,'' Youcef Yousfi told the leading Arabic
newspaper, Al-Hayat.
	   Oil prices have fallen steadily since last year and hit historic
lows in London and New York last week.
	   Speaking in Vienna, where the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries elected him as its president on Thursday,
Yousfi said the state of the market demanded immediate action.
	   ``Everybody knows there is a huge surplus in oil markets and, in
order to reach a balance in this market, we should withdraw one
million to 1.5 million barrels a day,'' Yousfi told the
London-based newspaper.
	   ``This reduction should take place as soon as possible.''
	   Yousfi, who is Algeria's oil minister, said his country believed
that OPEC heads of states should hold a summit to decide on a
long-term strategy because ``these problems can only be solved on
the political level.''
	   ``We've found a supportive response to our bid for a political
solution,'' Yousfi said, adding that if an OPEC summit cannot be
arranged, the cartel should meet at foreign minister level.
	   OPEC has agreed to two production cutbacks since prices began
falling last year, but the downward slide has continued.
	   OPEC's average price per barrel in the third quarter of 1998 has
been dlrs 12.33, a substantial fall from the average price of dlrs
18.03 in the third quarter of 1997.
	   OPEC members produce a total of 26.9 million barrels a day. They

Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Zimbabwean Price trails one shot behind the leader in home tourney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ South African Hennie Walters, aided by a
practice putting contraption, led defending champion Nick Price and
two other players by one shot Saturday in the Zimbabwe Open golf
championship.
	   ``I have a plastic-and-metal putting aid which forces the putter
in practice to travel along a fixed groove so as to make you repeat
the stroke exactly. It certainly worked for me today,'' said
Walters after posting a third-round lead of 207.
	   Price shot a one under par 71 for a total of 208. He struggled
to find some sparkle in front of his expectant home country fans,
managing just three birdies but also dropping two shots.
	   Price's 54 holes score is matched by Darren Fitchardt and Tjaart
van der Walt, both of South Africa.
	   Another South African, Andrew McLardy, is on 210, three strokes
back, while Price's main Zimbabwe rivals Tony Johnstone, on 211,
and Mark McNulty, on 212, have outside chances of snatching the
title.
	   However, another Zimbabwean, Marc Cayeux, who won the Zambia
Open last week, has also moved into the picture. Beginning the
tournament with a 77, he followed up with a 68 and then 67 for a
212 score.
	   The course record of 66 was equalled Saturday by three players,
Canada's Doug McGuigan, Richard Fulford of South Africa and
McLardy. These six under par scores moved them all into contention,
with McGuigan on 212 and Fulford on 213.
	   Although not at his best in the third round, Price still has a
good chance Sunday to win his third Zimbabwe Open in four years and
become the first player to successfully defend the title.
	   Such is Price's magnetism and stature here that the organizers
moved up Sunday's play by 40 minutes at his request so that he can
immediately fly to a new course called Leopard Creek on the edge of
Kruger Park, South Africa's biggest wildlife sanctuary, where he
will play a charity singles match Monday against Ernie Els.

Mountie loses leg after shootout with gunman who kills himself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A Royal Canadian Mounted
Police officer had her right leg amputated after she was wounded in
a shootout with a man who later killed himself, police said
Saturday.
	   The wounded 27-year-old woman was among three officers
dispatched to a townhouse near Vancouver on Friday to investigate a
report of alleged sex offenses.
	   After she was shot, she was rushed to Vancouver General
Hospital, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her leg. Other
officers surrounded the townhouse, waiting for the gunman to
surrender.
	   Late Friday, officers heard a single gunshot. They entered the
building two hours later and found the lone male occupant dead of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Sgt. Russ Grabb.
	   Names of the dead man and the wounded officer were being
withheld until their families could be notified, Grabb said.

Eales kicks Australia to 12-11 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TWICKENHAM, England (AP) _ John Eales kicked four huge
penalties, including the matchwinner from 46 meters three minutes
from the end, to guide Australia to a 12-11 victory over England at
Twickenham Saturday.
	   England was leading 11-9 after Jeremy Guscott's lone try of the
match when the home forwards were penalized at a ruck and lock
forward Eales, who also kicked four second half penalties to clinch
the Wallabies win against France last week, found the distance from
almost the half way line.
	   It was a tight finish to a closely fought match before 75,000
fans at Twickenham in which England performed far better than in
their 76-0 loss to the Wallabies in Australia in June.
	   A fifth minute penalty by Eales gave the Wallabies a 3-0 lead
with a huge kick from 44 meters after England scrum half Matt
Dawson was penalized at a scrum. The lock forward should have
doubled the lead three minutes later but sliced his kick from the
left wing.
	   After Paul Grayson had kicked a penalty wide the Northampton fly
half limped off with a knee injury in the 33rd minute and was
replaced by Bath's Mike Catt.
	   It was Catt who leveled in the final minute of the first half
when Patricio Noriega was penalized for fighting and the
replacement fly half made it 3-3 at the interval.
	   He kicked another penalty nine minutes into the second half
after the Australian forwards were penalized for illegally
preventing an English try.
	   The Wallabies then produced a spell of pressure that failed to
produce a try but gained another penalty.
	   Winger Joe Roff made a break off a pass by Daniel Herbert to
take the Wallabies to England's line. Austin Healey stopped the
move with a tackle, but the Australians maintained the pressure.
	   Noriega halted Jason Leonard just short but when England captain
Lawrence Dallaglio was penalized in a ruck, Eales kicked the
penalty to make it 6-6 in the 55th minute.
	   He regained the lead with another 40-meter penalty in the 69th
minute but England then came up with the only try of the game by
Guscott a minute later.
	   Healey and Catt combined to put fullback Matt Perry away through
the middle. The ball was laid up and Dawson and Catt slipped the
ball to Guscott who scored 23rd test try. Catt hooked the
conversion but England led 11-9 with 10 minutes to go.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ Matt Perry; Tony Underwood, Phil de Glanville, Jeremy
Guscott, Austin Healey; Paul Grayson, Matt Dawson; Darren Garforth,
Richard Cockerill, Jason Leonard, Martin Johnson, Tim Rodber,
Lawrence Dallaglio (capt) Richard Hill, Neil Back.
	   Australia _ Chris Latham; Jason Little, Daniel Herbert, Nathan
Grey, Joe Roff; Stephen Larkham, George Gregan; Andrew Blades, Phil
Kearns, Particio Noriega, John Eales (capt), Tom Bowman, Matt
Cockbain, David Wilson, Toutai Kefu.
	   Referee _ Paul Honis, New Zealand.

	   ALTENBERG, Germany (AP) _ Olympic silver medalist Barbara
Niedernhuber shattered the Altenberg course record Saturday and led
a German sweep of the first four places in women's singles at the
luge World Cup race.
	   Niedernhuber blazed to a new record of 53.858 seconds in her

by almost a second. She won in a combined time of one minute 47.823

	   "This is a puzzle to me," said Niedernhuber, who won her second
career world cup race. "In the past, I've always been the first to
crash at this course."
	   In the doubles, the American men couldn't repeat their feat in
the last world cup at Igls, Austria where they grabbed the top two
spots.
	   Tobias and Markus Schiegl of Austria swept first in 1:25.322 on
the same course where the cousins captured the 1996 World
Championships.
	   Italians Gerhard Plankensteiner and Oswald Haselrieder were
second in 1:25.428 while Americans Gordy Scheer and Chris Thorpe,
the Olympic silver medalists settled for a bronze in 1:25.431.
	   The U.S. junior world champions, Chris Niccum and Matt McLain,
finished fourth but remained first in the overall standings. The

German talks near concluded on compensation fund for Nazi slave
</HEADLINE>
laborers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Talks on establishing a compensation
fund for former Nazi slave laborers are near completion between
government and industry leaders, a news magazine reported Saturday.
	   U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum and Israeli Ambassador Avi Primor
are helping negotiate the industry-wide fund which will be
administered by the government, according to Der Spiegel.
	   Before taking office in October, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government decided to establish a fund to settle back-wage claims
and lawsuits from concentration camp inmates forced to work for
German companies during World War II.
	   Slave laborers have not been eligible for back wages under
postwar German laws on reparations for Nazi victims. Estimates on
the number of slave laborers run as high as 9 million, many of them
Jews from eastern Europe.
	   Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, will spend the early
weeks of December meeting with companies to determine how much they
will contribute to the fund, the magazine reported. Among those
participating are Allianz insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche
banks, DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, Degussa
and BASF.
	   Opposing the fund are former slave laborers who have called on
the German government to recognize their right to settle their
claims individually or on a class-action basis. A group has filed a
New York lawsuit seeking a portion of company profits.

Turks demonstrate in favor of Kurdish rebel leader's extradition

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ More than 15,000 Turks demonstrated in several
German cities Saturday urging Italy to extradite a Kurdish rebel
leader to face trial in Turkey on charges of murder and terrorism.
	   Protest marches in Berlin, Bonn, Munich and Nuremberg came one
day after Germany and Italy agreed to push for establishing an
international court to hear charges against Abdullah Ocalan, whose
outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, has fought a 14-year war
for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.
	   Ocalan's fate has been a subject of debate since police arrested
him Nov. 12 in Italy on arrival aboard a flight from Moscow. A Rome
court freed him Nov. 20, rejecting a Turkish warrant because
Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where
they face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan also faces murder and terror charges in Germany, which
does not have the death penalty, but Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on Friday ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of Kurdish
unrest.
	   About one-fifth of Germany's 2 million Turkish residents are
Kurds, and Germany has seen numerous protests since Ocalan's arrest
_ Turks demanding his extradition to Turkey and Kurds demanding his
freedom. About 11,000 Kurds protested in Bonn on Friday as
Schroeder met with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer met with D'Alema in Rome on
Saturday, presumably to discuss Ocalan's case.
	   The Kurdish leader, who has requested asylum in Italy, is now
under police surveillance at a Rome villa. Judges ordered him to
stay in Rome until Dec. 23 while Germany decided whether to seek
extradition. What happens next depends on his asylum request and on
the establishment of an international court.
	   Turkish protests Saturday were peaceful. Police estimated about
6,500 protesters in Munich; 5,000 in Nuremberg; and 3,500 in both
Berlin and Bonn.

Russian Timochenko wins ladies junior title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Daria Timochenko took the gold medal in
the ladies skating program Saturday at the World Junior Figure
Skating Championships.
	   Timochenko, 18, was followed by 13-year-old American junior
national's champion, Sarah Hughes of Kings Point, N.Y., and
compatriot Viktoria Volchokova.
	   The victory was Timochenko's best personal result following two
second finishes on the junior Grand Prix circuit and a silver in
the Russian national's.
	   Although a bit shaky in her landings, Timochenko, a second-year
student of physical education at Moscow University, impressed the
panel of judges with a triple lutz, double toe-loop routine among
other combinations, earning a score of 5.3 to 5.6 for technical
merit and 5.3 to 5.7 for artistry.
	   She led a Russian sweep of five medals of a possible 12 in the
championships, including two golds.
	   Russians have dominated ice skating in the last six years, with
skaters like Ilia Kulik, Alexei Yagudin, Irina Slutskaja and Julia
Soldatova. They have claimed 14 of a possible 24 gold medals since
1994.
	   In the mens competition, Ilia Klimkin, 18, the latest rising
Russian star overshadowed his rivals with a daring quadruple triple
toe-loop, triple toe-combination among other stunts in his
repertoire, to take the men's title.
	   Jamie Silverstein, 14, and Justin Pekarek, 17, sparkled in the
ice dance to win gold, while reigning champions, Yulia Obertas and
Dmitry Palamarchuk of Ukraine, maintained their form to defend the
title in the pairs.

Russia, Norway agree to restrict overfishing in Barents Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Norway have agreed to work toward
restricting overfishing in the Barents Sea, a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   A joint commission of the two countries has agreed on a quota of
540,000 tons of cod to be taken from the arctic sea in 1999, the
head of Russia's State Fishing Committee, Vladimir Izmailov, told
the Interfax news agency.
	   He said a meeting would be held with Icelandic officials next
week regarding Iceland's role. Izmailov charged that Icelandic
fishing crews have ignored fishing regulations in the open waters
of the Barents Sea in recent years.
	   He said Russia and Norway are prepared to allow quotas to
Iceland for catching cod in their economic zones.

Italy to invest dlrs 3 billion to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy will offer financial incentives worth dlrs 3
billion in the next five years to encourage industry to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions, Environmental Minister Edo Ronchi, said
Saturday.
	   Ronchi said the incentives are intended to stimulate even
greater spending by the private sector.
	   He spoke at a national conference on the environment and energy,
unveiling a government plan to coordinate its efforts to cut carbon
dioxide emissions with those of industry, unions, consumer and
environmental groups.
	   The environmental group Greenpeace was critical of the plan,
saying it relied too heavily on voluntary cuts in emissions and
virtually ignored energy sources like solar.

Springboks win 27-13 to tie All Blacks victory record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ South Africa tied New Zealand's record of
17 wins in a row by beating Ireland 27-13 Saturday but was given a
tough battle by an Irish team who were far from outclassed by the
world champion.
	   Bobby Skinstad crossed for a try and two minutes later set up
another for scrum half Joost van der Westhuizen early in the second
half as the Springboks, helped by the accurate kicking of fullback
Percy Montgomery, quickly turned a 7-6 half time advantage to 24-6.
	   The Irish hit back with a Keith Wood try and twice went close to
crossing the Springbok line again but were kept out by some superb
defending.
	   The South Africans aim to set a new record of successive
victories by beating England at Twickenham on Saturday. Already on
this tour, they have beaten Wales and Scotland and their last
defeat was in August last year when they went went down 55-35 to
New Zealand.
	   The two teams and the 48,000 fans at Lansdowne Road stood for a
minute's silence before the game as a mark of a respect to the
victims of the bombing at Omagh, Northern Ireland, where 29 people
were killed in August.
	   Irish fly half Eric Elwood missed two straightforward penalties
but finally got one right from 27 meters to give Ireland a 3-0 lead
after 16 minutes.
	   The Springboks had barely been out of their own half but broke
out to score a a try in the 28th minute.
	   Irish winger Justin Bishop was caught in possession on the
right, winger Pieter Roussow robbed him of the ball, passed inside
scrum-half style and Johan Erasmus was well placed to dart through
a huge gap in the Irish defense to run 30 meters for the try. Percy
Montgomery kicked the conversion and the South Africans led 7-3.
	   Elwood reduced the lead to a point with a simple 28 meter
penalty five minutes later and had the chance to give the Irish a
half time lead in first half injury when the South Africans were
guilty of killing the play. But his angled kick just missed the
right hand post and South Africa led 7-6 at the break.
	   Montgomery kicked a close range penalty to stretch the lead to
10-6 three minutes into the second half before the speedy back
rower Skinstad scored his try.
	   After the South Africans had won clean ball at a lineout,
fly-half Henry Honiball sucked in three tacklers with a determined
run and Skinstad weaved through a gap in the defense for the try.
Montgomery's conversion made it 17-6.
	   Two minutes later Skinstad's pace got him clear again, he passed
to Honiball and the ball was switched on to Van der Westhuizen who
crossed for the try. Montgomery stretched the lead to 24-6 before
the Irish hit back.
	   Ireland's experienced hooker Wood took a pass from scrum half
Conor McGuinness, shrugged off tackle from Robbie Kempson and
barged his way over for his third try in Irish colors. Elwood's
conversion cut the lead to 24-13
	   Montgomery's fifth successful kick made it 27-13 to complete the
record-tying victory for the Springboks.
	   Lineups:
	   Ireland _ Conor O'Shea; Justin Bishop, Jonathan Bell, Kevin
Maggs, Girvan Dempsey; Eric Elwood, Conor McGuinness; Peter
Clohessy, Keith Wood, Justin, Malcolm O'Kelly, Paddy Johns,
Fitzpatrick, Victor Costello, Andy Ward, Dion O'Cuinneagain.
	   South Africa _ Percy Montgomery; Stefan Terblanche, Andre
Snyman, Christian Stewart, Pieter Rossouw; Henry Honiball, Joost
van der Westhuizen; Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robbie Kempson,

KLA first anniversary marked with memorial, swearing in ceremony

	    &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   LAUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A memorial service Saturday for a
teacher killed by Serb police a year ago and a swearing-in ceremony
for new recruits to Kosovo Liberation Army marked the anniversary
of the rebels' first public appearance.
	   Hundreds of KLA members attended a memorial service in Lausa,
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina, for Halit
Geci, a school teacher killed last November by Serb security forces
as he sat in his classroom.
	   Three uniformed members of the KLA appeared at his funeral on
Nov. 28 last year _ the first time they had appeared in public.
	   ``That night we decided to fight until the last Serb leaves and
until we are independent,'' said Shaban Muslem, a KLA commander,
during his speech at the ceremony. ``Our only weapons were our
morale and our will,'' he added, while a crowd of several hundred
people chanted the name of the rebel army.
	   ``After some months, the KLA were all around Kosovo,'' Muslem
said. ``The war had started. For the first time, the Serbs saw they
would have to fight to keep Kosovo.''
	   Clashes that began in February following a Serb crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo have claimed hundreds of
lives and forced more than 300,000 people from their homes. Ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
	   The Serb security forces quickly and soundly put down the KLA
rebellion this summer, but since the cease-fire in October, the
guerrillas have been boldly returning to some areas from which they
had been driven.
	   Children from Geci's school recited poems in his honor and later
accompanied his daughter, Valbona, 19, and his nephew Driton Geci,
as they lay a wreath of plastic flowers at his grave on the
outskirts of Lausa.
	   About 100 KLA fighters stood at attention facing the grave for a
minute's silence.
	   In the nearby village of Prekaz, around 300 new recruits swore
their allegiance to the KLA in the shadow of the Albanian flag _ a
double-headed eagle on a red background.
	   The recruits, most of whom were middle-aged, swore to fight
``for the freedom of occupied Albanian lands, for unity of the
lands.''
	   ``I will always be a faithful soldier, a soldier of freedom, of
vigilance, brave and disciplined,'' they said in unison.
	   A large crowd of civilians who had gathered to watch the
ceremony erupted in spontaneous applause at the arrival of a column
of KLA special forces in black uniforms.
	   The special forces were renamed the Adem Jashari unit, after the
local KLA leader who was killed along with another 27 members of
his family by Serb authorities last March.
	   Saturday would have been his 43rd birthday, villagers said.
	   His daughter, wearing a KLA camouflage uniform, cried as the
assembled crowd held one minute's silence in memory of her
relatives.
	   ``On behalf of my family and my name, those who were killed and
those who are alive, I congratulate you on the oath that you gave
to the KLA on this day of the flag,'' she said, addressing the
rebel group's new members. ``I am the daughter of brave Kosovo.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Egypt have begun a week-long
joint naval exercise aimed at strengthening military ties between
the two Mediterranean countries, defense officials here said
Saturday.
	   Two frigates from each country and other smaller vessels are
participating in the exercises which began Friday off the Egyptian
port of Alexandria.
	   The ``Alexandria 98'' maneuvers are part of a defense pact
signed between the two countries when Defense Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos visited Cairo earlier year.
	   Greece has expressed concern over expanding military cooperation
between Israel and its traditional rival Turkey. Egypt and Syria
have also appeared wary of this cooperation.

Russian Timochenko wins ladies junior title

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Daria Timochenko took the gold medal in
the ladies skating program Saturday at the World Junior Figure
Skating Championships.
	   Timochenko, 18, was followed by 13-year-old American junior
national's champion, Sarah Hughes of Kings Point, N.Y., and
compatriot Viktoria Volchokova.
	   The victory was Timochenko's best personal result following two
second finishes on the junior Grand Prix circuit and a silver in
the Russian national's.
	   Although a bit shaky in her landings, Timochenko, a second-year
student of physical education at Moscow University, impressed the
panel of judges with a triple lutz, double toe-loop routine among
other combinations, earning a score of 5.3 to 5.6 for technical
merit and 5.3 to 5.7 for artistry.
	   She led a Russian sweep of five medals of a possible 12 in the
championships, including two golds.
	   Russians have dominated ice skating in the last six years, with
skaters like Ilia Kulik, Alexei Yagudin, Irina Slutskaja and Julia
Soldatova. They have claimed 14 of a possible 24 gold medals since
1994.
	   In the mens competition, Ilia Klimkin, 18, the latest rising
Russian star overshadowed his rivals with a daring quadruple triple
toe-loop combination among other stunts in his repertoire, to take
the men's title.
	   Jamie Silverstein, 14, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. and Justin
Pekarek, 17, of Southfield, Mich., sparkled in the ice dance to win
gold, while reigning champions, Yulia Obertas and Dmitry
Palamarchuk of Ukraine, maintained their form to defend the title
in the pairs.

At frontline, Congolese rebels say war goes on despite truce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With France-Africa Summit; Congo-Rebel Trials &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ Rebel troops on the frontline of a
Congolese government counteroffensive know little about a
cease-fire agreement reached in Paris between the government and
the rebels' foreign backers _ and say they care even less.
	   Standing on a bridge straddling the brown waters of the Congo
River, rebel commander Gabriel said he had heard that President
Laurent Kabila had agreed to the ceasefire only through news
reports.
	   ``Rwandans and Ugandans can agree upon whatever they want, but I
am a Congolese and I have a war to fight,'' Gabriel, who only uses
his first name, said of his erstwhile backers. ``We have started
this war to kick Kabila out. We shall finish it.'
	   French President Jacques Chirac announced that Rwanda, Uganda
and Congo had reached a consensus to stop the four-month war in a
cease-fire brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the end
of a summit of African leaders in Paris.
	   Rebel leaders, who did not take part in the summit, were not
signatories. One rebel leader, Arthur Ngoma, had been scheduled to
attend the summit as an observer, but he was unavailable for
comment.
	   Rebel leaders have urged Kabila to directly negotiate with them,
something the Congolese president has been refusing since Aug. 2
when minority Tutsis, disenchanted members of his army and
opposition politicians took up arms.
	   They have been backed in arms, troops and equipment by their
allies in Rwanda and Uganda, who accuse Kabila of enlisting in war
thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan insurgents.
	   Previous efforts by African diplomats to broker a cease-fire
have failed over Kabila's refusal to negotiate with them, and more
recently, rebel obstacles to African peace proposals.
	   Rebel leaders were planning to attend another round of peace
talks sponsored by the Southern Africa Development Community in
Pretoria next month.
	   Kabila has refused to attend those talks in the past, demanded
that Rwanda and Uganda first withdraw from Congo, something both
countries have ruled out without a prior peace agreement and
security guarantees for their borders.
	   In Kabalo, a front-line town deep in tropical forest 300
kilometers (185 miles) south of the rebel eastern stronghold at
Goma, pro-Kabila Zimbabwean jet fighters striking at towns and
rebel army convoys had brought rebel advances to a halt.
	   Apart from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad are also propping
up Kabila.
	   At the Nzofu Bridge over the Congo, 14 kilometers (8 miles) west
of Kabalo, guns fell silent on Saturday. But Gabriel, the rebel
commander, said Zimbabweans had been seen regrouping on the other
side and he expected more fighting to follow.
	   ``We are fighting against Kabila's mismanagement, corruption and
tribalism. This war will end up in (capital) Kinshasa,'' he said.

West Ham takes second; Ferguson scores twice for new club

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After years of fighting relegation, West Ham moved
into second place in the Premier League Saturday with a 2-1 home
win over Tottenham on two early goals by Trevor Sinclair.
	   If West Ham was the team of the day, Duncan Ferguson was the
player of the day.
	   In his first match with Newcastle after a 7-million pound (dlrs
11.5 million) transfer from Everton, the big Scot scored twice at
St. James' Park in a 3-1 come-from behind win over Wimbledon.
	   Both matches overshadowed Aston Villa's 2-2 draw at Nottingham
Forest, which kept Villa atop the league with 29 points to 26 for
West Ham.
	   Chelsea held fourth (24 points) with a disappointing 1-1 home
draw with Sheffield Wednesday. Chelsea equaled a club record of 19
games without a loss.
	   The places behind Villa could change Sunday with third-place
Manchester (25 points) at home to Leeds and No. 5 Arsenal (24
points) hosting Middlesbrough. In Sunday's other match, last-place
Blackburn played at Liverpool.
	   In other Saturday Premier League games: Charlton 1, Everton 2;
Coventry 1, Leicester 1; Southampton 0, Derby 1.
	   Even it was just for a day, West Ham coach Harry Redknapp was
savoring the moment as his east London club has picked up 13 points
in its last five matches.
	   ``Well, it's a good start for us,'' he said. ``There's still a
long way to go, but it's a measure of how far we've come in the
last couple of years.''
	   In England's first division, first-place Sunderland bounced back
from its first loss of the season, thrashing Sheffield United 4-0.
Sunderland leads with 43 points. Ipswich moved into second with 38
points following a 3-0 win over Crewe.
	   In Scotland's Premier League, Kilmarnock defeated Dumfermline
3-0 to move up to 28 points behind leading Rangers (30 points).
Celtic is third with 26 points after a 2-0 win over Motherwell. In
the day's other Premier League match, Dundee United beat Aberdeen
3-0.
	   Rangers played Sunday against St. Johnstone at Celtic Park in
the League Cup final.

Turkey presses ahead with extradition bid for Kurdish rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Turkey pressed stubbornly ahead Saturday with its
campaign to get Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader,
dispatching a thick file full of graphic material on his alleged
crimes to Rome.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan because he could
face death penalty in Turkey. Despite this, Turkish Ambassador Inal
Batu said a formal extradition request would be made to the Italian
government in the next few days.
	   He said the file on Ocalan includes around 900 pages of material
describing in detail the rebel leader's alleged crimes, along with
what he indicated were gruesome photographs and videos. ``It's not
something I'd advise minors under 18 to see,'' Batu told the
Italian news agency ANSA.
	   Germany also has arrest warrants for Ocalan on charges of murder
and arson, but doesn't want him because it fears unrest among its
immigrant population. About one-fifth of Germany's 2 million
Turkish residents are Kurds. The Turks want him extradited to
Turkey, while the Kurds are demanding his freedom.
	   On Saturday, more than 15,000 Turks demonstrated peacefully in
the German cities of Berlin, Bonn, Munich and Nuremberg, urging
Italy to extradite Ocalan. A day earlier, around 11,000 Kurds
demonstrated in Bonn when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.
	   Schroeder made it clear Germany wouldn't ask for Ocalan's
extradition.
	   Germany and Italy now hope to extricate Europe from growing
Kurdish-Turkish tension by arranging for an international court to
try Ocalan.
	   Turkey is vehemently opposed to the idea.
	   ``This is a legal scandal,'' Turkish Justice Minister Hasan
Denizkurdu said Saturday in Ankara, vowing that Turkey ``will never
allow the issue to be taken to an international arena.''
	   Ocalan has asked Italy for political asylum in Italy and is now
living in a heavily guarded villa on the outskirts of Rome.
	   An Italian court ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to
give Germany more time to ponder extradition. What happens next
depends on his asylum request and whether the idea of an
international court goes anywhere.
	   Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, and his Italian
counterpart, Lamberto Dini, discussed the Ocalan case for several
hours in Rome on Saturday along with teams of legal experts.
	   In a statement, they said Italy and Germany were working
together to see ``that Ocalan is brought to justice'' and to seek a
negotiated end to the Kurdish conflict.
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting for
Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984 in a war that
has killed 37,000 and devastated the region. The Turkish government
has always refused to negotiate with the PKK.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a
flight from Moscow. He has renounced armed struggle since his
arrival, but the war continues.
	   On Saturday, the rebels claimed they downed a Turkish troop
transport helicopter. Turkish officials said 15 soldiers died when
the helicopter crashed for unknown reasons.

Report: Former Nazi agents soon to face charges in Stuttgart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Acting on new information from Polish
investigators, German prosecutors will soon bring charges against
two former Nazi officials, a news magazine reported Saturday.
	   A former Gestapo official in Katowice, Poland, will be charged
in connection with sentencing 1,000 Nazi prisoners to death by
hanging, according to Der Spiegel.
	   Another former Nazi officer will be charged with shooting to
death seven prisoners in the Therisienstadt concentration camp
during the last days of the war.
	   Both men will be charged in Stuttgart, the report said.
Stuttgart prosecutors earlier this week charged a 79-year-old
former Gestapo agent in connection with the deaths of 17,000
people, mostly Jews at the Majdanek concentration camp.
	   The suspect, identified as Alfons Goetzfrid, remains under
investigation in connection with 45,000 other killings near
Lemberg, in present-day Ukraine, and near Lublin, Poland.
	   Charges against Goetzfrid, as well as the expected charges
against the two others, stem from Polish investigators who have
filed 10 new cases with German authorities in the past six months,
Die Spiegel reported. The Hamburg-based magazine said about 100
cases remain under investigation in Poland.

Corretja upsets Sampras, Moya beats Henman to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Corretja beating Sampras &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Alex Corretja saved three match points
and overcame an error-filled performance by top-ranked Pete Sampras
on Saturday to set up a historic all-Spanish final at the ATP Tour
World Championship against Carlos Moya.
	   Corretja, No. 6 in the world, rallied to upset Sampras 4-6, 6-3,
7-6 (7-3).
	   Sampras, who is assured of holding to No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year, had 50 unforced errors in the match that lasted
two hours and eight minutes. Corretja had only 19.
	   Moya beat Tim Henman 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 earlier Saturday.
	   Sampras hit a sizzling backhand to break Corretja's serve for a
3-2 lead. The American fired two aces in the next game to ward off
two break points and cruised through the remainder of the set.
	   But Sampras started making more and more uncharacteristic
unforced errors and Corretja took advantage to break serve for a
3-1 lead in the second. Two consecutive forehand errors by Sampras
gave the set to Corretja.
	   Corretja began the third set by breaking Sampras' serve, only to
see Sampras take some risky shots to return the favor in the next
game.
	   The Spaniard saved three match points to send the match into the
decisive tiebreaker.
	   All three were long rallies and all three went Corretja's way,
one on his winner, two on errors by Sampras. Sampras dived for a
volley on the last one, but it went wide.
	   In the tiebreaker, Corretja rolled to a 6-1 lead, wasted two
match points, but Sampras then sent a backhand return into the net.
	   Sampras, the two-time defending champion in the dlrs 3.5 million
tournament, did not drop a set in three round-robin matches. He was
seeking his fifth title in the event.
	   Sampras accomplished his main goal of the year _ holding the No.
1 for the sixth consecutive year _ when Marcelo Rios dropped out
Thursday because of a back injury. That ruined Rios' hopes of
challenging Sampras for the No. 1.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, turned the match in the middle
of the third set, when he broke Henman's serve to tie the score at
3-3.
	   ``I played one of my best matches on indoor surfaces,'' Moya
said, adding that this was probably one his best three matches all
year.
	   Two Spaniards have never played in a final before in this
tournament. The last Spanish finalist was Manuel Orantes, who also
won what was then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston.
	   ``I said when I came here that I wanted to win this
tournament,'' Moya said. ``Nobody believed me. Now it's just one
step away from me. I hope you realize when I talk, I'm not joking
at all.''
	   Although not known for his prowess on indoor courts, Moya
reached the semifinals of the championship last year in his first
appearance in the tournament and now has advanced to his first
final.
	   Ranked No. 4 in the world, Moya broke Henman's service in the
seventh game and that allowed him to take the first set.
	   Henman, who will move up two spots to a career-high ranking of
No. 7 in final season rankings that come out Monday, broke Moya's
serve for the first time for a 2-0 lead in the second set.
	   The first Briton to reach the semifinals of the event, Henman
survived a scare in the seventh game, when he saved four break
points. He held serve to win the set and tie the score.
	   Henman broke Moya's serve again at the start of the decisive
set. But Moya pulled back in the sixth game and fought off three
more break points in his next two service games.
	   With Henman serving to stay in the match, Moya whipped a
backhand passing shot to gain a match point. He hit a tremendous
return winner past Henman to clinch the match after two hours and
20 minutes.
	   ``He definitely raised his game in those games that he broke me
at 3-2 and at the end,'' Henman said. ``He came up with some great
shots.''
	   Moya advanced to his fourth final of the year, the first not on
clay. He also won the Monte Carlo tournament.
	   ``I played amazingly today, I had to take risks. I had to hit as
hard as I can to pass him,'' Moya said.

Clashes erupt as Palestinians demonstrate for prisoner releases

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians held wide-spread demonstrations,
some of which turned violent, throughout the West Bank and east
Jerusalem Saturday calling for the release of relatives and
neighbors in Israeli jails.
	   In east Jerusalem, Israeli police on horse-back charged a crowd
of about 40 Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to prevent them
from marching towards Jerusalem's walled Old City.
	   The protesters threw stones and empty bottles at police, and
police responded with rubber-coated bullets and tear gas. Several
Palestinians and journalists were injured from being clubbed by
police.
	   Police officers fired live bullets into the air to extricate
themselves from a group of demonstrators that surrounded them,
police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said. Ben-Ruby said that
demonstration organizers had refused police requests to apply for a
permit.
	   After the demonstration, Palestinian youths threw stones at
three passenger buses in east Jerusalem, lightly wounding one
driver, Ben-Ruby said. Altogether, nine police officers were
lightly injured and 19 Palestinians were arrested in east
Jerusalem, Ben-Ruby said.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted between
Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards an
Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers with stones. Troops
responded with tear gas and rubber-bullets before Palestinian
police arrived on the scene and pushed their citizens back from the
Israeli-controlled area. A group of Palestinians burned one Israeli
flag. There were no injuries reported.
	   In Hebron, clashes broke out between stone-throwing
demonstrators and police who responded with rubber-coated bullets,
Israel radio said. Three demonstrators and one policeman were
lightly injured, the radio said.
	   In four other Palestinian-controlled cities throughout the West
Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters called on Israel to
set free so-called security prisoners, and lambasted the
Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails.
	   ``We went out in the past to demonstrate against the Israelis to
release our sons, but this time its different. There is an
agreement. We came today to raise our voice to the Palestinian
Authority to get the agreement implemented,'' said Khalid Abu
Mihsin, whose son Jamal was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for
being part of a terror cell behind the murder of an Israeli.
	   As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israel agreed to
release 750 Palestinians in three stages. One week ago, Israel
released the first group which included 150 common criminals,
setting off criticism and disappointment from both the Palestinian
public and officials who had expected the release of Palestinians
held for political or militant activities.
	   ``We didn't spend our time at Wye Plantation discussing the
release of those car thieves and criminals,'' Palestinian Cabinet
Secretary Nabil Shaath said late Friday night. ``We discussed the
release of those who participated in the Palestinian struggle.''
	   A statement released by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office Saturday said that the Palestinians were trying
to create a crisis in the peace talks by making new demands to
which Israel never agreed.
	   Netanyahu said in the statement that no ``artificial crisis''
would change his refusal to release prisoners who committed murder
or militant acts.
	   The prisoner issue is a sensitive one for Palestinians since
most families have had a brother of father arrested at one time or
another during the 30 years of Israeli occupation and had hoped the
peace process with Israel would mean the release of prisoners.
	   A statement from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet,
which met until late Friday, said the issue of prisoner releases
was ``top priority,'' and ``will not be subjected to compromise.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat would
raise the issue with U.S. President Bill Clinton when he goes to
Washington next week.
	   At Saturday's demonstrations however, held under the banner ``no
peace without prisoner release,'' most of the anger was lobbed at
Arafat's Palestinian Authority and in some cases, at Erekat
directly.
	   In the city of Nablus, some 250 Palestinian demonstrators
including mothers of prisoners carrying photos of their sons,
chanted, ``Tell Erekat we are fed up with statements.''
	   Similar protests were held in the Gaza Strip last week and
Palestinians said weekly demonstrations would grow until all
prisoners were released.

Opposition Congress Party takes early lead in crucial provincial
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout with Vajpayee conceding defeat, CHANGES
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Voters have rejected India's ruling
party in three crucial state elections, a rout that could
destabilize the federal government.
	   After results were tallied Saturday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said voters who cast their ballots Wednesday appeared to
want a change, and admitted defeat for his his Bharatiya Janata
Party in three of four states to the opposition Congress party.
	   A regional party was leading in a fourth state, where the BJP
did not contest elections.
	   Vajpayee insisted the results would have no bearing on the
stability of his 8-month-old federal government _ but others saw
the BJP's rout as a referendum on its rule and said defeat could
lead to infighting with its 18 coalition partners.
	   ``It's clearly a vote against the BJP's policies, the poor
performance of the government,'' said Mamta Banerjee, a leader of
the BJP-allied Trinamul Congress, who said her party would stick
with the BJP _ for now.
	   There were even those in the BJP who hinted that the federal
government's performance was to blame.
	   ``The voters did not defeat us; the BJP worked for its own
defeat,'' said Delhi's outgoing BJP chief minister, Sushma Swaraj.
	   It also was a key test for Congress' new leader, Sonia Gandhi,
widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer
of the dynasty that has ruled India for most of its 51 years of
independence.
	   Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since she
emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.
	   Congress could win two-thirds of the seats in the states of
Rajasthan and New Delhi, hitherto considered the BJP strongholds.
Bucking opinion polls, the Congress also managed to retain power in
the central state of Madhya Pradesh. A regional party was likely to
form a government in Mizoram.
	   ``The BJP has lost the goodwill of the people. Its
eight-month-rule has been marked by sheer incompetence, bickering
and inability to govern,'' said Natwar Singh, a Congress leader.
	   For now, Congress said it had no immediate plans to unseat the
federal government, although the victories might eventually prompt
the party to woo enough lawmakers in federal Parliament to unseat
Vajpayee.
	   ``This can't be put aside as a local issue,'' said Salman
Khursheed, another Congress leader. ``This is an approval signal
from the people.''
	   More than 600 seats were contested in the voting for about 5,000
candidates from dozens of political parties. Final results were
expected early Sunday.
	   Skyrocketing prices for vegetables and foodgrain were the main
issue, wiping out any credit the BJP may have earned for the highly
popular nuclear tests it conducted in May.
	   The election was the first political test for the BJP since it
took office eight months ago.

Garcia Paniagua, former Mexican official, dead at 61
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Javier Garcia Paniagua, a former top
government official who had aspired to Mexico's presidency in the
1980s, has died at his home near Guadalajara. He was 61.
	   Garcia Paniagua, the national director of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1981, suffered a heart attack
Tuesday in Zapopan, Jalisco, according to Mexico City newspapers.
	   Born on Feb. 13, 1937, Garcia Paniagua was the son of Gen.
Marcelino Garcia Barragan, who was Mexico's defense minister in
1968 when the military violently suppressed student democracy
protesters.
	   In the 1960s, Garcia Paniagua managed a government agricultural
bank. He went on to become a ruling party senator.
	   During the 1976-82 presidency of Jose Lopez Portillo, Garcia
Paniagua led the Federal Security Administration, a powerful police
agency that has since disbanded, and then served as deputy interior
minister.
	   When the time approached for Lopez Portillo to pick his
successor, as has been the party's tradition, Garcia Paniagua was
widely seen as the likely choice. But economic turmoil led the
president to tap his minister of budget and planning, Miguel de la
Madrid.
	   The choice marked a watershed in Mexican politics, a point when
the party's hard-line traditionalists began to lose power to
foreign-educated ``technocrats.'' De la Madrid picked as his
successor the Harvard-trained economist Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
who in turned chose Yale-educated economist Ernesto Zedillo,
Mexico's current president.
	   Garcia Paniagua, meanwhile, went on to brief terms as labor
minister and as head of the national lottery.
	   He had spent recent years in retirement at his ranch in Jalisco
state.
	   Funeral services were held Wednesday.
	   Garcia Paniagua is survived by his wife, Olivia Morales, and 10
children: Javier, Enoch, Dolores, Olivia, Claudia, Marisa, Laura,
Adrian, Omar and Marcelo, the daily Reforma reported.

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Two firefighters were
injured Friday when their water tanker truck flipped over while
they were responding to a blaze in St. Thomas, officials said.
	   It was the second incident in a week in which firefighters were
injured. Two men suffered burns Nov. 23 while fighting a fire that
destroyed a home in St. Thomas.
	   In Friday's incident, the 2,000-gallon (7,600-liter) truck
overturned on a steep slope near the University of the Virgin
Islands, said Carlton Dowe, fire service director.
	   One of the two men was treated and released while the other
remain hospitalized with broken ribs.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Egypt have begun a week-long
joint naval exercise aimed at strengthening military ties between
the two Mediterranean countries, defense officials here said
Saturday.
	   Two frigates from each country and other smaller vessels are
participating in the exercises which began Friday off the Egyptian
port of Alexandria.
	   The ``Alexandria 98'' maneuvers are part of a defense pact
signed between the two countries when Defense Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos visited Cairo earlier year.
	   Greece has expressed concern over expanding military cooperation
between Israel and its traditional rival Turkey. Egypt and Syria
have also appeared wary of this cooperation.

Inter's Ronaldo to miss Sunday's game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo will miss yet another game for
Internazionale of Milan with a nagging knee injury, the Italian
League club's doctor said Saturday.
	   The two-time FIFA Player of the Year will not suit up for his
club's game against visiting Salernitana Sunday. He will have
played in only nine of Inter's 22 outings in cup and league play
this season.
	   Inter doctor Piero Volpi said the Brazilian star is being held
out of the Salernitana game as a precaution and indicated the
striker could be on the field Thursday for an Italian Cup match
against Lazio of Rome.
	   ``There is nothing alarming or mysterious,'' Volpi told
reporters. ``Ronaldo's condition has not regressed at all. The
player has a slight tendon problem in his right knee.''
	   Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes Wednesday and set up the
first goal as Inter beat Spain's Real Madrid 3-1 to move closer to
clinching a spot in the Champions Cup quarterfinals.
	   But he got up slowly after some rough tackles.
	   ``Ronaldo is not in bad shape,'' Volpi said. ``He would
certainly have been able to take to the field if he had not been
hit on the knee a few times, preventing him from playing but not
from practicing.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians demanding the release of relatives
in Israeli jails held widespread demonstrations Saturday throughout
the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Some turned violent.
	   In east Jerusalem, Israeli mounted police charged a crowd of
about 40 Palestinian demonstrators in an effort to prevent them
from marching towards Jerusalem's walled Old City.
	   The protesters threw stones and empty bottles at police, who
responded with rubber-coated bullets and tear gas. Several
Palestinians and journalists were injured after from being clubbed.
	   Police officers fired live bullets into the air to extricate
themselves from a group of demonstrators that surrounded them, said
police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. Demonstration organizers had
refused police requests to apply for a permit, he said.
	   After the demonstration, Palestinian youths threw stones at
three passenger buses in east Jerusalem, lightly wounding one
driver, Ben-Ruby said. Altogether, nine police officers were
lightly injured and 19 Palestinians were arrested in east
Jerusalem, he said.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, clashes erupted between
Israeli soldiers and about 200 Palestinians who marched towards an
Israeli army outpost and pelted soldiers with stones.
	   Troops responded with tear gas and rubber-bullets before
Palestinian police arrived on the scene and pushed Palestinians
back from the Israeli-controlled area. There were no injuries
reported.
	   In Hebron, clashes broke out between stone-throwing
demonstrators and police who responded with rubber-coated bullets,
Israel radio said. Three demonstrators and one policeman were
lightly injured, the radio said.
	   In four other Palestinian-controlled cities throughout the West
Bank, demonstrations were peaceful. Protesters lambasted the
Palestinian leadership for not doing enough to secure the release
of an estimated 2,500 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails.

Saddam son's commandos crack down in Karbala after attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS throughout; ADDS Iraq alleges U.S. has built airport,
Kurdish reply final grafs; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein's eldest son,
Odai, ordered commandos to crack down on the city of Karbala after
a bid to assassinate a top official, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Babil newspaper, published by Odai, said the commandos, who
are known for their ferocity, arrested 39 ``saboteurs and agents''
in their swoop after Monday's attempt on Izzat Ibrahim's life.
	   The paper did not say whether the detainees were involved in the
attempt, but accused them of having ``sold themselves to the
enemy.''
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on Ibrahim,
Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command Council and a
deputy commander of the armed forces. But Babil hinted that foreign
agents were behind it _ a reference to Iran.
	   Ibrahim escaped unharmed when an unidentified assailant hurled
two grenades while he was attending a religious ceremony in
Karbala. Several of Ibrahim's bodyguards and bystanders were
wounded.
	   Witnesses said bodyguards promptly killed the lone attacker.
	   Karbala, a holy city 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Baghdad,
lies in the southern Shiite Muslim heartland, which has long been a
source of opposition to Saddam.
	   The newspaper did not say how many of the commandos from
Saddam's Fedayeen took part or how long the operation lasted.
	   Fedayeen is a paramilitary force of about 40,000 run by Odai. To
emphasize their ferocity, its men are often shown on television,
butchering cats, dogs and wolves and then eating their raw meat.
	   ``Babil has learned that heroes from Saddam's Fedayeen ...
stormed hideouts of saboteurs and agents 72 hours after the vicious
aggression on Mr. Izzat Ibrahim,'' Babil said.
	   The attack on Ibrahim was the first assassination bid to be
reported in Iraq since December 1996, when gunmen shot Odai about
10 times while he waited in his car in an upscale Baghdad
neighborhood.
	   Iraqi dissidents abroad claim Baghdad falsified the
assassination attempt to increase its repression of Shiite Muslims
in southern Iraq.
	   Shiites are in a slight majority in Iraq, but Saddam and most of
his officials are Sunnis.
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's parliamentary speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, has
accused the United States of building an airport near the northern
town of Sarsang ``to ferry troops and equipment'' to rebels, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Hammadi made the charge in letters to Arab states that urge
their governments to oppose any U.S. bid to topple Saddam, the
agency said.
	   Sarsang lies in the Kurdish autonomous zone. Delshad Miran, a
spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party, which controls Sarsang,
dismissed Hammadi's allegation as ``baseless.''
	   Speaking from London, Miran said the only airport in the area
had been built during the monarchy and was out of use.

Turkey presses ahead with extradition bid for Kurdish rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS report on Ocalan interview &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Turkey pressed stubbornly ahead Saturday with its
campaign to get Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader,
dispatching a thick file full of graphic material on his alleged
crimes to Rome.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan because he could
face death penalty in Turkey. Despite this, Turkish Ambassador Inal
Batu said a formal extradition request would be made to the Italian
government in the next few days.
	   He said the file on Ocalan includes around 900 pages of material
describing in detail the rebel leader's alleged crimes, along with
what he indicated were gruesome photographs and videos. ``It's not
something I'd advise minors under 18 to see,'' Batu told the
Italian news agency ANSA.
	   Germany also has arrest warrants for Ocalan on charges of murder
and arson, but doesn't want him because it fears unrest among its
immigrant population. About one-fifth of Germany's 2 million
Turkish residents are Kurds. The Turks want him extradited to
Turkey, while the Kurds are demanding his freedom.
	   On Saturday, more than 15,000 Turks demonstrated peacefully in
the German cities of Berlin, Bonn, Munich and Nuremberg, urging
Italy to extradite Ocalan. A day earlier, around 11,000 Kurds
demonstrated in Bonn when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met with
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.
	   Schroeder made it clear Germany wouldn't ask for Ocalan's
extradition.
	   Germany and Italy now hope to extricate Europe from growing
Kurdish-Turkish tension by arranging for an international court to
try Ocalan.
	   Turkey is vehemently opposed to the idea.
	   ``This is a legal scandal,'' Turkish Justice Minister Hasan
Denizkurdu said Saturday in Ankara, vowing that Turkey ``will never
allow the issue to be taken to an international arena.''
	   Ocalan has asked Italy for political asylum in Italy and is now
living in a heavily guarded villa on the outskirts of Rome.
	   An Italian court ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to
give Germany more time to ponder extradition. What happens next
depends on his asylum request and whether the idea of an
international court goes anywhere.
	   Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, and his Italian
counterpart, Lamberto Dini, discussed the Ocalan case for several
hours in Rome on Saturday along with teams of legal experts.
	   In a statement, they said Italy and Germany were working
together to see ``that Ocalan is brought to justice'' and to seek a
negotiated end to the Kurdish conflict.
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting for
Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984 in a war that
has killed 37,000 and devastated the region. The Turkish government
has always refused to negotiate with the PKK.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a
flight from Moscow. He has renounced armed struggle since his
arrival, but the war continues.
	   On Saturday, the rebels claimed they downed a Turkish troop
transport helicopter. Turkish officials said 15 soldiers died when
the helicopter crashed for unknown reasons.
	   According to Italian television, Ocalan threatened an escalation
in the conflict if Turkey continues to refuse to negotiate. The
report said the rebel leader spoke in an interview with a
pro-Kurdish TV station in London.

	   Details of English Premier League games played Saturday.
 &UR; Charlton 1, Everton 2 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Everton didn't seem to miss Duncan Ferguson _ sent to Newcastle
in a transfer last week _ as Danny Cadamarteri scored in the 45th
and the 73rd in Everton's win. Everton's Michael Ball missed a
penalty kick with his side leading 1-0. Mark Kinsella got
Charlton's lone goal in the 72nd.
 &UR; Chelsea 1, Sheffield Wednesday 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Chelsea matched a club record of 19 games unbeaten, but this
will be seen as two lost points. Gianfranco Zola gave Chelsea a 1-0
lead in the 27th off a cross from Celestine Babayero, but Andy
Booth got the equalizer in the 67th with a shot just inside the
post.
 &UR; Coventry 1, Leicester 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Frank Sinclair was sent off for Leicester on his second yellow
card _ both questionable _ in the 47th. Darren Huckerby's goal in
the 78th seemed to cinch a win for Coventry, but Leicester rallied
to get the late equalizer in the 89th from Emile Heskey. Heskey was
playing his first match after missing two with an ankle injury.
 &UR; Newcastle 3, Wimbledon 1 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Duncan Ferguson, who had scored half of Everton's goals (four of
eight) before moving to Newcastle last week, scored Newcastle's
final two in the win _ his debut. Marcus Gayle gave Wimbledon a 1-0
lead in the 34th but Peruvian Nolberto Solano leveled in the 38th,
setting the stage for Ferguson.
 &UR; Nottingham Forest 2, Aston Villa 2 (2-0) &QC; 
	   Forest, playing its best match of the season, took a 2-0 lead on
goals by Chris Bart-Williams (32nd) and Dougie Freedman (44th). But
Villa's Julian Joachim evened on two goals in five minutes _ 58th
and 63rd. Villa remains unbeaten away from home this season.
 &UR; Southampton 0, Derby 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Argentine defender Horacio Carbonari got the winning goal in the
33rd on a long-range shot, and then relied to key saves from
Estonian goalkeeper Mart Poom. Southampton was without key players
Matt Le Tissier, Egil Ostenstad, Ken Monkou, and Claus Lundekvam.
It was only Derby's second win in its last eight.
 &UR; West Ham 2, Tottenham 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   West Ham moved into second on Trevor Sinclair's goals in the
39th and 46th. He got the first when Tottenham goalkeeper Espen
Bardsen failed to control a long shot. Chris Armstrong made it 2-1
on a header in the 72nd with both clubs squandering late chances.

Brazilians lead Leverkusen win as team stays on Munich's heels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Brazilians Emerson and Paulo Rink scored Saturday
as Bayer Leverkusen won 2-0 and continued to press frontrunner
Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.
	   Leverkusen stretched its unbeaten run to 12 matches with the
easy 2-0 victory over MSV Duisburg and remained just two points
back in the table of Munich, also a 2-0 winner against Nuremberg.
	   Rink, stepping in for injured striker Ulf Kirsten, stunned
Duisburg with the first goal just 43 seconds into the match.
Emerson added the second in the 60th minute for Leverkusen, which
showed less dazzle than in other recent outings.
	   "In other matches we've played better, but this time we made the
necessary goals," said coach Christoph Daum.
	   Munich also turned in a workmanlike performance against
Nuremberg in front of 63,000 at Olympiastadium. For the Bavarians,
it was their seventh win in eight home matches.
	   Brazilian national team striker Giovane Elber, exploiting a
mistake by young defender Markus Grasser, shot his ninth goal in
the 36th minute. Bixente Lizarazu, a French World Cup player, then
punched in Mario Basler's free kick in the 63rd.
	   "The Bayern have too many good players -- we just couldn't keep
pace," said Nuremberg coach Willi Reimann.
	   VfL Wolfsburg continued its remarkable run, having soared from
16th to sixth place in just nine matches, by blasting VfL Bochum
4-1. But 1860 Munich, still clinging to third, was trounced 4-0 by
Werder Bremen.
	   Hamburger SV also rolled past Moenchengladbach 3-0 and Freiburg
beat Stuttgart 2-0. On Friday, UEFA Cup aspirants Dortmund beat
Frankfurt 3-0 and Berlin slipped past Rostock 2-1.
	   Wolfsburg steamrolled Bochum as Polish striker Andrzei
Juskoviak, who had been a washout at Moenchengladbach, struck for
his eighth and ninth goals in the second and 20th minutes.
	   After Viorel Ion raised Hamburg's hopes by scoring in the 36th
minute, Roy Praeger and Frank Greiner sealed Wolfsburg's fourth
straight home win by connecting late in the second half.
	   Bremen continued its resurgence under new coach Felix Magath,
climbing to 12th with its third straight wins as all-arounder Marco
Bode scored two key goals.
	   Bode, who has played both midfield and forward, put Bremen ahead
in the sixth minute by knocking back a ricochet, then a second time
in the 62nd after 1860's Abderrahim Quakili equalized.
	   Lodewijk Reombiak and Andreas Herzog, converting a penalty,
added late goals for Bremen, which has put distance between itself
and the demotion zone under Magath.

Russians capture all titles at the Cup of Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Alexei Urmanov completed a Russian sweep
of the titles at the Cup of Russia, capturing the men's event
Saturday for his first major international victory this season.
	   Following their women teammates' success, Russian men captured
all three top positions in the cup's men's event.
	   The Cup of Russia is the fifth event in the International
Skating Union's Grand Prix Series, which features Olympic-eligible
skaters and was held in Moscow for the first time.
	   Urmanov landed a triple flip-triple toe loop jump at the
beginning of his tango routine, but fell on the next triple
axel-triple toe loop combination and stumbled on the next triple
axel.
	   ``I'm not satisfied with my skating today,'' Urmanov told
reporters, lamenting his ``silly mistake.'' Nevertheless, it was
enough for a win.
	   ``Judges favored me today,'' Urmanov said.
	   He got mostly 5.7s on the top line, and six judges gave him the
edge over Yevgeny Plushenko, who secured second place after the
short program.
	   Alexander Abt, skating a modern Egyptian theme, failed to land
three jumps and came in third.
	   Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, missed all of last season _
including a chance to repeat as Olympic champion _ but made his
return a rewarding one, winning a silver medal in last summer's
Goodwill Games in New York. He finished third in Skate America, the
first event of the Series.
	   Russian pairs captured the ice dance podium as well.
	   World champions and Olympic silver medalists Angelika Krylova
and Oleg Ovsiannikov unveiled a controversial new program, a
routine with only drums and percussion instruments, at the Nations
Cup two weeks ago. It did not go over well.
	   Their reception in Moscow was better. They got one 5.9 mark at
the top line and 4 for presentation _ enough for a first-place
finish.
	   Before the event, Krylova defended the routine, saying, ``We're
world champions and we have a right to experiment.''
	   Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh were second, followed by
Tatiana Navka and Roman Kostamarov. All three pairs are coached by
Natalia Linichuk and Gennady Karponosov.
	   Even without Olympic champions competing this season, the
Russians have won fourteen of 20 titles as the International Figure
Skating Grand Prix Series reaches its finals with only one event
left to go.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians had four
victories in eight events. They doubled that in Gelsenkirchen,
Germany, and added two more at the Lalique trophy competition in
France. They made it four for four in Moscow.
	   Men's gold medalist Ilia Kulik and pairs champion Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev have bypassed the Grand Prix series
this year, preferring to enter pro-ams and do the show circuit
while staying eligible for future Olympic competition.
	   Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov have split up and are no longer
eligible. Yet even without them, the Russians have proved capable
of dominating the skating ranks.
	   Winners in the Grand Prix receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can
accumulate points from two of the meets to qualify for the series
final in St. Petersburg, Russia, in March.
	   The Russians Urmanov and Abt have qualified for the finals as
well as Yelena Sokolova and Maria Butyrskaya. Yelena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze, who won the pairs event in Moscow on Friday,
have also qualified.
	   The last qualifying event is the NHK Trophy, being held next
week in Sapporo, Japan.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After gaining an extra week to decide whether to
allow the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Spanish charges
including genocide, Britain's government faced continuing pressure
from Chile Saturday to let the former dictator come home.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview. ``These processes are going on and I fully expect they
will result in justice.''
	   Fourteen cases were already pending in Chile and Pinochet had no
immunity from prosecution, said Insulza, who was himself an exile
during Pinochet's rule.
	   All the suits are being handling by Santiago Judge Juan Guzman,
who has said he plans to question Pinochet in December _ if he
comes home.
	   ``I can assure you that the cases are going to be prosecuted. I
can never say that somebody is going to be condemned until the
trial is over, of course,'' Insulza said at a news conference
Saturday.
	   He added: ``I must remind you that there are several people in
jail in Chile for violations of human rights, condemned for
violations of human rights. So some cases have been opened,
accused, tried and condemned.''
	   In an interview on Spanish National Television TVE on Saturday,
Insulza said it is unlikely Pinochet could get a fair trial if the
former dictator is extradited to Spain.
	   ``A fair trial on this issue in Spain would be difficult given
the high level of emotion that this case has caused,'' Insulza
said. ``I believe that Pinochet has already been tried and
condemned in Spain.''
	   He said he will meet with Spanish officials about the
extradition.
	   ``I am going to Spain to talk about the case, I hope to meet
with everybody, here (in London) this was not possible, but I am
not going to make any specific requests,'' Insulza said.
	   On Friday, a British magistrate granted a one-week extension _
until Dec. 11 _ for Home Secretary Jack Straw to decide whether to
permit extradition proceedings to begin.
	   Pinochet, 83, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year rule,
remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he is
recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British police on
Oct. 16.
	   There was fresh evidence of strains in Chile's relations with
Britain. The Ministry of Defense said it has canceled plans for the
frigate HMS Sutherland to appear at a naval fair in the Chilean
port of Valparaiso, and the Foreign Office said it was temporarily
closing its consular office in the city. Four other British
consulates and the embassy in Santiago remain open.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
ordered Pinochet to appear in court on Dec. 11 to hear Straw's
decision, ``subject to any medical reports.''
	   ``There must be time given for proper consideration,'' Parkinson
told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet on Friday.
``It is in some respects quite a historic decision to make.''
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled Wednesday that Pinochet
could not claim immunity as a former head of state.
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew President Salvador Allende. Allende died in
the coup.

KLA first anniversary marked with memorial, swearing in ceremony

	    &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   LAUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A memorial service Saturday for a
teacher killed by Serb police and a swearing-in ceremony for new
recruits to Kosovo Liberation Army marked the anniversary of the
rebels' first public appearance _ and their determination not to go
away.
	   Hundreds of KLA members attended a memorial service in Lausa,
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina, for Halit
Geci, a school teacher killed last November by Serb security forces
as he sat in his classroom.
	   Three uniformed members of the KLA appeared at his funeral on
Nov. 28 last year _ the first time they had appeared in public.
	   ``That night we decided to fight until the last Serb leaves and
until we are independent,'' said Shaban Muslem, a KLA commander,
during his speech at the ceremony.
	   ``Our only weapons were our morale and our will,'' he said while
a crowd of several hundred people chanted the name of the rebel
army.
	   ``After some months, the KLA were all around Kosovo,'' Muslem
said. ``The war had started. For the first time, the Serbs saw they
would have to fight to keep Kosovo.''
	   Clashes that began in February following a Serb crackdown on
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo have claimed hundreds of
lives and forced more than 300,000 people from their homes. Ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
	   The Serb security forces quickly put down the KLA rebellion this
summer, but since the cease-fire in October, the guerrillas have
been returning to some areas from which they had been driven.
	   Children from Geci's school recited poems in his honor and later
accompanied his daughter, Valbona, 19, and his nephew Driton Geci,
as they lay a wreath of plastic flowers at his grave on the
outskirts of Lausa.
	   About 100 KLA fighters stood at attention facing the grave for a
minute's silence.
	   In the nearby village of Prekaz, some 300 new recruits swore
their allegiance to the KLA in the shadow of the Albanian flag _ a
double-headed eagle on a red background.
	   The recruits, most of whom were middle-aged, swore to fight
``for the freedom of occupied Albanian lands, for unity of the
lands.''
	   ``I will always be a faithful soldier, a soldier of freedom, of
vigilance, brave and disciplined,'' they said in unison.
	   A large crowd of civilians who had gathered to watch the
ceremony erupted in spontaneous applause at the arrival of a column
of KLA special forces in black uniforms.
	   The special forces were renamed the Adem Jashari unit, after the
local KLA leader who was killed along with another 27 members of
his family by Serb authorities last March.
	   Saturday would have been his 43rd birthday, villagers said.
	   His daughter, wearing a KLA camouflage uniform, cried as the
assembled crowd held one minute's silence in memory of her
relatives.
	   ``On behalf of my family and my name, those who were killed and
those who are alive, I congratulate you on the oath that you gave
to the KLA on this day of the flag,'' she said, addressing the
rebel group's new members. ``I am the daughter of brave Kosovo.''

Schmidt sets new record at Lillehammer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmidt was simply
unbeatable when he won the World Cup ski jump opener Saturday with
a hill record at 136 meters in the K120 hill.
	   Schmidt had the best jumps in all practice legs and the
qualifier.
	   In the first leg, Schmidt also took the lead with a 127.5-meter
jump. He had 268.8 points, 7.7 points ahead of Jani Ahonen of
Finland, who jumped 124.5 and 130 meters.
	   The Finn did not have extreme lengths in his jumps, but he came
close to Schmidt because of esthetic jumping.
	   Thus, Ahonen was ahead of Germany's Sven Hannawald who captured
third with 251.1 points and two jumps at 126.5 and 128 meters.
	   There was a big step down from Schmidt, Ahonen and Hannawald to
the other competitors. Japan's Kasuyoshi Funaki and Noriaki Kasai,
took respectively fourth and fifth with 232.3 and 231.1 points.
	   Kasai had a chance to get close to Schmidt's 136-meter record
but he fell at 135.5 meters in his second jump. Still, this was
enough to capture fifth, but he couldn't pass his younger teammate
Funaki.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's government is debating
whether to file criminal charges against former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet for the disappearance of five Brazilians
under his regime, media reported Saturday.
	   Justice Minister Renan Calheiros will decide whether to pursue
the case, the Rio daily O Globo daily said.
	   The five vanished in 1973 and 1974. Their families are pressing
for Pinochet's prosecution.
	   Pinochet is under arrest in Britain pending a decision by Home
Secretary Jack Straw on an extradition request by Spain, which
wants to try him for the torture and killing of Spanish citizens.
	   Switzerland, France and Belgium also have filed extradition
proceedings against Pinochet.

Saddam son's commandos crack down in Karbala after attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout; ADDS Iraq alleges U.S. has built airport,
Kurdish reply final grafs; NEW to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein's eldest son,
Odai, ordered commandos to crack down on the city of Karbala after
a bid to assassinate a top official, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The Babil newspaper, published by Odai, said the commandos,
known for their ferocity, arrested 39 ``saboteurs and agents'' in
their swoop after Monday's attempt on Izzat Ibrahim's life.
	   The paper did not say whether the detainees were involved in the
attempt, but accused them of having ``sold themselves to the
enemy.''
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on Ibrahim,
Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command Council and a
deputy commander of the armed forces. But Babil hinted that foreign
agents were behind it _ a reference to Iran.
	   Ibrahim escaped unharmed when an unidentified assailant hurled
two grenades while he was attending a religious ceremony in
Karbala. Several of Ibrahim's bodyguards and bystanders were
wounded.
	   Witnesses said bodyguards promptly killed the lone attacker.
	   Karbala, a holy city 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Baghdad,
lies in the southern Shiite Muslim heartland, which has long been a
source of opposition to Saddam.
	   The newspaper did not say how many of the commandos from
Saddam's Fedayeen took part or how long the operation lasted.
	   Fedayeen is a paramilitary force of about 40,000 run by Odai. To
emphasize their ferocity, its men are often shown on television,
butchering cats, dogs and wolves and then eating their raw meat.
	   ``Babil has learned that heroes from Saddam's Fedayeen ...
stormed hideouts of saboteurs and agents 72 hours after the vicious
aggression on Mr. Izzat Ibrahim,'' the newspaper said.
	   The attack on Ibrahim was the first assassination bid to be
reported in Iraq since December 1996, when gunmen shot Odai about
10 times while he waited in his car in an upscale Baghdad
neighborhood.
	   Iraqi dissidents abroad claim Baghdad falsified the
assassination attempt to increase its repression of Shiite Muslims
in southern Iraq.
	   Shiites are in a slight majority in Iraq, but Saddam and most of
his officials are Sunnis.
	   Iraq's parliamentary speaker, Saadoun Hammadi, has accused the
United States of building an airport near the northern town of
Sarsang ``to ferry troops and equipment'' to rebels, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Hammadi made the charge in letters urging Arab governments to
oppose any U.S. bid to topple Saddam, the agency said.
	   Sarsang lies in the Kurdish autonomous zone. Delshad Miran, a
spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party which controls Sarsang,
dismissed Hammadi's allegation as ``baseless.''
	   Speaking from London, Miran said the only airport in the area
had been built decades ago and was out of use.

Brazilians lead Leverkusen win as team stays on Munich's heels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Anthony Yeboah's hat trick &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Brazilians Emerson and Paulo Rink scored Saturday
as Bayer Leverkusen won 2-0 and continued to press frontrunner
Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.
	   Leverkusen stretched its unbeaten run to 12 matches with the
easy 2-0 victory over MSV Duisburg and remained just two points
back in the table of Munich, also a 2-0 winner against Nuremberg.
	   Rink, stepping in for injured striker Ulf Kirsten, stunned
Duisburg with the first goal just 43 seconds into the match.
Emerson added the second in the 60th minute for Leverkusen, which
showed less dazzle than in other recent outings.
	   "In other matches we've played better, but this time we made the
necessary goals," said coach Christoph Daum.
	   Munich also turned in a workmanlike performance against
Nuremberg in front of 63,000 at Olympiastadium. For the Bavarians,
it was their seventh win in eight home matches.
	   Brazilian national team striker Giovane Elber, exploiting a
mistake by young defender Markus Grasser, shot his ninth goal in
the 36th minute. Bixente Lizarazu, a French World Cup player, then
punched in Mario Basler's free kick in the 63rd.
	   "The Bayern have too many good players -- we just couldn't keep
pace," said Nuremberg coach Willi Reimann.
	   VfL Wolfsburg continued its remarkable run, having soared from
16th to sixth place in just nine matches, by blasting VfL Bochum
4-1. But 1860 Munich, still clinging to third, was trounced 4-0 by
Werder Bremen.
	   Hamburger SV rolled past Moenchengladbach 3-0 with Anthony
Yeboah, twice the leading marksman in the Bundesliga, returning to
form with a hat trick.
	   Freiburg also beat Stuttgart 2-0. On Friday, UEFA Cup aspirants
Dortmund beat Frankfurt 3-0 and Berlin slipped past Rostock 2-1.
	   Wolfsburg steamrolled Bochum as Polish striker Andrzei
Juskoviak, who had been a washout at Moenchengladbach, struck for
his eighth and ninth goals in the second and 20th minutes.
	   After Viorel Ion raised Hamburg's hopes by scoring in the 36th
minute, Roy Praeger and Frank Greiner sealed Wolfsburg's fourth
straight home win by connecting late in the second half.
	   Bremen continued its resurgence under new coach Felix Magath,
climbing to 12th with its third straight wins as all-arounder Marco
Bode scored two key goals.
	   Bode, who has played both midfield and forward, put Bremen ahead
in the sixth minute by knocking back a ricochet, then a second time
in the 62nd after 1860's Abderrahim Quakili equalized.
	   Lodewijk Reombiak and Andreas Herzog, converting a penalty,
added late goals for Bremen, which has put distance between itself
and the demotion zone under Magath.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire to end the fighting between rebels and forces loyal
to Congolese President Laurent Kabila, French President Jacques
Chirac said.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo ``had
reached a consensus to stop this war.''
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime in December before a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The secretary general has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   But, perhaps ominously for the fate of the Paris agreement,
rebel leaders in Congo were not present at Saturday's meeting since
they were not been invited, raising doubts about how a cease-fire
could be put into effect without their consent.
	   At the frontline in Congo, rebel troops said Saturday the war
would go on regardless.
	   At a noisy meeting with thousands of Congolese at a Paris hotel
later Saturday, Kabila said Uganda and Rwanda should be forced to
withdraw their support of the rebels.
	   ``We want to pressure public opinion in France and everywhere so
that this meeting will weigh heavily on the leaders of those
countries,'' Kabila told the boisterous audience, some of whom
banged drums and waved national flags.
	   He said 30,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops were currently in
Congo, and he emphasized that no agreement had yet been signed.
	   Kabila later met with Chirac at the Elysee Palace for a
scheduled meeting.
	   Earlier Saturday, Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of
officials, including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda.
The heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.'' He did not refer to whether the rebels in
Congo had been consulted, or what their position now would be.
	   He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to
establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a
greater rapprochement,'' he said.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his
renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his
regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion,
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
	   The purpose of the Paris talks on the sidelines of an African
summit on security was to try to work out some framework for peace
negotiations between the warring parties.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders _ especially those at
war in Congo _ to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Annan said many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of
intolerance'' and that the Congo conflict poses the continent's
greatest challenge.
	   Chirac on Friday urged African nations to do their own
peacekeeping _ a departure from past practices that put the burden
on France and other Western nations.
	   Thirty four African leaders attended the 20th French-African
summit. But throughout the summit, all eyes were on Kabila, who
finally sat down with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur
Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.

Norway ends participation in U.N. peacekeeping force

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Norway formally ended its 20-year role in
the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon on Saturday, saying
it was sad to be leaving the conflict zone.
	   Some 21 Norwegian soldiers have died since 1978 when the country
helped set up the U.N. Interim Force In Lebanon to police the
Lebanese-Israeli border, where guerrillas exchange fire daily with
Israeli troops and their allied militia.
	   In a ceremony at UNIFIL headquarters in Ebl al-Saqi, in the
Israeli-occupied zone of Lebanon, Norwegian Defense Minister Dag
Jostein Fjaervoll said his country was withdrawing its 470 troops
``not without sadness.''
	   ``The work has not ended and the mission has not been completed,
but we are pleased and honored to hand over responsibility to the
Indians,'' he said.
	   Some 670 Indians, including troops from the elite 2nd Gurkha
Rifles, have replaced the Norwegian battalion in the eastern sector
of the security zone.
	   Norway announced in June it was withdrawing its contingent
because of difficulties in recruiting volunteers.
	   In addition to the Indians, the force consists of contingents
from Fiji, Finland, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal and Poland.
	   Israeli forces have crossed into southern Lebanon in several
offensives since 1978. In 1985 they set up the occupied zone as a
buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.

Reluctant Primakov says Russia will meet IMF conditions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with new quotes, background,
concerns about U.S. currency. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An indignant Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Saturday that Russia was ready to comply with tough loan conditions
set by the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``We should comply with their conditions, but not because we are
overly obedient,'' Primakov told regional politicians in southern
Russia, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   At the same time, Primakov said Russia would print more money to
cover its expenses, something the IMF has resolutely opposed. That
remark suggested that Russia still faces a tough round of
negotiating with IMF officials.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia adopt a budget that
incorporates Western ideas about reforming its economy, including
cost cutting, much better tax collection and curbs on currency
printing.
	   Russia desperately needs the next installment of a dlrs 22.6
billion loan package that was frozen in August, but has been loathe
to follow the IMF's prescription. That much hasn't changed, as
Primakov made clear.
	   ``I find myself irritated when young boys come and start
imposing their conditions,'' Primakov said. ``They have read many
books but they don't know life as it is or the actual situation in
Russia.''
	   But, speaking to the legislative assembly in the southern
Russian city of Belgorod, Primakov said his government was prepared
to fulfill the fund's conditions because Russia badly needs the
next dlrs 8 billion installment of IMF money.
	   ``This money will allow us to clear some foreign debts and to
inject 85 billion rubles into the economy,'' Primakov said.
	   He said he hoped to reach an agreement soon with the IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus, who was scheduled to come to
Moscow on Dec. 1, Interfax reported.
	   An IMF delegation left Moscow earlier this week with no promise
that it would resume its payments.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, after succumbing to the global economic troubles that
started in Asia and prompted Russia to default on loans and devalue
the ruble in August.
	   Primakov was caustic in criticizing the government of his
predecessor, Sergei Kiriyenko, who made the devaluation and default
decisions. He called it ``a disgrace close to being a crime.''
	   Primakov has assembled a government that covers a far broader
swath of Russia's political spectrum than the Western-oriented
Kiriyenko government, and is more open to leftist economic
solutions, including money-printing.
	   Primakov warned Saturday that Russia would have to crank up its
presses while it waits for foreign aid.
	   ``If we switch on the money-printing presses, and this is
something we cannot avoid, we should do our best to keep the money
emission under control,' the prime minister said, according to
Interfax. ``Otherwise, uncontrolled money printing will lead to a
serious rise in inflation.''
	   Primakov also said the government needs to do something to get
Russians' vast holdings of U.S. currency into circulation. But he
conceded that it would be difficult to get Russians to put their
money in banks. Many Russians lost much of their savings in the
August crisis, and are wary of getting burned again.
	   Russians hold dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40 billion in U.S.
currency, the prime minister said.
	   ``What should we do to invest it in the economy?'' he asked.
``People don't trust us, and they have their reasons.''
	   He suggested various ideas, including allowing people to put
their money in foreign banks if the banks agree to invest the funds
in the Russian economy.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Norway, a principal broker in the Mideast
peace process, formally ended its 20-year role in the U.N.
peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon on Saturday, expressing
regrets at leaving the conflict zone.
	   Some 21 Norwegian soldiers have died since 1978 when the country
helped set up the U.N. Interim Force In Lebanon to police the
Lebanese-Israeli border, where guerrillas exchange fire daily with
Israeli troops and their allied militia.
	   In a ceremony at UNIFIL headquarters in Ebl al-Saqi, in the
Israeli-occupied zone of Lebanon, Norwegian Defense Minister Dag
Jostein Fjaervoll said his country was withdrawing its 470 troops
``not without sadness.''
	   ``The work has not ended and the mission has not been completed,
but we are pleased and honored to hand over responsibility to the
Indians,'' he said.
	   Some 670 Indians, including troops from the elite 2nd Gurkha
Rifles, have replaced the Norwegian battalion in the eastern sector
of the security zone.
	   Norway announced in June it was withdrawing its contingent
because of difficulties in recruiting volunteers. The Scandinavian
country helped broker the breakthrough 1993 Oslo agreement between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
	   The force also includes contingents from Fiji, Finland, Ghana,
Ireland, Nepal and Poland.
	   Israeli forces have crossed into southern Lebanon in several
offensives since 1978. In 1985 they set up the occupied zone as a
buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.

Rail services disrupted for second day in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French rail traffic was disrupted for a second
consecutive day on Saturday after workers continued to strike over
demands that more staff be hired.
	   The national rail company, the SNCF, said one in three
long-distance trains ran on average.
	   The strike hit particularly hard outside the Paris region. Many
workers were expected to continue their action through Sunday. But
srvices were expected to slowly return to normal by Monday.
	   Rail workers are protesting what they see as insufficient staff,
and are concerned about how the government will implement a plan to
cut the working week from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Eurostar services to London and the Thalys service to Brussels
were running normally Saturday.
	   French rail workers also walked off the job last Monday, along
with colleagues in five other European countries to protest plans
to open state-owned railways to private operators in the European
Union.

Highway severed as bridge crumbles

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It was perhaps the fastest opening
ceremony in history.
	   Authorities scrambled to unveil a new road bridge Saturday after
the existing one was washed away in a storm, suspending traffic on
Greece's main highway for over eight hours.
	   No one was hurt as cars were stopped just after large cracks
appeared in the road.
	   The 35-year-old bridge collapsed in torrential rain near the
northern town of Katerini, severing the main traffic route between
Athens and the northern port city of Salonica. Cars were forced to
follow a lengthy detour.
	   The public works ministry ordered the opening of the new bridge
_ adjacent to the old one _ ahead of schedule. It said the new
bridge was built using ``modern and international safety
standards''.

	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Austrian Thomas Stangassinger took a slim
lead over countryman Mario Reiter after the first run of a men's
World Cup slalom Saturday on Aspen Mountain.
	   Stangassinger, who finished second to Austrian Thomas Sykora in
last season's World Cup slalom standings, negotiated an icy,
57-gate course in 43.57 seconds.
	   Reiter, skiing in the second seed, was .23 seconds behind at
43.80.
	   Another Austrian, Christian Mayer, was third at 43.83.
	   Next came a Norwegian trio of Kjetil Andre Aamodt, Tom Stiansen
and Lasse Kjus in 43.85, 43.90 and 43.93, respectively.
	   Pierrick Bourgeat of France, who won a season-opening slalom
last Sunday in Park City, Utah, stood seventh in 44.14. Thomas
Grandi of Canada was eighth in 44.22.
	   Ten skiers were within one second of the lead entering the
second run.
	   The course held up well despite warm temperatures. Twelve of the
top 20 finishers in the first run started in the second seed or
lower.
	   Norway's Hans-Petter Buraas and Austria's Siegfried Voglreiter
both were faster than Stangassinger at the first intermediate
clocking but carried too much speed into some tight gates further
down the course and failed to finish.
	   Sykora underwent surgery on Monday to repair an injury to his
patellar tendon and is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks.

Corretja upsets Sampras, Moya beats Henman to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with quotes, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ The year of his historic achievement
ended less gloriously for Pete Sampras on Saturday, in an
error-filled loss to the tenacious Spaniard, Alex Corretja, in the
semifinals of the ATP Tour World Championship.
	   Corretja beat the top-ranked Sampras 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), saving
three match points along the way.
	   His victory produced a historic all-Spanish final at the elite
season-ending dlrs 3.5 million championship, with Corretja facing
Carlos Moya, a good friend.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, defeated Tim Henman 6-4, 3-6,
7-5.
	   Despite his loss, Sampras is assured of holding to No. 1 for a
record sixth consecutive year.
	   ``It's a tough way to end it, I must admit,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I had mixed emotions, coming so close to winning, being in the
final. But the achievement of doing it six years in a row, and the
fans giving me a nice ovation, it was a very food feeling.''
	   ``But it wasn't the way I wanted to end the year,'' Sampras
said.
	   ``Although I felt I wasn't playing as well as I was through the
week, I felt like I was playing well enough to win. He hit some
unbelievable passing shots,'' said Sampras, who had not dropped a
set in his three round-robin matches.
	   But he had 50 unforced errors against Corretja, who only had 19.
	   Sampras was seeking his fifth title in the elite tournament
after winning the championship in 1991, 1994 and the last two
years.
	   Only once before have two Spaniards contested a final on any
surface other than clay, and that was at the start of this year
when Corretja beat Felix Mantilla in Dubai.
	   The ATP championship is played on an indoor hard court.
	   ``We have been told by people all over the world that we can
only play on clay,'' said Corretja, who is ranked No. 6 in the
world. ``Now they have to show us some respect.''
	   Sampras accomplished his main goal of the year _ remaining No. 1
for the sixth consecutive year _ when Marcelo Rios dropped out
Thursday because of a back injury. That ruined Rios' hopes of
challenging Sampras.
	   Corretja gave Sampras an epic four-hour battle in the U.S. Open
quarterfinals in 1996, when Sampras was so ill he had to vomit,
still managing to save a match point. But Corretja had never beaten
Sampras in their previous three matches.
	   ``I realize God is fair and gave me this victory after two years
of hearing about that match,'' Corretja said.
	   The three match points turned into a long rallies, and all went
Corretja's way, one on his winner, two on errors by Sampras.
Sampras netted a simple forehand and dived for a volley on the last
one, but it went wide.
	   ``That easy forehand on match point will sit on me for a
while,'' Sampras said after that match that lasted two hours and
eight minutes.
	   The loss reflected the kind of mixed year Sampras has had, by
his standards. He won Wimbledon and three other titles, but no
other Grand Slams.
	   Two Spaniards have never played in a final before in this
tournament. The last Spanish finalist was Manuel Orantes, who also
won what was then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston.
	   Although not known for his prowess on indoor courts, Moya
reached the semifinals of the championship last year in his first
appearance in the tournament and now has advanced to his first
final.
	   Corretja could become the first player to win the event in his
first attempt since John McEnroe in 1978.
	   Moya turned the match in the middle of the third set, when he
broke Henman's serve to tie the score at 3-3.
	   ``I played one of my best matches on indoor surfaces,'' said the
fifth-ranked Moya, adding that this was probably one his best three
matches all year.
	   ``I said when I came here that I wanted to win this
tournament,'' Moya said. ``Nobody believed me. Now it's just one
step away from me. I hope you realize when I talk, I'm not joking
at all.''
	   With Henman serving to stay in the match, Moya whipped a
backhand passing shot to gain a match point. He hit a tremendous
return winner past Henman to clinch the match after two hours and
20 minutes.
	   ``He definitely raised his game in those games that he broke me
at 3-2 and at the end,'' said Henman, who will move up two places
to a career-high No. 7 in the world in final 1998 rankings. ``He
came up with some great shots.''
	   Moya advanced to his fourth final of the year, the first not on
clay. He also won the Monte Carlo tournament.

	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A Virgin Islands
Police Department sergeant was among four people charged with
embezzlement and conspiracy for allegedly running a shoplifting
ring, police said.
	   The four, two of them employees of the Kmart at the Tutu Park
Mall on St. Thomas, stole various items from the store, said Police
Commissioner Ramon S. Davila. He did not know the total value of
items stolen, but he said more arrests were expected.
	   Among those charged was Sgt. Irma George, 45, who has worked for
the Virgin Islands Police Department for 18 years, 11 years as a
police officer.
	   ``George has been relieved of her duty and is on paid
administrative leave pending the outcome of the case,'' Davila
said.
	   Also arrested were two 20-year-old Kmart employees and the
24-year-old sister of one of them.

Russians capture all titles at the Cup of Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEONID CHIZHOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Alexei Urmanov completed a Russian title
sweep at the Cup of Russia, capturing the men's event Saturday for
his first major international victory this season.
	   Matching the success of their women teammates, the Russian men
captured all three medals in their event too.
	   The Cup of Russia is the fifth event in the International
Skating Union's Grand Prix Series, which features Olympic-eligible
skaters, and was held in Moscow for the first time.
	   Urmanov landed a triple flip-triple toe loop jump at the
beginning of his tango routine, but fell on a subsequent triple
axel-triple toe loop combination and stumbled on the next triple
axel.
	   ``I'm not satisfied with my skating today,'' Urmanov said,
lamenting his ``silly mistake.
	   ``Judges favored me today.''
	   He got mostly 5.7s for technical merit, and six judges gave him
the edge over Yevgeny Plushenko, who secured second place after the
short program.
	   Alexander Abt, skating a modern Egyptian theme, failed to land
three jumps and came in third.
	   Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, missed all of last season _
including a chance to repeat as Olympic champion _ but made his
return a rewarding one, winning a silver medal at the Goodwill
Games in New York. He finished third in Skate America, the first
event of the Series.
	   Russian pairs filled the ice dance podium steps as well.
	   World champions and Olympic silver medalists Angelika Krylova
and Oleg Ovsiannikov unveiled a controversial new program, a
routine with only drums and percussion instruments, at the Nations
Cup two weeks ago. It did not go over well.
	   Their reception in Moscow was better. They received one 5.9 for
technical merit and four more for presentation _ enough for a
first-place finish.
	   Before the event, Krylova defended the routine, saying, ``We're
world champions and we have a right to experiment.''
	   Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh were second, followed by
Tatiana Navka and Roman Kostamarov. All three pairs are coached by
Natalia Linichuk and Gennady Karponosov.
	   Even without Olympic champions competing this season, the
Russians have won fourteen of 20 titles as the International Figure
Skating Grand Prix Series reaches its finals with only one event
remaining.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians won four of the
eight events. They swept the titles in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and
added two more at the Lalique trophy competition in France. Like
Gelsenkirchen, they swpt all four in Moscow.
	   Men's gold medalist Ilia Kulik and pairs champion Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev have bypassed the Grand Prix series
this year, preferring to enter pro-ams and do the show circuit
while staying eligible for future Olympic competition.
	   Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov have split and are no longer
eligible. Yet even without them, the Russians have proved capable
of dominating the sport.
	   Winners in the Grand Prix receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can
accumulate points from two of the meets to qualify for the series
final in St. Petersburg, Russia, in March.
	   Urmanov and Abt have qualified for the finals as well as Russian
compatriots Yelena Sokolova and Maria Butyrskaya. Yelena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze, who won the pairs event in Moscow on
Friday, also have qualified.
	   The last qualifying event is the NHK Trophy next week in
Sapporo, Japan.

Dutch prince fills in for queen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander was a
last-minute replacement Saturday for his mother, Queen Beatrix,
whose Russia trip was postponed because of President Boris
Yeltsin's poor health.
	   The prince arrived in St. Petersburg for the presentation of two
cultural projects at the Hermitage museum, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. He was due to return to the Netherlands on Sunday.
	   Kremlin officials asked Queen Beatrix last week to postpone her
visit, which was to include a meeting with Yeltsin, to give the
ailing president time to recuperate from pneumonia.

Man dies as migrant boat struck by storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraklio, Greece (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish man drowned Saturday
when a Lebanese fishing boat crammed full with illegal migrants
lost its course in rough seas near the island of Crete.
	   Coast guard officials said the man fell overboard before the
vessel carrying 74 other migrants washed up on the north east coast
of the island.
	   The weary survivors, mostly Iraqi Kurds but also from other
countries, told police they had sailed from Lebanon and were bound
for Italy. They were all being held in the port city of Iraklio.
	   A boat captain and two alleged accomplices, all from Lebanon,
were arrested and due to be charged with migrant smuggling.
	   Tens of thousands of migrants cross into Greece illegally every
year. Most come from Albania but they also cross from the east,
heading over the border with Turkey or onto one of the islands in
the eastern Aegean Sea.
	   On Thursday, more than 150 illegal Kurdish immigrants were
discovered stranded on barren rocks near the island of Kasos after
being abandoned by smugglers.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire, French President Jacques Chirac said. But with
rebel groups apparently not consulted and vowing to battle on, the
accord was shrouded in doubt.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo had reached
a consensus to stop the war between rebels and forces loyal to
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   But, perhaps ominously, rebel leaders in Congo were not present
at Saturday's meeting having not been invited, raising doubts about
how a cease-fire could be put into effect without their consent.
	   At the frontline in Congo, rebel troops said Saturday the war
would go on regardless.
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime before a meeting of the
Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The secretary general has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of officials, including
Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are supporting the
insurgency. The heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.'' He did not refer to whether the rebels in
Congo had been consulted, or what their position now would be.
	   He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to
establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a
greater rapprochement,'' he said.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his
renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his
regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion,
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
	   At a noisy meeting with thousands of Congolese at a Paris hotel
later Saturday, Kabila said Uganda and Rwanda should be forced to
withdraw their support of the rebel insurgency.
	   ``We want to pressure public opinion in France and everywhere so
that this meeting will weigh heavily on the leaders of those
countries,'' Kabila told the boisterous audience, some of whom
banged drums and waved national flags.
	   He said 30,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops were currently in
Congo, and he emphasized that no agreement had yet been signed.
	   Kabila later met with Chirac at the Elysee Palace for a
scheduled meeting that lasted 30 minutes.
	   The purpose of the Paris talks on the sidelines of an African
summit on security was to try to work out some framework for peace
negotiations between the warring parties.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders _ especially those at
war in Congo _ to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Annan said many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of
intolerance'' and that the Congo conflict poses the continent's
greatest challenge.
	   Chirac on Friday urged African nations to do their own
peacekeeping _ a departure from past practices that put the burden
on France and other Western nations.
	   Thirty four African leaders attended the 20th French-African
summit. But throughout the summit, all eyes were on Kabila, who
finally sat down with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur
Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
	   At a state dinner Friday night, Kabila was the only African
leader Chirac did not publicly greet on the steps of the Elysee
Palace. Instead, Chirac welcomed the Congolese leader inside, far
from the cameras.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police shot dead Saturday an Iranian air
force deserter who had run amok, killing 14 people and wounding 11
others, the official news agency reported.
	   Siavosh Rahmani-Aqdam left his barracks ``with a firearm and a
large amount of cartridges several days ago,'' the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported late Saturday.
	   Earlier the agency had said Rahmani-Aqdam belonged to the army
and had gone AWOL on Thursday.
	   He quickly began a spree of indiscriminate shootings and had
killed six people by the time the police mounted a manhunt.
	   Police eventually shot him in a suburb of south Tehran, the
agency said.

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ A Glasgow businesswoman is betting on a
white Christmas, placing thousands of small wagers that could net
more than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 84,000) if it snows on Dec. 25.
	   Gillian Muir, who works for promotion company Morgan
Partnership, has placed 9,265 bets of 50 pence (dlrs 0.84) each
with a Glasgow betting shop. She said she plans to give the betting
slips away to business contacts.
	   With 10-1 odds, the holders would collect 5.50 (dlrs 9.24) each
if at least one snowflake flutters to the ground Christmas Day.
	   ``We believe this is the biggest bet ever placed on a White
Christmas _ it is certainly the greatest number of bets ever placed
by one person on anything,'' said Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for
the bookmaker, William Hill. ``It will also be one of the most
expensive Christmas gifts ever handed out should it snow at
Christmas.''

Thousands march for ETA prisoners, victims say peace process
</HEADLINE>
ignores them &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Thousands marched Saturday through this
northern city demanding an end to the government policy of keeping
imprisoned members of the armed Basque separatist group ETA in
jails far from their families in the northern Basque region.
	   The demonstrators, many linked to pro-independence political
parties and social groups, held placards displaying black and white
photos of prisoners.
	   The fate of ETA's 535 prisoners is at the center of the
fledgling peace process ushered in by an ETA cease-fire in place
since Sept. 18.
	   But while there have been moves towards peace talks over the
past two months, ETA has demanded a change in prison policy before
going to the table while the government has insisted that
negotiations cannot begin until the group renounces violence
forever.
	   ``We are not yet convinced that ETA has given up violence for
good, so the government will not be doing anything new in terms of
prison policy,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said on
national radio.
	   ETA is a Basque-language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom. Its bombing and shooting campaign in favor of a Basque
homeland straddling parts of northern Spain and southern France
began in 1968 and has left nearly 800 people dead.
	   Earlier Saturday in the nearby Basque city of San Sebastian
victims of the violence presented a document complaining that they
were not being taken into account in the peace process.
	   ``The victims are being asked to be generous, to forgive and
forget, but the assassins are not being forced to seek forgiveness
for their crimes,'' the document said according to the state-owned
news agency EFE.
	   There was also anger at being ``abandoned'' by religious and
state institutions, ``Every victim has a horror story to tell, not
just about the terrorists,'' EFE quoted the document as staying.
	   The document was signed by about 220 victims, or relatives of
the victims, of the violence, and named ETA as the major culprit
but also cited the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL.
	   The GAL was a government-linked death squad that killed 27
people between 1983 and 1987 in a bid to quash ETA. Many of its
victims were mistaken targets.

Yeltsin agrees to support new Russian center-right bloc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has agreed to support the
formation of a center-right political coalition that has rapidly
taken shape in the past week, a Kremlin official said Saturday.
	   The idea for the coalition has quickly gathered strength since
the killing of an outspoken liberal Duma deputy, Galina
Starovoitova, on Nov. 20. Oleg Sysuyev, the deputy head of the
Kremlin administration, said Yeltsin endorsed the idea, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   In Russia's skewed political spectrum, which is heavily weighted
by the Communist left, those in the center or moderate right are
considered liberals, and are the strongest advocates of free market
economic reforms.
	   Before her death, Starovoitova had said she hoped to run for
president in 2000. Her death focused the fears of those on the
center-right that they might lose power to leftist or nationalist
forces, and prompted talk of a coalition of like-minded parties and
individuals.
	   Sysuyev, speaking in a television interview, said it was
important that the coalition find a leader who can organize it and
set priorities, ``the sooner the better.''
	   One liberal leader, Boris Nemtsov, proposed that the movement be
led by his close ally and former counterpart as deputy prime
minister, Anatoly Chubais _ a man who is admired for his economic
acumen and widely reviled for his role in Russia's tainted
privatization program.
	   Nemtsov said he had tried to persuade Chubais to lead the
movement, ``although he was not delighted,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Nemtsov said he would consider leading the movement himself if
he believes he has support.
	   He said the coalition could consolidate three existing parties,
Our Home is Russia, Otechestvo (Fatherland) and Yabloko. Former
Prime Ministers Yegor Gaidar and Sergei Kiriyenko are among the
other organizers of the bloc.
	   Nemtsov said he thought Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov would
join the coalition, since ``these ideas approximate his own.'' But
Primakov, meeting regional leaders in southern Russia, declined to
even comment on the center-right bloc, saying he ``should be
neutral'' in his position as prime minister.
	   Parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, has predicted
that the group will quickly self-destruct in a battle over
leadership.

	   MAZATLAN, Sinaloa (AP) _ Men armed with assault rifles ambushed
a police patrol in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, killing two
officers and wounding two others, public security authorities said
Saturday.
	   Late Friday, about 20 men dressed in military-styled camouflage
clothing attacked the police patrol in La Noria, a small town which
is 35 kms (20 miles) northeast of the resort city of Mazatlan and
in a region known for illegal drug cultivation.
	   The gunmen opened fire, killing officers Jesus Guadalupe Coronel
Zamora and Victor Manuel Romero Navarro. Officer Julio Cesar
Estrada was shot seven times and was in critical condition Saturday
in a Mazatlan hospital. Police Cmdr. Julio Cesar Rueda Perez
suffered a wound to the leg.
	   Two local men who had been eating in a nearby restaurant also
were wounded.
	   The assailants fled toward a nearby village, where they briefly
held two hostages. They exchanged gunfire with pursuing police,
wounding 10 officers, before escaping.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Russia's Daria Timochenko impressed with
a triple lutz-double toe-loop combination and beat fellow teen-ager
Sarah Hughes to win the girls title Saturday at the World Junior
Figure Skating Championships.
	   The victory was the 18-year-old Timochenko's best result
following two second-place finishes on the junior Grand Prix
circuit and a silver in the Russian nationals.
	   Although a bit shaky on her landings, the second-year physical
education student at Moscow University recived scores of 5.3 to 5.6
for technical merit and 5.3 to 5.7 for artistry.
	   Thirteen-year-old Hughes was followed by another Russian,
Viktoria Volchokova, who took the bronze.
	   Timochenko led a Russian sweep of the individual titles at the
championships, where Russia claimed five medals of a possible 12.
Ilia Klimkin won the boys' title Thursday night.
	   Russia has won 14 of the 24 titles at the world juniors since
1994.
	   The other titles this week went to Americans Jamie Silverstein
and Justin Pekarek in the ice dancing and defending champions Yulia
Obertas and Dmitry Palamarchuk of Ukraine retained their pairs
crown.

	   LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmidt carried his
training success into competition on Saturday, scoring the two best
jumps of the day including a hill-record 136 meters to win the
season-opening World Cup ski jumping competition.
	   Schmidt, who had the best jumps in all practice sessions and the
qualifier, took the lead with a 127.5-meter jump and finished with
268.8 points, 7.7 points ahead of Jani Ahonen of Finland, who
jumped 124.5 and 130 meters.
	   Although the Finn's jumps were not long, he made up for it with
style points. That enabled Ahonen to beat Germany's Sven Hannawald,
who captured third with 251.1 points and two jumps at 126.5 and 128
meters.
	   The top three finished considerably ahead of the rest of the
field. Japanese Kasuyoshi Funaki and Noriaki Kasai were fourth and
fifth with 232.3 and 231.1 points.
	   Kasai had a chance to get close to Schmidt's 136-meter record
but he fell after landing a 135.5-meter leap on his second jump.

	   The GAL was a government-linked death squad that killed 27
people between 1983 and 1987 in a bid to quash ETA. Many of its
victims were mistaken targets.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ South African Hennie Walters shot a
5-under-par 67 Saturday and moved one stroke ahead of a trio of
players, including local hero Nick Price, to lead the Zimbabwe Open
after three rounds.
	   Despite bogeying No. 10 when he missed a putt from less than a
meter (3 feet), Walters birdied six others and will start Sunday's
final round with a 9-under 207.
	   ``I have a plastic-and-metal putting aid which forces the putter
in practice to travel along a fixed groove so as to make you repeat
the stroke exactly. It certainly worked for me today,'' said
Walters, who claimed he should have scored better after missing a
string of putts inside 3 meters (10 feet).
	   Price shot a 1-under 71 and was tied with South Africans Darren
Fitchardt and Tjaart van der Walt, who had rounds of 69 and 71.
	   Another South African Andrew McLardy was alone in fifth another
two strokes back at 210 after a course-record equalling round of
66, one of three on the day.
	   Zimbabwean Tony Johnstone was among a group of four at 211 after
a 71 and compatriots Mark McNulty and Marc Cayeux were at 212
following rounds of 69 and 67.
	   Cayeux has worked his way into a title chance after opening with
a 77 on Thursday.
	   Besides McLardy's 66, Canada's Doug McGuigan and South Africa's
Richard Fulford also matched the course record. McGuigan was five
strokes back with McNulty and Cayeux at 212 and Fulford was another
stroke back.
	   On Sunday, Price will be trying to win his third Zimbabwe Open
title in four years and become the first player to sucessfully
defend his title.
	   Organizers have moved up the start of Sunday's play by 40
minutes at Price's request so he can fly to a new course called
Leopard Creek on the edge of Kruger Park, South Africa's biggest
wildlife sanctuary, and play a charity match on Monday against
Ernie Els.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After gaining an extra week to decide whether to
allow the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Spanish charges
including genocide, Britain's government faced continuing pressure
from Chile Saturday to let the former dictator come home.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview. ``These processes are going on and I fully expect they
will result in justice.''
	   Fourteen lawsuits were already pending in Chile, and Pinochet
had no immunity from prosecution, said Insulza, who was himself an
exile during Pinochet's rule.
	   Chilean legal experts believe an extradition request by Chile
should take precedence over those from Spain or other European
nations who also want to try the 83-year-old former dictator,
because he is a Chilean and the alleged crimes were committed in
Chile.
	   Trying Pinochet at home, however, would face some complex
hurdles, as he has wide immunity as a life member of the Chilean
senate, and is further protected by an amnesty law he issued during
his regime.
	   ``I can assure you that the cases are going to be prosecuted,''
Insulza said at a news conference Saturday. ``I can never say that
somebody is going to be condemned until the trial is over, of
course.''
	   He added: ``I must remind you that there are several people in
jail in Chile for violations of human rights, condemned for
violations of human rights. So some cases have been opened,
accused, tried and condemned.''
	   In an interview on Spanish National Television TVE on Saturday,
Insulza said it is unlikely Pinochet could get a fair trial if the
former dictator is extradited to Spain.
	   ``A fair trial on this issue in Spain would be difficult given
the high level of emotion that this case has caused,'' Insulza
said. ``I believe that Pinochet has already been tried and
condemned in Spain.''
	   He said he will meet with Spanish officials about the
extradition.
	   ``I am going to Spain to talk about the case, I hope to meet
with everybody, here (in London) this was not possible, but I am
not going to make any specific requests,'' Insulza said.
	   Pinochet, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year rule,
remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he is
recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British police on
Oct. 16.
	   There was fresh evidence of strains in Chile's relations with
Britain. The Ministry of Defense said it has canceled plans for the
frigate HMS Sutherland to appear at a naval fair in the Chilean
port of Valparaiso, and the Foreign Office said it was temporarily
closing its consular office in the city. Four other British
consulates and the embassy in Santiago remain open.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
ordered Pinochet to appear in court on Dec. 11 to hear Straw's
decision, ``subject to any medical reports.''
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew President Salvador Allende. Allende died in
the coup.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A court on Saturday acquitted 10
former military state policemen of murder in the 1993 slaying of 21
residents of a Rio slum.
	   Judge Jose Geraldo Antonio said secretly taped jailhouse
confessions by other defendants showed the 10 didn't take part in
the massacre at the Vigario Geral slum on Rio's north side.
	   On Aug. 29, 1993, hooded gunmen entered the slum firing at
random. Investigators said they were from a police death squad out
to avenge the murder of four policemen there a day earlier by drug
traffickers.
	   During the five-day trial, defense lawyers said their clients
had been at home or on duty elsewhere on the night of the massacre.
	   The key evidence was the taped conversation inside the jail, in
which other defendants said the 10 were not involved.
	   In four previous trials of 52 officers accused in the massacre,
only two were convicted. Since 1996, judges have released 24
because of lack of evidence or confirmation of an alibi.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's government is debating
whether to file criminal charges against former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet for the disappearance of five Brazilians
under his regime, media reported Saturday.
	   Justice Minister Renan Calheiros will decide whether to pursue
the case, the Rio daily O Globo daily said.
	   The five vanished in 1973 and 1974. Their families are pressing
for Pinochet's prosecution.
	   Pinochet is under arrest in England pending a decision by
British Home Secretary Jack Straw on an extradition request by
Spain, which wants to try him for the torture and killing of
Spanish citizens.
	   Switzerland, France and Belgium also have filed extradition
proceedings against Pinochet.

	   MAZATLAN, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen ambushed a police patrol in the
northwest state of Sinaloa, killing two officers and wounding 12
more, authorities said Saturday.
	   Late Friday, about 20 men dressed in military-style camouflage
clothing attacked the patrol in La Noria, a small town 20 miles (35
kms) northeast of the resort city of Mazatlan. The region is known
for illegal drug cultivation.
	   The assailants fled to a nearby village, where they briefly held
two hostages, and exchanged gunfire with pursuing police before
escaping.
	   Two local men who had been eating in a restaurant were also
wounded by the gunfire.

Presidential advisor indicates Turabi might leave his post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Speculation increased Saturday that the
most influential person in Sudan's government, parliamentary
Speaker Hassan Turabi, would be leaving his post.
	   The president's legal adviser, Abdel-Basit Sabdarat, said his
chief would not ``intervene in the selection'' of a new speaker,
the official news agency SUNA reported.
	   Sabdarat did not say whether Turabi was leaving.
	   The government newspaper Al-Anbaa said Tuesday that Turabi would
be retiring as speaker to give more time to the National Congress,
which is effectively the ruling party.
	   Turabi has not commented on the report, but earlier this year he
expressed a desire to leave Parliament.
	   Turabi is widely regarded as the principal ideologue of the
military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Al-Anbaa said Turabi would announce his resignation before a new
law that legalizes ``political associations'' takes effect on Jan.
1. El-Bashir's government dissolved all political parties after it
seized power in 1989.

Prosecutor: Detectives making progress in slain lawmaker case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Detectives are making headway in the investigation
into the killing of a prominent Russian parliamentary leader, and
are hoping to track down witnesses, the country's prosecutor
general said Saturday.
	   ``This is the first time we've had such a situation on our
hands, when people are helping us very actively and there is a
large amount of information that we immediately analyze,'' Yuri
Skuratov said in a television interview.
	   The Nov. 20 killing of liberal leader Galina Starovoitova is
believed to have been a contract hit, a crime that is both common
and very rarely solved in Russia.
	   Skuratov said detectives are poring over material evidence left
at the scene, and that they are close to finding people ``who could
have witnessed this crime,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Starovoitova was one of the most prominent victims of violence
in post-Soviet Russia, and her death has rallied liberal forces in
the country and prompted numerous calls to crack down on
lawlessness and violence.

Congo cease-fire reached in Paris; but will rebels conform?

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire, French President Jacques Chirac said. But with
rebel groups apparently not consulted and vowing to battle on, the
accord was shrouded in doubt.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo had reached
a consensus to stop the war between rebels and forces loyal to
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   But, perhaps ominously, rebel leaders in Congo were not present
at Saturday's meeting having not been invited, raising doubts about
how a cease-fire could be put into effect without their consent.
	   At the frontline in Congo, rebel troops said Saturday the war
would go on regardless.
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime before a meeting of the
Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The secretary general has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of officials, including
Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are supporting the
insurgency. The heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.'' He did not refer to whether the rebels in
Congo had been consulted, or what their position now would be.
	   He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to
establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a
greater rapprochement,'' he said.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his
renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his
regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion,
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
	   In an interview with France Info radio, Kabila said: ``We will
add our signature,'' to the agreement.
	   ``But if they (the rebels) attack, if they advance, then we will
have to continue to defend ourselves,'' he warned, adding that the
cease-fire would only prosper if the rebels leave Congo.
	   Earlier, at a noisy meeting with thousands of Congolese at a
Paris hotel, Kabila said Uganda and Rwanda should be forced to
withdraw their support of the rebel insurgency.
	   ``We want to pressure public opinion in France and everywhere so
that this meeting will weigh heavily on the leaders of those
countries,'' Kabila told the boisterous audience, some of whom
banged drums and waved national flags.
	   He said 30,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops were currently in
Congo.
	   Kabila later met with Chirac at the Elysee Palace for 30
minutes.
	   The purpose of the Paris talks on the sidelines of an African
summit on security was to try to work out some framework for peace
negotiations between the warring parties.
	   Annan on Friday had urged African leaders _ especially those at
war in Congo _ to renounce violence and accept compromise to
achieve peace.
	   Annan said many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of
intolerance'' and that the Congo conflict poses the continent's
greatest challenge.
	   Thirty four African leaders attended the 20th French-African
summit. But throughout the summit, all eyes were on Kabila, who
finally sat down with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur
Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.

Four people killed by land mine in southern Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four people were killed Saturday when their
car detonated a land mine left over from Yemen's 1994 civil war,
police said.
	   The car was driving along a sand road near the city of Lahj, 35
kilometers (21 miles) north of the southern port of Aden, when the
mine exploded, a policeman said.
	   The blast killed three women and a man. A fifth passenger was
wounded, the policeman said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. He did not give the victims' names.
	   An estimated 100,000 land mines were planted during Yemen's
civil war. They have killed and maimed hundreds of people.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Several bands of showers and thunderstorms aligned southwest to
northeast developed across the local area this afternoon to produce
very heavy rainfall. In addition to these, an area of afternoon
showers and thunderstorms developed across the western half of the
Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. Doppler radar indicated several
areas of two-inch rainfall or greater throughout the afternoon,
mostly across interior and northeast Puerto Rico and the waters
just of the west coasts of the Virgin Islands.
	   A very wet weather scenario is shaping up for the local area
through Monday and possibly continuing into the middle of the
upcoming week. Abundant amounts of low-level moisture will move
from the Atlantic and eastern Caribbean into our local area through
Monday and combine with a middle to upper-level trough now moving
from the western Atlantic southeastward into Hispaniola. These
features will clash over our general area for the next 36 to 48
hours to produce periods of showers and thunderstorms, with
occasional heavy rainfall and flash flooding potential. Afternoon
showers and thunderstorms occurring across the area will continue
through the evening hours before beginning to diminish around
midnight. Activity is expected to continue overnight across the
coastal waters and across coastal sections of our islands.
	   A surface trough extending from northwestern Hispaniola
northeastward across the Atlantic was located out ahead of a
weakening cold front across the central Bahamas. This surface
trough will move southeast tonight and may move into our off shore
Atlantic waters on Sunday. Fresh to strong northeast winds will
build into the region with and behind this trough Sunday evening
through Monday and will begin to quickly deteriorate Atlantic
coastal seas. Mariners are urged to use caution out on the local
waters during this potentially very active weather period.

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A Royal Canadian Mounted
Police officer had her right leg amputated after she was wounded in
a shootout with a sex-crimes suspect who later killed himself,
police said Saturday.
	   The wounded constable, Laurie White, 27, was among three
officers dispatched to a townhouse in the northern coastal town of
Kitimat on Friday to investigate a report of alleged sex offenses.
	   After she was shot, she was airlifted to Vancouver General
Hospital, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her leg. Other
officers surrounded the townhouse, waiting for the gunman to
surrender.
	   Late Friday, officers heard a single shot. They entered the
building two hours later and found the lone male occupant dead of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Sgt. Russ Grabb.
	   The dead man was identified as Ronald Hoag, 44. Police declined
to give details about the sex-crimes investigation that prompted
the officers to be sent to his home.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A member of the Iranian air force left his
barracks with a gun, hijacked a van and went on a shooting spree
that left 14 people dead before police shot him to death Saturday,
the officials news agency reported.
	   Eleven people were wounded in the rampage. At least three of the
dead were policemen.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency gave few details of the events.
But it said that the soldier, identified as Siavosh Rahmani-Aqdam,
left his barracks Thursday ``with a firearm and a large amount of
cartridges.''
	   A manhunt was launched after the man killed six people on
Thursday. Police eventually shot him Saturday in a suburb of south
Tehran, the agency said.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second run. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Austrian Thomas Stangassinger, the
first-run leader, withstood a blistering second run by Frenchman
Sebastien Amiez to win a men's World Cup slalom Saturday on Aspen
Mountain.
	   Amiez stood a distant 22nd after the first run, 1.47 seconds
behind Stangassinger, but the Frenchman skied to a 42.54-second
final heat and took the provisional lead.
	   The next 20 skiers failed to better Amiez's two-run aggregate of
1 minute, 27.58 seconds. Stangassinger then put together a solid
second run of 43.75 that was only the 13th-fastest, but good enough
to beat Amiez with a cumulative 1:27.32.
	   Norway's Tom Stiansen was third in 1:27.69, followed by teammate
Kjetil Andre Aamodt in 1:27.70. Italian Angelo Weiss, who started
38th but placed ninth after the initial run, finished fifth in
1:27.82. Austrian Christian Mayer was sixth in 1:27.94.
	   Norwegian veteran Finn Christian Jagge, 28th after the first
run, finished seventh at 1:28.05, thanks to the fastest second run
of 42.46.
	   Two late-seeded skiers, Drago Grubelnik of Slovenia and Giorgio
Rocca of Italy, placed eighth and ninth, respectively, in 1:28.12
and 1:28.15.
	   Pierrick Bourgeat of France, who won a season-opening slalom
last Sunday in Park City, Utah, placed 10th in 1:28.16.
	   Austria's Mario Reiter, runner-up to Stangassinger and just .23
seconds off the pace after the first run, was having a quick second
run before he straddled the gate three from the finish. Norway's
Lasse Kjus and Canada's Thomas Grandi, who stood sixth and eighth,
respectively, after the first run, also missed gates on their
second runs.
	   Stangassinger, who finished second to Austrian Thomas Sykora in
last season's World Cup slalom standings, made no noticeable errors
on either of his runs down the icy courses that maintained their
firmness despite warm temperatures.
	   ``The second run was very tough for me,'' Stangassinger said.
``The snow was a little bit softer. The organization did a good job
on course preparation all weekend.
	   ``We have an early plane out of Denver, but I think we'll have
time to celebrate tonight.''
	   Mayer's sixth-place finish was worth 40 points and gave him 290,
enabling him to reclaim the World Cup overall lead from teammate
Stefan Eberharter by 10 points. Eberharter does not compete in
slalom.
	   In the first run, Norway's Hans-Petter Buraas and Austria's
Siegfried Voglreiter both were faster than Stangassinger at the
first intermediate clocking but carried too much speed into some
tight gates farther down the course and failed to finish.
	   Sykora underwent surgery on Monday to repair an injury to his
patellar tendon and is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks.

Rennes falters again in title challenge with loss to Nantes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Third-placed Rennes lost more ground on the top two
teams in the French championship on Saturday when it lost 3-2 at
home to Nantes.
	   The result leaves Rennes, a surprise early challenger for the
French title, nine points behind leader Marseille.
	   Rennes' challenge appears to be faltering. Last week it lost
disappointingly at Paris Saint-Germain.
	   Monaco, held 1-1 at Strasbourg, also missed its chance to make
up ground on the top teams.
	   Bastia climbed to sixth place with an emphatic 4-1 win against
Lyon.
	   In other games Saturday: Le Havre 2, Auxerre 1; Lorient 0, Nancy
1; Metz 3, Montpellier 1; Toulouse 1, Sochaux 1.
	   In Sunday's matches, league leader Marseille takes on archrival
Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade Velodrome.
	   Bordeaux, which lies one point behind Rolland Courbis' team,
plays at home to Lens.

Two policemen injured in scuffle over mayor charged with fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Two policemen suffered minor
injuries during a scuffle Saturday involving supporters of a mayor
accused of trying to extort dlrs 2.5 million from companies hired
to clean up after Hurricane Georges.
	   Meanwhile, two officials _ including one from his own party _
said Toa Alta Mayor Angel Rodriguez should resign immediately
because of the charges against him.
	   The policemen were injured in an incident at the Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport where supporters of Rodriguez had
gathered to greet him as he returned from spending Thanksgiving
with family in Philadelphia.
	   Police said a scuffle broke out after taxi drivers made negative
comments about Rodriguez and an argument ensued.
	   The two officers were treated and released and further
information on their injuries was not immediately available. Police
held two people for questioning but did not file charges.
	   Meanwhile, Comptroller Manuel Diaz Saldana, citing previous
critical audits of Toa Alta's municipal finances by his office and
by his predecessor, said Rodriguez should resign. Diaz Saldana,
like Rodriguez, is a member of the pro-statehood New Progressive
Party.
	   On Saturday, the president of the rival Popular Democratic
Party, Anibal Acevedo Vila, also called on Rodriguez to resign.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Speculation increased Saturday that the
most influential person in Sudan's government, parliamentary
Speaker Hassan Turabi, would be leaving his post.
	   The president's legal adviser, Abdel-Basit Sabdarat, said his
chief would not ``intervene in the selection'' of a new speaker,
the official news agency SUNA reported.
	   Sabdarat did not say whether Turabi was leaving.
	   The government newspaper Al-Anbaa said Tuesday that Turabi would
be retiring as speaker to give more time to the National Congress,
which is effectively the ruling party.
	   Turabi has not commented on the report, but earlier this year he
expressed a desire to leave Parliament.
	   Turabi is widely regarded as the principal ideologue of the
military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. His
departure from the speakership is not expected to reduce his role
as the power behind the scenes.
	   Al-Anbaa said Turabi would announce his resignation before a new
law that legalizes ``political associations'' takes effect on Jan.
1. El-Bashir's government dissolved all political parties after it
seized power in 1989.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire, French President Jacques Chirac said. But with
rebel groups in Congo vowing to battle on, the accord was shrouded
in doubt.
	   Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a summit of
African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo had reached
a consensus to stop the war between rebels and forces loyal to
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   But, perhaps ominously, rebel troops at the frontline in Congo
said they knew of no such plan, and vowed to battle on.
	   Brokered by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire
agreement was to be signed sometime before a meeting of the
Organization of African Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The secretary general has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   Annan presided at a two-hour meeting of officials, including
Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and Rwanda, who are supporting the
insurgency. The heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part.
	   Chirac said the meeting had been ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.'' He did not refer to whether the rebels in
Congo had been consulted, or what their position now would be.
	   He said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need to
establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a
greater rapprochement,'' he said.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his
renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his
regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion,
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
	   In an interview with France Info radio, Kabila said Saturday:
``We will add our signature,'' to the agreement.
	   ``But if they (the rebels) attack, if they advance, then we will
have to continue to defend ourselves,'' he warned, adding that the
cease-fire would only prosper if the rebels leave Congo.
	   The rebels were not invited to the Paris summit, and officials
did not say what their stance was, or whether they had been
consulted.
	   Only one rebel leader, Arthur Ngoma, attended the summit as an
observer, but could not be reached for comment.
	   Standing over a bridge over the wide, chocolate-colored Congo
River, a rebel commander, identified only by his first name
Gabriel, refused to believe such a deal could be struck.
	   ``Rwandans and Ugandans can agree upon whatever they want, but I
am a Congolese and I have a war to fight,'' he said. ``We have
started this war to kick Kabila out. We shall finish it.''

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 1.8 percent contraction of GDP, sted growth, in 2nd
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Bad weather and declining commodity
prices have ended Guyana's seven straight years of robust growth
and slowed the economy, said Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo.
	   Exports have declined and the Gross Domestic Product is expected
to decline 1.8 percent this year instead of growing 3.2 percent, as
originally projected, Jagdeo said at a press briefing Friday
evening.
	   Exports of sugar, still the country's principal foreign currency
earner, dropped by 10 percent and timber and other forest products
dropped 23.9 percent, he said.
	   Guyana suffered an extended drought last year that damaged a
variety of crops and was blamed on weather patterns caused by El
Nino.
	   The South American country also relies on exports of gold and
bauxite, and prices for such commodities have been low this year,
in part due to the worldwide economic slowdown.
	   Jagdeo said inflation was 4 percent.

Ten-man PSV settles for a point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven's recent recovery
was checked by a 2-2 draw with De Graafschap Doetinchem Saturday,
after its top-scoring striker Ruud van Nistelrooy was sent off.
	   PSV (6-5-4) is eighth in the league. Leader Feyenoord plays a
Rotterdam derby Sunday at Sparta as second-placed Ajax travels to
Vitesse Arnhem.
	   Van Nistelrooy heads the Dutch premiership with 13 goals and
came into the game fresh from a hat-trick Wednesday in the
Champions League.
	   In a strange twist of events after just 17 minutes, referee Dick
van Egmond adjudged the striker to have dived in the penalty box,
then produced a red card after Van Nistelrooy made a kicking motion
as he lay on the ground.
	   Van Egmond had already aroused the PSV crowd's anger after
awarding De Graafschap a free-kick for a back-pass to PSV keeper
Ronald Waterreus, from which Eric Viscaal opened the scoring.
	   Choral abuse from the home supporters caused the referee to
suspend play briefly after 25 minutes and PSV came back strongly to
lead 2-1 at the half after two goals from Belgian ace Luc Nilis.
	   But Viscaal netted his second a half hour into the second period
and De Graafschap departed happy with a point.
	   Saturday's other match, between NEC Nijmegen and RKC Waalwijk
was postponed due to an unplayable field. An early-morning pitch
inspection will determine whether the fixture can go ahead Sunday.
	   Friday saw Cambuur Leeuwarden down Fortuna Sittard 3-1 and Roda
JC Kerkrade edge MVV Maastricht 2-1.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The most influential person in Sudan's
government, parliamentary Speaker Hassan Turabi, appeared to have
decided to resign Saturday.
	   Deputy Speaker Ellison Magaia was quoted by the official
Egyptian news agency MENA as saying that Turabi would resign in
order to devote his time to the National Congress, which is
effectively the ruling party.
	   ``Turabi will continue heading the assembly until it approves
next year's budget on Dec. 17,'' MENA quoted Magaia as saying after
a meeting of leading legislators Saturday.
	   Earlier in the day, the president's legal adviser, Abdel-Basit
Sabdarat, announced that his chief would not ``intervene in the
selection'' of a new speaker, the official news agency SUNA
reported.
	   Sabdarat did not say that Turabi was leaving, but the
announcement set the stage for such a resignation.
	   The government newspaper Al-Anbaa had reported Tuesday that
Turabi would be retiring as speaker.
	   Al-Anbaa said Turabi would announce his resignation before a new
law that legalizes ``political associations'' takes effect on Jan.
1. Political parties have been banned since the military seized
power in 1989.
	   Turabi has not responded to the reports, but earlier this year
he expressed a desire to leave Parliament.
	   Turabi is widely regarded as the principal ideologue of the
military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. His
departure from the speakership is not expected to reduce his role
as the power behind the scenes.

Peru's journalists protest slander campaign Internet

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Journalists charged Saturday that a
Miami-registered Web page was financed by Peru's intelligence
service and was being used to slander and intimidate opposition
politicians and journalists.
	   The Web site, produced by a group calling itself the Pro-Defense
of the Truth Association, appeared a month ago and has scared
opponents of President Alberto Fujimori, who has close ties to the
intelligence service.
	   Human rights groups have long accused Peru's powerful National
Intelligence Service of trying to intimidate its opponents and
silence journalists who report on human rights abuses or
corruption.
	   The page, which contains more than 100 pages of text, has a
``white list'' and a ``black list'' of prominent politicians and
journalists in Peru, giving detailed biographies and personal
attacks on opposition figures.
	   Among the 13 people on the ``black list'' are the publisher of
Peru's main opposition newspaper, Gustavo Mohme, popular television
journalist Cesar Hildebrandt and Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade,
Fujimori's main political rival.
	   ``No one but the intelligence service could have the precise
biographical and personal details that appear'' on the Web page,
said political analyst Fernando Rospigliosi, who appears on the
``black list.''
	   He charges that the page is an attempt to discredit and
intimidate opponents of the government and intelligence service.
	   Angel Paez, head of the investigative unit of the daily La
Republica and another journalist on the ``black list,'' said the
site ``gathers all the articles written against me in the
pro-government newspapers'' and was part of a campaign ``apparently
by the intelligence services, against journalists who criticize
Fujimori and against opposition politicians.''
	   The page accuses Mohme, whose newspaper has broken stories on
death squad activity and torture within the intelligence service,
of treason, slandering the military and having ties to leftist
guerrillas.
	   ``Before long he will face popular justice at the hands of
Peruvians,'' the page said about Mohme.
	   The Web page was registered on the Internet on Oct. 29 in Miami
by a woman with a Peruvian accent calling herself Blanca Rivera,
Peru's largest newspaper El Comercio reported.
	   The newspaper said its investigation showed that the telephone
and address she gave on the registration form appear to be false.
	   Although it does not identify its author, the page says its
creators are: ``a group of professionals, university students and
people like you'' who are alarmed by the existence of ``bad
intentions, disinformation, distortion and the manipulation of the
truth.''
	   The address of the Web page is: www.aprodev.org.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British government on Saturday night was close
to a deal that would send Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile to
stand trial there, two newspapers reported in Sunday editions.
	   Citing unnamed government sources, the Sunday Telegraph and The
Observer reported that the compromise deal is seen as the best way
to avoid the diplomatic and economic consequences of allowing the
83-year-old former dictator to be extradited to Spain to stand
trial on charges including genocide and murder.
	   It would solve the dilemma facing Home Secretary Jack Straw, who
would never be forgiven by some sections of his Labor Party if he
allowed Pinochet to escape prosecution, and would keep trade
relations with Chile from being damaged, the newspapers said.
	   Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to extradite Pinochet.
	   The government faced continuing pressure from Chile Saturday to
let the former dictator come home.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview. ``These processes are going on and I fully expect they
will result in justice.''
	   Fourteen lawsuits were already pending in Chile, and Chilean
legal experts believe an extradition request by Chile should take
precedence over those from Spain or other European nations who also
want to try Pinochet, because he is a Chilean and the alleged
crimes were committed in Chile.

Sudan's Hassan Turabi has reportedly decided to resign from
</HEADLINE>
parliamentary post &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The most influential person in Sudan's
government, parliamentary Speaker Hassan Turabi, told fellow
lawmakers Saturday that he will resign from the speaker's post, a
report said.
	   Deputy Speaker Ellison Magaia was quoted by the official
Egyptian news agency MENA as saying that Turabi would resign in
order to devote his time to the National Congress, which is
effectively the ruling party.
	   ``Turabi will continue heading the assembly until it approves
next year's budget on Dec. 17,'' MENA quoted Magaia as saying after
a meeting of leading legislators Saturday.
	   Turabi is widely regarded as the principal ideologue of the
military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. His
departure from the speakership was not expected to result in a
reduction in his role as the power behind the scenes.
	   Earlier in the day, the president's legal adviser, Abdel-Basit
Sabdarat, announced that his chief would not ``intervene in the
selection'' of a new speaker, the official Sudanese news agency
SUNA reported.
	   The government newspaper Al-Anbaa had reported Tuesday that
Turabi would be retiring as speaker.
	   Al-Anbaa said Turabi would announce his resignation before a new
law that legalizes ``political associations'' takes effect on Jan.
1. Political parties have been banned since the military seized
power in 1989.
	   Turabi has not responded to the reports, but earlier this year
he expressed a desire to leave Parliament.

French Prime Minister outlines measures to compensate Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday
that France will create a centralized body to investigate
restitution claims from heirs and descendants of Jews whose
property was confiscated during World War II.
	   Jospin told Jewish leaders that the government would put an
additional 10 million francs (dlrs 1.75 million) to boost staff
working on satisfying individual slaims.
	   ``For France, it's a question of learning from its history and
of making reparations where necessary,'' Jospin told the annual
dinner hosted by the Representative Council of French Jewish
Institutions, (CRIF).
	   Fifty-three years after the close of the war, France is still
plagued by accusations that it is hesitant to face its pro-Nazi
collaborationist past.
	   Jospin denied suggestions that a government-appointed commission
of experts investigating the widespread, systematic plundering of
Jewish property met resistance from French banks and insurance
companies thought to hold unclaimed Jewish assets.
	   ``The deliberate discreet nature of its work should not mask the
scale and quality of the results it has already achieved thanks to
the active participation of the state agencies concerned,'' Jospin
said.
	   Jospin said the commission would complete its probe by the end
of 1999. He said a French delegation of officials and experts would
attend the meeting in Washington D.C. that starts Monday on looted
Jewish assets.
	   He praised France's national museum authority for doing its
utmost to track down the owners or heirs of some 2,000 pieces of
unclaimed art in its possession.
	   Jospin also announced a 50 million franc grant (dlrs 8.7
million) to transform the Memorial to the Jewish Martyr in central
Paris into a ``genuine holocaust museum,'' complete with a wall
listing the names of the 76,000 Jews deported from France to
Hitler's death camps. Only 2,500 survived.
	   France recently pledged 20 million francs (dls 3.5 million) to
an international fund to compensate victims of Nazi persecution.
Jospin said the decision did not ``extinguish France's
responsibility to compensate French victims of their families
today.''
	   Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld called Jospin's proposals very
positive. ``I only hope that the funds will go to the real victims
of wartime persecution, that is the children who lost both parents,
who grew up without affection and financial support and who today
are elderly and poor.''

want to try Pinochet, because he is a Chilean and the alleged
crimes were committed in Chile.

Ten-man PSV settles for a point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Eric Viscaal scored his second
goal with 15 minutes remaining and gave De Graafschap Doetinchem a
2-2 draw with a 10-man PSV Eindhoven Saturday.
	   PSV played the final 73 minutes without striker Ruud van
Nistelrooy, who leads the Dutch first division with 13 goals and
was coming off a three-goal match against HJK Helsinki in a 3-1
European Champions League victory on Wednesday.
	   The draw improved PSV to 6-5-4 and 23 points, good enough for
eighth place.
	   League leader Feyenoord plays a Rotterdam derby Sunday at Sparta
and second-placed Ajax travels to Vitesse Arnhem.
	   Saturday's other match, between NEC Nijmegen and RKC Waalwijk
was postponed due to an unplayable field. An early-morning pitch
inspection will determine whether the fixture can go ahead Sunday.
	   Friday saw Cambuur Leeuwarden beat Fortuna Sittard 3-1 and Roda
JC Kerkrade edge MVV Maastricht 2-1.
	   At Eindhoven, PSV placed itself in a hole when referee Dick van
Egmond determined Van Nistelrooy dived in the penalty area and red
carded him after Van Nistelrooy made a kicking motion as he lay on
the ground.
	   Van Egmond already had aroused the PSV crowd's anger after
awarding De Graafschap a free kick for a back-pass to PSV keeper
Ronald Waterreus, from which Viscaal opened the scoring.
	   Choral abuse from the home supporters caused the referee to
suspend play briefly after 25 minutes and PSV came back strongly to
lead 2-1 at the half after two goals from Belgian Luc Nilis.
	   But Viscaal netted his second a half hour into the second period
and De Graafschap departed happy with a point.

Largest party dumps candidate in effort to stop ex-coup leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's largest political party
dumped its presidential candidate and will back an independent,
Yale-educated businessman in a last-ditch effort to stop a former
coup leader from winning the Dec. 6 race.
	   Leaders of the center-left Democratic Action said Saturday the
party will support former state governor Henrique Salas Romer, who
is in second place in polls behind former paratrooper Hugo Chavez.
	   After a raucous debate at a meeting Friday night, party
delegates dropped long-time party leader Luis Alfaro Ucero as their
candidate. Alfaro, 77, is a distant third in the polls.
	   Alfaro refused to quit the race and may remain on the ballot as
the party's official candidate. However, his campaign manager quit,
the party withdrew financial support and TV ads for him, and party
leaders said their powerful political machine would be behind Salas
on election day.
	   Salas, 62, an independent, has said he would accept the party's
support but that he would not give any guarantees to bring the
party into power if he wins. Many Venezuelans blame the country's
traditional parties for squandering the world's largest oil
reserves outside the Middle East.
	   Chavez, 44, is drawing support from the poor who see him as a
hero partly because of his tough anti-corruption talk. The middle
and upper-class fear he will impose a leftist dictatorship and are
largely backing Salas.
	   Democratic Action officials said the threat to democracy posed
by Chavez, who tried to overthrow the government in 1992, forced
them to back Salas.
	   The party ``has responsibly put aside partisan attitudes since
... Venezuela is first,'' said party Secretary-General Lewis Perez,
a long-time Alfaro supporter.
	   The party's backing was expected by many analysts to boost
Salas's chances of victory, although Chavez said he believed he
would get many of the party's votes.
	   Venezuela's other major traditional party, the social Christian
COPEI, also has been wracked by turmoil, with many members
clamoring for the party to drop its candidate, former Miss Universe
Irene Saez, and support Salas.
	   Saez, an independent who accepted COPEI's support, says she is
staying in the race, though the party is expected to make a final
decision this week.

New Miss World says she was raped in Italy last month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The new Miss World, Israel's Linor Abargil, says
she endured a two-hour sexual assault last month while in Italy for
a fashion show, British newspapers reported in Sunday's editions.
	   Miss Abargil, the reigning Miss Israel who was crowned Miss
World Saturday night, was attacked Oct. 6 after going to a travel
agency to buy a plane ticket to Rome, where she planned to meet her
mother before flying home, several newspapers reported.
	   The Egyptian owner of the travel agency has since been arrested
and charged with the rape, the newspapers said.
	   The man, who was not named in the report, offered to drive Miss
Abargil to Rome himself because he had business there and all
flights were booked, the newspapers said. Shortly after starting
out, he pulled off the road, tied her up and assaulted her.
	   After the attack, he tried to apologize as he drove had back to
Milan, the reports said. In the morning, Miss Abargil caught a
train to Rome and went with her mother to tell police there what
had happened, the newspapers reported.
	   Police in Milan released details of an assault on an Israeli
model at the time, and on Friday confirmed the victim's identity to
Ansa, Italy's government-backed national news agency, the
newspapers reported.

Lehman's birdie run continues in Skins Game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ It was yesterday once more for Tom
Lehman in the Skins Game.
	   The defending champion carried over the birdie binge he began
last year as a rookie participant, making five more Saturday that
helped him win five skins and dlrs 150,000.
	   Mark O'Meara, the U.S. Masters and British Open champion, rolled
in a 7 1-2-meter (25-foot) birdie putt on the 8th hole worth four
skins and dlrs 150,000. He and Lehman tied a Skins record for most
money won on a Saturday.
	   Australia's Greg Norman, making a comeback from shoulder
surgery, and Fred Couples, the career leader in Skins money and
holes won, were shut out over the first nine holes at Rancho La
Quinta Country Club.
	   ``There's plenty of time left,'' Couples said. ``If you're not
going to get any (skins), today is a good day not to.''
	   The foursome will play nine holes Sunday with dlrs 700,000 of
the dlrs 1 million pursue still up for grabs.
	   Lehman, who hasn't won on the U.S. PGA Tour in two years, made
10 birdies last year, giving him 15 in 27 holes of Skins
competition.
	   ``It's nice to play when you know that a bogey is not going to
cost you anything,'' he said. ``Sometimes when things get going
well, you start building on it. You're allowed to get aggressive
and you don't really make little mistakes and you shoot some low
scores.''
	   Lehman came alive at the par-3, 140-yard (126-meter) 3rd hole.
His tee shot landed on the back of the small green and he rolled in
a 3 1-2-meter (12-foot) birdie putt to collect three skins worth
dlrs 75,000. Couples' attempt from 3 1-2 meters (12 feet) that
would have tied Lehman missed to the right.
	   No one won the first two holes worth dlrs 25,000 each, so the
money was carried over to the 3rd. Lehman also won a 1999 Toyota
Camry automobile for his designated charities on the hole.
	   Lehman earned dlrs 25,000 on the 4th hole with an 2 1-2-meter
(8-foot) birdie. He finished off the day with a 30-centimeter
(1-foot) birdie putt on the 9th hole worth dlrs 50,000.
	   O'Meara matched Lehman's money haul on the 8th hole. His 6-iron
shot landed about 7 1-2 meters (25 feet) left of the flag, he sank
the birdie putt and then watched the others miss putts. O'Meara
also won a 1999 Camry for his charity.
	   Norman struggled off the tee all afternoon, driving into the
rough on the 1st, 4th, 5th and 7th holes, into the water on No. 2
and missing the green on No. 6. He had six pars, two bogeys and one
birdie over nine holes.
	   ``You've got to get back in the groove,'' said Norman, playing
his second event since missing seven months because of surgery.
``It's just getting your timing and rhythm back. It's not easy to
jump right back in the saddle.''
	   O'Meara's only major gaffe came on No. 6 when he mistakenly
picked up Couples' marker. O'Meara conceded the putt to Couples,
who replaced his coin and made the putt to halve the hole. Play was
briefly delayed when Norman sought a ruling.
	   ``I messed up,'' O'Meara said. ``Maybe I fell asleep, but I just
assumed the other guys would give him that putt and I picked up his
coin. Obviously, it's going to change how (Greg) is going to play
the hole. He just wanted to make sure that Fred's putt was good. If
it wasn't good, then he's got to try and be a little bit more
conservative on his chip shot.''
	   Norman's chip rolled 2 1-2 meters (8 feet) past the hole.

Atletico beats Barcelona 1-0 in centennial match disappointment for
</HEADLINE>
Catalan giants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _A penalty successfully converted by
Vladimir Jugovic of Yugoslavia was enough to give Atletico de
Madrid a 1-0 victory over FC Barcelona in the 12th-round of the
Spanish soccer league Saturday.
	   The win took Atletico into 3rd place with 20 points, two points
behind the leader Mallorca, while Barcelona moved down to No. 4
with 19 points. The remainder of the round's matches were due
Sunday except Real Madrid vs. Salamanca which has been postponed
until Jan. 6.
	   Jugovic's penalty came in the 39th minute, earned when Jose Mari
Romero went down in the box following a tackle by Dutchman Michael
Reiziger.
	   For the home crowd the loss was particularly disappointing in a
match that kicked off after the team's famous Camp Nou stadium
staged a spectacle to inaugurate its centennial celebrations.
	   The defeat also came immediately after Barcelona was eliminated
from the European Champions' League.
	   Further, the draw failed to live up to expectations of the
traditional fiesta of goals that has tended to mark
Barcelona-Atletico matches _ an average of 5.8 in the last 10
years.
	   Barcelona only managed one clear opportunity in the first half,
when Patrick Kluivert of Holland hit the far post with a
right-footed smash in the 24th minute.
	   The pace of play picked up after the break, but the scoreline
remained unchallenged and Barcelona fans waved white handkerchiefs
of shame at Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal whose position at the club
looked more than ever in doubt.
	   Sunday's games see table topper Real Mallorca traveling to play
struggling Athletic de Bilbao and second-placed Celta de Vigo at
home against No. 5 Valencia
	   Betis faces struggling Tenerife, Extremadura, with just two
goals scored all season, takes on mid-table Espanyol, Valladolid
hosts Deportivo La Coruna, Villlarreal takes on Alaves, Zaragoza
faces Oviedo and Racing plays Real Sociedad.
	   Real Madrid's match against Salamanca was postponed until Jan. 6
because of its trip to Tokyo to play the Brazilian team Vasco de
Gama in the World Club Championship on Dec. 1.

Stangassinger survives another late challenge to win slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Optional lead with more quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Opponents keep throwing quick second runs
at Thomas Stangassinger, which is just fine with the veteran
Austrian skier _ as long as the results remain constant.
	   In the 1994 Olympic slalom, Alberto Tomba came from far off the
pace with a blistering second run to momentarily overtake first-run
leader Stangassinger, but the Austrian won.
	   On Saturday, it was Frenchman Sebastien Amiez clocking a fast
second heat, and again Stangassinger, the first-run leader,
withstood the challenge to win a men's World Cup slalom on Aspen
Mountain.
	   Amiez stood a distant 22nd after the first run, 1.47 seconds
behind Stangassinger, but the Frenchman skied to 42.54-second
second heat.
	   The next 20 skiers failed to better Amiez's two-run aggregate of
1 minute, 27.58 seconds. Stangassinger then put together a solid
second run of 43.75 that was only the 13th-fastest but was good
enough to hold off Amiez with a cumulative time of 1:27.32.
	   ``I knew Amiez must have had a special run,'' Stangassinger
said. ``I had to wait a very long time for my second run, and I
knew the snow was getting softer.
	   ``I tried to have an easy, good run. I tried to find a feeling
and not be too fast through the first gates. My skiing style is to
look for the cleanest line. It was enough.''
	   Norway's Tom Stiansen was third in 1:27.69, followed by teammate
Kjetil Andre Aamodt in 1:27.70. Italian Angelo Weiss, who started
38th but placed ninth after the initial run, finished fifth in
1:27.82. Austrian Christian Mayer was sixth in 1:27.94.
	   Norwegian veteran Finn Christian Jagge, 28th after the first
run, wound up seventh at 1:28.05, thanks to the fastest second run
of 42.46.
	   Two late-seeded skiers, Drago Grubelnik of Slovenia and Giorgio
Rocca of Italy, placed eighth and ninth, respectively, in 1:28.12
and 1:28.15.
	   Pierrick Bourgeat of France, who won a season-opening slalom
last Sunday in Park City, Utah, placed 10th in 1:28.16.
	   Austria's Mario Reiter, runner-up to Stangassinger and just .23
seconds off the pace after the first run, was having a quick second
run before he straddled the third gate from the finish. Norway's
Lasse Kjus and Canada's Thomas Grandi, who stood sixth and eighth,
respectively, after the first run, also missed gates on their
second runs.
	   Stangassinger, who finished second to Austrian Thomas Sykora in
the World Cup slalom standings the last two years, made no
noticeable errors on either of his runs down the icy courses that
maintained their firmness despite warm temperatures.
	   ``The organization did a good job on course preparation all
weekend,'' said Stangassinger, who posted his ninth career slalom
victory. ``We have an early plane out of Denver, but I think we'll
have time to celebrate tonight.''
	   Amiez, who won the World Cup slalom title in 1996, said his
first run ``was no good. It's the first time in my career I've been
so slow. I was upset between runs and said to myself: Let's go for
it.
	   ``When I finished the second run in front of Jagge, I had a good
feeling. I was starting to hope for a top-10 finish. Then, as each
racer came down, I realized I could finish higher.''
	   Mayer's sixth-place finish was worth 40 points and boosted his
total to 290, enabling him to reclaim the World Cup overall lead
from teammate Stephan Eberharter by 10 points. Eberharter does not
compete in slalom.
	   In the first run, Norway's Hans-Petter Buraas and Austria's
Siegfried Voglreiter both were faster than Stangassinger at the
first intermediate clocking but carried too much speed into some
tight gates farther down the course and failed to finish.
	   Sykora underwent surgery on Monday to repair an injury to his
patellar tendon and is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks.
	   The men's tour moves to Whistler Mountain, Canada, next weekend
for a downhill and super-G.

Another `Old Man' excels at Aspen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Skiing-Men-Slalom &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colo. (AP) _ While Thomas Stangassinger, age 33,
celebrated victory, another 30-something slalom skier had reason to
pat himself on the back.
	   After a simply terrible first run in Saturday's men's World Cup
slalom, 32-year-old Finn Christian Jagge responded with the fastest
run of the afternoon. It was so fast, in fact, that he improved an
incredible 21 places to finish seventh overall.
	   ``Yeah, it was pretty good. For once, I was lucky with the
conditions. It was pretty soft the second run so I could climb a
few places,'' Jagge said. ``The top wasn't that good but the lower
part I really had a good run. It felt good.''
	   Jagge led after the first run of the season-opening slalom in
Park City, Utah, last weekend, only to fall victim along with many
others to a badly rutted course in the second heat. He dropped to
fourth.
	   The Norwegian had similar troubles in Saturday's first run,
failing to cope with the ice at the top of the trail. He figured
there was no way he made the field of 30 for the second run.
	   ``I was already on the plane going home, but I had to come up
for the second run and I'm glad,'' he said. ``On the second run,
there was no ice problem and I was starting so far back that I
could go all out.
	   ``That's what I should do all the time. It's what I did in Park
City.''
	   Jagge, the 1992 Olympic slalom champion, trailed Stangassinger,
the 1994 gold medalist, by 2.02 seconds in the morning run. He made
up 1.29 in the afternoon, yet felt he could have done even better.
	   ``It's a bit annoying to see how close I came to the podium,''
he said. ``I could have skied better on the top the second run. The
first run was terrible anyway but I could have done something more
in the second, I feel.''
	   Although he has little to show after putting up two of the
season's four fastest slalom times, Jagge figures he is on the
verge of winning.
	   ``The first race boosted my confidence. I know I'm up there when
I ski well,'' he said. ``But with this competition you really have
to ski well, give your best, or you don't have a chance.''

Bad weather, world commodity prices push Guyana into slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Bad weather and declining commodity
prices have ended Guyana's seven straight years of robust growth
and slowed the economy, the country's finance minister has said.
	   Exports have declined and the Gross Domestic Product is expected
to decline 1.8 percent this year instead of growing 3.2 percent, as
originally projected, Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo said at a
news conference Friday evening.
	   Exports of sugar, still the country's principal foreign currency
earner, dropped by 10 percent and timber and other forest products
dropped 23.9 percent, he said.
	   Guyana, an English-speaking country on South America's northern
coast, suffered an extended drought last year that damaged a
variety of crops and was blamed on weather patterns caused by El
Nino.
	   The country also relies on exports of gold and bauxite, and
prices for such commodities have been low this year, in part due to
the worldwide economic slowdown.
	   Jagdeo said inflation was 4 percent.

Atletico beats Barcelona 1-0, ruins Barca's centennial ceremony

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Yugoslav midfielder Vladimir Jugovic
converted a 39th-minute penalty and Atletico Madrid won 1-0 to
spoil FC Barcelona's celebratrions to commemorate its 100th
anniversary.
	   The victory improved Atletico to 6-2-4 and 20 points, same as
second-placed Celta but just behind on goal differnce and two
points behind league leader Mallorca.
	   Barcelona dropped to 5-4-2 and fourth place with 19 points. The
remainder of the 12th round was to be played Sunday except for the
Real Madrid vs. Salamanca match, which has been postponed until
Jan. 6.
	   Jugovic's penalty came after Jose Mari Romero was tackled by
Dutchman Michael Reiziger.
	   For the home crowd the loss was particularly disappointing in a
match that kicked off after the team staged a spectacle at famous
Camp Nou Stadium to inaugurate its centennial celebrations.
	   The defeat also came immediately after Barcelona was eliminated
from the European Champions' League.
	   Additionally, the match failed to live up to expectations of the
traditional fiesta of goals that has marked Barcelona-Atletico
matches over the last decade _ an average of 5.8 in the last 10
years.
	   Barcelona only managed one clear opportunity in the first half,
when Dutch midfielder Patrick Kluivert hit the post with a
right-footed smash in the 24th minute.
	   The pace of play picked up after the break, but Barcelona fans
waved white handkerchiefs in derision at Dutch coach Louis Van
Gaal, whose job looked in doubt more than ever.
	   Sunday's games see Real Mallorca traveling to play struggling
Athletic Bilbao and second-placed Celta Vigo at home against
fifth-placed Valencia
	   Betis faces struggling Tenerife; Extremadura, which has scored
only two goals all season, takes on mid-table Espanyol; Valladolid
hosts Deportivo La Coruna; Villlarreal takes on Alaves; Zaragoza
faces Oviedo; and Racing plays Real Sociedad.
	   Real Madrid's match against Salamanca was postponed until Jan. 6
because of its trip to Tokyo to play the Brazil's Vasco da Gama in
the Toyota Cup on Tuesday.

Austrian Goetschl grabs second downhill win at Lake Louise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Adds details, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE LOUISE, Alberta (AP) _ Austrian Renate Goetschl won her
second women's World Cup downhill in as many days Saturday, winning
by more than a half second.
	   The 23-year-old Goetschl, who started 12th in the fog-delayed
race in this Rocky Mountain resort, blazed down the 2.7-kilometer
course in 1 minute, 35.36 seconds.
	   Austria apeared headed for a sweep podium sweep at one point on
the day, but Italy's Isolde Kostner claimed second _ as she did on
Friday _ in 1:35.92 and Germany's Regina Haeusl took third in
1:35.95.
	   ``I hope I'm making people forget about Katja Seizinger a little
bit,'' said the reserved Goetschl, who finished second overall in
the World Cup downhill and super-giant slalom standings behind
Seizinger last year.
	   ``I'm having fun because in the last few years the Germans were
always running in front of us.''
	   Seizinger is not on the World Cup circuit this season after
injuring a knee in training this summer.
	   ``We've had a lot of good training, Friday was a good start for
us,'' Goetschl said. ``Somebody told me this morning I had to win
again, but I wasn't feeling any pressure.''
	   The course ran faster after a night of cooler temperatures and
light snow, although most of the racers are finding the normally
tough mountain easier than last year.
	   Haeusl found particular pleasure in her third-place finish
because it amounted to a bit of revenge against Austrian Michaela
Dorfmeister.
	   Dorfmeister was second provisionally on Saturday with a time of
1:36.20, but she was pushed into third by Kostner and then into
fourth by Haeusl.
	   At the Winter Olympics in Japan, Dorfmeister came from a late
starting position to bounce Haeusl from a potential bronze medal in
the super-giant slalom
	   ``Michaela came up to me and said: `I guess that was for the
Olympics,''' Haeusl said with a smile. ``But I would rather have
had the Olympic one.''
	   Haeusl said the podium finish was important for the German team
because it shows it can win without Seizinger.
	   ``I needed this very much for my self-confidence,'' Haeusl said.
``It was also important for our team because people are always
asking us about Seizinger.''

Kotiev retains WBO title against Cardona
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUBECK, Germany (AP) _ Russia's Ahmed Kotiev won a hard-fought
12-round decision Saturday over Puerto Rico's Santos Cardona to
defend his WBO welterweight title for the second time.
	   Kotiev, who ran his record to 23-0 with 14 knockouts, took a
decisive llth round in which the Puerto Rican also had a point
discounted for low blows.
	   The judges ruled the fight 115-112, 115-112 and 116-112 for the
Russian.
	   Although both fighters were the same height, Cardona used a
four-inch reach advantage to pressure the Russian. After the fifth,
he repeatedly backed Kotiev onto the ropes with flurries of
punches.
	   But it was Kotiev who landed the harder blows, rocking Cardona
with a combination to the head in the seventh round.
	   Cardona, whose record fell to 37-8 with 26 knockouts, also got
stung with a left uppercut in the third and a combination in the
following round.
	   Kotiev, 30, won the title by decision on Feb. 14 against Leonard
Townsend of the United States.
	   Both fighters weighed 66. 4 kilos (146 pounds).

New World says she was raped in Italy last month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian police confirmed that the new World,
Israel's Linor Abargil, reported that she was attacked last month
while in Italy for a fashion show, British newspapers reported in
Sunday's editions.
	   Abargil, the reigning Israel who was crowned World Saturday
night, told police she was attacked Oct. 6 after going to a travel
agency to buy a plane ticket to Rome, where she planned to meet her
mother before flying home, The Times of London and several other
newspapers reported.
	   The Egyptian owner of the travel agency has since been arrested
and charged in the attack, the newspapers said.
	   Julia Morley, one of the organizers of the World competition,
told The News of the World that she nor Abargil would comment on
the rape report. Abargil could not be reached, and a family member
who answered the phone at Abargil's home in Jerusalem declined to
comment.
	   ``For legal reasons, absolutely no comment can be made by Linor
or myself,'' Morely was quoted as saying.
	   Abargil told police that the man, who was not named in the
reports, offered to drive her to Rome himself because he had
business there and all flights were booked, the newspapers said.
She told police that he pulled off the road shortly after starting
out, tied her up and sexually assaulted her.
	   ``It went on and on for about two hours,'' The News of the World
quoted Abargil as telling Italian police.
	   Abargil told police that after the attack, he tried to apologize
as he drove had back to Milan, the newspapers said. In the morning,
Abargil caught a train to Rome and went with her mother to tell
police there what had happened, the newspapers reported.
	   Police in Milan released details of an assault on an Israeli
model at the time, and on Friday confirmed the victim's identity to
Ansa, Italy's government-backed national news agency, the
newspapers reported.
	   Details of the ordeal were uncovered by Guido Columba of the
Ansa news agency.
	   ``When I heard an Israeli girl won the ( World) contest, I
suddenly remembered we had written a piece in October about an
Israeli model,'' Columba told The Times. ``I decided to check it
out and went to the Borgho police station. They let me check the
documents for October, and I compared the names. I couldn't believe
my eyes when I saw the name.''

Largest party dumps candidate in effort to stop ex-coup leader

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's largest political party
dumped its presidential candidate and will back an independent,
Yale-educated businessman in a last-ditch effort to stop a former
coup leader from winning the Dec. 6 race.
	   Leaders of the center-left Democratic Action said Saturday the
party will support former state governor Henrique Salas Romer, who
is in second place in polls behind former paratrooper Hugo Chavez.
	   After a raucous debate at a meeting Friday night, party
delegates dropped long-time party leader Luis Alfaro Ucero as their
candidate. Alfaro, 77, is a distant third in the polls.
	   Alfaro refused to quit the race and may remain on the ballot as
the party's official candidate. However, his campaign manager quit,
the party withdrew financial support and TV ads for him, and party
leaders said their powerful political machine would be behind Salas
on election day.
	   Salas, 62, an independent, said Saturday night that he would
accept the party's support but indicated he would give no guarantee
to bring the party into power if he wins. Many Venezuelans blame
the country's traditional parties for squandering the world's
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.
	   ``Here there are no pacts, either open or hidden,'' he told
reporters as a group of Democratic Action governors who declared
their support for him stood alongside. ``This is an alliance for
Venezuela, against corruption and against violence.''
	   Chavez, 44, is drawing support from the poor who see him as a
hero partly because of his tough anti-corruption talk. The middle
and upper-class fear he will impose a leftist dictatorship and are
largely backing Salas.
	   Democratic Action officials said the threat to democracy posed
by Chavez, who tried to overthrow the government in 1992, forced
them to back Salas.
	   The party ``has responsibly put aside partisan attitudes since
... Venezuela is first,'' said party Secretary-General Lewis Perez,
a long-time Alfaro supporter.
	   The party's backing was expected by many analysts to boost
Salas's chances of victory, although Chavez said he believed he
would get many of the party's votes.
	   Venezuela's other major traditional party, the social Christian
COPEI, also has been wracked by turmoil, with many members
clamoring for the party to drop its candidate, former Miss Universe
Irene Saez, and support Salas.
	   Saez, an independent who accepted COPEI's support, says she is
staying in the race, though the party is expected to make a final
decision this week.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian police confirmed that the new World,
Israel's Linor Abargil, reported that she was attacked last month
while in Italy for a fashion show, British newspapers reported in
Sunday's editions.
	   Abargil, the reigning Israel who was crowned World Saturday
night, told police she was attacked Oct. 6 after going to a travel
agency to buy a plane ticket to Rome, where she planned to meet her
mother before flying home, The Times of London and several other
newspapers reported.
	   The Egyptian owner of the travel agency has since been arrested
and charged in the attack, the newspapers said.
	   Julia Morley, one of the organizers of the World competition,
told The News of the World that she nor Abargil would comment on
the rape report. Abargil could not be reached, and a family member
who answered the phone at Abargil's home in Jerusalem declined to
comment.
	   ``For legal reasons, absolutely no comment can be made by Linor
or myself,'' Morely was quoted as saying.
	   Abargil told police that the man, who was not named in the
reports, offered to drive her to Rome himself because he had
business there and all flights were booked, the newspapers said.
She told police that he pulled off the road shortly after starting
out, tied her up and sexually assaulted her.
	   ``It went on and on for about two hours,'' The News of the World
quoted Abargil as telling Italian police.
	   Abargil told police that after the attack, he tried to apologize
as he drove had back to Milan, the newspapers said. In the morning,
Abargil caught a train to Rome and went with her mother to tell
police there what had happened, the newspapers reported.
	   Police in Milan released details of an assault on an Israeli
model at the time, and on Friday confirmed the victim's identity to
Ansa, Italy's government-backed national news agency, the
newspapers reported.
	   Details of the ordeal were uncovered by Guido Columba of the
Ansa news agency.
	   ``When I heard an Israeli girl won the ( World) contest, I
suddenly remembered we had written a piece in October about an
Israeli model,'' Columba told The Times. ``I decided to check it
out and went to the Borgho police station. They let me check the
documents for October, and I compared the names. I couldn't believe
my eyes when I saw the name.''

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   PARIS (AP) _ The countries at war in the Congo agreed Saturday
to a cease-fire, French President Jacques Chirac said. But with
rebel groups in Congo vowing to battle on, the accord was shrouded
in doubt. Chirac told a news conference on the final day of a
summit of African leaders in Paris that Uganda, Rwanda and Congo
had reached a consensus to stop the war between rebels and forces
loyal to Congolese President Laurent Kabila. But, perhaps
ominously, rebel troops at the frontline in Congo said they knew of
no such plan, and vowed to battle on. Brokered by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a cease-fire agreement was to be
signed sometime before a meeting of the Organization of African
Unity on December 17-18, Chirac said. (FRANCE-AFRICA SUMMIT)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British government on Saturday night was close
to a deal that would send Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile to
stand trial there, two newspapers reported in Sunday editions.
Citing unnamed government sources, the Sunday Telegraph and The
Observer reported that the compromise deal is seen as the best way
to avoid the diplomatic and economic consequences of allowing the
83-year-old former dictator to be extradited to Spain to stand
trial on charges including genocide and murder. It would solve the
dilemma facing Home Secretary Jack Straw, who would never be
forgiven by some sections of his Labor Party if he allowed Pinochet
to escape prosecution, and would keep trade relations with Chile
from being damaged, the newspapers said. Straw has until Dec. 11 to
decide whether to extradite Pinochet. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Thousands marched Saturday through this
northern city demanding an end to the government policy of keeping
imprisoned members of the armed Basque separatist group ETA in
jails far from their families in the northern Basque region. The
demonstrators, many linked to pro-independence political parties
and social groups, held placards displaying black and white photos
of prisoners. The fate of ETA's 535 prisoners is at the center of
the fledgling peace process ushered in by an ETA cease-fire in
place since Sept. 18. But while there have been moves towards peace
talks over the past two months, ETA has demanded a change in prison
policy before going to the table while the government has insisted
that negotiations cannot begin until the group renounces violence
forever. (SPAIN-BASQUE)
	   ROME (AP) _ Turkey pressed stubbornly ahead Saturday with its
campaign to get Italy to hand over a Kurdish rebel leader,
dispatching a thick file full of graphic material on his alleged
crimes to Rome. Italy has refused to extradite Abdullah Ocalan
because he could face death penalty in Turkey. Despite this,
Turkish Ambassador Inal Batu said a formal extradition request
would be made to the Italian government in the next few days. He
said the file on Ocalan includes around 900 pages of material
describing in detail the rebel leader's alleged crimes, along with
what he indicated were gruesome photographs and videos. ``It's not
something I'd advise minors under 18 to see,'' Batu told the
Italian news agency ANSA. (ITALY-TURKEY-KURDS)
	   NEW DELHI, India _ Voters have rejected India's ruling party in
three crucial state elections, a rout that could destabilize the
federal government. After results were tallied Saturday, Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said voters who cast their ballots
Wednesday appeared to want a change, and admitted defeat for his
Bharatiya Janata Party in three of four states to the opposition
Congress party. A regional party was leading in a fourth state,
where the BJP did not contest elections. Vajpayee insisted the
results would have no bearing on the stability of his 8-month-old
federal government _ but others saw the BJP's rout as a referendum
on its rule and said defeat could lead to infighting with its 18
coalition partners. (INDIA-ELECTIONS)

 &UR; Eds: Items are on Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, the Dutch royal
family, Michelle Pfeiffer, Pamela Lee Anderson and betting on a
white Christmas. Some items moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ This time, it's definitely over between Rolling
Stone singer Mick Jagger and former Texan model Jerry Hall _ at
least according to an array of British tabloids.
	   Hall, 42, has called in a divorce lawyer after the latest
reports of Jagger's infidelities, according to The Daily Mail, The
Sun and other tabloids.
	   The Sun quoted unnamed sources Saturday as saying that Hall
rebuked Jagger, 55, this week at their mansion in southwest London,
after she read newspaper reports that a Brazilian model, Luciana
Gimenez Morad was pregnant with Jagger's child.
	   The Sun said that Hall, who has four children with Jagger, has
contacted attorney Anthony Julius, Princess Diana's lawyer in her
divorce from Prince Charles.
	   Neither Hall or Jagger have commented on the reports, and Morad,
29, has denied Jagger is the father of her child. Lawyer Julius has
refused to comment, although he has admitted in the past that Hall
is a client.
	   Newspapers have long reported details of Hall and Jagger's
stormy relationship. The couple have lived together since the late
1970s and married in 1991.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander was a
last-minute replacement Saturday for his mother, Queen Beatrix,
whose Russia trip was postponed because of President Boris
Yeltsin's poor health.
	   The prince arrived in St. Petersburg for the presentation of two
cultural projects at the Hermitage museum, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. He was due to return to the Netherlands on Sunday.
	   Kremlin officials asked Queen Beatrix last week to postpone her
visit, which was to include a meeting with Yeltsin, to give the
ailing president time to recuperate from pneumonia.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Superstardom hasn't ruined Michelle Pfeiffer's
innocent sense of wonder.
	   ``Actually, I'm forever naive, always shocked and surprised at
everything around me,'' Pfeiffer says in the December issue of US
magazine. ``It doesn't matter where you travel, who you meet, what
you read, how sophisticated you are; there is an innate innocence
that, if you have it, you never lose.
	   ``I'm always expecting people to be good _ and shocked at how
bad they can be.''
	   Pfeiffer's many films include ``Scarface,'' ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' ``Tequila Sunrise,'' ``Batman Returns,'' ``The Age of
Innocence,'' ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' and ``One Fine Day.''
	   Friends credit her success to a gutsy, risk-taking approach to
choosing movie roles.
	   ``People always tell me, `You're so brave,''' she said. ``But a
love of my bravery came out of naivete. I just didn't know. I'd
dive into situations.
	   ``I did that all the time; and because I have a sink-or-swim
mentality, I always managed to swim. But at the end of the day, I
lived a lot of my life in fear.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ It's all over for Pamela Anderson Lee and
Tommy Lee _ at least where their honeymoon videotape lawsuit is
concerned.
	   A U.S. judge dismissed the Lees' dlrs 90 million lawsuit against
an Internet company, saying the couple signed away the rights to
the explicit tape.
	   U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson ruled in favor of Internet
Entertainment Group, which contended its agreement with the Lees
was broadly written and provided for the video's distribution
without specifying the format.
	   The Lees contended they agreed only to have the tape relayed on
the group's Web site, not to be distributed on videotape, CD-ROM
and in hotel rooms. About 200,000 copies of the video have been
sold, IEG said.
	   Pregerson said the former ``Baywatch'' actress and the Motley
Crue drummer, who are in the process of a divorce, never asked for
the return of the videotape, which they claim was stolen from a
safe in their Malibu home.
	   The judge indicated early this month that he would throw the
lawsuit out. His ruling was made public this week.
	    &UR; ___
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ A Glasgow businesswoman is betting on a
white Christmas, placing thousands of small wagers that could net
more than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 84,000) if it snows on Dec. 25.
	   Gillian Muir, who works for promotion company Morgan
Partnership, has placed 9,265 bets of 50 pence (84 U.S. cents) each
with a Glasgow betting shop. She said she plans to give the betting
slips away to business contacts.
	   With 10-1 odds, the holders would collect 5.50 (dlrs 9.24) each
if at least one snowflake flutters to the ground Christmas Day.
	   ``We believe this is the biggest bet ever placed on a White
Christmas _ it is certainly the greatest number of bets ever placed
by one person on anything,'' said Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for
the bookmaker, William Hill. ``It will also be one of the most
expensive Christmas gifts ever handed out should it snow at
Christmas.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Countries fighting in Congo agreed to a cease-fire
at a summit here, striking a shaky consensus to stop the war
between rebels and forces loyal to Congo's President Laurent
Kabila.
	   But Congolese rebel leaders were not present at Saturday's
meeting, raising doubts about how a cease-fire could be put into
effect without their participation.
	   French President Jaques Chirac told reporters attending the
final day of a summit of African leaders in Paris that Uganda and
Rwanda, which both support the insurgency, and Congo had agreed to
end fighting in a war that has raised fears of an all-out regional
conflagration.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presided at a two-hour meeting
of officials, including Kabila and the leaders of Uganda and
Rwanda. The heads of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso also took part in
the meeting, which Chirac said was ``held in a tense but not
hostile environment.''
	   Chirac did not refer to whether the rebels in Congo had been
consulted, or what their position now would be. A rebel leader,
Arthur Ngoma, was scheduled to attend the summit as an observer,
but he could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Though no rebel leaders were available for comment, rebel ground
troops in Congo said Saturday that the war would continue despite
the Paris agreement. Kabila said in Paris that although he would
sign the cease-fire it could fall apart if his troops are provoked.
	   Chirac said Kabila had agreed to democratic reforms and the need
to establish dialogue. ``Every party has made progress toward a
greater rapprochement,'' he said.
	   Brokered by Annan, the cease-fire was to be signed sometime
before a meeting of the Organization of African Unity on Dec.
17-18, Chirac said.
	   ``The secretary general has achieved an agreement for the
reaffirmation of the commitment to put an end to this absurd and
painful war,'' Chirac said.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He promised reform and democracy in his
renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, but many critics say his
regime's 18 months in power has seen repressive policies and a
growing intolerance of criticism.
	   Disaffected members of his armed forces banded together with
ethnic Tutsi insurgents earlier this year and launched a rebellion,
accusing the president of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
	   At a noisy meeting with thousands of Congolese at a Paris hotel
later Saturday, Kabila said Uganda and Rwanda should be forced to
withdraw their support of the rebel insurgency.
	   ``We want to pressure public opinion in France and everywhere so
that this meeting will weigh heavily on the leaders of those
countries,'' Kabila told the boisterous audience, some of whom
banged drums and waved national flags.
	   Kabila has demanded that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their troops
and leave Congo. Both countries claim they have legitimate security
interests there and say they will stay as long as Congo remains a
threat.
	   Kabila said 30,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops were currently in
Congo, and he emphasized that no agreement had yet been signed.
	   In an interview with France Info radio, however, Kabila said:
``We will add our signature,'' to the agreement.
	   ``But if they (the rebels) attack, if they advance, then we will
have to continue to defend ourselves,'' he warned in the radio
interview, adding that the cease-fire would only take hold if the
rebels leave Congo.
	   Until the summit, Kabila had spurned attempts to arrange talks
with rebels or neighboring countries involved in the 4-month-old
conflict. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola are supporting Kabila
against the rebels, who have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   At the front line in Congo, rebel troops said Saturday the war
would go on regardless of events in Paris.
	   Standing over a bridge over the wide, chocolate-colored Congo
River, a rebel commander, identified only by his first name
Gabriel, refused to believe such a deal could be struck.
	   ``Rwandans and Ugandans can agree upon whatever they want, but I
am a Congolese and I have a war to fight,'' he said. ``We have
started this war to kick Kabila out. We shall finish it.''
	   Kabila later met with Chirac at the Elysee Palace for a
scheduled meeting that lasted 30 minutes.
	   Congo's war dominated the final day of a Paris summit of more
than 40 African countries focusing on security concerns and ways to
help the troubled continent achieve stability and economic growth.

have to continue to defend ourselves,'' he warned in the radio
interview, adding that the cease-fire would only take hold if the
rebels leave Congo.
	   Until the summit, Kabila had spurned attempts to arrange talks
with rebels or neighboring countries involved in the 4-month-old
conflict. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola are supporting Kabila
against the rebels, who have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   At the front line in Congo, rebel troops said Saturday the war
would go on regardless of events in Paris.
	   Standing over a bridge over the wide, chocolate-colored Congo
River, a rebel commander, identified only by his first name
Gabriel, refused to believe such a deal could be struck.
	   ``Rwandans and Ugandans can agree upon whatever they want, but I
am a Congolese and I have a war to fight,'' he said. ``We have
started this war to kick Kabila out. We shall finish it.''
	   Kabila later met with Chirac at the Elysee Palace for a
scheduled meeting that lasted 30 minutes.
	   Congo's war dominated the final day of a Paris summit of more
than 40 African countries focusing on security concerns and ways to
help the troubled continent achieve stability and economic growth.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The government is close to reaching a compromise
that would return Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile to stand
trial on human rights charges stemming from his dictatorship, two
newspapers reported in Sunday editions.
	   The Sunday Telegraph and The Observer, citing unnamed government
sources, reported that the deal is seen as the best way for Britain
to avoid potentially damaging economic and diplomatic fallout from
an extradition of the former dictator to Spain. Spanish authorities
want to try Pinochet for genocide, torture and terrorism.
	   Such a compromise would solve the dilemma confronting Home
Secretary Jack Straw. Many of Straw's fellow Labor Party members
would never forgive him if he allowed Pinochet to avoid
prosecution. At the same time, a trial in Chile would avoid damage
to Britain's trade relations with the South American country, the
newspapers said.
	   Associated Press phone calls to the British Home Office went
unanswered late Saturday.
	   Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to extradite Pinochet
to Spain.
	   Chile's Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, turning up the
pressure on Britain, warned Saturday that the former dictator would
not receive justice if extradited to Spain.
	   ``A fair trial on this issue in Spain would be difficult given
the high level of emotion that this case has caused,'' Insulza
said. ``I believe that Pinochet has already been tried and
condemned in Spain.''
	   Pinochet remained under police guard at a London hospital, where
he is recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British
police on Oct. 16.
	   Chilean legal experts argue that Pinochet, 83, should be tried
in Chile since the alleged crimes during his 17-year rule were
committed there.
	   ``The Chilean people have to be allowed to judge and decide how
they are going to deal with their past,'' Insulza said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``These processes are going on,
and I fully expect they will result in justice.''
	   Fourteen lawsuits were already pending in Chile.
	   ``I can assure you that the cases are going to be prosecuted,''
Insulza said at a news conference Saturday.
	   Efforts to try Pinochet at home, however, would face complex
hurdles. He has broad immunity as a life member of the Chilean
senate and is further protected by an amnesty law issued during his
regime.
	   In an interview on Spanish National Television TVE on Saturday,
Insulza said he will meet with Spanish officials about their
extradition efforts.
	   There was fresh evidence Saturday of strains in Chile's
relations with Britain. The Ministry of Defense said it has
canceled plans for the frigate HMS Sutherland to appear at a naval
fair in the Chilean port of Valparaiso, and the Foreign Office said
it was temporarily closing its consular office in the city. Four
other British consulates and the embassy in Santiago remain open.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
dictatorship, which began in 1973 when he overthrew President
Salvador Allende. Allende died in the coup.

Families of Swissair victims return for to crash site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Eleven relatives of the victims of
Swissair Flight 111 returned to the site of the Sept. 2 crash for a
ceremony at sea to remember their loved ones.
	   One by one, family members tossed red carnations from a Canadian
navy minesweeper into frigid waters over the wreckage on Saturday.
Several relatives huddled together, arms wrapped around each other
for support and protection from the winds.
	   ``There's something about being at the last place that my son
was alive,'' said Judy Wilson of Brandon, Florida, referring to
Jonathan Wilson, 22, who died when the jetliner crashed off the
Nova Scotia coast, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   As the crew lowered the Canadian flag to half staff, the family
members, all from the United States, placed a floral wreath over
the site, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southwest of the fishing
village of Peggy's Cove.
	   Most came to Nova Scotia shortly after the crash, but none were
able to get so close to the area where the MD-11, en route from New
York to Geneva, went down.
	   A New Jersey woman said she knew instinctively that she should
visit the site for the memorial.
	   ``I just felt drawn and there was no clear logical reason why,''
said Peggy Coburn, of East Brunswick, New Jersey, whose husband
Richard, was headed to a business meeting in Europe. ``It was
powerful, it was moving, it was spiritual and emotional.''
	   Relatives also wanted to see Pearl Island, a small bird
sanctuary in the area that is being considered as site for a
permanent memorial.
	   The trip was organized by Miles Gerety, a Redding, Connecticut,
lawyer who lost his older brother, Pierce, a U.N. refugee expert.
Gerety has formed an support group to help grieving families get in
touch with one another over the Internet.
	   Gerety said one purpose of the trip, just days after
Thanksgiving, was to thank residents of the small communities that
dot the coast.
	   Many of them ventured into the dark on Sept. 2 in a futile
search for survivors. When they got to the site, they found a
horrifying mix of clothing, children's toys, books and human
remains scattered over the water.
	   ``There was a good life behind each person and I wish that the
fishermen could think about that and not the horror that they
saw,'' said Coburn.
	   ``I want to thank them because their reaching in the water and
pulling out our loved ones, to me, was such an act of loving for
someone they didn't even know.''
	   About 80 percent of the plane's wreckage has been recovered from
the seabed, and retrieval efforts continue. Investigators say they
still do not know why the cockpit of the plane began filling with
smoke 16 minutes before the crash, although experts have indicated
some sort of electrical problem is a likely cause.

Report: GE Capital Corp. in talks to take over Japan Leasing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. financial services giant GE Capital Corp. is
in negotiations to acquire a failed affiliate of Japan's recently
nationalized Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, a newspaper said
Sunday.
	   Connecticut-based GE Capital is considering buying Japan Leasing
Corp. for about 900 billion yen (dlrs 7.4 billion), Japan's
respected Nihon Keizai business daily reported.
	   If the deal materializes, it will be the most expensive Japanese
company acquisition ever, the paper said.
	   GE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., would acquire
only the healthy leasing operations of Japan Leasing, while the
company's bad real estate assets would be disposed of in bankruptcy
proceedings, the paper said.
	   Company officials were not available for comment over the
weekend.
	   Under the deal GE Capital would also take over the healthy
business of Japan Leasing's car leasing subsidiary, Japan Leasing
Auto Corp., the Nihon Keizai said.
	   Japan Leasing declared bankruptcy in September with debts of
more than 2 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion). It was Japan's biggest
corporate collapse since the end of World War II.
	   Japan Leasing, a leasing agent for computers, aircraft and other
equipment, was crushed under massive soured debts incurred from
reckless real estate speculation during Japan's ``bubble'' economy
of the 1980's.
	   In October, the government nationalized Japan Leasing's parent
company, the debt-ridden LTCB, as part of efforts to ensure
stability in Japan's troubled banking system.
	   GE Capital has assets of more than dlrs 250 billion and is one
of GE's biggest money-makers.

Myanmar pinning hopes on women lifters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AYE AYE WIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Competing under the motto ``Myanmar
Sports-The World to Conquer,'' the country's 70-member team at the
13th Asian Games is pinning hopes on its women weightlifters to
better its poor performance at the last Games.
	   Once formidable in the region, Myanmar's tottering economy,
isolationism and other problems have sent the country into the
Asian sports cellar.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, shared last place at the 12th
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, with three other nations. It won
only two bronze medals.
	   Maung Win, a director in the Ministry of Sports, said Myanmar's
21 male and 29 female athletes would compete in weighlifting,
archery, taekwando, sepak takraw and canoeing at the Dec. 6-20
Games in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   In a recent interview, he said sports officials were laying high
hopes for medals in women's weightlifting and possible triumphs in
sepak takraw and canoeing.
	   Top woman weightlifter Win Win Maw brought home a bronze in the
70-kilogram class at the 1994 Hiroshima Games and a silver at the
1995 Southeast Asian Games in Thailand.
	   The weightlifting team manager, San Myint, hopes his
seven-member women's squad will capture no less than two golds,
with China the main rival.
	   Sepak takraw team manager Aung Kyaw Nyunt is also optimistic,
fearing only host Thailand and Malaysia. Although the country's
sepak takraw federation was only formed in 1991, the sport is
similar to a traditional cane-ball game widely played by men in
Myanmar.
	   The women's team was only formed in 1993 but Myanmar women took
a gold and a silver at the 1995 Southeast Asian Games. The highly
acrobatic sport involves batting a small ball across a net using
virtually every part of the body.
	   Although it will be their Asian Games debut, Myanmar rowers have
been notching impressive performances during training and climbing
up the Asian ladder in recent years.
	   They won 11 silvers and one bronze medal at the 19th Southeast
Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia, and a gold at the 1997 Asian
Canoeing Championships in South Korea.
	   The three-year-old Myanmar Archery Federation, which is sending
three women competitors, aims to reach at least the quarter finals.
And the taekwondo team has hopes for its two women marital arts
competitors.
	   Soe Soe Myar, who will compete in the flyweight class, took
first place at the 1998 World Junior Taekwondo Championships in
South Korea.
	   Fuelling motivation will be a promise of rewards for those who
return home from Bangkok with medals. Maung Win said a ``suitable
amount'' of cash will be awarded to each winner by the government,
along with more cash and kind from local and foreign businesses.
	   The government gave an apartment and 680,000 kyats (dlrs
111,475) to each gold medalists at the Jakarta Southeast Asian
Games, Maung Win said.
	   In recent years the country has been trying to revive some of
its former sporting strength.
	   A Ministry of Sports was established in December, 1996, and
since then Myanmar has sent 63 contingents to compete abroad. The
motto of the sporting establishment _ ``Myanmar Sports-The World to
Conquer'' _ indicates the country has a ways to go before attaining
international class status.

Opposition Congress Party leads in provincial elections in India

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's right-wing ruling party was
routed in elections in three states, according to early results,
suffering a major setback in its first political test since forming
a coalition government eight months ago.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee acknowledged Saturday that
the results were a defeat for his Bharatiya Janata Party, but
insisted they would have no bearing on the stability of his
national government's 19-party coalition.
	   The election was held Wednesday, but final results were not
expected until later Sunday. The opposition Congress Party was
expected to win as many as two-thirds of the seats in the states of
Rajasthan and New Delhi, both of which had been considered BJP
strongholds.
	   Congress also retained power in the large central state of
Madhya Pradesh.
	   A regional party was likely to win in Mizoram, a tiny
northeastern state where the BJP did not field a candidate.
	   ``The BJP has lost the goodwill of the people. Its
eight-month-rule has been marked by sheer incompetence, bickering
and inability to govern,'' said Congress leader Natwar Singh.
	   The BJP's setback could trigger infighting among the coalition
partners, and it could put pressure on the Congress Party to unseat
Vajpayee if it can woo enough lawmakers in Parliament.
	   However, the Congress said it had no immediate plans to unseat
the government.
	   About 5,000 candidates from dozens of political parties competed
for more than 600 seats in the four states.
	   Skyrocketing prices for vegetables and grains were the main
election issue, wiping out any support the BJP may have earned for
the widely popular nuclear weapons tests India conducted in May.
	   BJP leaders admitted that infighting led to the party's defeat.
	   ``The voters did not defeat us; the BJP worked for its own
defeat,'' said New Delhi's outgoing chief minister, Sushma Swaraj.
	   The elections were also seen as a test for the Congress Party's
new leader, Sonia Gandhi, widow of slain former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer of the dynasty that has ruled India
for most of its 51 years of independence.
	   Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since she
emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.

Ramos Horta criticizes Australian support of Indonesian military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ East Timorese independence activist
Jose Ramos Horta on Saturday criticized Australia's foreign
policies as morally bankrupt and devoid of new ideas.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate also attacked Australia's support
for Indonesian armed forces chief Wiranto.
	   Ramos Horta said he was not surprised at Australian Defense
Minister John Moore's show of support for General Wiranto during a
visit to Jakarta.
	   General Wiranto is facing harsh criticism for the actions of his
troops, including security forces who opened fire on thousands of
unarmed students on Nov. 13, killing at least nine.
	   ``Australia's foreign policy is morally bankrupt, devoid of new
ideas, devoid of courage,'' Ramos Horta said.
	   ``Things are changing, things in Indonesia are developing fast
but Australia clings to the old policies of embracing the military
which is under severe criticism in the new Indonesia.
	   ``The problem with Australia is that instead of supporting
democracy _ and democracy means that the army must get out of
politics in Indonesia _ it goes on embracing the same people that
kept Suharto in power for 32 years.''
	   During his visit to Indonesia on Saturday, Moore praised
Australia's good links with the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI) and
said there was no reason Australia could not work with them in the
future.
	   ``We understand the enormous role ABRI plays in this country,''
Moore said. ``General Wiranto is a very competent person.''
	   Ramos Horta said he was cautious about a United Nations
announcement that Indonesia and Portugal were moving closer to an
agreement to give East Timor wide-ranging autonomy.
	   ``If that autonomy arrangement removes Indonesian troops out of
East Timor and all prisoners are released, if it is a transition
arrangement until a referendum on self-determination can be held,
it is acceptable,'' he said.
	   ``We will reject forcefully if autonomy means we remain within
(the) Indonesian republic.''
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it the following year. The United Nations and Portugal do
not recognize Indonesia's claim to East Timor.

Holiday crush at movie theaters as studios go with quality and

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The crowds. The confusion. The frantic
last-ditch grab for your money.
	   Ah, the holidays in Hollywood.
	   America's multiplexes are jammed tighter than the mall parking
lot this season as studios unroll a dizzying slate of movies
between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Several films have Academy
Award potential, if only they can get seen.
	   ``It is daunting,'' said Lindsay Law, president of Fox
Searchlight, which believes it has a hit of ``Full Monty''
proportions in the Irish comedy ``Waking Ned Devine,'' opening
slowly across the country.
	   Although the fall has been overrun by rugrats, water boys and
other kid stuff, the holidays promise variety, from a grown-up
romance like ``You've Got Mail'' to such Oscar contenders as ``The
Thin Red Line'' and ``A Civil Action.''
	   Not that families will be overlooked _ there's ``A Bug's Life,''
``Babe: A Pig in the City'' and ``Mighty Joe Young.''
	   For those who want something a little more thoughtful, there's
Maya Angelou's directorial debut, ``Down in the Delta,'' and
DreamWorks Pictures' animated biblical epic ``The Prince of
Egypt.'' And if those movies prove too lofty, there's always Jerry
Springer to bring it down with his acting debut in ``Ringmaster,''
out this weekend.
	   Here is a rundown of many holiday movies:
	    &UR; GROWN-UP AT LAST
	   With Adam Sandler and Nickelodeon's babies ruling the box office
of late, the holidays bring some relief for those old enough to
vote, starting with two romantic comedies.
	   Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan of ``Sleepless in Seattle'' reunite in
the cyber-romance ``You've Got Mail'' (Dec. 18), while Drew
Barrymore stars in the quirky ``Home Fries'' (out this weekend).
	   DreamWorks tries to break the Disney animation mold with ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' a biblical epic without a single cute talking
animal sidekick. The movie, out Dec. 18, may follow Disney's
``Beauty and the Beast'' in getting a rare best picture nod for an
animated feature.
	   Overseas imports are particularly strong, led by ``Waking Ned
Devine,'' which opened this month and is slowly spreading across
the country. The film is about a small Irish town infected with
lottery fever. Adding to the ``Full Monty'' feel: comic nude scenes
by veteran actors Ian Bannen, 70, and David Kelly, 69.
	   Also, ``Little Voice'' stars Jane Horrocks of British TV's
``Absolutely Fabulous'' in an Oscar-worthy performance as a shy
girl who can really belt out a tune. Michael Caine is her
deliciously sleazy manager and Brenda Blethyn her brassy mother in
the film, which opens Dec. 4.
	   Brazil's ``Central Station,'' which is being rolled out across
the nation this month, is a strong best picture or best foreign
language picture possibility. It tells the story of a young boy and
the lonely woman who befriends him.
	   ``Shakespeare in Love'' (Dec. 11) has the Bard as just another
struggling writer, and ``Elizabeth,'' about the queen by the same
name, is already doing strong business in limited release.
	    &UR; FAMILY FEAST
	   With ``The Rugrats Movie'' and the reissued ``The Wizard of Oz''
still in theaters, along come more family friendly fare: ``A Bug's
Life,'' the computer-animated bug fest; and ``Babe: Pig in the
City,'' the special-effects-filled sequel to the charming 1995
porker hit. Both are in wide release this weekend.
	   A resurrected RKO Pictures digs into its past for material,
coming up with the remake of the simian adventure, ``Mighty Joe
Young.'' And Michael Keaton plays a really cool dad _ he's a
snowman _ in ``Jack Frost.'' Both are out Dec. 18.
	    &UR; THRILLS AND CHILLS
	   One of the biggest movie questions of the year _ How could they
remake ``Psycho'' without messing it up? _ is answered Dec. 4 with
the release of the color, shot-by-shot re-creation of the 1960
Alfred Hitchcock classic. Universal Pictures is not allowing
critics to see it before it opens, though.
	   For those looking for a little darkness this holiday season turn
to ``Very Bad Things'' (out this weekend), about a Las Vegas
bachelor party that takes a morbid turn, or ``The Faculty'' (Dec.
25), a supernatural thriller written by Kevin Williamson, the
``Scream'' scribe.
	   And for science-fiction fans who think that eight ``Star Trek''
movies just isn't enough, there's ``Star Trek: Insurrection.'' The
franchise is freshened with this twist: Capt. Picard falls in love.
	    &UR; CHRISTMAS CHAOS
	   Expect a bloodbath this Christmas Day, and we're not just
talking about the battle scenes from one of the year's most
anticipated films, ``The Thin Red Line,'' a World War II saga from
Terrence Malick, who hasn't directed a movie since ``Days of
Heaven'' 20 years ago. Studios are dashing for Oscars and the
competition will be fierce.
	   Universal is hoping to end its dismal year on a high note with
``Patch Adams,'' starring Robin Williams as a doctor who believes
that laughter truly is the best medicine.
	   Two of Hollywood's biggest actresses, Susan Sarandon and Julia
Roberts, team in ``Stepmom,'' the story of an ex-wife who finds she
can't hate her younger replacement. And noted poet Angelou tries
her hand at directing in ``Down in the Delta.''
	   And after ``Beloved'' imploded over the fall, Disney's best shot
at an Academy Award-caliber movie will be ``A Civil Action,'' a
legal drama based on the best-selling book. It stars John Travolta.
	   ``Theory of Flight,'' with Kenneth Branagh and Helena
Bonham-Carter, and ``Hurlyburly,'' with Sean Penn and Kevin Spacey,
play in limited release for Oscar consideration, before going wide
next year.
	    &UR; POST-CHRISTMAS
	   Hollywood plays its final Oscar card on Dec. 30 with three
releases: ``Another Day in Paradise'' with James Woods and Melanie
Griffith, ``Affliction'' with Nick Nolte and the Western ``The
Hi-Lo Country'' with Woody Harrelson.

Rennes falters again in title challenge with loss to Nantes EDS:
</HEADLINE>
UPDATES with details throughout

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Third-placed Rennes lost more ground on the top two
teams in the French championship on Saturday, conceding two late
goals to lose 3-2 at home to Nantes.
	   Patrick Suffo scored in the 85th minute and Christophe Le Roux
in the last minute of regulation time as Nantes snatched victory.
	   Rennes had led 2-1 at half time, Shabani Nonda and Stephane
Gregoire netting for the home team and Antoine Sibierski for the
canaries.
	   The result leaves Rennes, a surprise early challenger for the
French title, nine points behind leader Marseille.
	   Rennes' challenge appears to be faltering. Last week it lost
disappointingly at Paris Saint-Germain.
	   Monaco, held 1-1 at Strasbourg, also missed its chance to make
up ground on the top teams.
	   Philippe Christanval scored a 21st minute goal for Monaco but
midfielder Corentin Martins equalized within a quarter of an hour.
	   Bastia climbed to sixth place with an emphatic 4-1 win against
Lyon, Pierre-Yves Andre scoring two second half goals, including
one from the penalty spot.
	   In other games Saturday: Le Havre 2, Auxerre 1; Lorient 0, Nancy
1; Metz 3, Montpellier 1; Toulouse 1, Sochaux 1.
	   In Sunday's matches, league leader Marseille takes on archrival
Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade Velodrome.
	   Bordeaux, which lies one point behind Rolland Courbis' team,
plays at home to Lens.

Top-ranked Tennessee remains on course for Fiesta Bowl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Tennessee moved one step closer to a
shot at the national title.
	   Tee Martin threw for a touchdown and ran for another as the
top-ranked Volunteers routed Vanderbilt 41-0 Saturday.
	   If Tennessee (11-0, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) beats
Mississippi State in the SEC title game next weekend, the Vols will
probably get to play for the national championship in the Fiesta
Bowl.
	   The Vols are currently No. 1 in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings, ahead of two other undefeated teams, UCLA and Kansas
State. The top two teams in the BCS standings will meet in the
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
	   ``They're a well-deserving No. 1,'' Vanderbilt coach Woody
Widenhofer said of the Vols. ``In the four years that I've been
here, this is the toughest team they've had.''
	   UCLA and Kansas State each have a game left next Saturday. The
Bruins play at No. 19 Miami, while Kansas State meets No. 6 Texas
A-and-M for the Big 12 championship in St. Louis.
	   Tennessee intercepted four passes, recovered two fumbles and
converted those turnovers into 24 points to beat Vanderbilt (2-9,
1-7) for the 16th straight time.
	   ``I don't think we did anything wrong out of here today,'' said
Tennessee receiver Peerless Price, who caught seven passes for 181
yards, including a 67-yard touchdown.
	   After struggling to score against Vandy the past three seasons,
Tennessee finally got on track with 17 points in the second quarter
for a 20-0 halftime lead.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 17 Georgia Tech 21, No. 12
Georgia 19; No. 16 Virginia 36, No. 20 Virginia Tech 32; No. 21
Syracuse 66, No. 19 Miami 13; and No. 23 Penn State 51, Michigan
State 28.
 &UR; No. 17 Georgia Tech 21, No. 12 Georgia 19 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, Brad Chambers kicked a 35-yard field goal
with two seconds remaining as Georgia Tech (9-2) ended a seven-year
losing streak against Georgia (8-3).
	   The Yellow Jackets, co-champions of the Atlantic Coast
Conference, had not beaten Georgia since 1990, losing the last
three years by a combined margin of 13 points.
	   Joe Hamilton, who committed three turnovers, redeemed himself by
directing a nine-play, 52-yard drive that set up the second field
goal of the game by Chambers. The Bulldogs called two straight
timeouts hoping to distract Chambers, who earlier had missed a
37-yarder. But his final kick sailed straight down the middle.
 &UR; No. 16 Virginia 36, No. 20 Virginia Tech 32 &QC; 
	   At Blacksburg, Virginia, Ahmad Hawkins caught a 47-yard TD pass
from Aaron Brooks with 2:01 remaining to cap a big second-half
comeback by Virginia.
	   The Cavaliers, who overcame a 29-7 halftime deficit, marched 93
yards in six plays for the winning score.
	   Virginia (9-2) is going to the Peach Bowl, while Virginia Tech
(8-3) is still waiting for a bowl bid. Officials from the Music
City and Gator bowls were among those on hand.
 &UR; No. 21 Syracuse 66, No. 19 Miami 13 &QC; 
	   At Syracuse, New York, Donovan McNabb ran for three touchdowns
and threw for two as the Orangemen won the Big East title and
earned a berth in the Bowl Championship Series.
	   Syracuse (8-3, 6-1), which will play in the Orange Bowl or Sugar
Bowl, scored the most points against Miami (7-3, 5-2) since the
Hurricanes lost to the Orangemen 56-16 in 1970.
	   It was Miami's second-largest margin of defeat behind a 70-14
loss to Texas A&AMP;M in 1944.
 &UR; No. 23 Penn St. 51, Michigan St. 28 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pennsylvania, Eric McCoo rushed for 206 yards,
and David Macklin and Anthony King returned interceptions for
touchdowns as Penn State strengthened its case for an eighth
straight Jan. 1 bowl.
	   McCoo also scored a touchdown and Travis Forney kicked a
career-high five field goals for the Lions (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten), who
have a chance to go to the Outback Bowl after finishing their home
schedule unbeaten for the first time since 1994.
	   Michigan State (6-6, 4-4) didn't qualify for a bowl despite
victories over Notre Dame and then-No. 1 Ohio State.

Christopher Reeve returns to acting in `Rear Window'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY355 &QL; 
 &UR; By FRAZIER MOORE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Christopher Reeve was an actor for a
quarter-century. Then, three years after breaking his neck and
still paralyzed from the neck down, he was acting again.
	   ``Just like getting back on a bicycle,'' he says of his return.
	   Reeve's comeback project: ``Rear Window,'' which he shot last
summer. Daryl Hannah also stars in what is billed as ``a modern
update'' of the story that inspired Alfred Hitchcock's 1954
classic. It aired last week in the United States on the ABC
television network.
	   The two ``Rear Windows'' are substantially different, as
different as, say, Hannah from Grace Kelly, the original's co-star.
But each adopts the viewpoint of an inadvertent witness to a crime
(or WAS there a crime?), of a man in a wheelchair struggling to
confirm suspicions that eventually imperil him.
	   ``But instead of Jimmy Stewart with a broken leg _ who could get
up and hop around if he had to _ you put a severely disabled person
in the same kind of jeopardy,'' Reeve notes, ``and you raise the
stakes.''
	   Speaking with a reporter in the sun-drenched office of his
Bedford, New York, home, Reeve at age 46 looks good. Despite his
body's utter stillness in his high-tech wheelchair, he commands an
expressive face and a voice that, while gravelly, flows without the
frequent halts for air that, as recently as two years ago, meant
anything he said was parceled out in fragments.
	   Now, fluidly, Reeve does a little boasting about his fitness
regimen and its promising results. For instance, in a recent
bone-density scan to test for osteoporosis, ``I beat the national
average by 20 percent,'' he reports. ``I'm just as healthy as I was
the day of the accident.''
	   The character Reeve plays in ``Rear Window,'' architect Jason
Kemp, shares his hearty outlook. This, says the actor, is one
reason he wanted to make the film (he was also executive producer):
Jason, left a quadriplegic after a car crash, refuses to give up.
	   Such heroism, of course, is what Reeve has radiated almost from
the moment of his dreadful tumble from a horse in May 1995. Since
then, he has become a fund-raiser, political arm-twister and
unrepentant noodge in the service of spinal-cord research _ and of
finding the cure Reeve insists is just a few years away.
	   ``I've been making a lot of noise for the last three years,'' he
sums up his labors. ``I've been in a lot of peoples' faces.''
	   Reeve has carried out this starring role with tenacity and grace
before a rapt global audience that understands his victories are
theirs. But will the latest victory in Reeve's real-life drama _
his improbable return to acting in ``Rear Window'' _ upstage the
performance he gives in it?
	   Dismissing his own uniqueness, he replies, ``Watching almost
every famous actor, there's a certain amount of time before you're
willing to stop thinking about who they are and let their character
take you away.'' An actor's success ``depends on the audience's
willingness to say, `OK, I'm going to go with this.'
	   ``At least, it is when I go to the movies.''
	   But how to judge Reeve's performance apart from his physical
limitations? The truth of his portrayal is indisputable, and any
able-bodied actor might very well have chosen to play Jason in the
same way. But is it valid to credit or criticize Reeve for creative
choices imposed on him by the paralysis that another actor in the
role would invent?
	   When asked about the reduced set of acting tools now in his
possession, Reeve replies, ``This character doesn't have as many
tools, either.''
	   ``If I had been on my feet,'' he reasons, ``playing this part
would have meant a research assignment. But I come to the part
already with the given circumstance in place.'' Thus does Reeve
transform a hindrance into a head start.
	   He filmed ``Rear Window'' during a grueling 25-day shoot at an
office park in the nearby city of Yonkers. Jason's swanky loft was
installed in one building that faced another, where apartments on
three floors were constructed for Jason to spy into.
	   ``I was worried that only acting with my voice and my face, I
might not be able to communicate effectively enough to tell the
story,'' Reeve acknowledges. ``But I was surprised to find that if
I really concentrated, and just let the thoughts happen, that they
would read on my face. With so many close-ups, I knew that my every
thought would count.''
	   He cites a moment when Jason, stationed at his living room
window, gazes on a beautiful woman across the way. ``At first he
smiles, but then you see this pure longing on his face. You see his
pain: How part of his life is gone for good. It was just me
thinking those thoughts, and the camera picked them up.''
	   Yes, it did. Powerfully. But might Reeve have been drawing on
thoughts of his own deprivations?
	   ``No,'' he says flatly. ``Jason's in a very different place than
I am. His wife has left him, his business partners have dumped him,
whereas I have nothing but support and love.''
	   Those, and his continuing role in a real-life drama he is sure
ends happily.

In 50th year of stardom, actress hits the road to recover from Las

Vegas bust &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The unsinkable Debbie Reynolds once again
demonstrates her recuperative powers. After a financial disaster
with her Las Vegas hotel-casino, she's taking her act on the road
and also starring in a television movie.
	   In her 50th year in show business, Miss Reynolds has survived a
series of personal and business setbacks. The latest came last year
when the Debbie Reynolds Hotel and Casino _ and Miss Reynolds
herself _ were forced to file for protective bankruptcy. She
returned to traveling the country with her nightclub show, and made
``The Christmas Wish,'' a movie that appears on the U.S. CBS TV
network Sunday (Dec. 6) at 9 p.m. EDT.
	   ``The Christmas Wish'' is one of those heart-warmers that
proliferate at this time of year. Neil Patrick Harris, grown out of
his teen-physician role in the television show ``Doogie Howser,
M.D.,'' is a Wall Street wheeler-dealer who returns to his home
town to be with his grandmother (Reynolds) and modernize her late
husband's real estate business.
	   The grandmother has a wish: that her grandson trace a mysterious
woman whose name recurs in the grandfather's diaries. The young man
discovers the secret and finds himself as well.
	   ``I liked the script because I felt it was a good family
picture,'' Miss Reynolds said. ``I've always liked films for the
family; I really don't feel that we have enough of it out there.''
	   Miss Reynolds says she is unlike her character, who seeks help
from the grandson: ``I'm the opposite kind; I always say I'll have
to do it all myself ... I fight a lot harder.''
	   She exhibits a remarkable calmness in the role, as she did in
her recent breakout film, Albert Brooks' ``Mother.''
	   Yet it's not her own style, which is more like Miss Reynolds'
Academy Award-nominated turn in ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' or
her role as Mama Rose in ``Gypsy.''
	   In 1992, Miss Reynolds poured her fortune, her rare collection
of movie costumes and memorabilia and her endless energy into a
defunct hotel-casino in Las Vegas. For a few years, the investment
seemed to be paying off. Now, however, the whole effort is in
bankruptcy.
	   What happened?
	   ``The theater worked, the museum worked,'' she said. ``But when
you have a hotel that was run by other people, you make leases for
television sets, you make leases for furniture. Those who were
handling that end of it were not handling it well, and they put the
property into debt. Once you get into debt, it's very hard to pull
out.
	   ``I worked there four years for nothing. I can't keep doing
that. I'm 66 and I gave it four years on-stage, Monday through
Friday, and I never kept a penny. I just kept pushing the money
back into the property, and I finally had to give up. I'm just
running out of years to subsidize the world.''
	   Two months ago the World Wrestling Federation bought the Vegas
property at auction for dlrs 9 million. Miss Reynolds considered it
worth dlrs 22 million.
	   As always in times of financial stress, the entertainer has
turned to live audiences. She was interviewed before performing in
Palm Springs. The next day she would fly to Florida for shows in
Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, moving on to Biloxi, Mississippi,
and to Laughlin, Nevada, for holiday shows.
	   Her 1999 schedule includes shows aboard two cruise ships to
Hawaii, performances in San Jose, the Napa Valley and Texas.
	   ``I've been on the road since the hotel went down,'' she said.
``I bought the place in Vegas to get off the road. When that fell
through after six years, I went back. I'll just stay on the road
now, because obviously I don't want to give six years to a project
that doesn't work.''

British author rides up the charts on a wizard's tale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY323 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a pinch, could you name the 12 uses of
dragon's blood? Whip up a draught of Living Death? Handle an
overpowered Nimbus 2000 broom in a rip-roaring game of Quidditch?
	   Of course not _ even if you are a skinny, bespeckled 11-year-old
prodigy like Harry Potter. That's why, as Joanne Rowling tells us,
it takes seven years to graduate from the Hogswarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry.
	   Rowling, the 33-year-old author of ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone,'' has ridden to the top of best-seller lists in
Britain and the United States with one of the most engaging
characters since those Roald Dahl created in ``Matilda'' and
``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.''
	   The book, the first of what Rowling sees as a seven-part series,
has swept up publishing awards in Britain, dominating both the
children's and the adult best-seller lists there and earning
Rowling a six-figure movie option from Warner Bros.
	   ``I have a very visual imagination. I see it, then I try to
describe what is in my mind's eye,'' Rowling said recently on her
first visit to the United States, a five-city book tour.
	   Scholastic Inc., her American publisher, has gone back to print
three times since September to produce 100,000 hardcover copies of
``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' _ a rare achievement for
a children's book. In its first month of release, the plucky
adventure tale also hit No. 2 on the Publishers Weekly children's
best-seller list for October.
	   While the British tabloids have focused on Rowling's
rags-to-riches personal history _ she was an unemployed, divorced
single mother on welfare when she finished the book _ the hundreds
of little details that make up the universe of wizards had been
percolating in her imagination for years.
	   ``I have boxes and boxes of stuff on Harry _ wizard laws,
notebooks, bits of ideas,'' Rowling said as she signed books for
schoolchildren in Glen Rock, New Jersey. ``There is great depth to
this world.''
	   But she does admit that the pressure of having to care for an
infant alone _ her daughter Jessica is now 5 _ focused years of
daydreams and scribbled notes into a plot.
	   ``Being in that situation, feeling so isolated, it gave me
courage. What did I have to lose?'' she said.
	   Rowling was raised in the Chepstow, in the Forest of Dean that
lies on the border of England and Wales. As a girl, she loved
reading _ ``Little White Hare'' by Elizabeth Goudge and ``Manx
Mouse,'' by Paul Gallico, to name two _ and would pour out her own
wild stories to her younger sister, Di. Those stories continued as
she majored in French at the University of Exeter.
	   ``My parents hoped I could become a secretary,'' Rowling said,
laughing about the years she spent as a ``very mediocre'' one at
Amnesty International before heading off to Portugal to teach
English.
	   There she met her husband, had her daughter, got divorced and
ended up back in England trying to make sense of her life.
	   Rowling has an unerring sense of what it means to be 11, and her
arresting, brick-by-brick construction of Harry's world has turned
a rather traditional plot into a delight.
	   Harry Potter _ a goodhearted orphan boy _ is mistreated by
ignorant relatives, finds out the real reason for his parents'
deaths and heads off to wizard school to battle both the bullies in
his classes and the malevolent forces that threaten to unleash pure
evil on the world.
	   Think Luke Skywalker. Then add a broom, a bunch of oddball
buddies like the Goonies, and an athletic contest where wizards
great and small desperately try to fix the outcome. Toss in a pet
fire-breathing dragon _ forbidden _ and a mysterious third floor _
absolutely verboten. Don't forget to hunt down who is killing
defenseless unicorns and figure out why the killer needs to drink
their blood.
	   Each book can be read as a separate adventure, but the subplots
woven through them unite into an orchestral crescendo in the
seventh book.
	   Rowling handed in the third book in the series, ``Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' to her British publisher before
coming to the United States. And the final chapter of the seventh
book is already written, but Rowling is not sure how she _ or Harry
_ is going to get there from here.
	   Right now, the author is simply enjoying the financial freedom
of hitting several literary home runs _ and knows just how she is
going to spend some of the big bucks rolling in.
	   ``I'm coming back to New York, a big trip,'' she vowed. ``It's
more beautiful than I thought!''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ She is the shining star of a new generation of
musical theater performers. At age 28, Audra McDonald, already a
three-time Tony winner, faces the future armed with some impressive
credentials that just keep growing.
	   Among the latest accolades:
	   _''Way Back to Paradise,'' her dazzling debut recording
(Nonesuch Records) that celebrates the work of young, largely
unknown theater composers and lyricists. Not for her an album of
Porter, Gershwin or Rodgers and Hart standards but rather music of
McDonald's own contemporaries who, she says, speak to her in ``a
new language.''
	   _An exuberant, self-assured cabaret act featuring much of the CD
material and marked by an instant disarming rapport with the
audience. Earlier this fall, it was the hottest ticket in town as
fans tried to shoehorn their way into Joe's Pub, the inviting new
performance space named after impresario Joseph Papp in the Public
Theater complex.
	   _Most intriguing of all, her very own musical, a show called
``Marie Christine,'' based on ``Medea'' and set in New Orleans and
Chicago in the 1880s. The musical, scheduled for production next
season at Lincoln Center, was written by Michael John LaChiusa, one
of the composers featured on ``Way Back to Paradise.''
	   ``She has got taste and grace and modesty and brains,'' says
veteran director Harold Prince, who has seen a lot of talent over
the years. ``But I'll tell you what. Nothing beats brains. Audra
has a swell voice, but it is the other stuff that supports that
wonderful voice.''
	   It is the ``other stuff'' that has had a hand in helping her
cope with success, particularly after winning her third Tony last
June, this time for ``Ragtime.''
	   ``It is a bit scary,'' McDonald said during an interview in her
dressing room at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts where
``Ragtime'' is playing. ``I've been sort of panicking about what I
am going to do with the rest of my life.
	   ``But it is easy to fall into the trap and worry, `Oh, God, how
am I going to top this?' I feel like that about one out of four
days. The rest of the time I keep thinking, `Well, I've just got to
keep working hard.'
	   ``If anything, I think that each time I have won the Tony it has
made me aware of how much harder I need to work. For me that means:
`Don't get lazy. Don't think that every year is going to be like
this.'''
	   Only every other year.
	   McDonald's Tonys have arrived at two-year intervals. In 1994,
she won for playing a swooning Carrie Pipperidge in the revival of
``Carousel'' at Lincoln Center. In 1996, it was for her portrait of
a defiant opera student facing down Maria Callas in ``Master
Class.'' This year's award came for her portrayal of the doomed
Sarah in ``Ragtime,'' a show she has done for two years, first in
Toronto and then New York City.
	   ``I was shocked the third time,'' McDonald says. ``Wouldn't you
be? But it has hit other people around me, my friends and my
family, more than me. Yet when I see them get excited, I get
excited, too.''
	   McDonald, born in Berlin, was raised in Fresno, California,
where her father, an Army man, became a high school principal. Her
mother heads the affirmative action program at California
Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.
	   McDonald had no choice genetically. She had to sing. Everyone in
her family did, including five aunts who toured in the 1970s as the
McDonald Sisters, singing gospel music.
	   ``If I had been tone deaf they would have thrown me out,'' she
adds.
	   ``I always was a stage-struck child. Instead of putting me on
Ritalin, my parents were trying to find another way of channeling
my dramatic, hyperactive energy with piano lessons, dance lessons
and singing lessons,'' she says with a laugh.
	   She found her way to a local dinner theater by age 9, then a
performing arts high school. ``Performing was just something I've
been doing _ always,'' McDonald says.
	   ``My plan was I had to appear on Broadway by the time I was
18,'' she says. She missed her goal by five years, going instead to
study at the Juilliard School. At least it was a ticket to New
York.
	   ``The focus there was classical music and classical singing. I
don't think I thought it through and didn't realize that my focus
would have to completely shift, although my voice is inherently
operatic.''
	   Broadway didn't beckon until she was 23 and she went into the
cast of ``The Secret Garden.'' But audiences didn't notice her
until the following year when director Nicholas Hytner cast her in
``Carousel.'' Even then, she was the stuff of Broadway legend.
	   At her final callback, she passed out from all the excitement of
the audition after singing ``Mr. Snow,'' slumping to the floor as
the casting director and Mary Rodgers, daughter of ``Carousel''
composer Richard Rodgers, looked on.
	   But then McDonald's singing has always been marked by an
emotional intensity, a directness that she conveys immediately to
an audience. Yet there is enormous technique, too, a product of her
Juilliard training where diction was stressed again and again and
again.
	   That discipline helped get her through ``Way Back to Paradise,''
which took two years to make.
	   ``I almost wanted to call the recording `Talking About My
Generation,''' she says. ``This is my generation of musical theater
composers.''
	   The four men and one woman featured on the recording are
post-Sondheim, post-Kander and Ebb, even post-Alan Menken, the
relatively youthful composer of ``Beauty and the Beast.''
	   She had worked with Adam Guettel on a workshop production of
``Myths and Hymns.'' And her boyfriend, bass player Peter Donovan,
had played in the pit of Guettel's off-Broadway musical, ``Floyd
Collins.'' She found Ricky Ian Gordon through her voice teacher and
last year appeared in his song cycle ``Only Heaven,'' based on the
poetry of Langston Hughes. And LaChiusa, of course, is writing
``Medea'' for her.
	   ``Much of their music is very unpredictable,'' McDonald says. ''
It's sort of in a new language. The harmonics are very thick and
rich, but I was able to connect to each piece personally, which is
the only reason to sing a song.''

Thousands mourn slain Sikh publisher in western Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Police searched the grounds for
bombs as about 2,000 people gathered at a funeral home to mourn the
shooting death of a moderate Sikh newspaper publisher who had been
critical of Sikh hard-liners.
	   The memorial service Saturday for Tara Singh Hayer was broadcast
over loudspeakers to mourners who could not fit inside the home in
suburban Vancouver and who had gathered under white canopies
outside.
	   ``We cannot stop our eyes from weeping,'' Hayer's daughter,
Rupinder Hayer Bains, said in a tribute to her father. ``What do we
say to your grandchildren when they ask us why would anyone shoot
grandfather? ... We have no words to explain to your grandchildren
how such a coward could do it.''
	   Hayer's family and other Sikh moderates in the Vancouver area
believe the 62-year-old publisher was gunned down Nov. 18 by Sikh
militants because of his views. Police have no suspects yet in the
slaying.
	   Hayer was publisher of Indo-Canadian Times, the
largest-circulation Punjabi-language newspaper in North America,
and had been a vocal critic of militant Sikh separatists who have
frequently resorted to violence in their crusade for an independent
homeland in India.
	   He survived a 1988 shooting attack that left him in a
wheelchair; a young Sikh firebrand was imprisoned for the crime.
	   Before the slaying, Hayer had urged the community to support
moderate candidates in board elections at two temples in the
Vancouver area.
	   Fearing sabotage at Hayer's memorial service, more than 40
officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrolled the grounds
of the funeral homes and checked bags of attendees.

Langen wins four-man competition one day after winning two-man
</HEADLINE>
race &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Germany's Christoph Langen overcame
changing track conditions that produced two crashes to win the
World Cup four-man bobsled race, Langen's second victory in two
days.
	   Only Switzerland's Marcel Rohner stood in the way of a German
sweep Saturday, finishing second ahead of Germany II and Germany
III, which were third and fourth, respectively.
	   Langen finished his two heats on the winding Bear Hollow track
in a combined 1:36.97 despite sketchy track conditions. The track
was soft early on under a light drizzle, but it hardened during the
second heat as night fell, bringing colder temperatures.
	   ``It didn't really bother me,'' Langen said of the conditions,
which led to crashes by both Great Britain I and Austria I in turn
12, the ``Slingshot.''
	   No serious injuries resulted from the crashes, although three of
the four British sledders broke their helmets. Both sleds rolled
after hitting the top of the curve.
	   Langen, who finished second in both the two-man and four-man
season-opening races in Calgary two weeks ago, won the two-man
competition Friday that marked the international debut of the Bear
Hollow course.
	   Rohner, who finished with a combined 1:37.25, wasn't about to
concede the rest of the season to Langen.
	   ``He is ahead of me now, but one day I will be ahead of him,''
Rohner.
	   Germany II, piloted by Harald Czudaj, finished one-hundredth of
a second behind Rohner, while Andre Lange in Germany III was fourth
in 1:37.41.
	   Jim Herberich piloted USA II to the best American finish,
placing sixth with a time of 1:37.67.

Techno-thriller author Dale Brown awed by success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY308 &QL; 
 &UR; By SANDRA CHEREB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INCLINE VILLAGE, Nevada (AP) _ Military-techno writer Dale Brown
is living the life many aspiring authors only dream of. With his
12th book in the works and a movie venture pending, his success is
unquestionable _ that is, unless you ask Dale Brown.
	   Despite 11 best sellers in as many years, Brown is awed by his
niche in the world of military action novels. It's as if he fears
turning the page to find he's part of a twisted plot that goes awry
in the final chapter.
	   ``I think you can be really big one day and be nowhere the next
day,'' Brown said during an interview at his modest home near the
shores of Lake Tahoe. ``So in my mind, at least, I have to keep on
working as if this is my first shot at it.
	   ``It's safer to have that attitude.''
	   Brown's books, including ``Flight of the Old Dog,'' ``Day of the
Cheetah'' and ``Fatal Terrain,'' have sold more than 10 million
copies in 70 countries and are published in 11 languages.
	   His latest novel, ``The Tin Man,'' blends classic
military-techno wizardry, biker gangs, the illegal drug trade and
law-enforcement corruption in a plot that pits the city of
Sacramento, California, against a terrorist assault from a neo-Nazi
group led by international terrorist Gregory Townsend.
	   The book brings back retired Air Force combat pilot Patrick
McLanahan. Only this time, instead of fighting enemies abroad,
McLanahan is working for a private defense contractor who has
developed a material called BERP _ a light, supple fabric that
gives the wearer nearly invincible, superhuman powers _ hence the
title, ``Tin Man.''
	   Brown's wife, Diane, a retired Sacramento Police Department
narcotics lieutenant, provided technical advice for the book.
	   Earlier this year, Brown formed a joint venture with New
Millennium Entertainment to co-produce his works for feature films
and television.
	   Brown, 41, wrote for fun as a young boy growing up outside
Buffalo, New York. But he never thought someone would pay him to do
it. His early shots at being published came by accident. An
editorial he wrote that was published in his high school newspaper
denouncing student protests over a crackdown on smoking in the
bathrooms won him an award from Saint Bonventure University.
	   Later, while attending Pennsylvania State University, a letter
to the student newspaper criticizing a column brought a challenge
from the editor: ``If you think you can do better, write it up.''
He did, and landed himself a job as a weekly columnist.
	   ``For an entire year's worth of columns I got dlrs 6,'' Brown
recalled. ``But I was so tickled to get it. It was the first time
anybody ever paid me to write for them.''
	   His first novel, ``Flight of the Old Dog,'' took root in the
early 1980s while he was stationed at Mather Air Force Base in
Sacramento. Brown spent eight years in the military and earned the
rank of captain.
	   ``The Aerospace Defense Command was changing over software for
its air defense and space warning systems,'' Brown said. ``There
was a whole series of false alarms. The Cold War was still hot, so
things were real tense at that time.''
	   A navigator-bombardier for B-52G and FB-111A bombers, Brown said
crews were briefed on ground-based laser systems developed by the
Soviets. Afterward, they'd talk about the ``what ifs'' of being
sent to destroy a laser site in a foreign land.
	   ``That's where the idea for the first book came from,'' Brown
said. ``I just started working on it with pencil and paper. It took
three years.''
	   Getting it into print was another matter. Brown said he has a
scrapbook containing about 100 rejection letters for ``Flight of
the Old Dog.''
	   It wasn't until one publisher suggested he find an agent that
things started to look up. Yet dreams of grandeur were kept in
check by cold reality. Brown recalled traveling to New York with
visions of being wined and dined. Instead, he met with his agent
for all of five minutes in a small room piled to the ceiling with
manuscripts.
	   ``He said, 'Fix it and send it back.' That was the whole
thing,'' Brown said.
	   He made the corrections. Thenn he left the Air Force and
returned to California. About a year later he got word that his
book had been sold, and he had a contract for two more _ ``Silver
Tower'' and ``Day of the Cheetah.''
	   That's when he almost retired his pen.
	   ``Day of the Cheetah'' was going to be the last book I was ever
going to write,'' Brown said. ``I just didn't believe I was going
to make it as a full-time author. ... I was going to get out of the
Air Force and become a flight instructor.''
	   But then came a contract for two more books and a chance to
pitch ``Day of the Cheetah'' to Universal Pictures.
	   ``I believed after three best sellers I could just march into
Hollywood and sell this thing _ piece of cake,'' he said, laughing
at his naivete. His ego was quickly deflated by a cab driver who,
during casual conversation, mentioned he had pitched 11 screenplays
to the same person Brown was going to see.
	   These days, Brown divides his time between writing, flying and
home. He and his wife have a young son, Hunter. He is also a
director and volunteer pilot for AirLifeLine, a charitable
organization that flies needy patients free of charge to receive
medical treatment.
	   ``I always wanted to be a writer. I always wanted to fly, too,
so I've been lucky to do both for a living,'' said Brown, who is
working on his 12th book, due out next June.
	   Brown fans can expect the return of McLanahan to military
service, though his mission as yet remains top secret.

Soccer action at Asian Games set to begin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Although the opening ceremony is still
a week away, soccer action of the 13th Asian Games gets under way
Monday with six teams beginning their quest for the most
prestigious gold medal of the competition.
	   Preliminary contests among the 23 teams at the Games will take
place in seven provincial areas before the action moves to stadiums
in Bangkok Dec. 7.
	   Monday's schedule has Turkmenistan facing off Vietnam, China
playing Lebanon and Hong Kong taking on Oman.
	   Favored at the Dec. 6-20 Games are Iran, South Korea, China and
Uzbekistan which downed the Chinese to take the gold at the last
Games in Hiroshima.
	   Another strong team, Saudi Arabia, will not be competing. The
entire national squad pulled out last week in probable protest
against Thailand's failure to solve two criminal cases involving
Saudi citizens.
	   Talent-rich Iran is fielding 12 players from last year's World
Cup, including Bayern Munich striker Ali Daei. South Korea is
bringing four World Cup players.
	   Japan, which also sent a team to France, has chosen to leave
most of its stars at home, opting instead to groom younger players
with an eye towards the 2000 Olympics and the World Cup two years
later, which Japan and South Korea will co-host.

Met Office: Mild haze over Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A mild haze caused by smoke blown
from forest fires in Indonesia hung over Kuala Lumpur, but was
expected to clear soon, the weather office said Sunday.
	   Smoke from fires on the nearby Indonesian island of Sumatra
blanketed Singapore and parts of southern Malaysia Friday and
Saturday.
	   Skies turned gray over Kuala Lumpur and visibility dropped on
Sunday morning, but a desk officer at the meteorological
forecasting office said it was because of dark clouds and not the
``slight haze.''
	   Malaysian officials said pollution levels were not alarming.
Sunday's air pollution index for Kuala Lumpur was not immediately
available.
	   A change in the wind direction in the region was expected to
blow the smog away from Malaysia, Sunday's New Straits Times
newspaper quoted Environment Ministry's Director General Rosnani
Ibrahim as saying.
	   ``This is a transitional period,'' he said.
	   Last year, raging forest fires in Sumatra and another Indonesian
province, Kalimantan, cast a severe haze over the region.
	   It subsided this year as the El Nino weather pattern _ which
caused unusually dry conditions that exacerbated the spread of
annual forest fires _ eased and was replaced by wetter weather.
	   Malaysian officials were trying to determine the extent of the
new forest fires in Sumatra.
	   ``Based on satellite information, the fires are small in scale
and are not expected to result in any prolonged periods of smoke
haze,'' said a statement released by the Environment Ministry
Saturday.

Italian news agency. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British newspapers reported Sunday that the new
Miss World, Israel's Linor Abargil, was sexually assaulted last
month while in Italy for a fashion show.
	   The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid, said that Miss World
competition organizer Julia Morley refused to comment on its
report. Abargil could not be contacted, and a family member who
answered the phone at Abargil's home in Jerusalem declined to
comment.
	   ``For legal reasons, absolutely no comment can be made by Linor
or myself,'' Morley was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
	   In Italy, the Italian news agency ANSA, citing unnamed sources,
said that a travel agency boss in Milan, northern Italy, was
arrested by police after being accused of an Oct. 6 assault on
young model, whom the agency identified as Abargil. The man is
still under investigation, ANSA said.
	   The news agency said reports of the attack first surfaced after
Abargil was named Miss Israel on Oct. 12.
	   The News of the World, a London-based Sunday tabloid, said that
Abargil had given details of the attack to police, which happened
when she accepted a ride from the man from Milan to Rome, where she
was meeting her mother. The newspaper also quoted unnamed sources.
	   The newspaper said that Abargil, who was crowned Miss World on
Saturday night, reported the assault on Oct. 7 to a Rome police
station.

Lorrie Moore: laughter from the edge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY351 &QL; 
 &UR; By HILLEL ITALIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ The world is a funny place around
author Lorrie Moore.
	   She talks about God and a black bird darts by. She gets easy
laughs out of blind dates and cafeteria spinach. She gets hard
laughs out of the cemetery she has picked for her eternal resting
place.
	   Moore is 41, by all appearances healthy and a confirmed
nonbeliever. The afterlife, so to speak, is for the birds. Her
faith is that everything must end and that the end will not be
happy.
	   That's where the jokes come in.
	   ``If you know everything is going to end in tears, it can
release you from worry,'' she says. ``If you know all will end in
tears anyway there might be acts of generosity you find yourself
capable of.''
	   The rare short story writer to make national best-seller lists,
Moore has become a popular voice for a generation of skeptics, a
successor to witty, wide-eyed observers from Ann Beattie and Mary
McCarthy to Dorothy Parker and James Thurber.
	   In books such as ``Like Life,'' ``Self-Help'' and her newest
collection, ``Birds of America,'' Moore sends up poets, academics
and young professionals. But Topic A is the unhappy-but-funny
endings of modern love _ the broken promises and the missed
connections, the arguments and the silences, the ``dust bunnies''
under the beds of our souls.
	   ``I don't really feel like a cynic,'' Moore said during an
interview in her office at the University of Wisconsin, where she
is a professor in the English department. ``A cynic is someone who
feels like nothing is worth believing in, that it's all just trash.
	   ``I'm maybe just more of a pessimist. I think that all these
ideas and these little emotional projects we hope for in the world
are all worth hoping for. But that they will come about? I doubt
it.''
	   Wit runs likes music through her fiction and it brightens (and
darkens) her office as well. On the door are New Yorker cartoons
and a near-illiterate letter from a luggage company, offering Moore
a discount. On the walls inside are more cartoons and a letter from
Celestial Seasonings, asking the author to write something for
their tea boxes. The windows offer a marvelous view of Lake Mendota
and an equally marvelous view of a large concrete circle, where
lovers once met and argued.
	   ``They would stand there at some distance from one another and
look angry and converse with their hands on their hips,'' said
Moore, who then laughed and added, ``They don't go there anymore.
Maybe they discovered people can see them.''
	   Readers should know that the author has had better luck than the
couples she observes. The parents of this accomplished chronicler
of divorce and despair are still together. Moore herself is married
(she and her lawyer husband met on a blind date) and has a
4-year-old son. For one of her characters, middle age means the
``hairs sprout, skin sags, my mouth grows stupid as a boot.'' For
the tall, dark-haired author it has meant both good skin and a
mouth still on the right side of smart.
	   Born and raised in the upstate New York town of Glens Falls,
Moore remembers nothing exceptional about her childhood, although a
normal childhood is enough to set off a potential writer. Moore
grew up in a middle-class neighborhood, in a household where the
Bible was read every evening. This tradition, she said, produced a
family of atheists.
	   Moore noted that religion was not the only ``pillar'' to fall.
(The black bird flew by her office window as she uttered the word
``pillar.'') By age 7, Moore had turned her back on Santa Claus and
fairy godmothers. By college, love had taken a tumble as well.
	   She had always liked making up stories, and making her friends
laugh, and the gifts fit together nicely. As a graduate student she
entered the creative writing program at Cornell University, where
her teacher was the acclaimed fiction writer Alison Lurie.
	   ``It was obvious she was amazingly gifted,'' Lurie said. ``And
at first I didn't know what I could teach her.
	   ``I encouraged her to write about people her own age. The first
thing she turned in was about someone from a previous generation
and it was awfully, awfully good, but it wasn't as amazingly modern
and original as the stuff about people of her generation.''
	   As with any good writer, the sum of Moore's stories transcends
the parts, although the parts are worth noting. Few fiction writers
are so quotable. ``Wives are like cockroaches,'' the narrator
advises ``other women'' in one story, ``They will survive you after
a nuclear attack.'' Marriage is likened to a ``nice warm bath, in a
tub flying off the roof.'' And life? ``In the end, you suffer
alone. But at the beginning you suffer with a whole lot of
others.''
	   Moore was single and living in New York when her first book was
published, in 1985. Now, she is married and settled in Madison,
settled enough to know the shady spot where she wants to be buried.
In earlier fiction, her characters confront the shortage of decent,
available men. In her more recent stories, Moore's characters
confront parenthood and death.
	   In ``Terrific Mother,'' Adrienne is a printmaker haunted by a
terrible accident: While holding a friend's baby, she fell backward
and the child was killed. The friend has forgiven Adrienne, but
Adrienne cannot forgive herself.
	   Adrienne is married to a research economist named Martin, the
rare man in Moore's fiction who says the right things. In an
earlier Moore story, Adrienne would have ended up alone, and wiser.
This time, she stays, and asks for forgiveness.
	   ``I suppose it's a form of universal love, and a kind of
maturity,'' Moore said. ``It's strange how when things shake down
in life you land on some very simple, basic ideas _ like
forgiveness.''

Honduras evacuates 10,000 people because of mudslide fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Authorities began evacuating more
than 10,000 people from the northern town of Choluma out of fear
that four days of heavy rains could cause mudslides.
	   Vice President Billy Handal said the evacuations that began
Saturday could be extended to other towns on Honduras' Caribbean
coast if rains continue as forecast.
	   Already, parts of Choluma, 125 miles (200 kilometers) north of
Tegucigalpa, are flooded, and the Choluma River has risen 3 feet
(about 1 meter) above its normal levels. The waters continue to
rise.
	   It was the second evacuation in a month for residents of the
low-lying parts of Choluma. Most of the town's 40,000 residents
were evacuated because of flooding during Hurricane Mitch a month
ago.
	   The government was preparing temporary shelters for the
evacuees, Handal said.
	   The Honduran government says more than 7,000 people died in the
country from Hurricane Mitch. Another 12,000 are missing, 11,000
are wounded and 2 million were affected, the government says.
	   Choluma also was hard hit in 1974 during Hurricane Fifi. About
4,000 residents of the town died in mudslides.

`A Bug's Life' computer games play on Disney movie release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ARTS-US-Bug Bloopers &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY356 &QL; 
 &UR; By RIC LEYVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A bug in a computer is usually a bad thing.
	   Three exceptions to that rule are a trio of software titles
coming out in conjunction with the November release of Disney's new
computer animated film, ``A Bug's Life.''
	   All center on the movie's hero, Flik, a plucky ant who leads the
colony's uphill battle against invading grasshoppers.
	   The most well-rounded is ``A Bug's Life: Active Play'' (Disney
Interactive, CD-ROM for Windows, dlrs 29.99), which was designed
for children ages 3-7. It's a lighthearted package of puzzles and
games unified by a scavenger hunt for components that make up
Flik's complex contraption to defeat the grasshoppers.
	   Taking elements from the film, like Flik's backpack made of a
rolled-up leaf, the program leads children on a journey through
various activity sites including the Bug Bar and Grill, P.T.'s Flea
Circus, Ant Island and the perilous streets of The City. Each site
has its own different puzzle.
	   With each puzzle's solution comes a reward: a part of Flik's
anti-grasshopper device, a Rube Goldberg-like machine designed to
turn back the enemy insects. The solutions don't come easy, but can
be reached without too much frustration using a process of
elimination.
	   In Ant Island, kids help the ants sort fruit from the berry
harvest, directing red and blue berries as they fall through
ant-hill tunnels so they end up in the right storage areas. In The
City, the task is to reunite a little lost beetle with its father
by maneuvering him safely along a path strewn with obstacles.
	   In the Flea Circus, various insect performers and their props
must be positioned properly for an acrobatic and high-wire act.
Once they're in place, kids launch the animated show. If one or
more of the bug acrobats aren't in the right spots, pratfalls and
other slapstick comedy ensue.
	   Each success takes children one step closer to the ultimate
payoff, an animated sequence featuring the construction and
battlefield use of Flik's crazy contraption.
	   As with previous Disney children's software, designers mix in
educational components with other parts that are pure fun. There's
also a healthy dose of activities, games and crafts to be printed
out and played with away from the computer screen, either alone or
with others, addressing a concern of parents who don't want their
kids glued to the monitor all the time.
	   One is the virtual bug camera, which allows children to take a
closer look at the real lives of the bugs they encounter during
their adventures. Bug snapshots are stored in a virtual photo
album, where kids can learn facts about real bugs, with color
photos and voice-over narration by ``A Bug's Life'' characters.
	   The information and photos can be printed out to make bug fact
cards that kids can study, share with friends or even take to
school.
	   Another title for ages 3-7 is ``A Bug's Life: Print Studio''
(dlrs 19.99), which has greeting cards, banners, party invitations,
stationery, calendars, envelopes and other items in an array of
colors, backgrounds and styles. All the movie's favorite characters
are there, including Flik, the villain Hopper and lovely Princess
Atta.
	   Finally, in a title aimed at older children and teen-agers,
there's ``A Bug's Life: Action Game'' (dlrs 29.99). It's a 3-D,
arcade-style adventure that closely follows the plot of the film,
sending Flik on a dangerous overland journey to gather enough
goodies to defeat the grasshoppers. Many hostile bugs cross his
path, so he fends them off by hurling berries.
	   There are 15 action-packed levels, each of which, upon
completion, rewards players with actual clips from the feature
film, totaling 20 minutes in all. The levels get progressively
harder, from relatively simple runs through the daisies to tougher
stuff, like a gliding flight hanging from a dandelion tuft, riding
updrafts across a barren plain. Beware of hungry robins that swoop
down if you fall short of your goal.

Bug bloopers give 'Bug's Life' a funny postscript
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ARTS-US-Bug's Life &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Don't leave ``A Bug's Life'' before the final
credits have finished rolling. You'll miss one of the funniest bits
in the movie.
	   These would be the blooper outtakes: actors flubbing lines, a
microphone dropping into the scene, an actor sulking back to his
trailer. You hear the director say, ``Action,'' and you see the
clapper.
	   Only this is computer animation. There are no outtakes. It's
impossible. Mistakes occur on the computer screen, not on the set,
because there is no set. And there are no actors, just computer
creations given voices.
	   You laugh at the outtakes, then you laugh at yourself for
believing there could be outtakes.
	   ``We actually had the idea back on 'Toy Story' to do this, but
we didn't have the time,'' explained ``Toy Story'' and ``Bug's
Life'' director John Lasseter of the Northern California Pixar
studio, which created the films for Disney. ``I saved the idea and
quietly kept it in the back of my head and decided it had to be in
this movie. I really worked hard to make it happen.''
	   For inspiration, Pixar's animators looked at the outtakes from
Burt Reynolds' ``Cannonball Run'' films.
	   And for realism, the clapper's slate seen in the fake outtakes
has the actual scene number and date the shot was completed on the
computer.
	   Although the bloopers come at the end of the movie, the actors'
voices for them were recorded before animation even began. With
``Bug's Life,'' as with ``Toy Story'' and other Disney animated
features, the voices are recorded first, then the artwork drawn
around them.
	   As for the director's voice you hear, ``That's me,'' says
Lasseter.
	   But it's not the role the Oscar winner gave himself in the
movie.
	   He's also one of the two grasshoppers in the border bar who
can't remember the lyrics to the song, ``La Cucaracha,'' as well as
the doomed bug who becomes hypnotized by an electric bug-zapper.
	   ``I can't help it. It's so beautiful,'' the bug says in
Lasseter's falsetto, just before getting zapped.

Whitney added a goal and three assists as the Florida Panthers
chased two-time NHL MVP Dominik Hasek on the way to routing the
Buffalo Sabres.
	   Scott Mellanby and Robert Svehla each had a goal and two assists
as the Panthers tallied their highest output since a 5-5 tie Nov.
19 at Boston. Radek Dvorak added a shorthanded goal.
	   Hasek, the two-time reigning Hart Trophy winner, was yanked by
Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff with the Sabres trailing 2-1 after the
first period. He made 15 of 17 saves, including several key stops
as the Panthers peppered him from the opening seconds.
 &UR; Blues 4, Capitals 2
	   In St. Louis, Jamie McLennan stopped 32 shots and Pierre Turgeon
scored the game-winning goal as the St. Louis Blues beat the
Washington Capitals.
	   McLennan, playing in his 100th NHL game, is 4-3-0 since taking
over for Grant Fuhr, who suffered a groin injury on Nov. 7.
	   Turgeon gave the Blues a 3-1 lead when he scored on a power play
at 6:28 of the third period. Turgeon scored after taking a pass
from behind the goal by Pavol Demitra.
	   The Blues are 3-2-1 in their last six games while the Capitals
are 2-4-0 in their last six.

Trio en route to South Pole pass place of Scott's demise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Antarctic adventurers Peter Hillary,
Eric Phillips and Jon Muir _ en route to the South Pole _ have
passed the site where British explorer Robert Scott perished more
than 85 years ago.
	   Since leaving Scott Base, Antarctica, on Nov. 4 the adventurers
have covered more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) on foot.
	   After three weeks of trekking, team officials said Sunday the
three had passed the site where Scott's ill-fated journey came to
an end in 1912 as they attempt to retrace his journey to the South
Pole and back.
	   Each of the team is hauling a sled loaded with more than 150
kilograms (330 pounds) of food, cooking fuel and equipment.
	   They have left quantities of food and cooking fuel at each of
the two depots they have established so far on the pole-ward leg of
the journey, to be collected on their return to Scott Base.
	   ``We have had to endure temperatures as cold as minus 15 degrees
Celsius, a screaming blizzard which forced us into the tent for a
day, and sastrugi (snow ridges on the ice) which have made our
progress slower than expected,'' Hillary, son of Mt. Everest
conqueror Sir Edmund Hillary, said Sunday.
	   ``But we have had some good days and as we leave each depot our
load lightens and we can travel faster.''
	   The team had been keeping their spirits up by speaking to their
families by satellite phones.
	   The team is aiming to travel the remaining 1,000 kilometers (620
miles) to the South Pole by Christmas Day, but have to traverse the
crevasse-riddled Shackleton Glacier on the way.

UN gives government a reprieve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government will have
until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from
declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka
uranium mine.
	   At its meeting in Kyoto, Japan, UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau
on Saturday night expressed ``grave concerns'' about the impact
Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural world values.
	   But after intensive lobbying from the Australian government, the
bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world
heritage areas considered to be in danger.
	   Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed
report by April 15 next year saying what had been done to ``prevent
further damage and to mitigate all the threats'' to the park posed
by Jabiluka.''
	   The bureau said that if the report did not show that the threats
posed by Jabiluka had been properly dealt with, Kakadu should
immediately be put on the in danger list, joining other areas such
as the war-torn old city of Jerusalem.
	   Last Wednesday, the committee called for the scrapping of the
mine.
	   Federal Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as
biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity. And while the report
was thought to be an embarrassment to the Australian government,
Hill stressed that the committee's findings had no legal standing
and that construction of the mine would not stop.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
	   The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million
metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the
environment.

Australia move to 194 for four at lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Australian batsmen ground out a spirited
England bowling attack Sunday as it stayed focus on a sizable
first-innings lead in the second Ashes test at the WACA.
	   After dismissing England for 112 on Saturday, Australia,
resuming the day on 150 for three, made slow progress to 194 for
four at lunch on the second day.
	   Australia lost the solitary wicket of night watchman Jason
Gillespie (11), but the Waugh twins _ Mark and Steve _ continued to
defy England.
	   The home side did well not to lose more than a wicket,
especially against the pumped-up Darren Gough and left-arm seamer
Alan Mullally, who beat the bat without much luck.
	   Mullally was rewarded for his persistence, finally finding a
leading edge off Gillespie and wicketkeeper Alec Stewart completed
a good catch.
	   England dropped another catch, the fourth of the innings, giving
Steve Waugh (19 not out) an early life on 11. An outside edge off
Mullally, the best bowler of the morning, flew past Mark Butcher at
third slip as he moved slowly and managed to get his fingertips.
	   Mark Waugh, 34 not out, who exchanged words with Gough before
India umpire Srini Venkataraghavan intervened, faced 87 balls in
adding 15 runs to his overnight score.
