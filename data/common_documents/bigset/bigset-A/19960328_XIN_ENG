<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
will arrive here Saturday to hold talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian Minister of Information Safwat el-Sherif,
the two leaders will discuss regional developments and Egypt's
mediation efforts in the Yemeni-Eritrean conflict over the Red Sea
Greater Hanish island.

<HEADLINE> More Farmers to Attend Govt's Farming Extension Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Agriculture
Teketel Forsido said today the government plans to embrace
400,000 farmers in the government's farming extension program
this year, as against only 40,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here, the minister said production of
the main crops has grown by two to four fold following the
implementation of the extension program in various areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, maize production has zoomed from
the previous 20-25 quintals (one quintal equals to 100 kilograms)
per hectare to 60-80 and even 100 quintals per hectare following
the application of agricultural promotion techniques.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production has grown from 12-20 to 40-50 quintals per
hectare while teff production per hectare has doubled to 15-25
quintals.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic life of people living in areas where
extension program has been put in practice is showing
considerable improvement.
</P>
<P>
Based on the achievements gained so far, preparations are
under way to embrace more farmers in the extension program this
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are about 10 million farmers in Ethiopia. The new plan
indicates that the government will speed up the implementation of
its agricultural extension program to promote crops production in
the country.

<HEADLINE> LLO Delegation Ends Advisory Mission To Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A two-man delegation from the
International Labor Organization (LLO) based in Geneva left
Uganda today after a two-week labor administration audit and
advisory mission to 10 districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was led by Von Richthofen, a senior labor
administration specialist from the LLO.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Uganda, Richthofen told journalists that they
were invited by the government to assist the Ugandan Ministry of
Labor to take stock of and identify problems which had impeded
smooth labor administration in the country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation earlier today met with Minister of Labor and
Social Affairs Steven Chebrot whom they briefed about the
findings of their mission.
</P>
<P>
Chebrot informed the delegation that the government of Uganda
is committed to streamlining labor administration for the benefit
of employees and workers.
</P>
<P>
He, however, noted that logistical constraints have greatly
impeded the government's effort in the provision of required
services especially at district level.
</P>
<P>
Richthofen reported that some districts are lacking in the
basic labor standards, adding that this situation must be quickly
addressed because maintenance of labor laws is a national
obligation.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Egyptian Plane Returns to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian passenger plane which
was hijacked to Libya Wednesday returned to Cairo safe and sound
today.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 of EgyptAir was hijacked to the Libyan
Mediterranean city of Martubah, some 250 kilometers west of
Egypt. Wednesday's initial reports about the hijacking had said
that the EgyptAir plane landed in Tobruk, also an Libyan
Mediterranean city near the Libyan-Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus A300, the Egyptian plane sent to Libya to transport
the passengers of the hijacked plane back to Egypt, also returned
to Cairo today, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy and Tourism Minister Mamdouh
el-Beltagui greeted the 145 passengers at the airport. No one was
hurt in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The three Egyptian hijackers surrendered to the Libyan
authorities Wednesday evening. Earlier reports said that the
hijackers are Saudis, but investigations carried out later showed
that they are all Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted security sources as saying that Mohamed Mahmoud
Hamid, his son and nephew, managed to pass through the scanners at
the Luxor airport undetected with bags of gun powder, which were
taken for bags of flour.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir's laxity in security check-ups was further exposed as
Amenhot Nasser, pilot of the hijacked plane, disclosed that while
145 passengers were on board the plane, only 140 names were listed
on the airline's boarding list, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told reporters today that
Egypt has asked the Libyan authorities to hand over the hijackers,
who do not belong to a political or any other organization.
</P>
<P>
Sources were also quoted by MENA as saying that the hijackers
seized the plane only five minutes before it was to touch down at
the Cairo airport.
</P>
<P>
One of the hijackers forced his way into the cockpit and
ordered the pilot to fly to Libya, threatening with two Molotov
cocktails and a bag full of gun powder, the pilot of the hijacked
plane was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Today, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi met with the passengers of
the commandeered plane and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
was in Libya for talks with Gaddafi on the incident, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers claimed Wednesday that they wanted to present "a
message from God" to Gaddafi, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
U.S. President Bill Clinton demanding a lifting of the Israeli
closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a solution to the
issue of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They said that they have important information about the failed
assassination attempt on the life of Mubarak in Addis Ababa last
June.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane had been en route from the Saudi port city
of Jeddah to Cairo with a stopover in Luxor, Egypt's southern
resort city famous for temples and tombs left over from the
Pharaonic era.

<HEADLINE> Regional Infrastructure Investment Meeting Opens  In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A round-table meeting to examine
policy aspects of promoting and implementing foreign direct
investment in infrastructure in southern and eastern Africa
opened today in Entebbe, 40 kilometers south of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Uganda, the meeting which brought together
ministers, permanent secretaries and senior investment experts
from the eastern and southern Africa region was opened by the
Ugandan Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Mayanja
Nkangi.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is co-sponsored by the International Finance
Corporation, the World Bank, the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Nkangi expressed confidence that the
meeting would offer recommendation to enhance regional
integration, cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to reduce direct government
investment in infrastructure so as to increase efficiency and
inter-country penetration all over the region.
</P>
<P>
Representing the Director of UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa,
the UNDP Resident Representative in Uganda Thomas Babatunde said
his organization was committed to increased investment on the
continent in line with the recently launched system "Wide-Special
Initiative for Africa."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the meeting would give a framework for both the
private sector and the government to enter dialogue on the best
way to revitalize the region's infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Mandate for Operation Provide Comfort Extended in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government today had
the mandate for the Operation Provide comfort (OPC) extended for
another three months as of March 31, while it promised to bring
necessary changes to the status of the controversial operation.
</P>
<P>
The government's extension draft was passed in the parliament
by a vote of 243 to 199, with 76 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Under the OPC which dates back to 1991, a U.S.-British-French
air force comprising 48 war planes and an array of support
aircraft and helicopters has been based in southeastern Turkey
and patrolled an air exclusion zone north of the 36th parallel to
deter an Iraqi attack on Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
But opposition leaders and local media pointed out that the
operation has in fact created a "power vacuum" in northern Iraq
which Turkish separatist Kurds took advantage of in their
entrenchment and infiltration into southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told the legislature that
with the mandate extension, his government would neither let the
OPC undermine Iraq's territorial unity, nor allow the separatist
Kurdish Workers' Party to continue their activity in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey had kept talks with its Western allies on the
topic and Turkey's concern over Iraq's territorial integrity was
met with more understanding.
</P>
<P>
Washington will send a representative to northern Iraq in the
near future to meet Iraqi Kurdish leaders on how to bring
stability to the region, Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
However, some circles in Turkey still suspect that the United
States is trying to set up an independent Kurdish state in
northern iraq, which they believe would lead to a disastrous
impact on Turkey's Kurdish problem.
</P>
<P>
The government draft promised to make efforts to resume Iraq's
territorial integrity and build up security along the
Turkish-Iraqi border within the next three months.

<HEADLINE> Banks Must Slash Workforces by Up to Half: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Many large retail banks in North
America, Europe and the UK will have to slash their workforces by
up to half within the next 10 years, according to a report to be
published next week.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Economist Intelligence Unit and management
consultants Coopers and Lybrand, argues that these banks'
opportunities to increase market share will be severely limited in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
If they are to be able to pay for big investments in new
products and services, they will have to cut the costs of their
existing operations.
</P>
<P>
"Staff reductions of as high as 50 percent by 2005 will not be
uncommon," says the study, which draws on Coopers and Lybrand
research and more than 50 interviews with senior bank executives.
</P>
<P>
The report comes within a few days of the announcement by
Barclays Bank, one of the UK's largest banks, that it is offering
voluntary redundancy to 1,000 managerial and clerical staff in
high street branches.
</P>
<P>
The report foresees not only a sharp drop in staff numbers
among large retail banks, but a change in the skills employees
will require.
</P>
<P>
It also forecasts significant change in how services are
provided. Bank branches will move from being the most important
delivery channel to being the least important.
</P>
<P>
Instead, screen-based banking through personal computers,
television and more powerful cash machines will dominate, together
with "express banking shops" -- outlets in places such as offices
and shopping malls where customers can meet bank staff and carry
out simple transactions.
</P>
<P>
Banks will need to provide "anytime, anywhere, anyhow" banking
for customers and to support that service by emphasizing their
financial strength and their brand, the report says.
</P>
<P>
However, it was difficult for staff to promote the bank's brand
if their job prospects were uncertain. This added to the case for
banks to act quickly in cutting employee numbers rather than
looking for more gradual change.

<HEADLINE> China Elaborates on Position on Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese disarmament ambassador Sha
Zukang today stressed the need for compromise and flexibility from
all parties in order to ensure the conclusion of a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty no later than 1996.
</P>
<P>
"China believes that as long as all parties concerned show
enough political will and necessary flexibility in the
negotiations, it is possible to achieve the objective of
concluding the treaty this year," Sha said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador made the remarks in a general statement
to the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament at which a nuclear
test ban treaty has been negotiated since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sha said that in order to concentrate on its economic reforms,
China needs and has been making all-around efforts for a long-term
peaceful international environment.
</P>
<P>
As an aspect of the comprehensive efforts, China has been
participating in the test ban talks in a "positive, serious and
responsible manner" in the past two years and more, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation hopes to conclude, no later than 1996,
a good test ban treaty, which will genuinely prohibit all nuclear
weapon test explosions, and which is universal and internationally
and effectively verifiable, so as to promote international peace
and security," Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that the nuclear test ban treaty will have
a long-term bearing on international peace and security, he said,
China stands for solving the outstanding issues "with a realistic
and serious attitude," instead of "in a simplistic, hasty manner."
</P>
<P>
"If some people misinterpret this position as being not
positive to the negotiations, it is either out of ignorance or
ulterior political motives," the Chinese ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all parties need to recognize each other's
legitimate concerns, and on that basis, show sufficient
flexibility, in order to work out necessary compromise.
</P>
<P>
"Any effort to make use of one's advantageous edge in certain
areas to seek unilateral benefits from the treaty is a recipe for
failure and can only lead the negotiations to a dead end," said
Sha.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China is willing to make compromises on
some issues, but that cannot be done on a unilateral basis. "No
country can impose its will on China under any circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador spelled out China's positions on some main
outstanding issues of the test ban talks.
</P>
<P>
On the key issue of the scope of the ban, Sha said China is
committed to concluding a test ban treaty which prohibits any
nuclear weapon test explosion at any place and in any environment,
that is to say, the scope of the test ban should exclude any
threshold.
</P>
<P>
On peaceful nuclear explosions (PNES), the Chinese delegation
maintains that as an important principle, any disarmament or arms
control treaty should not hinder the development and application
of science and technology for peaceful purposes. Therefore, it
would be incorrect if the test ban treaty should ban PNES.
</P>
<P>
"China fully shares the concern over the possible misuse of
PNES. However, we think that this issue can be solved by
establishing a strict application and approval procedure and an
effective international on-site monitoring mechanism for the whole
process of PNES," Sha said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also stressed that in order to ensure reaching
the two main objectives of a test ban: to promote nuclear
disarmament and to prevent nuclear proliferation, the test ban
treaty should enter into force only after being ratified by all
nuclear-capable states, as specified in the relevant International
Atomic Energy Agency list.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Ukraine Trip May Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that his official visit to Ukraine due to start on
April 4 may be postponed because of the deadlock between Moscow
and Kiev over the Black Sea Fleet issue.
</P>
<P>
After signing of number of documents with visiting Kirghiz
President Askar Akayev in the Kremlin, Yeltsin told reporters here
that the delay could be caused by the still unsettled Black Sea
Fleet division dispute.
</P>
<P>
"If the agreement on the fleet is not included in the big
treaty (on friendship and cooperation) with Ukraine, there's no
reason to hurry myself to Kiev," Yeltsin said. "Let's move the
visit up a little more and settle this problem for good, so both
sides are satisfied."
</P>
<P>
"We have only two unsettled fleet issues left with Ukraine,"
the Russian president said, without specifying what they were.
</P>
<P>
He said that he settled one of the issues in a telephone talk
with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma Wednesday night. But, the
other one remains, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the prime ministers of the two countries
discussed the remaining issue all the day Wednesday but failed to
reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not changing our positions," Yeltsin said, noting that
the Ukrainian side is doing the same. "This is no good," the
Russian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev flew to
Ukraine to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Valeri Shmarov, to
discuss the remaining issue.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has already postponed his visit to Ukraine several
times because of the two sides' differences over the fleet
division.

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks EU Compensation for Cattle Slaughtering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg told the House of Commons this afternoon that the
government is seeking financial help from the European Union
before announcing any cattle slaughter policy.
</P>
<P>
The minister repeated once more that British beef was safe to
eat despite the collapse of the home beef market and the EU ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the British cabinet discussed the
possibility of slaughtering cattle this morning, but so far no
policy on this matter has been announced.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major promised that his government would be
making an announcement later today on the next step to restore
confidence in British beef, which has been severely damaged by the
wave of the mad cow disease (BSE) scares.
</P>
<P>
Major also told parliament that the whole issue of restoring
consumer confidence was being examined and several options were
under discussion.
</P>
<P>
It would be inappropriate to bring recommendations into force
on cattle slaughtering and without proper care, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hellenic Pharmaceuticals
Organization today banned the distribution and sale of cosmetics
manufactured from substances originating from British beef
products.
</P>
<P>
The ban was announced amidst Europe-wide fears that Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) may be linked to the deadly
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the ban would remain in effect
pending a European Union decision on the problem. It called on
companies producing, importing and distributing cosmetic products
to adhere to the ban.
</P>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua)-- Finance Minister Chris
Liebenberg's resignation would be announced later today, said a
South African government sources.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela was expected to confirm this when he
announced a cabinet reshuffle in a special address to parliament
at 6 pm, said the source.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that Trade and Industry Minister Trevor
Manuel would take over the finance portfolio, and that Deputy
Finance Minister Alec Erwin would be promoted to the cabinet and
take over the trade and industry portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about Liebenberg's resignation first surfaced on
Wednesday, and were neither confirmed nor denied by the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, presidential spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe
declined to say whether the rumor was correct, but said a

However, Liebenberg on Wednesday did not deny the rumor, but
said he occupied his post ''at the pleasure of the president''.

Liebenberg, who was not elected to parliament, was appointed
finance minister in October 1994 after an amendment to the
interim constitution was made for him to take the cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's local currency Rand weakened for a
second consecutive day as the market braced itself for
Liebenberg's rumored resignation. enditem

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Announces New Moves to Support Higher Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he has decided to take some practical steps to
support higher education, a move aimed to win the "minds and
hearts" of Russian intellectuals in the June presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of higher educationists, Yeltsin said his
re-election platform will emphasize "investment in people, their
education, culture, morality and health."
</P>
<P>
He said the federal budget will allocate 100 billion roubles
(more than 22 million U.S. dollars) to the leading scientific
schools.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that this is clearly not enough, Yeltsin said he has
decided to establish a presidential scholarship for 100 young
researchers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a pension system will be established for
professors to ensure they will receive at least 80 percent of
their average salaries, which means 50-120 dollars for each person.
</P>
<P>
By all these measures, the president is trying to win the
"minds and hearts" of the voters and gain support from the
country's intellectuals in the forthcoming presidential polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's arms sales increased by
65 percent to some 2.2 billion U.S. dollars last year, a Russian
general said today.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Alexander Kotelkin, head of the Rosvooruzheniye
government arms export company, told a news briefing that the
spectacular growth happened at a time when the world arms market
shrunk almost by 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Russia's arms sales contracts for 1996 total more than 7
billion dollars, said Kotelkin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rosvooruzheniye spokesman Valery Pogrebenkov said on
the same occasion that Russia fetched over 3 billion dollars
through arms sales in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Former Soviet Union's arms trade peaked in 1987 when its sales
totaled over 20 billion dollars, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
With trade missions in 30 countries, Rosvooruzheniye sells arms
to 51 countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
</P>
<P>
The arms exported by Russia include MIG aircraft and Mi-17 and
BTR-80 helicopters as well as various kinds of guns.

<HEADLINE> Fijians Win Carlsberg Cup 10s Rugby in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Mana Magicians of Fiji
played some of the best rugby ever seen in Hong Kong to beat the
Tokyo Aliens of Japan 25-17 and lifted the Carlsberg Cup
International 10s title here today.
</P>
<P>
An amazing try late in the second half which saw the Fijians
sweep from behind their own goal line to score at the other end
finished off two time winners Aliens who seemed to have the upper
hand with their overwhelming physical force.
</P>
<P>
But soon after the game was leveled at 17-17, Kini Boko evaded
five tackles behind his own posts before passing to Marika Gusuna
who sprinted up the touch line and kicked ahead for Nemia Ratu to
catch and send away Joape Seru to score the winning try.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fantastic try. You cannot defend against something
like that," admitted Aliens captain Steve Miln. "We have no
excuse. We fronted and gave the crowd a good final and a good
day's rugby. Hopefully the Fijians will be back next year and we
can have another go at them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Mana Magicians defeated a New Zealand A team in the Air
Pacific final in New Zealand last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, the US Hogs made their first Carlsberg 10s
tournament a winning one by taking the Plate title with a 19-15
victory over the Royal Logistics Corps.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Gaijin rounded off an impressive tournament by lifting
their second Bowl title in three years with a thumping 72-0
victory over the Royal Logistics Corps of Britain.
</P>
<P>
And the all-Fijian semi-final between holders Davetalevu and
Mana was a bit of disappointment for the crowd.
</P>
<P>
It was a very tight match between two talented sides and Mana
Magicians had a few more tricks in the end and won out 12-5 over
their countrymen, thanks to tries from Nemia Ratu and Kini Boko.
</P>
<P>
In the Bowl competition, the Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA) Sports Institute team put up a fighting display against
Tokyo Gaijin in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The PLA, playing in its first international tournament after
taking up the sport just three years ago, scored three tries
before eventually succumbed 39-21.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with the way we performed but we have to learn a
lot about playing rugby," said Duan Caizao, the playing captain.
Duan scored one of the tries.
</P>
<P>
"It would be good it we could play some more rugby in Hong Kong
and come back to the 10s next years," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Business Investments Increase Slowly in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The investments in plants and
equipment by U.S. businesses will rise by 1.5 percent this year,
well below the increase in 1995, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that a national survey showed U.S.
businesses plan to spend 603.4 billion dollars in plants and
equipment investment, up from 594.5 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise of business investment will be the fifth straight
increase but much slower than in the previous two years when it
shot up by 12.3 percent in 1994 and by 8.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By industry, the manufacturing companies plan to increase their
investments by 7.2 percent, to 184.8 billion dollars. Businesses
producing durable goods said they planned a 9.6 percent increase;
nondurable goods producers, 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Increases also were planned in finance, insurance and real
estate industry, up 0.7 percent; services, up 4.6 percent; and
communications, up 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But declines were expected in other areas -- down 6.7 percent in
the mining industry, down 5.2 percent by utilities, 5 percent by
transportation firms, and 4.3 percent by wholesale and retail
trade businesses.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts said that the small increase in business
investments is due to the slower economic growth which resulted in
lower profits and the businesses have fewer dollars to invest.
Meanwhile, the nation's factories are operating below capacity so
there is less need to increase and modernize equipment and
facilities.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after an hour-long meeting at the

</P>
<P>
Di Roberto, who arrived here Wednesday for the second visit

briefed the minister on the conclusion of his report prepared for
the EU Council.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said that Cyprus welcomes and encourages EU
interest but would like to see coordination among efforts toward a

After the meeting with President Clerides, Di Roberto crossed

<HEADLINE> Croats, Muslims Blamed for Obstructing Federal Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The international mediator for the
Bosnian Federation on Wednesday blamed Bosnian Croats for the
unsuccessful attempt to create transitional federal authorities in
the central Bosnian town of Bugojno.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, Christian
Schwarz-Schiling, mediator from Germany in Bosnia, said that he is
convinced the transitional municipal council of Bugojno would have
been formed if the Croats had wanted it.
</P>
<P>
He said HDZ, the largest Bosnian Croat party, insisted on an
"illegal procedure," because it was willing to recognize the
mandates of only 35 council members instead of the agreed 48, so
the council's founding session was interrupted.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz-schiling, who has been put in charge of the formation of
federation by the international contact group, also accused Muslims
of failing to acceptng a proposed agenda of the founding assembly of
the council in Stolac.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz-schiling said that he supports the German government's
decision to call off a conference on solving problems in the
federation that was due to be held in Bonn-Petersburg on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will cointinue to follow the law and international
agreements, but we cannot continue to sign agreements while at the
same time the leaders are giving the people instructions contrary to
those that they sign," he said. enditem

ZAGREB, March 28 (Xinhua) -- There are certain indications that

<P>
He said that the dumped materials would pollute underground
water used by Sarajevans.
</P>

Smajic also said that IFOR troops cut a great deal of woods in

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The defense Ministers of the former
Soviet republics see the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) as a threat, a Russian Army general
said today.
</P>
<P>
Summing up Wednesday's meeting of the defense ministers of the
member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
General Viktor Samsonov said that the possibility of NATO's
eastward expansion has given a boost to the military integration
within the framework of the CIS. General Samsonov heads the CIS
committee on military coordination.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CIS states should work out a joint strategy in
response to NATO's expansion plan but that will be done by the
defense ministers at their next meeting.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the CIS countries will establish a new
military coordination body -- the CIS Joint Chiefs of Staff, which
will be chaired by Russian Chief of the General Staff General
Mikhail Kolesnikov. This indicates that military integration
within the CIS is underway, Samsonov pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that the defense ministers have decided at Wednesday's
meeting to take further moves to upgrade the joint air defense
system. Majority of the CIS member nations have reached an
agreement on customs policies and the funding and placement of
production orders needed for the system, the General said. But
Azerbaijan and Moldova prefer to remain outside the joint air
defense system.
</P>
<P>
All of the 12 CIS states, except Moldova, Armenia and
Uzbekistan, were represented by their defense ministers. Moldova
failed to attend the session, while Armenia and Uzbekistan were
represented by general staff officers.

Weather experts say the amount of rainfall - a fraction under

Shanghai residents have been forced to cover up, by adding more
clothes to keep warm, while protecting themselves from the

<HEADLINE> Major Railway Junction Work Completed Two Years Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A major railway hub, built in
express time, has been given the all-clear signal by official
assessors.
</P>
<P>
Work started on the Fuyang railway hub, the largest and
most complicated on the Beijing-Kowloon railway, in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted that because of the extensive work
involved, the project would take five years to complete.
</P>
<P>
But a few days ago the work was finally completed - more than
two years early -- and to add to the success story it has passed a
technical assessment by railway experts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Beijing-Kowloon railway, another four
railway lines also intersect the hub, which is located in the
northwestern part of Anhui Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
The hub consists of 165 bridges and culverts, and 147 km of
railway lines.
</P>
<P>
Once fully operational, the hub is expected to handle more than
10,000 freight trains a year, carrying 130 million tons of
goods. More than 60 passenger trains will go past the hub every
day.
</P>
<P>
Railway workers are busy constructing telecommunications and
power facilities, to ensure that the hub can be put into use by
September this year.

<HEADLINE> Bir Zeit University Protests Israel's Arrests of Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bir Zeit University issued a
statement today strongly condemning the Israeli military
authorities for a pre-dawn invasion of the town of Bir Zeit and a
mass detention of some 200 university students.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Israel's seizure of almost 10 percent of the
university student body is a grave violation of human rights and
the rule of law on a scale unprecedented in the university's bitter
history under Israel's military occupation, according to a report
of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"In the pre-dawn hours this morning, large contingents of
Israeli and security services moved into the town of Bir Zeit,"
the statement said, adding that teams of soldiers invaded student
houses and student apartment buildings, breaking doors and windows
and damaging other property as students, and other residents, were
seized and taken away.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Travel to the University was blocked until
approximately 11 a.m. this morning, leaving students and teachers
stranded along the road."
</P>
<P>
The university said that although Israeli radio reports affirmed
that the raid was directed against the University's Gaza
students, a narrow majority of the arrests reported so far by
eyewitnesses are of students from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"In relation to Gaza students, the University continues to
uphold firmly their right to study at Bir Zeit University without
harassment, and points out that this principle is confirmed by the
interim agreements which clearly consider the West Bank and Gaza
to be a "single territorial unit," it said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A teenage boy took the fashion
world by storm in China today by showing he is a cut above the
rest.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jin, who is 19, captured the championship trophy in a
major national fashion design contest in Beijing - beating over
400 rivals, many of them experienced designers.
</P>
<P>
Now his work is destined for show at the prestige Hong Kong
Fashion Festival next year.
</P>
<P>
More than 440 designers from across China entered the contest
to design fashions for modern career women.
</P>
<P>
But it was Liu's work that swept the board, bringing a big
shake to the country's most open-minded garment experts.
</P>
<P>
The Moniza Cup contest was originally launched last March when
the search for top fashions started. The 33 most outstanding
participants paraded their work in the final this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But secondary school boy, Liu Jin, gave a good lesson to his
elder competitors on the concept of modern fashion.
</P>
<P>
The robust but modest boy brought the house down when he
presented a series of womens' garments, themed "Storm in Old
Fortress," to the audience composed of more than three hundred
Chinese and foreign fashion experts, and social celebrities.
</P>
<P>
His garments adopted silk inside, and heavy woollen as a
coating, creating a striking visual impact through its excellent
three-dimension design, as experts commented.
</P>
<P>
He will be invited to attend the '97 Hong Kong Fashion
Festival, according to the selecting committee of the contest.
</P>
<P>
Li Xin, a senior fashion designer and chairwoman of the
selecting committee, said that the contest gave a "panorama view'
of the competence, and artistic talent of Chinese young designers,
and helped establish more domestic hard garment brands, and
improved the fashion design business.
</P>
<P>
The designs presented this afternoon showcased the
daily wear of Chinese career women, ranging from office clothing,
evening dress to casual wear. The best pieces will be put into
production by the Beijing-based Moniza Company.

<HEADLINE> Education Sector Must Train More Personnel: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
called on the country's educational sector to meet the need to
train people for China's massive modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that the quality and efficiency of teaching
across the country should also be improved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum to mark the 100th anniversary of the
founding of Jiaotong University which falls on April 8, Jiang
said, "Trying to institute a socialist educational system with
Chinese characteristics is a precondition for achieving China's
socialist modernization."
</P>
<P>
This is a "glorious common task" that teachers, and the entire
Chinese people must fulfil, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, schools must train large numbers of
specialized senior personnel, as well as large numbers of
technicians, managers and executives for rural areas, enterprises
and institutions at grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
The leader emphasized that in carrying out educational reforms,
it is imperative to put "firm and correct" political orientation
above anything else, and persist in arming all teachers and
students with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought,
particularly Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative to encourage teachers and students to set
a correct outlook on the world and life, and a correct concept of
values, and guide them to conscientiously resist corrosive
influence of various sorts of decadent ideas and culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party, urged that efforts be made to make education in patriotism,
collectivism and socialism more "lively, pragmatic and effective."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must attach the utmost importance to linking
education with production and labor. We must also teach students
to have a correct understanding of the relation between them and
the laboring people, increase their feelings for laboring
people, and take the road of integrating themselves with
laboring people."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to make it the guideline in all
schools, especially colleges and universities, to carry forward the
virtues of the Chinese nation and fine tradition of the Chinese
Communist Party, foster the spirit of loving the motherland, and
devotion to one's career, solidify the belief in socialism and
master the skills needed for China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
"We must try to train students into socialism builders, and
successors with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a good education
and a strong sense of discipline," he told the forum.
</P>
<P>
The forum was attended by leading officials from Shanghai
Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Southwest China
Jiaotong University and North China Jiaotong University.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang called on teachers to become good friends and
guides of their students.
</P>
<P>
"All teachers, particularly young teachers, must
conscientiously improve their ideological, theoretical, political
and moral cultivation with Marxism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary to provide necessary financing and
materials to aid universities and colleges in the development of, and
research, into high technology.
</P>
<P>
"Colleges and universities should try to make breakthroughs in
a number of major high-tech projects, in order to better serve
China's economic construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Party secretaries and presidents of universities and colleges
must try to enable themselves to become "socialist statesmen and
educators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures must be taken to strengthen the Party's
leadership over reform and development in colleges and
universities, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen tonight reaffirmed China's support for Iraq,
and said left over issues from the Gulf War should be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Qian's comments came during talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf in Beijing this evening.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers exchanged views on the situation in
the Gulf, as well as on bilateral ties and other issues of common
concern, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated that the Chinese government supports Iraq's
efforts to safeguard state sovereignty, unification and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the issues left over from the Gulf war should
be settled at an early date, based on an overall implementation of
relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council, Qian was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of these issues is not only conducive to
achieving peace and stability in that region, but will also create
 favorable conditions for countries in the region to focus on
economic development, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He told his guest that China will continue to make efforts to
gradually resolve the problems left over by the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the purpose of the Security Council's
Resolution 986, the so-called Iraq "food for oil" exchange, is
aimed at alleviating the plight in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate that Iraq takes a flexible and practical
approach in its negotiations with the UN on 'exchanging food for
oil', and hope that the negotiations will achieve progress at an
early date," Qian was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf briefed Qian on the latest developments in
negotiations with the UN on the implementation of Resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf, who met with visiting UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in Beijing on Wednesday, told Qian that Iraq will
continue to adopt a flexible and practical attitude in its
negotiations with the UN, in an effort to reach an agreement as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister expressed appreciation to China for its
"fair position" in seeking a settlement of the post-Gulf war
issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China will continue to play its
"important role" as a permanent member of the UN Security Council,
and continue to support the process of relaxation in the Gulf
region's situation.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on bilateral
relations. The Chinese foreign ministry official said both sides
agreed to maintain, and further develop existing friendly
relations and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf told Xinhua after his talks with Qian that the talks
had been "very good", and his visit so far has been "very
successful."
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Qian hosted a dinner in honor of the
Iraqi foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf arrived on Tuesday for a five-day visit to China as
guest of Qian Qichen. This is Al-Sahaf's fourth China
trip.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Signs Documents for Land Lease to U.S. Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today signed documents needed for renewing land leases
of the U.S. forces in Okinawa Prefecture on behalf of Okinawa
Governor Masahide Ota.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ota rejected an order issued on Monday by the
Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court to sign these documents. He
also indicated he would take the battle to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The documents in question are those for renewing land leasing
contracts for a total of 35,000 square meters of land owned by
Okinawa residents.
</P>
<P>
Ota has sided with the landowners and has rebuffed several
attempts by central government officials, including Hashimoto, to
persuade the governor to sign the lease documents.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing land lease problem came to a head following
the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa, Japan's
southernmost main island, last September for which three
U.S. servicemen have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
In December, the then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama filed a
lawsuit against Ota, aiming to force the governor to comply with
the wishes of the central government, which is obliged to the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

<P>
URUMQI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snow has piled on the agony
for people in Xinjiang in northwestern China, recovering after an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The bleak weather has hit the Jiashi-Artux area in northwest

The quake caused no deaths among city residents in Artux, but
reduced 4,500 homes to rubble, and endangered another 4,600

<HEADLINE> Britain Opposed to Calls for New Exchange Rate Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- British officials will fight
suggestions that UK be forced to enter a new European exchange
rate mechanism (ERM) after the proposed European single currency
comes into force, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Some continental countries are stepping up their demands that
countries, including Britain, should be forced to link their
currencies to the Euro, the future European single currency
planned to be issued by January 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a bilateral meeting Tuesday focusing on the issue, French
and German officials agreed that a new ERM would be needed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries fear that without a new exchange rate target
to link currencies to the Euro, currencies outside the future
single currency would devalue.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which pulled out of the mechanism in 1992, however, is
vehemently opposed to the idea, arguing that ERM structure might
be useful for other countries, but not for UK.
</P>
<P>
Instead, British officials are calling for a strict European
inflation control system under which countries outside future
single currency would be required to adhere to a tight inflation
target, probably less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that this is enforced, their policies for meeting the
target would be monitored by other countries and the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Britain argues that the inflation target would prevent the
devaluation of the currencies outside the single currency.
</P>
<P>
It is believed, however, that the UK argument is unlikely
to satisfy most of the other European countries and a fierce
debate is expected when European finance ministers meet in
Verona, Italy, next month.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China today warned Washington
against turning the question of Taiwan into "an explosive issue"
by inviting any Taiwanese leader to visit the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This came after the Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Jesse Helms, reportedly said that he will push for a
visit by Lee Teng-hui to the United States in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted that on many occasions the US government has
indicated that it hopes that any decision to allow any leader of
Taiwan to pay a visit to the US will not adversely affect the
normal development of Sino-US relations," Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have also noted that the US government on many occasions
stressed it would properly handle the question of Taiwan in
accordance with the 'one China' principle," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "I believe the US should realize the
importance of its relations with China and that maintaining normal
development of this relationship accords with its own interests."
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that on the question of Taiwan the US side should
follow the principles enshrined in the three Sino-US joint
communiques, instead of turning the question of Taiwan into an
"explosive issue," Shen emphasized.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen OUR International
Science &AMP; Technology Development Company in south China's
Guangdong Province has recently developed a new type of scalpel
for use in brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
The OUR-XGD Cobalt-60 Rotary Gamma Scalpel uses Gamma rays to
kill tumour cells by focussing it with pin-point accuracy on the
trouble spot in the brain.
</P>
<P>
The new method requires no anesthesia, does not destroy
surrounding tissue, and has no after-effects associated with
common surgical operations.
</P>
<P>
Considered a breakthrough in radiation therapy, the Rotary
Gamma Scalpel was jointly developed by scientists from seven
research institutes.
</P>
<P>
The new scalpel means that modern medical equipment and
instruments in China are similar to the most advanced in the world.
</P>
<P>
The new scalpel has already been approved by the State
Pharmaceutical Administration and has been patented in China, the
United States, and some European countries.

BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Shouguang's center Shan

<HEADLINE> UN To Aid Peace Process In S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
appealed for a 57 Million U.S. Dollar humanitarian aid for
Sierra Leone which is torn apart by five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The appeal involves all U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organisations working in food, health, water, sanitation,
agriculture and human settlement programs in the West African
state.
</P>
<P>
The aid is a major stimulant to the West African country where
a negotiative peace process has begun after the opening of the
first round of talks between the military and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
It is also a big incentive to the military which has decided
to hand over to the newly elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
"It is a refreshing change about to begin with the recent
peace talks in Cote d'Ivoire," said Brigadier General Julius Bio,
a soldier who came to power after a palace coup on January 17 and
later vowed to hand over power to a civil government.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. fund raising document, the war has
driven 47 percent of Sierra Leone's population or 2.1 million
homeless.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million Sierra Leoneans require humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
But in some areas of the country, particularly the southern
and eastern provinces, absence of security has allowed only
sporadic deliveries of relief goods for the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Only 16 percent of Sierra Leone's 500 health centers are still
functioning.
</P>
<P>
And the number of children living on the streets in the four
main urban centers, Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni, had
increased from approximately 2,000 in 1994 to 3,000 by the end of
1995 while an additional 2,000 unaccompanied children live with
substitute families.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 75 percent of children aged six to 14, are
out of school as a result of the war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, between 1991 and 1994, the government troops had
increased from 3,000 to over 16,000.
</P>
<P>
The country's mining-based economy is also ravaged by the
prolonged civil war.
</P>
<P>
"Each U.N. agency and NGOs will develop specific operational
strategies based on their mandates and expertise," said the U.N.
document.

BONN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's former world women's

compensation from the world athletics governing body IAAF for a
doping ban in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A German civil court in Munich said on Thursday that the IAAF's
two year ban on Krabbe was illegal under the German law and
therefore the runner has the right to demand compensation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-year-old Gulb Chand
Tripathi from northern India's Uttar Pradesh has been spending the
past 15 days in New Delhi waiting to get a candidacy in the
country's coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
He is among an expectant crowd outside the closed doors of the
headquarters of the ruling Congress Party as party leaders are
thrashing out the lists of Congress candidates for the Lok Sabha
(Lower House) election.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his prospects in the election, Tripathi
ignored the question and got into a rhetorical argument about why
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao is a capable leader.
</P>
<P>
A similar siege is also taking place at the headquarters of the
country's biggest opposition party -- the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP).
</P>
<P>
More than 200 applications were filed on Wednesday alone when
nominations started for the general elections to the Lok Sabha
(Lower House) and six state assemblies in India.
</P>
<P>
A BJP spokesman said the party did not encourage people to come
to New Delhi to seek candidacy.
</P>
<P>
But many people are still coming to the capital, some from
distant parts of the country, and hoping against hope for a place
on the candidate lists.
</P>
<P>
One man even said he was willing to spend two million rupees
(57,971 US dollars) to run in the election.
</P>
<P>
Elections to 543 seats in the Lok Sabha and 914 in six state
assemblies will be held simultaneously in five phases on April 27,
May 2, 7, 23 and 30.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Disgraced Ex-Kingpin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Shin Kanemaru, kingmaker in the
Japanese political world from the late 1980s to early 1990s, died
of stroke today at his home in Yamanashi Prefecture, the local
press reported. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
Kanemaru, who was disgraced following his arrest in 1993 for
alleged income tax evasion, played a pivotal backstage role in
pushing Noboru Takeshita to power in 1987.
</P>
<P>
As the main power broker in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
he was instrumental in the making of at least two other prime
ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu in 1989 and Kiichi Miyazawa in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kanemaru resigned his Diet (parliament) seat in October 1992
after admitting receiving illegal donations of 500 million yen (5
million U.S. dollars) from a now-defunct parcel delivery company.
</P>
<P>
His involvement in the scandal and his retirement from politics
led to the breakup of LDP's largest faction, the Takeshita
faction, which was headed by Kanemaru, and to the eventual
political realignment in Japan with LDP breakaways forming
splinter parties in 1993.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian foreign minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today that Malaysia felt that the
participation of the United States was not essential to the
formation or successs of any forums that is beneficial to this
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the parliament, Abdullah said in fact Malaysia felt
that even without the U.S. participation, such forums could run
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said it was common for the U.S. to be "suspicious or
doubtful" of any regional forum that was established, like the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), if it was not invited to join the
forum.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said the U.S. would feel uneasy
everytime there was a consensus or forum which did not involve
that country.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdullah said Malaysia felt that any forum that was
regarded as beneficial to this region should be formed and in fact
could be run smoothly without U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
He cited the ASEM, which was held in Bangkok early this month
without US participation, for an example and described the ASEM as
concrete, positive and pragmatic, adding none of the participating
countries were negative about the meeting although some countries
were unhappy that they were not invited.

<HEADLINE> Tsing Ma Bridge Completes Deck Erection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Tsing Ma Bridge, the world's
longest suspension bridge carrying both road and rail traffic,
finished the erection of the last unit of its suspended deck
today.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 7.1 billion HK dollars (910 million US
dollars), Tsing Ma Bridge is a vital link in the transport network
 of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
Building of the 2,160-meter-long bridge started in May 1992 and
 is scheduled for completion in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The deck of the bridge is made from some 50,000 tons of high
grade structural steel supplied from British and Japanese works in
 pre-fabricated pieces, which were assembled into 95 huge units
generally 18 meters long, 41 meters wide and over seven meters
deep in Dongguan, China.
</P>
<P>
The completed deck carries six lanes of road traffic on its
upper level and two further reserve roadways and two rail tracks
on the lower deck.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong is subject to typhoons during summer, the bridge
has been designed to withstand extreme wind speeds. In severe
weather, traffic will be diverted from the upper deck of the
bridge to the sheltered lower deck.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Project Lau Ching Kwong said: "Work on the
bridge is now about 88 percent complete and, looking ahead, we
are confident that the Tsing Ma Bridge will be completed in May
next year, on time and on budget."

HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
decided to suspend the issuing of import licenses covering all
frozen and chilled beef from the United Kingdom with immediate
effect, according to an official release today.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said separate notices had been issued to
 stockholders informing them of the government's decisions and
advising them to label the origin of their beef.
</P>
<P>
Those who have already imported British beef into Hong Kong
have also been directed to withhold their stocks and not to
release them to wholesalers, retailers or any other persons for
sale or consumption.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "These measures have been taken to restore
consumer confidence in beef sold as well as to avoid further
market confusion in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Some two to three percent of frozen beef sold in Hong Kong
comes from the United Kingdom, the rest originates mainly from
Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
All fresh beef sold in local markets comes from cows which are
imported from China and slaughtered in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the wholesomeness of the meat, all slaughtered
animals are inspected by qualified health inspectors of the

<P>
MACAO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese cultural relics
exhibition showing 80 pieces of relics began here today.
</P>
<P>
The largest of its kind in Macao, the exhibition will last for
a month. All the cultural relics were collections of the Nanjing
Museum, one of the three largest museum of cultural relics in
China.
</P>
<P>
The relics range from articles of the new stone age to vases
of the Qing Dynasty(1644-1911), covering a period of some 5,000
years. Many of them are classified as China's "national treasure."
</P>
<P>
They include stone tools, pottery and porcelain products, bone
articles, bronze, silver and gold ware, and jade ware. They can to
a certain degree represent the long history of Chinese culture,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
Most of the relics were unearthed in east China's Jiangsu
Province, but there are also relics excavated from other parts of
China. Part of the relics were royal articles of the Ming and Qing
Dynasty(1368-1911).
</P>
<P>
Built in 1930s, the Nanjing Museum now has a total collection
of some 420,000 pieces of cultural relics. The museum has
exhibited its relics in a dozen countries and regions including
the United States, Germany, Belgium, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers have

</P>
<P>
The smuggled articles were found at Lok Ma Chau Control Point

A total of 1,931 pieces of Chinese antiques were recovered in
the first three months of this year while in 1995, 1,360 were

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with visiting Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray here this
afternoon, and they exchanged views on furthering bilateral
relations in a friendly conversation.
</P>
<P>
Extending his welcome to Jasray, Jiang mentioned the "very good
talks" yesterday between Chinese Premier Li Peng and Jasray, and
said he believed that Jasray's current visit to China will make
new contributions to furthering bilateral good-neighborly
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China is glad to see the continuous development
of bilateral relations in the past few years, as well as bilateral
exchanges and co-operation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He added that exchanges of visits between leaders of the two
sides enhanced mutual understanding, trust and friendship, and
firmly push forward a healthy and steady development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Mongolia is an important neighbor of China, Jiang
said that to safeguard and develop Sino-Mongolian good-neighborly
friendship and reciprocal co-operation, a set policy of the
Chinese Government and the common aspiration of the two peoples,
is in the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that no matter what changes take place in the
international arena, China will always abide by the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence and the treaty on
Sino-Mongolian friendship and co-operation, and make unremitting
efforts to achieve a long-term, steady and healthy development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Last year Mongolia made new progress in safeguarding
social stability, and developing its economy and foreign
relations, which China was glad to notice, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, as a neighbor of Mongolia, China sincerely
hopes for social stability, economic prosperity and people's
happiness in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Jasray said that Mongolia attaches importance to friendship and
co-operation with China, hoping that bilateral ties can be further
strengthened as both countries advance toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that his current visit to China will
promote the further development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Mongolia admires China for its achievements
in developing its economy and raising its people's living
standards, and appreciates China's aid to Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Jasray noted that both Mongolia and China are developing
countries concentrating on reforms and market economies, and
bilateral friendship is conducive to the peoples of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts, he said, he hoped that bilateral
friendly co-operation in various fields including politics,
economy and culture can be continuously strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Jasray also briefed each other on their countries'
domestic situations.
</P>
<P>

one-day summit.
</P>
<P>
A workshop of Fiat Auto Corporation was refurnished as the

shape Europe's future with a perspective into the 21st century,
but predicted that the outcome is likely to be less momentous.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 police were deployed in the streets of the Italian
motor city, some 700 kilometers north of Rome.
</P>
<P>
To welcome the arrival of the EU leaders, many of whom will

<HEADLINE> Macao Governor Announces Goal of New Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
announced today that his government will continue its current
policy of friendly cooperation with China and a peaceful
transition of Macao before 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vieira, who was newly reappointed as Governor of Macao by
Portuguese new president, announced his six-point goal during his
new term of government at a press conference here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The six points include the ensuring of the stability and
confidence in the future of Macao, maintaining the name and value
of Portugal in oriental land, consolidation of the political and
legal systems of Macao, protection of the interests of people who
will either remain in Macao or return to Portugal, strengthening
the friendly cooperation with China and contacts with other parts
of the world, especially, Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is sure that those targets will "get the firm
support of the Portuguese president and government."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the reappointment of his position shows
the political confidence of the Portuguese president, government
and the Portuguese Assembly (Congress) in him, and he had
discussed Macao affairs with the president, premier and head of
the assembly.
</P>
<P>
"...There is an effective and institutional common
understanding between the President and the government that the
policy to Macao will be a national one," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Macao accounts for a leading part in
Portuguese foreign policy, and that "we will achieve common ground
and get the full support of all (portuguese) government
departments and institutions."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the governor said that the position of some
deputy secretaries of his government will be altered. At least
three of them, involving transportation and industry, justice, and
security, will be leaving soon, and new deputy secretaries will be

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Human Rights Report- 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four. Human rights in name, hegemonism in reality
</P>
<P>
No country in the world today can claim to have a perfect human
rights situation. To scientifically evaluate the human rights
conditions of a country, one should focus on the comprehensive
situation of the country and its historical development. The
report, however, ignores the overall human rights situation in
China and its trend of favorable development.
</P>
<P>
Objectively speaking, 1995 was a year in which China continued
to make all-round progress in the human rights field. The
country's national economy continued to grow rapidly, while the
people's material and cultural living standards were further
improved. Statistics show that the gross domestic product (GDP) of
China in 1995 reached 5,773.3 billion yuan, an increase of 10.2
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The annual average living expense per urban resident in 1995
increased by 4.9 percent compared with that of 1994, while the
annual average net income per rural resident increased by 5.3
percent over that of 1994. A total of 78.4 percent of primary
school graduates continued their schooling in middle schools in
1995, 4.6 percentage points higher than in 1994, and 98.5 percent
of all children of school age were at school last year, also up
from the previous year. Besides, five million more people shook
off poverty in 1995 and 4.76 million people became literate. The
rates of poverty-stricken and illiterate people in China dropped
to 5.4 percent and 12.01 percent in 1995 from 5.8 percent and 17
percent in 1994, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has made great efforts to strengthen socialist
democracy and its legal system. Last year China revised the law on
the election of deputies to the National People's Congress and
local People's Congresses and the law on the organization of
local People's Congresses and governments, and also promulgated
and implemented the police, procurators, judges and education laws.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress,
which closed recently, passed the law on administrative punishment
and revised the criminal procedures law. All these measures have
improved the legal guarantees for human rights and strengthened
protection of human rights in various links of democracy and the
legal system.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's human rights situation is marked by
comprehensive improvement, while the country enjoys political
stability, sound economic growth and social progress, and unity of
all ethnic groups, and the people are living and working in peace
and contentment with living standards constantly being improved.
The "human rights report" made by the US government did not
evaluate these basic facts in an objective way, but made
gratuitous charges against and viciously attacked China based on
several isolated cases, rumors and hearsay evidence.
</P>
<P>
This fully indicates that what the US government really cares
about is not human rights of the Chinese people but using "human
rights" as an excuse to vilify China's international image,
undermine China's stability and contain its development so as to
change China's development course and its social system. In one
word, the US government attempts to make use of the human rights
issue to interfere in China's internal affairs and practise its
hegemony and power politics.
</P>
<P>
Country-to-country and region-to-region cooperation based on
equality for common development has become the irresistible trend
of post-Cold War period. In the field of human rights, all
countries should, following this historical trend and based on the
principle of equality and mutual respect, enhance international
cooperation and dialog by removing misunderstanding and discarding
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The US government however goes against the historical trend and
stubbornly clings to its Cold War thinking. It makes public year
after year its so-called "Human Rights Country Reports" to launch
gratuitous charges against other countries and wantonly interfere
in the internal affairs of other countries. This cannot but arouse
refutation and resistance by many countries. Any sovereign state
in the world has the right to demand that the US government stop
such arbitrary interference. Moreover, the US government should
issue a report on its own human rights situation each year, if it
really cares about the issue.

<P>
Three. Interference of Procrustean-style
</P>
<P>
Passing US standards off as the international norms and
ignoring China's national conditions, the report is a procrustean
bed that distorts the human rights situation in China.
</P>
<P>
The report criticizes China's adoption of the death penalty,
saying it violates human rights. Such criticism is utterly
groundless.
</P>
<P>
Most countries and regions have kept the death penalty in their
legal systems in the light of their own national conditions. Major
international human rights instruments also allow the
implementation of the death penalty for "the most serious
crimes". China also has kept the death sentence, however it
stipulates specially cautious approval procedures on the use of
the death penalty. According to China's Criminal Law, the death
penalty is reserved for those who commit the most heinous crimes
and the Criminal Law also stipulates that it may not be carried
out on those who were under the age of 18 when they committed the
crimes or on women who were pregnant when they were tried. As for
economic crimes, only those criminals who commit the most heinous
crimes or steal huge amounts of money are executed. The report
criticized China's system of death sentence by citing an example
of a criminal who was executed for shooting to death innocent
people. Could the US death penalty system forgive such a criminal
and his like?
</P>
<P>
The report regards the regulation that (Chinese) Communist
Party members must not believe in any religion as evidence proving
China has no religious freedom, saying that "this places a serious
limitation on religious believers". Such a statement fully
reflects the arrogance and ignorance of the author of the
report.
</P>
<P>
Chinese laws protect the freedom of religious belief, and there
are more than 100 million religious believers in the
country. Chinese Communist Party members believe in the scientific
theory of Marxism. They are atheists. People who want to become
religious believers may refuse to join or withdraw from Communist
Party organizations, and believe in any kind of religion
freely. How can this be regarded as restriction on the freedom of
religious belief? Could only forcing atheistic Communist Party
members to believe in religion be called freedom of belief? Could
only forcing the Chinese Communist Party to give up atheism and
pursue theism instead be called respect for human rights? It is
utterly unreasonable for the report to ask the Chinese Communist
Party to act in accordance with the organizing models of US
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The report time and again criticizes the Chinese Government's
policies to help the people in Tibet in their economic
development, saying the policies have "disrupted traditional
living patterns" of the Tibetans and non-Tibetan technical
personnel aiding Tibet have been "diluting Tibetan demographic
dominance." This is a fabrication with ulterior motives. The
Chinese government has all along implemented policies both to
develop the Tibetan economy and protect the fine traditions of
Tibetan culture. A small number of non-Tibetan technical personnel
go to Tibet in the light of the needs of certain construction
projects, and help the local people develop their economy. This
has not resulted in any major change in the local population
formation.
</P>
<P>
According to 1990 statistics, the total population in Tibet
stood at 2.196 million, 2.096 million being Tibetans, who account
for 95.5 percent of the total, with less than five percent being
people of other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The report's criticism has shown that the US government
actually holds up its policies towards the Native Americans as
models, hoping that the Chinese government will isolate the
ethnic-minority groups just as the US government has done, and
keep ethnic-minority people apart from the modernization process
and leave them in a state of backwardness and barbarism. Actually,
the US government has no qualifications to criticize China on the
issue of ethnic-minority groups. The US Government implements
racial segregation policies towards Native Americans and encloses
them in reservations, with the result that they live in chronic
poverty and backwardness. That is a real infringement of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
China is an independent sovereign state, which has its own
unique cultural traditions and national characteristics. China
does not need to and cannot change itself according to US
standards and it will not allow the United States to issue orders
to it.

from the Royal Malaysian Navy.

The report made a fuss about the case of Wu Hongda (Harry Wu),
saying that "the case of US citizen Harry Wu exemplified problems
with the lack of procedural and substantive due process of law and
also the problem of forced confessions" and "The authorities
permitted Wu to choose (his attorneys) only from a list of
government-approved names."
</P>

The fact is that Wu had been convicted of theft and rape and
punished in accordance with the law before he first left China.
He went to the United States in 1985 and later obtained American

From 1991 Wu, using the aliases of "Peter Hwu" and "Harry Wu",

illegally sneaked into China again. The Wuhan City Intermediate
People's Court tried Wu through legal procedures, and Wu's
attorneys were chosen by himself in accordance with the relevant
regulations about attorneys' qualification in Chinese law and from
a list of law offices provided by the American Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed satisfaction with his defense in court and wrote a
letter of gratitude. An official with the US Embassy in China, who
was present in the court when Wu was tried, said that he had not
expected that the attorneys would made such a positive defense for
Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu confessed everying in a letter written of his own free
will. The court sentenced Wu to 15 years of imprisonment in
accordance with law and informed him that he could appeal to a
higher court if he did not plead guilty. But Wu pleaded guilty and
gave up the right of appealing.
</P>
<P>
The censure on China's human rights situation made by the
report is self-contradictory. For example, on the one hand, the
report said that "incomes in many ethnic minority areas remain
well below the national average" while on the other hand it said
that the development programs launched by the Chinese government
in ethnic-minority areas "have also disrupted traditional living
patterns of minority groups".
</P>
<P>
It is universally acknowledged that the economic backwardness
in China's minority areas was caused by historical and geographic
reasons. The Chinese government has been taking measures to
promote the economy in those areas while respecting the
traditional living patterns of the minority groups.
</P>
<P>
It is only natural for the ethnic minorities to change some of
their habits along with economic progress, which represents social
progress. According to the report's logic, is it true that China
could only be considered as protecting human rights if it kept the
minority groups in traditional living patterns "well below the
national average"?
</P>
<P>
The report falsely claimed that Chinese citizens do not enjoy
freedom of movement, while it said that "the 'floating population'
of economic migrants leaving their home areas to seek work
elsewhere in China is estimated to be over 100 million." Without
freedom of movement, how could the "floating population" reach 100
million a year?
</P>
<P>
The report also said that "in recent years, freer movement of
people throughout China, government-sponsored development, and the
prospect of economic opportunity in Tibet have led to a
substantial increase in the non-Tibetan population in Lhasa and
other urban areas." This seems to admit that the Chinese citizens
have the freedom of movement, but that this freedom has brought
about negative results. Such self-contradiction shows that the
writers of the report lack the basic knowledge of logic.

<P>
Two. Distorted facts and Lots of Flaws
</P>
<P>
The report, out of an erroneous political stand, deliberately
misrepresented and depreciated China's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
It said, referring to the issue of employment of China's
released prisoners, that Chinese authorities "have denied some
former inmates permission ... to return to their homes," and
"those inmates sentenced to more than 5 years in reeducation
through labor camps also may lose their legal right to return
home."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the Prison Law of the People's Republic of
China stipulates that local people's governments should help
released prisoners to arrange their lives, which includes
employment. Over the years local governments have arranged jobs
for large numbers of released prisoners, including not only those
who had been imprisoned for over five years, but also those who
had served ten-year or even 20-year sentences, at the places where
their families are located. Some of them have come to be leading
workers or been appraised as advanced workers.
</P>
<P>
The report used Ren Wanding's case to accuse China of
maltreatment of prisoners, saying that Ren "reportedly had
difficulties in obtaining timely and adequate medical treatment",
and he has "reportedly" "been severely beaten by other inmates".
</P>
<P>
The fact is that since 1991 Ren, who was then sentenced to
seven years in prison, has been given humanitarian treatment,
including medical care. He undergoes regular physical examinations
and is properly treated when he gets ill. A recent check-up showed
that Ren's physical condition is normal, and that Ren has been
severely beaten by other inmates as cited in the report is purely
fictitious.
</P>
<P>
Just as in the human rights reports issued by the US State
Department in previous years, the report this year also quoted a
large number of baseless materials that are "reported", "believed"
or "not verified" to be so and so. It even openly quoted some
guesses which "could not be verified". Since the materials are not
verified or do not exist or are simply "said" to be so, why are
they quoted in a government report that is published for the
world? Isn't it extremely unserious and irresponsible to criticize
other countries' human rights situations by using such baseless
materials?
</P>
<P>
The report attacks China's alleged "one party autocracy"
without even getting to know some basic historical facts. The
report said that China's "Constitution was amended in 1993 to
ratify the existence of small 'democratic' parties".
</P>
<P>
The fact is, even before the founding of the People's Republic
in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party had drafted with
non-Communist parties the Common Program of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, which acted as a provisional
Constitution and in which the legal status of all democratic
parties in the People's Republic soon to be founded was clearly
stated. The first Constitution of the People's Republic of China,
which was passed in 1954, also stipulated that the broad people's
democratic unified front, formed by all democratic classes,
democratic parties and people's organizations under the leadship
of the Chinese Communist Party, will continue to play its
role. Over the past decades China has practised multi-party
cooperation led by the Communist Party. The eight non-Communist
parties have acted as political parties actively participating in
government and political affairs in China. They have been playing
important roles in China's political arena.

<P>
The report accuses the Chinese government of violating the
freedom of religion by banning the Henan-based Christian
evangelical sect known as the "Shouters" and reportedly detaining
leaders of the "Anointed One" sect. This accusation confounds
right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
The "Shouters", which are regarded by orthodox Christians as
heretical, engaged publicly in illegal and criminal activities
against the government and society under the cover of religious
activities.
</P>
<P>
They threatened to "organize the church and oppose the
government to the end", instigated their believers to harass
government institutions and attack government officials, and
committed such illegal and criminal activities as raping women and
swindling people out of their money.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yangming, head of the "Anointed One" sect, was found to be a
criminal guilty of the most heinous crimes. In the name of
religion he has raped and sexually harassed more than 100 women,
and controlled by force more than 20 young women believers in the
sect for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
These sects are by no means regular religious organizations,
but similar to the "doomsday cults" which once existed in the
United States, Japan and other countries. No responsible
government in the world would sit idly and remain indifferent to
such serious anti-social criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The United States has launched crackdowns on "doomsday cults".
</P>
<P>
Disregarding "the internationally-accepted norms", the report
included anything that is conducive to overthrowing the legitimate
Chinese government and China's socialist system as "evidence" of
China's "violation of human rights" even if they are crackdowns on
internationally-recognized criminal activities. As a Chinese
saying goes "if you are out to condemn somebody, you can always
trump up a charge".
</P>
<P>
US political bias and anti-China and anti-Communism stances are
used in the report, which confounds right and wrong, as standards
for commenting the human rights situation in China.
</P>
<P>
So long as China is still a socialist country with the
Communist party in power and a country which has not introduced
the American-style political system, the report will turn a blind
eye and a deaf ear to whatever improvements China has made in its
economic development, democratic politics and human rights
situation. As people say "bias is more extreme than ignorance."
</P>
<P>
With its accusations against China covering dozens of pages,
the report, however, cares about whether or not a handful of
criminals have the "right" to overthrow the legitimate Chinese
government and the leadership of the Communist Party, and to
change China's existing political system.
</P>
<P>
When the report actually mentioned some "improvements" in the
human rights situation in China, it would attach caveats, such as
"The National People's Congress does not in practice, however,
have the power to determine policy or remove government or party
leaders"; village elections "have no ability peacefully to
change ... the form of government", "do not ... endanger
the 'leading role' of the Communist Party", etc.
</P>
<P>
These caveats lay bare the hidden agenda of the report -- the
"human right" the report is concerned about is the "right" to
change China's form of government, and to overthrow the leading
role of the Communist Party of China. That is the crux of the
matter.

<P>
The report accused China of infringing upon citizens' freedoms
by prohibiting activities that oppose China's political system.
</P>
<P>
It said the Chinese government infringes upon freedom of speech
and the press by requiring reporters to "protect 'state
secrets'". The government's requirements of official registration
and approval of organizations "deter the formation of unauthorized
political or labor organizations".
</P>
<P>
The report also blamed China for "The Constitution provides
that ... activities may not infringe upon the 'interests of the
State.' Protests against the political system or its leaders are
prohibited."
</P>
<P>
According to the report's logic, to conform to human rights
norms, the Chinese government would have to permit its citizens to
divulge state secrets, to damage the state interests and to oppose
the current political system.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China's legislation is completely in keeping with
international practices concerning restrictions on the freedoms of
citizens.
</P>
<P>
In Articles 18-22, the "International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights" of the United Nations provides that restrictions
"which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a
democratic society in the interests of national security or public
safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or
the protection of the rights and freedoms of others" may be placed
on the exercise of rights to freedom of religion, speech, the
press, assembly and association.
</P>
<P>
No country in the world allows its citizens to enjoy freedoms
without legal limitations or restrictions. In the United States,
the legislation places strict restrictions on the exercise of
citizens' freedoms.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, there are legal restrictions on the use
of certain kinds of language, such as the prohibition of vulgar,
deceitful and libelous languages.
</P>
<P>
Article 2386 of "United States Code" has stipulated a tedious
and strict system for registration and examination of certain
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of one's freedoms to engage in activities
aimed at overthrowing or destroying the government or activities
which may endanger national security is totally prohibited in the
US.
</P>
<P>
The code stipulates that any kind of speech, publication,
assembly or association aiming at subverting the government would
be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Since US legislation prohibits American citizens taking
advantage of their freedoms to engage in anti-government
activities, or activities which may endanger national security,
how can the report criticize the Chinese government for
prohibiting activities which oppose China's political system and
requiring its citizens to "protect state secrets" and "not
infringe upon the interests of the State"?

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Human Rights Report- 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
Chinese State Council today released an article commenting on the
the "Human Rights Report for 1995" issued by the US Department of
State. Following is a translation of the full text of the article:
</P>
<P>
 Safeguarding Human Rights or Interfering in China's Internal
</P>
<P>
 Affairs?
</P>
<P>
 -- A commentary on the country report on China of the Human
Rights Report for 1995 released by the US Department of State
</P>
<P>
 by Information Office of the State Council
</P>
<P>
On March 5 this year the US Department of State released its
Human Rights Country Reports for the year 1995, which made
frivolous and indiscreet remarks on human rights situations in
more than 190 countries and regions, and, in the part on China,
vilified and blamed China in every possible way. This shows
once again the US government's hidden agenda to use human rights
issues as an excuse for waging power politics and interfering in
other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
One. A product from an erroneous stand
</P>
<P>
The report used tens of thousands of words to blame China,
through which runs an absurd logic: There will be respect for
human rights only if it is permitted to oppose the legal
government of China, and there will be conformity with human
rights norms only if it is allowed to attack on the ruling
position of the Chinese Communist Party; otherwise, human rights
abuses occur.
</P>
<P>
Such an erroneous stand and political prejudice against the
Chinese government and social system run diametrically counter to
the internationally-recognized human rights principles.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed China for "infringing upon human rights" for
punishing the crimes of endangering national security in
accordance with the law. For example, Wei Jingsheng obviously
committed the crimes of endangering national security and
conspiring to overthrow the government, of which there is
conclusive evidence and to which he made a candid confession. But
the report complained and called for redress of the legal
punishment.
</P>
<P>
It is a general rule that every country's legal system
safeguards the existence of its legal government. The Articles
2381-2391 of the "United States Code" stipulates that any
activities of treason, rebellion or insurrection, or advocating
the overthrow of government are not allowed, and severe punishment
is stipulated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Article 2383 stipulates: "Whoever incites, sets on foot,
assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the
authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid
or comfort thereto, shall be fined not more than 10,000 US dollars
or imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both; and shall be
ineligible to hold any office under the United States".
</P>
<P>
Article 2385 stipulates that severe punishment will be
inflicted upon whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets,
advises, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety
of "overthrowing or destroying the government of the United
States".
</P>
<P>
As the government and laws of the United States are regarded as
inviolable, how can the report require the Chinese government to
offer the "right of impunity" to anti-government criminals?
Ignoring internationally-recognized principles, the report listed
the punishments the Chinese government inflicted on
anti-government criminals as "human rights abuses", which exposes
the United States' intention of using "human rights" as an excuse
to oppose the legal Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> Zulus Take To The Streets In Johannesburg, S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zulu marchers
took to the streets of central Johannesburg this morning to
commemorate the 1994 Shell House massacre.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 Zulu marchers
trooped down the Johannesburg's central business districts,
chanting and waving a variety of traditional weapons including
spears and knobkerries which are banned by the government.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi last week
announced a ban on carrying dangerous weapons in public,
including spears and pangas.
</P>
<P>
Businesses on the march route closed and security around the
African National Congress (ANC) Shell House headquarters was
beefed up.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, 1994, nine Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters
were shot dead by ANC security guards outside the Shell House.
</P>
<P>
After the start of the march, Gauteng's Provincial Police
Commissioner Sharma Maharaj's instruction to disarm Zulus
carrying dangerous weapons was apparently ignored by the police
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, police seized 13 assagais and an axe from the Zulu
marchers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IFP spokesman Humphrey Ndlovu said Zulu marchers
were prepared to go to jail for carrying traditional weapons.
</P>
<P>
About 20 Zulus scuffled with police who tried to arrest a man
armed with a spear at the Library Garden, the marchers's final
destination.
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries were reported so far.

<HEADLINE> Relaxation of Tensions Across Straits Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- It is crucial for the Taiwan
authorities to truly return to the "one China" principle, in order
to relax the tensions between the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits, said experts specializing in the study of the Taiwan
question here today.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark at a forum sponsored by the Hong
Kong-based newspaper "Wen Wei Po". Experts and
officials from some government departments concerned attended the
forum.
</P>
<P>
The participants held that with the ending of the activity of
the change of the method for the formation of the leadership in
Taiwan, it has become the demand of the people in the various
sectors of Taiwan to relax, improve and develop the relations
across the straits, as well as to protect the people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Yu Keli, an official from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said it is true that some leaders of the Taiwan
authorities have made some remarks about relaxation, due to their
political needs and social pressures.
</P>
<P>
However, whether the tensions across the straits can be relaxed
or not will hinge on whether the Taiwan authorities truly give up
their activities of creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", to stop anti-communist propaganda, to accelerate the
realization of the direct exchanges of mail service, trade, air
and shipping services between the two sides, while not
internationalize the Taiwan issue and not relying on foreign
forces to interfere in China's internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zaixi, an expert from the Institute for International
Strategic Studies, said in order to restore and develop the
relations across the straits, it is essential for the new leaders
of Taiwan to return to the "one China" principle, and hold talks
to end the state of hostility, based on the eight propositions put
forward by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
On the direction of the relations across the straits, Li
Jiaquan, an expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
said it is possible that the Taiwan authorities will cling to
their splittist policy on the one hand, while taking some actions
for relaxation to deal with public opinion on the other.
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances the relations between the two sides will
probably relax, he noted, adding that as the deep-rooted cause has
not been extirpated, new crises and confrontations may emerge at
any time in the future.
</P>
<P>
Song Baoxian, vice-director of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations, also delivered a speech on
the tendency of the US policy toward Taiwan and the relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Croatian Foreign
Minister Mate Granic said here today that his country and Malaysia
would sign several agreements next months to strengthen bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Mate Granic, who ended his three-day visit to Malaysia today,

cooperation as well as on cultural cooperation would be also
signed during the visit if negotiations were completed by then.
</P>
<P>
He told the press here that Croatia was interested in importing
Malaysian national car Proton in the near future and assembly them
at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged Malaysians to use Croatia as a springboard
for the export of Malaysian goods to central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mate Granic hoped that Croatia could participate in
Malaysia's development of coastal highways and hydro-electric
projects.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he also thanked Malaysia for its
participation in the Implementation Force, and said his country
would continue to commit to the implementation of the Dayton Peace
accord.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has called on African authors and publishers to
protect their own cultures and values.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international seminar on the future of Africa's
publishing on Wednesday, Mkapa stressed the need to develop an
indigenous publishing capacity in Africa, saying African values
were endangered by the invasion of foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said publishing in mother tongues was inhibitive due to
low levels of literacy, the small size of the tribes and lack of
income by the target groups.
</P>
<P>
"Encouraging the use of mother tongues in publishing has its
cultural values, but this also has to be weighed against the
glorification of one tribe at the expense of another," Mkapa
noted.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa called for serious authorship in Kiswahili which he said
is lacking.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry Commission Holds GSS Responsible For Rabin's Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Commission of
Inquiry in the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin
concluded today that the General Security Service (GSS) ignored
intelligence information indicating a Jewish militant might try to
kill the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A final report, which was published after nearly five months of
investigations by the commission, said that for the past two years
there had been intelligence information regarding increasing
threats against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the head of the GSS, Karmi Gillon, had no formal
discussion with intelligence officials on the threats.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which was formed by the government on November
8 last year, four days after Rabin's murder, also said that the
planning of security on November 4 peace rally in Tel Aviv where
Rabin was shot was severely lacking and that police and GSS agents
did nothing to correct the situation once the rally was in
progress.
</P>
<P>
The report devoted a section to talks of possible conspiracy in
the security echelon, but concluded that there was none.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended punitive measures against three top
GSS officials, but said that two others who had already resigned,
including Karmi Gillon, should not be punished further.
</P>
<P>
The report is more than 350 pages long and includes about
100 pages of classified material which have not been released
to the public.

<HEADLINE> More Expatriate Police Officers to Stay in HK After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- More expatriate police officers
want to serve in Hong Kong in the post-1997 force, the "Eastern
Express" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest manpower survey figures, Angus
Stevenson-Hamilton, assistant commissioner of Hong Kong police,
said that the trend was the same among expatriates employed both
on contract and under Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service
(HMOCS).
</P>
<P>
Stevenson-Hamilton, who is responsible for police personnel
work, said that 118 HMOCS officers had opted to stay in the force
and 104 were leaving.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that most of the 60 officers who had
not decided will stay.
</P>
<P>
Of More than 300 officers on a separate contract arrangement,
98 percent have so far indicated they are staying or are seeking a
renewal of their contracts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said officers were also realizing that Hong Kong and
Southeast Asia offered better job opportunities, pay and living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said, "People who have gone back to the United Kingdom have
seen things getting worse in terms of job opportunities, and we
have had Special Branch officers who went last year, being
paid-off and not being successful at getting jobs."
</P>
<P>
"If you compare salaries, we must be one of the best paid civil
services in the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Power Industry Forging Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase its power
generating capacity up to 300 million kilowatts by the end of this
century, and enable at least 95 percent of rural households to use
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xizheng, vice-minister of Power Industry, said here today
that China's power output had reached 1,000 billion kwh in the
Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95).
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister attributed the good result to deepening the
reforms, using more foreign capital, and employing scientific
management.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the power industry had spent 276 billion yuan on
constructing capital projects over the past five years; and put
into operation generating units with a combined capacity of 75
million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the country had a power generating
capacity totalling 214 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Zhao noted that the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants
in east and south China, respectively, had gone into commercial
operation in the 1991-1995 period, and construction of the Three
Gorges Project is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the nationwide power grid covers all cities and
most of rural areas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994 the power industry had built 64 larger
projects, using a total contractual overseas investment of 14.5
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhao acknowledged that power shortage is still a key obstacle
that hinders China's economic development. At present, China still
has 80 million people who have no access to power.

NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 12 million people in India
are blind, according to a national survey.
</P>
<P>
The majority suffer from cataract while the rest have
refractive errors.
</P>
<P>
Two major surveys have been conducted on the prevalence of

showed 1.38 percent prevalence rate for blind. Another survey by
the national program for control of blindness and the World Health
Organization in 1988-89 showed that the prevalence rate had
increased to 1.49 percent.
</P>

To check blindness, the union Health Ministry launched a
national blindness control program in 1976 to reduce cataract
problem. In addition, 81 medical colleges have been upgraded under
this program and 39 medical colleges have been designated as
training centers for paramedical ophthalmic assistants.

<HEADLINE> "Sino-Sri Lankan Trade Needs Boost" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
said here today that China will continue to pursue friendly ties
with Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
And there is great potential for the development of two-way
trade since China's technology, products and equipment are
suitable for Sri Lanka, said Wu Yi, Chinese minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
She said this at the second meeting of the Sino-Sri Lankan
joint committee on trade and economic co-operation, which was
co-hosted by Wu and Kingsley Wickramaratna, minister of Trade,
Commerce and Food of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wickramaratna gave a briefing on his
country's current political and economic situations, and a plan to
establish a free trade region in South Asia before year 2005 by
the seven countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Sri Lanka should set up joint ventures
in his country to bring into full play China's technology and
equipment and Sri Lanka's natural resources in order to get a big
market share in the future free trade region.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China would encourage its businesses to invest in
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two countries have established joint ventures in
Sri Lanka with total investment valued at 5.48 million US dollars,
54 percent of which has come from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the total Sino-Sri Lankan trade volume surpassed a
record 240 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China mainly exports to Sri Lanka textiles, garments, cement,
paper, TV sets, small tools and cigarettes. It imports from that
country natural rubber and gems.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, from 1982 to 1995 the two countries signed 135 labor
and project contracts, which were valued at 160 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Signs Constitution Amendment  Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today assented to the constitution amendment bill providing
for the appointment of a 10-member caretaker government to be
headed by a chief adviser.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was passed by parliament on Tuesday morning,
stipulates that all future parliamentary elections will be held
under a caretaker government following dissolution of parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, a retired chief justice, or a retired
judge of the appellate division of the Supreme Court, or a
competent citizen would head the caretaker government. In case the
persons concerned are not available or unwilling to head the
interim government, the president would take over the post.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the opposition's indefinite
non-cooperation campaign starting from March 9, Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia Wednesday requested the president to give assent to
the caretaker government bill as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties have been demanding a fresh
parliamentary election under a caretaker government since early
1994.
</P>
<P>
They boycotted the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP)-held February 15 elections and refused to accept the
newly-elected parliament and government based on that election.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the president's move paved way for the
resignation of the BNP government and for holding a fresh election
under a caretaker government by May.

<HEADLINE> Port Development to Continue in Hong Kong: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to face
substantial growth in port throughput despite the rapid
development of ports in Chinese mainland, Tony Clark, secretary of
Hong Kong's Port Development Board, said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at "the China Intermodalism Conference '96" held in
Singapore today, Clark said that while Hong Kong would certainly
lose some transshipment business to mainland ports, it would
continue to consolidate its position as the hub port for the
region of South China.
</P>
<P>
He said that one big advantage Hong Kong has is its fast
turnaround of vessels which provides quick and guaranteed pick-up
and delivery.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage is Hong Kong's large and well established
shipping support operations. Combined with Hong Kong's strong
banking and financial institutions and familiarity with
international trade practices, it ensures payment on time and
fast, efficient documentation processing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that shippers are also attracted to Hong Kong because
of its straight forward and transparent customs formalities,
adding that as a port, Hong Kong is somewhat more user friendly
than the ports of the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the developing ports in China, he said that of the
East China ports, Shanghai was in the best geographical position
and it has enormous potential for future development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total container throughput is expected to grow
to 18 million TEUs in 1998 (over 12.5 million TEUs in 1995), 23
million in 2001, 31 million in 2006 and nearly 40 million in 2016.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next decade the ports in Southern China
will develop simultaneously with Hong Kong to provide the
facilities which are necessary to support the fastest growing
economy in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China will open its first global service for
mobile communications network in July and is expected to extend it
to the whole region by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
GSM service will be started in Urumqi, the capital of the region,
with 20,000 customers, with the number increasing to as many as
200,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The network will use technology and equipment from Northern
Telecom, a Canadian telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
Guan Yingbo, chief engineer for the Urumqi Telecommunications
Bureau, said that the climate and terrain of this landlocked
region place heavy demands on telecommunications equipment. The
GSM project will use a digital satellite map for advanced coverage
planning this time, to improve the accuracy of radio frequency
coverage.
</P>
<P>
The network will also incorporate Northern Telecom's basic
station technology and short transmission routes, in order to
minimize the transmission costs.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials say that the GSM service in Xinjiang means
rapid GSM development in China's inland provinces in the next few
years, and will have a "remarkable influence" on the area's
fledgling mobile telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
GSM service is available in more than 20 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, and more networks will be
launched or expanded during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), according to ministry officials.

<HEADLINE> Kim's Ex-Secretary Charged With Accepting Huge Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office (SDPO) today charged Chang Hak-ro, the former secretary for
South Korean President Kim Young-sam, with receiving about 4.8
million U.S. dollars in bribes from some 150 businessmen and
public officials.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO said that Chang began receiving money from small
business owners and public officials in 1990 when three ruling and
opposition parties merged into a single one.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, leaders of the
opposition parties, merged their parties with the then ruling
Democratic Justice Party of Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
"Chang has hidden most of the money he received from
businessmen and public officials since February 1990 in real
estate and financial assets under the names of his girl friend and
her brothers," a SDPO official said.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO plans to announce the results of its investigation
into the case tomorrow and will indict Chang on April 1 on charges
of accepting bribes in exchange for his influence as a close aide
of President Kim.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prosecution said that it plans to confiscate the
entire fortune illicitly acquired by Chang.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to Kim in 1977 and was his "steward"
for nearly 20 years. When Kim became president in February 1993,
Chang was named a presidential secretary in charge of Kim's
personal matters.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Delays Pullout from Hebron (Part two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli officials repeatedly stressed that the four-week long
closure will continue until all leaders of the terrorist groups
are caught, warning that the implementation of the Oslo accords
would be affected unless the PNA gets rid of the Palestinian
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israel now is using Hebron as a lever to exert more
pressure on the PNA to crack down on Islamic militants, and
Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said that Israel will not
leave Hebron until the Palestinians rein in terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has said that
the withdrawal is contingent upon the Palestinians' change of the
clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Palestinian National
Council is supposed to convene by May 7 to amend the Palestinian
Covenant, two months after the 88-member Palestinian Council
elected in January met for its first session on March 7.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the Palestinians must amend
the covenant before the Israeli general elections, set for May
29, to help their peace partner Peres to win the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the election campaigns have started, Peres has
sidelined his usual image and appeared to have tended to take up
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's role of "Mr. Security,"
referring to a fact that his stand towards the Palestinians is
turning to be hard.
</P>
<P>
Since another attack in Israel could give an edge to the
opposition party, it is highly questionable whether Peres will
order the withdrawal from Hebron before the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres may want to set facts on the ground to contend
with post-election scenarios, the Palestinians argued that having
PNA President Yasser Arafat's Palestinian police on the ground in
Hebron would give him a lever in controlling Islamic militants
there.
</P>
<P>
As far as the Palestinians are concerned, they see the failure
to redeploy Israeli troops in Hebron as a broken promise which
will only cause a further erosion of the Palestinian support for
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Promises to Implement Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto said here today that her government will carry out
the order of the supreme court even though it was "an order by the
judiciary against the judiciary".
</P>
<P>
Talking to the National Assembly on a short order announced by
the Supreme Court on the appointment of judges, the prime minister
said, "we will do what the supreme court decides because that is
the proper body to adjudicate such matters."
</P>
<P>
The supreme court of Pakistan last Wednesday issued a short
order to be followed by a detailed judgment next week on the
appointment of chief justices of high courts, additional and ad
hoc judges in the superior judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The court declared the appointment of judges to the superior
courts made without the consultation of the chief justice of
Pakistan as invalid and violative of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 judges from four provinces will be affected by the
order.
</P>
<P>
Benazir said the result of this order could "lead to a large
vacuum in the judicial structure of Pakistan".
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence scores of judges in the superior judiciary
could be affected," she added.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out, "Judges may face the unfortunate risk of being
dragged into litigation."
</P>
<P>
She argued "the appointment power lies with the president" and
"we have consulted the governor and chief justices in writing
about appointment of judges."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister criticized those who tried to politicize the
issue and denied there was any constitutional or political crisis
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In response to her speech, opposition leader Nawaz Sharif said
the prime minister tried to interpret the order from the supreme
court.
</P>
<P>
He also called for dialogue between the government and the
opposition to solve political and other national issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Delays Pullout from Hebron (By Wang Yukui) (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's withdrawal from
Hebron, scheduled to take place today, is to be postponed, as
Israel has conditioned the pullout upon a Palestinian crack-down
on Islamic military groups.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense sources said that the Israeli troops are
likely to remain in the West Bank town until at least
after the Jewish holiday of Pessah in mid-April, despite that
it is a violation of the Oslo accords with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army was supposed to have
concluded the redeployment of its troops in Hebron by midnight
tonight, when it was originally scheduled to pull back to defined
areas in the town, giving way to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) control over most parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last major West Bank town to be handed over to
the PNA, after the Israeli army had smoothly completed its
withdrawal from the West Bank towns of Jenin, Tulkarm, Nablus,
Kalkalya, Ramallah and Bethlehm by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 Jewish settlers live in the center of Hebron among
dozens of thousands of Palestinian residents, and the Israeli army
would remain in some areas of the city after its redeployment so
as to protect the settlers.
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the withdrawal, the Israeli army has removed much
of its equipment from Hebron, and bypass roads are basically
completed.
</P>
<P>
Commanders of the Israeli army and other defense officials say
that the redeployment could probably take place in about six hours.
</P>
<P>
However, a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel earlier
this month, which killed at least 60 people and wounded 150
others, had changed the whole situation.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, and coincidentally, it turned out
that two of the suicide bombers came from the Hebron area.
</P>
<P>
Following the suicide attacks, Israel has imposed a total
closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, barring
thousands of Palestinian workers from entering Israel, to
prevent further attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had demolished the homes of the suicide
bombers, and imposed a curfew on the village of Fawar, where the
suicide bombers came from.
</P>
<P>
Israel also asked the PNA to crack down on the Islamic
military groups operating inside the Palestinian autonomous
areas, and demanded for the capture of leaders of the extremist
organizations.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Germany Aims France for EU Reforms  (By Xia Zhimian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany is trying to ally with
France to push forward reforms within the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has said that the two
European giants will join hands again and serve as "the motor of
integration" to empower the process of European integration.
</P>
<P>
Days before a regional summit that is deemed crucial, Kinkel
suggested on Tuesday that joint efforts by Germany and France are
the key to the European integration.
</P>
<P>
Back in the early 1950's, Germany and France were the very
first partners initiating a regional alliance that was later
turned into the European Community (EC) and subsequently the EU.
</P>
<P>
Now, the 15-member EU is on the course of closer integration
set forth by the Maastricht Treaty effective from November 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, top officials from EU nations will meet in Turin,
Italy, to review for a day EU's work and institutions, and chart
its way toward future.
</P>
<P>
In preparing the gathering, known as inter-governmental
conference (IGC), Germany is disappointed with Britain, another
major power in the region, for its stance, and its opposition to
what Germany holds, on some major issues related to the
integration process.
</P>
<P>
It is under these circumstances that Germany and France want to
move closer to each other once more.
</P>
<P>
However, despite their common ground in major areas,
differences remain on some specific issues.
</P>
<P>
For instance, France agrees in principle on Germany's point
that, as the EU expands, decisions should be based on majority
vote rather than consensus. Meanwhile, it argues that in cases
that "national interests" are involved, member nations should have
the right to veto.
</P>
<P>
In another area, both advocate that EU members need to adopt
unified external and security policies. But while France calls
for appointing a senior representative to carry out the policies,
Germany cites the existence of an EU commissioner in charge of
external affairs in the current institution as a reason to refute
the idea.
</P>
<P>
Further more, Germany stresses that more powers should be
authorized to the EU. Germany and 12 other nations called for the
formal presence of European Parliament's representatives at the
upcoming IGC, as one of the measures to empower the institutions
now existing under the EU framework. The initiative was aborted
later, because of the objection by Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that in addition to these strifes on the
surface, Germany and France have their different philosophies deep
down in pursuing the European integration. While the German
government is most federalist, the French government under
President Jacques Chirac is more Gaullist, or nationalist, than
its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Whether "the motor for integration" envisioned by Germany could
be restarted, analysts here say, is up to developments in the
coming year in Germany's endeavor to resolve differences with
France.

<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, Italy, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government has
finished all the preparations for the opening of the European
Union (EU) special summit scheduled to be held here on Friday,
Italian prime minister's spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the spokesman said that Italy has spent
some 47 billion lira (about 30 million U.S. dollars) for the
preparation of the one-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Italy has refurbished a workshop of Fiat Auto Cooperation as
the venue of the gathering where 15 heads of government of the EU
will ceremonially launch negotiations on the future shape of the
union.
</P>
<P>
Local media billed the summit as a historic opportunity to
shape Europe's future for the 21st century, and also predicted
that the outcome is likely to be less momentous.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has called 5,000 police into the streets
of the Italian motor city, some 700 kilometers north of Rome.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the summit will set agendas for the
inter-governmental conference, likely to last at least 15 months,
and review the operations of the 1991 Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
To welcome the arrival of the 15 heads of government, among
whom many will stay here for only just a few hours, The local
government of Turin has decorated the streets, railway station and
airport with flowers and national flags of the 15 EU members.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police confiscated 3
tons and 456 kilograms of heroin and 17 tons and 356 kilograms of
hashish in Turkey in 1995, accounting for 22 percent of the drugs
seized in the world and and 47 percent in Europe.

Turkish police also seized 939 kilograms of base morphine, 121
kilograms of opium, 75 kilograms of cocaine, 53 tons and 287
kilograms of anhydride acid.
</P>
<P>
The police carried out 2,033 operations in the fight against
drug trafficking in Turkey last year and detained 238 foreign
suspected smugglers including 42 Iranians.

<P>
The agency added that the number of the smuggled heroin
in 1995 increased 59 percent over that of 1994.
</P>
<P>

the government to take effective and immediate measures against
the drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to combat drug trafficking both for the
growing of our young people in a healthy way and for the stopping
of the financial sources for the terrorist organizations," said
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has become a transit point for about half of the
drugs produced in the "Golden Triangle" bordering Thailand,
Myanmar and Laos and the "Golden Crescent" bordering Pakistan,
Iran and Afghanistan.

products and to export the products to other countries in Asia and
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Paris and New York, the multinational
Schlumberger is a world leader in output and sales of gas, water,
and electricity meters.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has called on the world developed and developing countries to
strengthen cooperation to make more resources available for human
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Shelter Afrique
headquarters building here on Wednesday, the President said that
one in 10 people in the developing countries is homeless, and
warned the increasing plight of the homeless in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many houses for Africans are not of the modern
type, the president challenged African architects to advise on
the appropriate technology that can be adopted to provide modern
but affordable houses the Africans.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said since most donors have directed assistance
to East Europe, following the end of the Cold War, it is
imperative that the Africans harnessed the available resources
for the general development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He urged Shelter Afrique to facilitate a free flow of
information on housing among the Africa countries in cases where
research on housing has produced success in one country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged member countries of Shelter Afrique to remit
their outstanding contributions to the organisation.

as it is still arresting people inside.

Palestinian sources were quoted as saying that most of those
arrested were students in Bir Zeit University who carry Gazan ID
cards, and therefore cannot stay in the West Bank. The students
live in Surda, Bir Zeit, Abu Qash, Abu Shkheidem and other
villages.

The campaign, which began last night, is in its final stage
this morning, although military sources said the closure on the
villages will last till the end of the day.

are terrorist organizations in Abu Qash and Bir Zeit... doing
harm to both Israelis and Palestinians."

Palestinians who want to carry on normal lives... It has no
problems with Moslems or their respected religion."

army in Judea and Samaria." Israel refers to the West Bank

A recent physical examination showed that Ren is in normal

<HEADLINE> US not Qualified to Criticize China's Ethnic Minority Stand (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to 1990 statistics, the total population in the Tibet
Autonomous Region stood at 2.196 million, 2.096 million of whom
were Tibetans, accounting for 95.5 percent of the total. The other
five percent are people from other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the US Report's criticism of China shows
that the US government holds up its policies towards the Indians
as examples, hoping that the Chinese government will isolate the
ethnic minority groups just as the US government has done, and
keep ethnic minority people apart from modernization process and
leave them in the status of underdevelopment and uncivilization.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the assessment of the Chinese human rights
situation made by the US Report is self-contradictory. For
example, on the one hand, the Report says that "incomes in many
ethnic minority areas remain well below the national average",
while on the other hand it says that the development programs
launched by the Chinese government in ethnic minority areas "have
also disrupted traditional living patterns of minority groups".
</P>
<P>
The Report claims that Chinese citizens have no freedom of
movement, while saying that "the population of economic migrants
leaving their home areas to seek work elsewhere in China is
estimated to be over 100 million," the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that such self-contradiction shows that
the writers of the Report lack the basic knowledge of logic.

The commentary refuted the US report with regard to the
employment of those released after serving their prison terms,
China's one-party leadership, lack of judicial procedures in
sentencing Harry Wu, problems relating to ethnic minority groups,
and immigration freedom of Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
It criticized the US report for using groundless materials
which applied such terms as "it is said", "it is believed",
"according to unconfirmed reports". If they are "unconfirmed," why
are they used in the report? Isn't it too unserious and
irresponsible to do so?
</P>
<P>
"China is an independent sovereign state with distinctive
cultural traditions and national characteristics, and it is
neither necessary, nor probable for China to change itself in
accordance with US standards, let along permit the United States
to order others about," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In its final part, the commentary listed many facts about
China's progress in human rights over recent years and
particularly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The US report did not give an objective and fair assessment
about such progress, but distorted the basic facts deliberately
and attacked China viciously, it said.
</P>
<P>
What the United States cares for is not the human rights of
Chinese people, but to vilify China, damage its stability, hold
back its development, and then change the road for development and
the social system in China, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"In short," the commentary stressed, the United States "is
employing the human rights to interfere in China's internal
affairs and pursue hegemonism and power politics."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of
China's State Council today hit back at the United States for
finding groundless fault with China's human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy commentary published here today, the Information
Office said that the United States imposed power politics, and was
interfering in China's internal affairs, with the release of the
1995 Human Rights Report (part on China) of the US Department of
State on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The 7,000-word commentary, entitled "Safeguarding Human Rights
or Interfering in Internal Affairs" of China, criticized the US
report for standing against China, distorting facts, interfering
in the affairs of more than 190 countries and regions according to
US standards, practising hegemonism, and imposing power politics.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that the US report was based on one
ridiculous logic: that "respect for human rights" meant to
tolerate those people opposed to China's legal government and
Chinese Communist Party's leadership, otherwise, human rights is
thought to be infringed.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the political bias, and wrong stand against the
Chinese government and China's social system, run counter to
international conventions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
With regard to US blame for China's sentence of Wei Jingsheng,
detention of "Anointed One" leader Wu Yangming, and the Chinese
government's requirement for reporters to keep state secrets, the
Information Office criticized the United States for commenting on
China's human rights situation with a political bias, and unfair
stand of opposing China and the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The United States will turn a deaf ear, and keep their eyes
closed, to China's social and economic developments, and
improvements in democratic politics and human rights, as long as
China remains a Communist Party-led socialist country, and pursues
a political system different from that of the United States, the
Information Office said in the commentary.
</P>
<P>
What the United States cares for is whether a few lawbreakers,
or criminals, have the right to overthrow China's legal government
and the Communist Party's leadership, and to change China's
current political system, the commentary said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States is not
qualified at all to criticize China on the ethnic minority issue,
the Information Office of China's State Council said here today in
a commentary refuting the US State Department's Human Rights
Report for 1995 released on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the US government implements a racial
segregation policy towards the Indians and pens them inside
reserves, with the result that they live in chronic poverty and
backwardness. That is the real infringement of human rights, the
commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the Human Rights Report for 1995 of
the US State Department criticized the Chinese government's policy
of helping Tibet develop its economy, saying it undermines the
traditional life style of the Tibetans. The report also says
non-Tibetan technological workers who are sent to work in Tibet
dilute the Tibet nationality. "This is a fabrication with ulterior
motives," the commentary stressed.
</P>
<P>
The commentary added that the Chinese government has all along
implemented policies both to develop the Tibetan economy and
protect traditional Tibetan culture. A small number of non-Tibetan
technological workers go to Tibet in the light of the needs of
certain construction projects, and help local people develop their
economy. This does not bring any changes in local population
formation at all, the commentary stressed.

<HEADLINE> "Anointed One" Leader Accused of Rape and Harassment (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China said today that the leader
of the "Anointed One" sect, Wu Yangming, was found guilty of the
most heinous criminal acts under the guise of religious activites.
</P>
<P>
The Information Office of the State Council made the statement
today in a long commentary to refute the Human Rights Report For
1995 issued by US Department of State on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that Wu Yangming raped and sexually
harassed more than 100 women. What is more he forcibly controlled
more than 20 young women religious believers for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Safeguarding human rights or
interference in the internal affairs" of China, said that the US
Report confused right with wrong by accusing the Chinese
government of violating the guarantee of freedom of religion by
banning the Henan-based Christian evangelical sect known as the
"Shouters" and reportedly detaining leaders of the "Anointed One"
sect.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the "Shouters", which are regarded by
many Christians as heretics, engaged publicly in criminal
activities, both against the government and against society under
the guise of religious activities. They said they would "organize
the sect to fight the government to the end," got their religious
followers to cause disruptions near government institutions,
attacked government officials, and engaged in other illegal or
criminal activities such as rape or fraud.
</P>
<P>
These sects are not religious organizations, but are, in fact,
similar to "doomsday cults" that have existed in the United
States, Japan, and other countries, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"No responsible government in the world would sit idly by and
be indifferent to such seriously anti-social criminal activity,"
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States itself has cracked down on 'doomsday cults'
in an extreme way," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The US Report, completely disregarding international legal
standards, used anything at all as "evidence" of a Chinese
"violation of human rights", even if involved actions against
criminal activities that were directed at overthrowing the Chinese
government or the socialist system, the commentary adds.
</P>
<P>
It quotes a Chinese saying that says "If you are out to accuse
someone, you can always find something wrong", and this accusation
is nothing but a confusing of right with wrong.

<HEADLINE> Harry Wu Chooses His Attorneys (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- American citizen Harry Wu (Wu
Hongda) himself chose his own attorneys from a list of law offices
provided by the American Embassy in China in accordance with the
relevant regulations about attorneys' qualifications set in
Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
The Information Office of Chinese State Council stated the fact
in a long commentary entitled "Safeguarding Human Rights or
Interfering in the Internal Affairs" of China, released today to
refute the US State Department Human Rights Report for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wu was once convicted of theft and rape and punished according
to law. Shortly after he went to the United States in 1985, Wu
obtained American citizenship. From 1991, by using the aliases
"Peter Hwu" and "Harry Wu", he slipped into restricted areas in
China to steal secret information from restricted places to
fabricate propaganda materials slandering China, said the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
In July 1995 Wu was detained and then arrested as he illegally
sneaked into China again. Afterwards the Wuhan Intermediate
People's Court tried Wu through legal procedures, according to the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
It said that the report made a fuss about the case of Wu,
saying that "the case of U.S. citizen Harry Wu exemplified
problems with the lack of procedural and substantive due process
of law and also the problem of forced confessions" and "the
authorities permitted Wu to choose (his attorneys) only from a
list of government-approved names."
</P>
<P>
Wu's attorneys were chosen by himself in accordance with the
relevant regulations about attorneys' qualifications set in
Chinese law from a list of law offices provided by the American
Embassy in China, and Wu had expressed satisfaction for the
defence in court and wrote a letter of gratitude, said the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
An official with the American Embassy in China, who was present
in court when Wu was tried, said that he had not expected that
China would allow such a positive defence for Wu, it said.
</P>
<P>
Wu admitted his guilty in a letter of confession which he
himself offered to write. The court sentenced Wu to 15 years in
jail and informed him that he could appeal to a higher court if he
did not plead guilty. But Wu pleaded guilty and gave up the right
of appealing, the commentary said.

BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
Chinese State Council said here today that 1995 saw continued
all-round progress in China's human rights.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on the US State Department Human Rights Report
for 1995 (part on China), which was published here today, the
Information Office said that China's national economy grew rapidly
while the people's material and cultural living standards were
further improved in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that in 1995 China revised the Law on
Deputies to the National People's Congress and Local People's
Congresses at Various Levels and the Organic Law of the Local
People's Congresses and Governments at Various Levels. China also
promulgated and implemented the Police, Procurators, Judges and
Education laws.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress,
which just closed recently, passed the Law on Administrative
Punishment and revised the Law on Criminal Procedures. All these
measures have improved the legal guarantees for human rights and
strengthened the protection of human rights, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the political situation in China is
now stable, its economy is growing, its society is progressing,
nationalities are united, people are living and working in peace
and contentment, and their living standard has constantly
improved. The human rights situation is being comprehensively
improved.

DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's business leaders
Wednesday welcomed Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's offer to quickly
form a caretaker government to supervise the next general
elections by May.
</P>
<P>
They hoped this move would lead to a solution of the ongoing
political crisis and also urged the opposition parties to withdraw
their current non-cooperation campaign.

<HEADLINE> Tang Tomb Found in Palace Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A tomb dating from the Tang
Dynasty (618-907) has been found in the Palace Museum here, which
used to be the imperial residence of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing
(1644-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made during the ongoing construction of the
world's largest underground storehouse for cultural relics in the
museum.
</P>
<P>
The brick tomb has a gate and a corridor leading to the burial
room. A bronze mirror, pieces of grey pottery and part of a
gravestone were the only burial articles found in the 4.32 m by
4.40 m room which had been damaged when the imperial palaces were
built in the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions on the gravestone show that the tomb was made in
799.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese tradition, burials were never inside the
city, so the tomb indicates that the site of the Palace Museum was
outside town the city at that time, Chinese archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents show that the site was not included in the
city area until the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).

<HEADLINE> CBI Detects Bank Scandal in Calcutta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) has detected a scam involving fraudulent bank
transactions of about 29 million US dollars following revealing 18
million US dollar scandal in the "hawala case" since January this
year.
</P>
<P>
At least 33 branches of 22 banks, including some foreign ones
in Calcutta are said to be involved in such transactions. The
banks include the State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank
(PNB), Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB), Allahabad Bank (AB) and Bank of
Baroda (BB).
</P>
<P>
The case is being investigated by the CBI.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has identified Mrs. S.R. Ramamani, senior manager of
Allahabad Bank, as the key person behind the fraudulent
transactions. She has been placed under suspension by Allahabad
Bank. Ramamani had worked in tandem with the Mafcon Group of
Companies, the latter being the beneficiary of crores (10 million)
rupees.
</P>
<P>
CBI officials have found that the Mafcon Group of Companies had
been allowed "huge temporary overdrafts" in their current accounts
at a branch of the State Bank of India in Calcutta, peaking at 10
million US dollars on December 23, 1995. The Mafcon group had in
turn pledged term deposit and fix deposit receipts to get
overdrafts.
</P>
<P>
The process of liquidation revealed that some of the term and
fixed deposit receipts had been issued by banks "without
consideration", CBI official said.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal Finance Minister Asim Dasgupta has alleged the
involvement of foreign hands in the bank scam and demanded the
government to take stringent action against the culprits.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan's 2.488Gb/sec SDH Transmission System Passes Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The latest synchronous digital
hierarchy transmission system, a 2.488Gb/sec system, has been
successfully developed in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
With its experience in plesio-synchronous digital hierarchy
research, the local academy of sciences, along with the Ministry
of Post and Telecommunications, developed the high-speed
transmission technology within three years.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications say
that the equipment conforms to standards of the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), which proposed the development of
SDH in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, China began to do research in SDH, and
developed low-speed 155Mb/sec and 622Mb/sec SDH transmission
systems last year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the existing PDH system, SDH has an immense
capacity, simple transmission structure, and great reliability. As
a basic part of the future information super highway, the
technology has been hailed as a revolution in the world of digital
telecommunications.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The first 6,000 life insurance
agents who have gotten official accreditation can begin work in
China's largest metropolis on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, 8,800 persons from about ten local
and foreign-funded insurance firms took part in exams organized
jointly by the local branch of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, and the Shanghai Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of them passed, said an official with the
bank. "In future, all life insurance agents in Shanghai will be
required to obtain credentials issued by our bank."
</P>
<P>
The bank has drawn up eight regulations for agents to prevent
fraud, the disclosure of information on clients, and the misuse of
premiums.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance agents began working in Shanghai in 1992. Their
door-to-door selling techniques have helped the development of
Shanghai's life insurance business, which amounted to nearly two
billion yuan in 1995.

<HEADLINE> French Beef Industry Hit by "Mad Cow" Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The French beef industry has
plunged into crisis as the scare of "mad cow" disease spreads,
leading to dramatic drop in beef sales.
</P>
<P>
France was the first country to ban March 21 the
imports of British beef after Britain reported earlier this week
the possible link between Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE),
or "mad cow" disease, and the fatal human brain disorder,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
Because of several cases of "mad cow" disease here, the scare
spreads quickly across the country with its
reports dominating daily the headlines of the whole media.
</P>
<P>
As many French consumers avoided eating beef, local butchers and
major beef retailers all saw a dramatic drop in their sales,
ranging from 8 percent to 60 percent, which served a further blow
to the already battered beef industry.
</P>
<P>
France, the biggest beef exporter in the European Union (EU),
raises 20.66 million heads with annual exports amounting to
1.66 million tons. Even before the scare of "mad cow" disease
surfaced, the price of French beef had plunged by 15
percent as sales shrank over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Mussaud, President of the FNICGV meat wholesalers'
federation, told radio reporters Wednesday the average drop in
wholesale beef sales was at 35 percent since earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that Italy's orders for French beef will fall by
more than a half as the "mad cow" crisis worsens in EU. The
shocked French beef industry, fearing further shrinking sales, has
issued a SOS call to the government to take measures to
rescue the industry from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to ease the fear of the "mad cow" disease, the French
government has now introduced a new labelling system for home-made
beef. From this weekend on, all butchers and supermarkets will
display the logo "Viande Francaise" on all french beef products.
</P>
<P>
But the French media strike a tone of pessimism on the
resolution of the "mad cow" disease crisis, saying that
the EU countries, which should have been united to deal with any
crisis, have been split by this disease and everyone only cares
about its own problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday called on states to reward good teachers, fire incompetent
ones and hold schools accountable for results.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national education meeting in Palisades, New York,
Clinton said students should have to pass tests to graduate from
elementary, middle and high schools which is already a requirement
in a number of states.
</P>
<P>
"Once you have high standards and high expectations, there are
unlimited things that can be done," the Associated Press quoted
Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine business leaders from across America have joined 41
governors at the meeting to discuss raising academic standards in
America's schools and infusing technology into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
After late-night partisan bickering, the governors ended the
two-day meeting by agreeing to set higher standards for students
and measure their performance.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders agreed to look at the high school
transcripts of prospective employees, push parents to get involved
in schools and play an active role in getting technology into the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to make a state's academic standards and
student performance a high priority in deciding where to build or
expand operations.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders called for tougher academic standards,
noting that managers often had difficulty finding qualified
workers. Poor-performance schools are partly to blame, they said.
</P>
<P>
Raising standards in core subjects, such as math, science,
English and history, is a bottom line issue for some businesses.
</P>
<P>
One-third of corporate economists surveyed by the National
Association of Business Economists in January said their companies
were having trouble finding skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 American Management Association survey on basic skills
testing and training revealed that the number of U.S. businesses
that provide remedial training jumped to 20 percent in 1994, up
from 4 percent in 1989.

NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) has filed its first information reports (FIRS)
against Lok Sabha (lower house) members Suraj Mandal, Shailendra
Mahato, Shibu Soren and Simon Maradi under the prevention of
corruption act for allegedly receiving substantial amounts of
money as bribe to vote against the motion of no-confidence against
the P.V. Narasimha Rao government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by additional solicitor-general A.N. Jayaram
to a division bench of the Delhi high court, which had on March 20
set a seven-day deadline for the CBI to complete investigations
into the source of money allegedly received by the MPs.
</P>

0.09 million US dollars as pay-off, which he deposited in his
account at the Punjab National Bank on August,1993.
</P>
<P>
Separate FIRS were filed against Mandal, Mahato, Soren and
Maradi in the designated CBI court of additional district and
sessions judge Dinesh Dayal for corruption cases on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties in just concluded parliament session here
raised the issue to the prime minister and asked him whether he
was investigated by the CBI, but Rao did not give a direct answer
to the question.
</P>
<P>
The high court proceedings are based on a petition filed by
Ravinder Kumar, who had alleged pay-offs to Mandal and three of
his colleagues to vote against the opposition-sponsored
no-confidence motion against the Rao government tabled in
parliament on July 28,1993. The Rao government survived the motion
by a narrow margin.

MADRID, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Spain's conservative Popular Party
(PP) today won the speakership of both the Congress of Deputies
and the Senate in parliament, putting an end to the Socialist
Party's 13-year rule.
</P>
<P>
PP candidates Federico Trillo and Juan Ignacio Barrero were
respectively elected with absolute majority, marking the forming

</P>
<P>
On March 3, PP topped the poll in the general election, but
fell 20 seats short of a majority in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
As a result, PP leader Jose Maria Aznar had to hold a series of
meetings with parties from Catalonia, Basque and other
regions seeking their support.
</P>
<P>
Trillo's winning of speakership today signaled the willingness
of these parties to help the conservative rule.

<P>
Despite the victory, Aznar has to get himself named prime
minister by King Juan Carlos and the sixth parliament, and pass the
Senate by absolute majority before forming a new government.
</P>

However, with the support of the regional parties in the
parliament, Aznar said he is confident to form a new government

<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko today reiterated that Belarus and Russia will be equal
partners within their political, economic and social union.
</P>
<P>
Belarus will not lose its sovereignty under the union treaty to
be signed on April 2, which will guarantee equal rights for both
sides, Lukashenko told the Supreme Soviet, Belarus' parliament.
</P>
<P>
"What we are going to set up is not a new state, but a union of
two states," Interfax and Itar-Tass quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Belarus has no choice but to accelerate its integration
with its vast neighbor which supplies 90 percent of its industrial
raw materials and buys 86 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the union was driven by "the economy and the
people" rather than by politics, Lukashenko said.

He said supranational institutions will be established,
including a supreme committee, a parliament and an integration
committee, which will comprise top officials from the two
countries.
</P>
<P>

after-effects long after that.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia last night asked President Abdur Rahman Biswas to take
necessary steps as soon as possible in forming a caretaker
government to supervise the next general elections by May.
</P>
<P>
The latest move indicates that an announcement of the
resignation of the government, dissolution of parliament and
formation of a neutral caretaker government to hold a "free and
fair parliamentary polls" is expected at any moment, the local
press said.
</P>
<P>
During her meeting with Biswas, Khaleda also urged the
president to give his assent to the constitution amendment bill on
the formation of a neutral caretaker government, which was passed
by parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Biswas is expected to sign the bill as soon as it reaches him,
a source close to the president said. The president was also
maintaining direct contact with the chiefs of the three branches
of the armed forces for steps he was now contemplating, and was in
torch with top leaders of the mainstream opposition parties, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The three mainstream opposition parties, the Awami (People's)
League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the Jammat-E-Islami,
indicated on Wednesday that they might participate in the proposed
general elections in May provided the prime minister resign
immediately, parliament is dissolved and a neutral caretaker
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has already made clear that they were willing to
sit with the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for talks
with the latter as a political organization and not as a ruling
party under the aegis of the chief adviser of a caretaker
government, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has demanded that the February 15 parliamentary
election be scrapped, and refused to recognize the new parliament
and the cabinet. The opposition boycotted the polls which were
won easily by the BNP.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day break in the interest of the celebration of the
independence day, the opposition resumed its indefinite
"non-cooperation" campaign this morning to press their demands.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 35 secretaries of different ministries
met the president on Wednesday and asked him to form a caretaker
government immediately.
</P>
<P>
In their six-point proposal to the president, the secretaries
-- high-ranking officials just below cabinet ministers and state
ministers in rank, warned that the government officials and
employees would not be able to attend offices from today if the
country's overall situation does not improve.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Wan Shuxia, a labourer employed
at the Qingdao Textile Mill, recently got 2,800 yuan of insurance
from the local labour bureau and 150 days of maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
Workers in Qingdao, a city in east China's Shandong province,
will no longer face being sacked for getting pregnant, the China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A new maternity insurance scheme has been set up in the city to
protect women who move in from the countryside to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the past, some employers have been reluctant to give women
long-term contracts for fear they will become pregnant and cost
them money. Others have simply sacked pregnant employees.
</P>
<P>
In last October, the Qingdao government stipulated that the
rural labourers should enjoy the same treatments as other women
employed by the city's enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many enterprises in the city have bought insurance
for women employees of child-bearing age who have moved into the
city from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a similar insurance system has been
established in many cities and counties of most of the Chinese
provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia's Prime Minister Branko
Crvenkovski has ruled out an early general election, saying the
political system "is operating properly," reports from Skoplje,
capital of the former Yugoslav republic, said.
</P>
<P>
"An early general election is usually held when the legislature
and the administration are obstructed, and the state system can't
operate properly," the reports quoted Crvenkovski as saying in an
interview with newspaper Nova Makedonija.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came amidst Opposition's calls for early general
election, which became loud last month when the Liberal party quit
the coalition government because of disputes with its partner, the
Social Democratic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Liberal leader Stojan Andov has resigned as president of the
Assembly and his party has turned itself into an opposition party.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the coalition's break-up, the government carried
out a major cabinet reshuffle, the first since its formation in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Crvenkovski said the cabinet reshuffle was not a radical
action, but a democratic procedure following the Liberal party's
departure from government.
</P>
<P>
He described as "absurd" the idea that the Liberal party's exit
would delay the country's democratic process and result in
political instability.
</P>
<P>
The country has made achievements in the process of
democratization, political and economic reforms, and in developing
diplomatic relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised further progress for this year in maintaining
the country's good-neighbor policy, setting up diplomatic ties
with Yugoslavia, participating in the "Partnership for Peace"
program, and realizing the strategic goal of integrating into
Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic side, the country will strive to stablize the
currency, control inflation and speed up the development of
industry, to boost growth, the prime minister added.

MEXICO CITY, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's legislators have
accused U.S. politicians of trying to make political capital out
of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The senate committee on border affairs today condemned a
U.S. bill which bars the children of illegal Mexican immigrants
living in the U.S. from receiving free public education.

<P>
The Mexican legislators said the bill seeks to legitimize the
new racist and xenophobic tendencies of politicians in the United
States, who are trying to win more votes through immigrant bashing.
</P>
<P>
They said the right to education is a human right and education
cannot be withheld just because the children are those of illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the bill's sponsors, Elton Gallegly and
Lamar Smith, stop using immigration problems for election purposes.
</P>
<P>
They are violating the very constitution of their country,
which guarantees the right to education of all its inhabitants,
the senators said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American and
Caribbean countries received a record level of capital from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) last year.
</P>
<P>
But making better use of their resources and checking the
flight of capital still remain their biggest challenges.
</P>
<P>
In the 37th IDB annual meeting which ended here today,
economic, finance and commerce ministers and central bank
presidents of 45 IDB members agreed that loans should be invested
first in manufacturing, energy, transportation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting held that it is also necessary to
allocate some to resolve problems in the social sectors, and in
the economic reform and adjustment processes.
</P>
<P>
They supported allocating more capital to the development of
small and medium-sized companies which are efficient in reducing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But the region can not depend solely on foreign capital and
must make more efficient use of internal savings, they deemed.
</P>
<P>
Particularly for short-term foreign capital or the "hot"
capital, some pinpointed the negative effects they might have on
the economy such as in the case of Mexico but others favored
controlling it through financial norms and policies.
</P>
<P>
The IDB member nations also exchanged opinions and experiences
on monetary policies to reach higher growth targets.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Annual income of resettled
people in poverty-stricken Shanxi and Henan provinces increased 15
to 20 percent after they moved to the Yellow River Valley, a
recent survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 6,618 persons affected by a water control
project at Xiaolangdi, on the middle reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The site is 30 km north of Luoyang City in Henan Province, and
is the largest water control project on the Yellow River. It is
expected that the construction of the project will inundate 32,330
ha of land in Henan and Shanxi Provinces and is requiring the
resettlement of 176,000 people, the second largest population
shift in China after the resettlement at the Three Gorges Dam on
the Yangtze River, said Xi Meihua, director of the Xiaolangdi
Resettlement Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the resettled people came from three
mountainous areas in Henan and Shanxi provinces, which are poor
areas with insufficient water supplies.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the resettlement project, which began in
1995, 25,000 farmers were moved into 24 resettlement villages with
relatively complete infrastructure, such as roads, electricity,
and telecommunication facilities.

<HEADLINE> More Expressways for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of expressways in
China has been growing rapidly over last several years, at a rate
of 324 km a year since 1990, with the total length now reaching
2,141 km.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan,
Beijing-Shijiazhuang, Jinan-Qingdao, Chengdu-Chongqing,
Kaifeng-Luoyang, and Xi'an-Baoji expressways have contributed
greatly to the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The improvements have gone from coastal areas to remote and
relatively less-developed central and western China. Shanxi
Province, the nation's major coal producer, is building a 144-km
expressway connecting the mountainous province with the
Beijing-Shijiazhuang Expressway.
</P>
<P>
When the expressway opens in June this year, some 50 million
tons of coal are expected to be transported every year to south
China, Japan, and southeast Asia on it.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Communications estimate that
nearly 10 expressways will open in the next one or two years. They
say that the quality of China's expressways is very good, thanks
to the introduction of international construction methods.
</P>
<P>
Some of the new expressways have been built with commercial
capital or overseas investment instead of only government backing.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are also taking an interest in using BOT in
expressway construction.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand emerged as the third
largest investor in India in 1995, with direct investment of 580
million US dollars, placing it behind only the United States and
Israel, the local newspaper Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Indian ambassador to Thailand Ranjit Gupta was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that interaction between India and Southeast
Asia was limited until the break up of the Soviet Union led to the
collapse of India's traditional markets in the former Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
India was then forced to focus on increasing its trade and
investment links with the Southeast Asian region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Thai investment in India has been in the
telecommunications sector, with the petrochemicals sector and the
hotel industry also attracting significant interest.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports to India reached 289 million US dollars in
1995, an increase of 49.4 percent over the previous year. Imports
from India were recorded at 623 million US dollars, a 17.4 percent
increase over 1994.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Natural disasters killed 5,561
people and affected more than 240 million others in China last
year, today's "China Daily" quoted a report by the Ministry of
Civil Affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the natural disasters, including
floods, drought, hailstones, snowstorms, typhoons and earthquakes,
had resulted in the damage costing 186.3 billion yuan (22.3
billion US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
While southern China was plagued by severe floods, the northern
part suffered from drought throughout the spring and summer. The
central provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi and northeastern provinces
of Liaoning and Jilin suffered from consecutive floods. And
northwest China witnessed virtually no rainfall since the fall of
1994.
</P>
<P>
About 137.7 million people were besieged by the floods, with
more than 10 million forced to leave their homes, while more than
4.5 million hactares of crops were affected by the disasters and
some reaped only 20 percent of their average output.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Civil Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of
Finance allocated 1.9 billion yuan (228 million US dollars) in
emergency relief to disaster areas and local authorities gave
another 850 million yuan (102 millionUS dollars). Over 40 million
people received government relief in food, clothes, housing and
medicine, while more than 100 million got food.

BONN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany hit in two unanswered goals
to beat Denmark in a soccer friendly at Munich on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The German team, 1992 European Championships losing finalists,
dominated the match as Denmark packed its defense and tried only
to launch some fast counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
Denmark surprisingly took the European championships title
four years ago by beating Germany 2-0 in the finals.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's match, Oliver Bierhoff was the hero of the
German team as he scored in the 44th and 61st minutes
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Klinsmann, top scorer of the German team, was shut
down by tight Danish marking.

<HEADLINE> Women Climb Social Ladder in Henan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- More women than ever are
treading the corridors of power in central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of officials in the province are females, a fact
which a senior official attributes to the improved social status
of women in the province.
</P>
<P>
Lu Caixia, head of the Zhanhe District, Pingdingshan City,
Henan Province, said, "Women can be as competitive as men provided
that they do not look down upon themselves."
</P>
<P>
Since Lu was elected as head of the district in June, 1994, the
district has witnessed marked progress in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
Last year the district's revenue increased 62 percent over the
previous year, ranking the first in the whole city in terms of
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
There is at least one female official in each of the province's
158 county-level administrative units.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of deputies to People's Congresses, at and
below provincial level within the province, are females.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the provincial government has helped 1.35
million young and middle-aged rural women eliminate illiteracy in
recent years, in a move to help them become better-off.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Enterprises Rely on Laws to Protect IPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
enterprises are relying on laws to protect intellectual property
rights (IPR).
</P>
<P>
Since last June, when an IPR Court was established in Tianjin,
43 cases involving trademarks, copyright, packaging and product
design, have been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Li Baoming, deputy presiding judge of the court, said that
though judicial practice in the field of IPR does not have a long
history in China, the country now boasts a comparatively complete
IPR-related law system, which is helping to win the trust of more
and more enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li said that in a planned economy era, manufacturer and
exporters used to create, and cash in on one trademark. But in a
market economy their interests are now separated, and as a result
the problem of who should inherit the trademark has to be
determined by legal means.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, the biggest industrial city in northern China, boasts
over 21,000 registered trademarks, and 7,000 authorized patents,
as well as thousands of scientific achievements registered in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> England Beats Bulgaria 1-0 in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- England beat visiting Bulgarian
national eleven 1-0 here this evening with the best soccer player
of England les Ferdinand scoring the only goal at the 7th minute.
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand, the Newcastle striker who is in superb form, was
sent clear by a Teddy Sheringham chip and he held off a strong
challenge to lift the ball over the Bulgarian goalkeeper Bobby
Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian team, also qualifier of the 96' European Soccer
Championships, were swamped for the rest of the match as Ferdinand
hit the post.
</P>
<P>
The inspired Steve McMananman went close but Robie Fowler had
no time to make an impact as a late substitute.
</P>
<P>
England coach Terry Venables said after the match that he was
disappointed not to have seen England beat Bulgaria by a wider
margin after the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of chances for a game at this level and I
think we should have put more of them away."
</P>
<P>
"I thought we should have been three or four up at halftime. We
have to be a bit more ruthless but we stuck at it and did ok."
</P>
<P>
The England coach also praised duo Sheringham and les
Ferdinand, who linked up well for the only strike, adding
"that goal was top drawer".
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand, who many said should not have played from the
start, is quoted as saying "I am glad to score at any time,
but in the first seven minutes was great".

<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government has placed
a 2.8 billion pound (4.2 billion US dollars) price tag on
slaughter of thousands of cattle in a bid to overcome the public
fears of the mad cow disease (BSE).
</P>
<P>
Britain's Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg announced today
that the European Union will also offer funds through existing
mechanisms to help meet the cost.
</P>
<P>
Although there are no details concerning the aid to be provided
by the EU, britain has been ensured that it will get a sympathetic
hearing.
</P>
<P>
The BSE crisis is still spreading and deepening both in Britain
and in the world.
</P>
<P>
Following the formally total ban on British beef by the
European commission, the Netherlands also announced that it will
destroy the 64,000 calves imported from the UK over the past month
and all British beef stored in the country.
</P>
<P>
And some Italian importers have rejected British lamb shipments
even though the Italian government has not banned the product.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the Meat and Livestock Commission said tens of
thousands of jobs at risk caused by the beef crisis and many
workers have already been out of job.
</P>
<P>
The beef industry employs around 500,000 people, including
15,000 working in abattoirs and 62,000 in meat processing.
</P>
<P>
And dairy farms employ some 25,000 agricultural workers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Overseas Money Pours Into North China Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Free Trade Zone in
north China's largest port city has increased the amount of
foreign investment brought in during the first two months of this
year by 370 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the zone totaled 60 million US dollars
during that period, according to San Xiangjun, deputy director of
the Administrative Committee of the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
A key characteristic of foreign investment this year is a sharp
increase in the number of export-oriented processing enterprises
in the zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect this trend to continue for some time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The seven square kilometer Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone was
established in 1991, with the State Council approval. It has a
financial trade sub-zone, a warehouse processing sub-zone, and a
wharf sub-zone.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 13 free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the Tianjin Zone had approved 2,900
enterprises, involving 1.43 billion US dollars in overseas
investment, San said.
</P>
<P>
A number of internationally-known companies have opened
businesses in the zone, including Daimler-Benz Company of Germany,
the Daiei Corporation of Japan, and the Daewoo Company of the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said that 50 projects, each involving at least five million
US dollars have been launched in the zone.
</P>
<P>
He said that his zone will spend 500 million yuan in
infrastructure construction this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone will eventually be built into
the largest international trade window in north China and operate
according to internationally accepted practices," he said.

NEW YORK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks fell in the
final minutes of Wednesday's session as investors took testimony
by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as a sign the central
bank will not lower interest rates soon.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 43.72 points at
5,626.88. Bond prices deteriorated too. Traders said the late
decline was assisted by computerized sell programs.
</P>
<P>
Decliners overtook advancers by small margins. Volume on the
floor of the Big Board was moderate at 402.84 million shares,
but up slightly from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The other major indexes also fell by different degrees.
</P>
<P>
Bonds were hit hard and sank precipitously late in the session.
The yielding of benchmark 30-year Treasury rose, when prices fall,
to 6.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bonds fell after traders pored over Congressional Greenspan's
testimony before the House Budget Committee, in which he said "the
current economic expansion seems to have staying power." Bond
traders interpreted that into a signal that the Fed is not likely
to ease interest rates any time soon.
</P>
<P>
The computer issues were affected by the news that Apple
Computer Inc. expects to lose about 700 million U.S. dollars in
the current quarter.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in U.S. Steel Mill Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A powerful blast ripped
through a steel mill in central U.S. today, killing three
employees and injuring nine others.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Portage, Indiana, said the early morning explosion
in a high pressured basement tank destroyed a corner of the
building housing the Beta Steel mill in the lake-side town near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The blast, sending a huge mushroom-type cloud into the sky,
also brought down part of the roof of a Beta office complex about
50 feet away.
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 50 to 60 employees were inside the steel
mill when the tank exploded at about 7:00 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden there was a huge explosion, like a time bomb,"
Lee Spitka, a supervisor at the mill, told local news media.
"People were just running all over the place. They were scattering
because they didn't know what was going to fall next."
</P>
<P>
Three workers, aging from 25 to 37, were confirmed dead and one
of the injured was listed in seriously condition with broken bones
at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cause of the blast was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Beta Steel, a five-year-old mill located in a port on Lake
Michigan, is about 30 miles southeast of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Moslem-Croat Federation Police Breaks Links with IPTF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Only a week after the Sarajevo
city was unified, Muslim-Croat federation police in the Sarajevo
Ilidza suburb today broke off all contacts with the U.N. police
whose duties were to monitor the activities of the federation
police in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Sarajevo spokesman Aleksandar Ivanko said the decision of
the Muslim-Croat federation was in direct violation of the Dayton
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"A certain number of incidents have been reported in the past
few days indicating the federation's lack of cooperation," Tanjug
news agency quoted Ivanko as saying in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He said members of the International Police Task Force (IPTF)
were barred from federation police operation rooms, denied work
schedules and refused information on arrests and patrolling.
</P>
<P>
When pressed for explanation on their behavior, the federal
police answered they were acting on "orders from above", Ivanko
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the IPTF was not allowed to see a Bosnian Serb
translator working for the U.N. police who was arrested by the
federaL police about 10 days ago. IPTF is not allowed access to
most of the other prisoners they are holding either, the U.N.
official complained.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international police was unable to perform
its duties, which is to monitor activities of the federal police.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko told reporters that U.N. police commissioner in Bosnia
Peter Fitzgerald wanted to remind Bosnian Federation Authorities
that this lack of cooperation was in violation of the Dayton peace
agreement and that he expected the authorities to give necessary
orders to their subordinates to end this crisis.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify what the U.N. police was ready to do if
the federation continued to violate terms of the Dayton agreement.

<HEADLINE> Serb FM Says Equal Treatment in Bosnian Key to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister
Aleksa Buha said today that equal treatment of both entities in
Bosnia was a key to the preservation of peace and restoration of
trust between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with British Ambassador in Sarajevo Brian
Hopkinson in the Serb stronghold Pale, Buha said he expected that
Britain would continue to treat equally both Bosnian entities --
the Serb state Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Buha and Hopkinson discussed the problem of prisoners of war,
elections and other questions related to the implementation of the
Dayton peace agreement, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official told Hopkins that big problems might arise if
the Bosnian elections, slated for September, were organized in
keeping with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the voters should vote in the
municipalities they lived in before the war, which might cause new
migrations from the Republika Srpska towards the Muslim-Croat
federation and vice versa, Buha said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official also informed the British ambassador about
the inconsistency on the part of some members of the international
community, primarily the United States, which supported the arming
and training of the Muslim-Croat federal army during a conference
on disarmament in the Balkans in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Hopkinson told reporters that today's
talks with Serb officials were constructive and such contacts
should continue in the future in order to ensure a successful
implementation of the Bosnia peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> World Trade Continues Strong Growth in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The volume of world merchandise
exports expanded eight percent in 1995, the second highest level
in more than a decade after the record high of 9.5 percent
registered the previous year, the latest world trade report
released today said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued today by the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the volume growth of world exports in goods is
expected to slow modestly in 1996, but could still maintain a
robust level around seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The new report, which is the WTO's first examination of the
evolution of world trade in 1995, also pointed out that as world
merchandise output grew by three percent in 1995, the growth of
world merchandise trade again exceeded by a wide margin the growth
of world merchandise output, following the pattern evident since
1990.
</P>
<P>
Among the recently-identified factors behind the trend is the
rapid expansion of processing trade, which for some countries has
become a significant factor in the evolution of their trade.
</P>
<P>
The report cited China as an example, where exports originating
in processing and assembly factories had risen to nearly 50
percent of its total exports by 1995. The coresponding share for
China's imports destined for further processing reached 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
Another factor behind the strong excess of trade growth over
output growth is the revolution in the information sector.
According to the report, by 1995, the share of office and telecom
equipment in world trade had risen to 12 percent from only five
percent in the first half of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the marginally slower volume growth, the value
of world merchandise trade expanded 19 percent in 1995 compared
with the 13 percent gain in 1994. The increase, the largest since
1979, pushed the value of world merchandise exports to nearly
4,900 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The WTO attributed this acceleration in value growth primarily
to the strong depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese
yen and many European currencies, together with the recovery of
prices of some major primary commodities.
</P>
<P>
The valuation effect of the dollar's depreciation was also a
significant factor behind the acceleration in the growth of world
trade in commercial services which are estimated to have exceeded
1,200 billion dollars in 1995, up 14 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO report, the combined value of world trade
in goods and services for 1995 broke the 6,000 billion dollar mark
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Broken down by geographical regions, Central and Eastern Europe
was the most dynamic region for trade in 1995, with export and
import values up by 25 percent and 27.5 percent respectively,
reflecting the progress made in the transition process and the
higher degree of integration of these countries with Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth consecutive year, Asia's import growth exceeded
its export growth. The value of imports rose by 23 percent last
year while exports grew by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, the value of exports grew by 21.5 percent
while imports rose by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Africa and the Middle East recorded their best trade
performances in recent years with their values of exports expanded
by 14 percent and 12.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in GDP growth in North America and Latin America
last year resulted in those two regions being the only ones to
record a slowdown in import growth relative to 1994.
</P>
<P>
In case of Latin America, the deceleration is due to the
absolute decline in Mexico's and Argentina's imports. Excluding
these two countries, Latin America's import growth accelerated at
a rate above the global average.

<HEADLINE> Mass. House Speaker Pleads Guilty to Tax Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of the
Massachusetts House agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to federal
tax evasion for filing phony expenses and lying under oath about
them.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Donald Sterner said Charles Flaherty also
admitted to the State Ethics Commission that he received free
vacation lodging from lobbyists and business executives.
</P>
<P>
Flaherty will spend two years on probation. If he had been
imprisoned, state law would have forced him to give up his office.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Flaherty admits that he lied under oath and submitted
bogus diaries and meal receipts to the IRS as part of a scheme to
cheat on taxes," the Associated Press quoted Stern as saying.
</P>
<P>
Governor William F. Weld said it was up to House members
whether Flaherty remains as speaker, and up to voters whether he
stays in the House.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of today's agreement, Flaherty agreed to plead
guilty to a felony tax charge, pay 24,200 dollars in criminal and
civil penalties and serve two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
Flaherty will also pay an additional 26,000 dollars in fines to
the State Ethics Commission as a penalty for receiving about
13,175 dollars in illegal gratuities from lobbyists and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The ethics charges stem from Flaherty's free use of vacation
homes on 62 days between July 1990 and August 1992.
</P>
<P>
Flaherty, 57, was first elected to the House in 1966 and was
chosen speaker in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities said that after Flaherty's 1983 income tax
return was audited, he submitted a false affidavit and an altered
diary in support of expenses he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Based on the bogus information, the IRS reduced his tax
liability and saved him at least 8,400 dollars in taxes, interest
and penalties, the government said.

<HEADLINE> Resumption Of Water Supply In Luanda Needs Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The supply of water in the
Angolan capital Luanda could not be resumed within at least eight
days, the Luanda provincial governor Justino Fernandes said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes was speaking to the press on the water shortage
problem in Luanda. He said that the government was short of money
to buy materials so a period of time was needed to completely get
rid of water shortage in the Angolan capital.
</P>
<P>
It is the 10th day today that water supply in Luanda has
suspended. Such a suspension of water supply resulted from the
cut-off of power supply to the water plant in the suburbs as
large rain fell down two high-voltage power supply towers.

LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. fact-finding mission to
Nigeria is expected to arrive on march 28 or Thursday, according
to a source close to the Nigerian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The UN mission is to investigate the November 10, 1995
execution of nine Ogoni activists for murder in south Nigeria and
appraise the steps taken by the Nigerian military government to
return the country to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of UN Secretary-General Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali,

partly at the request of the Nigerian government and partly, in
fulfilment of the mandate entrusted to the secretary-general by
UN resolution.

The UN team includes Koffi Amega, a former Togolese Minister
of Foreign Affairs, who is also a member of the African
Commission of Human and Peoples' Rights, and Justice V. S.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mutual Fund Assets Exceed 3 Trillion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Mutual fund assets across the
United States topped 3 trillion U.S. dollars in February -- almost
equaling bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Investment Company Institute
(ICI), a major mutual funds' trade group, funds had 3.01 trillion
U.S. dollars February 29, against 3.02 trillion U.S. dollars in
commercial banks. Mutual fund assets now equal more than 40
percent of 1995's 7.4 trillion U.S. dollar gross domestic product,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Mutual fund is an open-end investment company that puts
shareholders' money in shares of diversified companies, thus
lowers the degree of risk of investors. Some analysts said the
steadily rising of the New York Stock Exchange was partly assisted
by the influx of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
Mutual fund assets hit 2 trillion U.S. dollars in October 1993,
the group said. Half the gain since then came from share price
gains and reinvested dividends, half is new investment.
</P>
<P>
Investors poured 21.9 billion U.S. dollars into stock mutual
funds in February, compared with a record 28.9 billion U.S.
dollars in January, the ICI said. But the flood of new money ebbed
in March.

JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today held talks with Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi on the eve of a planned Zulu March on
Thursday to commemorate the 1994 Shell House massacre.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Presidential Spokesman
Joel Netshitenzhe confirmed the meeting had taken place, but
would not reveal the content of the talks between Mandela and
Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Buthelezi's office also remained tight-lipped
about the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said on Tuesday that the government could not continue
to tolerate demonstrations that threatened innocent lives and
that "very effective precautions" would be taken to ensure there
will not be a repeat of the 1994 bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, 1994 nine Inkatha supporters were shot dead by
African National Congress (ANC) security guards when they marched
past the ANC Shell House headquarters in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the march said Zulu protesters would defy the
recent government ban on the carrying of dangerous weapons in
public and would take to the streets of Johannesburg with their
full array of cultural weapons on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says U.S. Economy on A Sounder Footing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that the U.S. economy appears
on a sounder footing than just a month ago with good prospects for
continued growth and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Making remarks before the Budget Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Greenspan said "although not all of the
uncertainties have been resolved, recent data have confirmed the
expectation that a good bit of the economic sluggishness of late
1995 was related to inventory investment," describing an increase
of unsold goods that prompted production cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
But he said recent indicators point to the hopeful development
that business cutbacks in inventories are coming to an end,
meaning that production will start growing again.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted various reports showing increases in sales of
autos and other retail goods, a good gain in housing construction
and advances in spending for business investment.
</P>
<P>
He also noted February's startling 705,000-increase in payroll
jobs but cautioned that the biggest payroll increase in about 13
years almost certainly exaggerated the current strength in the
labor market.
</P>
<P>
"But even so, the current economic expansion seems to have
exhibited staying power" while developments on the inflation front
have been "reasonably encouraging", he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Senate Banking Committee hearing on his renomination
as Fed chairman for the third term yesterday, Greenspan also made
more optimistic comments on the economy than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"The economy seems at this stage to be running at a reasonably
good clip," he said. But on February 20, Greenspan, worried about
a "dismal" start to the year, said that the U.S. economy was
"basically on track for sustained growth".
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee, U.S. Fed's policy-making
panel, concluded its meeting on March 26 without announcing any
changes in the short-term rates.

<HEADLINE> (News Analysis) Turin Summit to Offer Opportunity to  Shape Europe's Future  (By Ming Dajun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The 15 heads of government of the
European Union will gather here on Friday in a refurbished factory
for the ceremonial launch of the inter-governmental conference
which should negotiate for a revision of the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
According to senior EU officials, the focus of the one-day
summit will be on trying to change the way the EU makes decisions
and setting the agenda for the inter-governmental conference which
is going to last at least 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The inter-governmental conference will review the operation of
the 1991 Maastricht treaty, signed after the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has billed, in its Commission Opinion
released lately, the conference as the last and only opportunity
for its member states to reflect together about how the Union is
to function in a wider framework.
</P>
<P>
Two issues are likely to be central to the discussions at the
inter-governmental conference. The first is whether to anticipate
the impact of monetary union and enlargement by planning
far-reaching changes in decision-making and institutions, the
other is how to effect any changes that are necessary without
damaging the interests and rights of the existing members of the
EU club.
</P>
<P>
Under the present treaty on the European integration, trade
negotiations are carried out by the European Commission and are
subject to approval by a sufficiently large "qualified majority of
member governments, foreign and security policy is the preserve of
governments, represented in the Council of Ministers, which
invariably prefers to act by unanimity and is required by the
Maastricht treaty to give the commission only a minor,
"associated" role.
</P>
<P>
Endymion Wilkinson, EU ambassador to China, said in a recent
exclusive interview with Xinhua that The EU is expected to expand
its member states from 15 to 20 by the end of this century.
Because of its scope and its diversity, this enlargement will be
different from previous ones, an extended Europe is bound to be
more heterogeneous and therefore more complex, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is obliged and wishes to enlarge the number of member
states. In order to do so we have to change the way in which
decisions are made," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador revealed that the EU Commission would propose to
the summit which subjects should be decided by consensus, which by
qualified majority and which by unanimous agreement.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl's prescriptions for the change
of the EU decision-making are a stronger European parliament to
act as a democratic counterweight to the decision-taking Council
of Ministers. He wants more majority voting as a matter of
principle to pave the way for enlargement to central and eastern
Europe, Germany's strategic imperative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany has insisted reducing national veto rights,
giving the European Commission a role in proposing changes, and
creating new legal instruments to replace cumbersome international
conventions which take years to ratify.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain takes a fundamentally different view of
European integration. The British attitude towards reforming
decision-making is minimalist - as is the government's general
approach to the conference. British prime minister John Major's
goal is containment. No extension of majority voting, no new
powers for the European Parliament, no more EU-wide areas of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
In the conference negotiations, much is likely to depend on
French president Jacques Chirac. France, as the core-nation of the
European integration, has long been partner of Germany on many
issues of European unity. However, in fear of Germans' overruling
over the EU, Chirac may stand on the side of Major on this issue
so as to placate Eurosceptics in his own party.
</P>
<P>
Friday's summit is allegedly to be a historic opportunity to
shape Europe's future for the 21th Century, but the outcome is
believed to be less momentous.
</P>
<P>
EU president Jacque Santer has European leaders urged to use
their political will to forge consensus at the summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
has repeated his call on the international community to make good
their pledges to Liberia's peace process so as to return life to
normalcy in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a meeting with OAU Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim in capital Accra on Tuesday, Rawlings blamed the
difficulties in implementing the Abuja peace agreement on serious
logistics constraints.
</P>
<P>
"If logistics support had come in time, we would not have lost
the momentum," Rawlings was quoted by a report today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The encampment and disarmament of some 60,000 fighters of
Liberia's armed factions have all fallen behind schedule set
under the Abuja peace accord signed by all parties to the
Liberian conflict last August.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the Organization of African Unity (OAU) appreciated
the efforts of West African countries to achieve permanent and
lasting peace in Liberia because "what happens in West Africa has
a bearing on the rest of Africa."
</P>
<P>
Salim is in Accra as part of a visit to countries involved in
Liberia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will also visit Monrovia for talks with aid agencies and
the Liberian interim government.

JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Senior government officials
and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) today squared up over carrying
dangerous weapons at the planned Zulu march through the city
center here on Thursday, the second anniversary of the Shell
House massacre.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
met on the eve of the Zulu demonstration, Presidential Spokesman
Joel Netshitenzhe said without disclosing the content of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Buthelezi's office also remained tight-lipped.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, 1994 nine Inkatha supporters were shot dead by
the African National Congress (ANC) security members when they
marched past the ANC Shell House headquarters in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people were killed in other incidents of violence
in and around Johannesburg that day.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi last week
announced a ban on the display and possession of dangerous
weapons including spears and pangas.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Zulu marchers would defy the government's
newly-imposed ban on carrying dangerous weapons in public and
would take to the streets of Johannesburg with their full array
of cultural weapons on Thursday when they commemorate the Shell
House killing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Gauteng's provincial Police Commissioner
Sharma Maharaj announced that Zulu protesters would be prevented
from marching if any were armed with the dangerous weapons listed
by the government proclamation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gauteng's Provincial Minister for Safety and
Security Jessie Duarte warned that the march could proceed only
if protesters obeyed all the country's laws, including the
weapons prohibition.
</P>
<P>
The march would not be allowed to continue if there weapons
were in the possession of any of the marchers, said Duarte,
adding the police were obliged to apply the laws of the country
strictly to the letter.
</P>
<P>
However, IFP Chairman and Kwazulu/Natal provincial government
Premier Frank Mdlalose said in Durban that enforcing the weapons
ban could cause chaos.
</P>
<P>
"There will be chaos, violence will start," said Mdlalose,
adding the ban was unfair and impractical.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Unveil Chechen Peace Plan on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will unveil his plan to settle the Chechen crisis in a TV address
on Sunday night, a well-informed Kremlin source said today.
</P>
<P>
The address to the nation will begin at 19:00 Moscow time (GMT
16:00) and will last for about 15 minutes, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted by both presidential and governmental
teams and approved by the decision-making Russian Security Council
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Yeltsin will focus on a complex of
problems on which the prompt settlement of the Chechen crisis is
contingent.
</P>
<P>
Among the specific proposals which the Russian leader is
believed likely to put forward, the source cited the completion of
the drafting of a treaty on power sharing between Chechnya and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will emphasize the need to continue talks with
representatives of Chechen elders, rebel field commanders and
spiritual leaders, the source said, adding that this will be done
in order to create "stable islands of peace" on the line of
engagement between Russian troops and armed Chechen rebels loyal
to separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is also expected to comment on the use of force against
"the irreconcilable (rebels)," the source said, noting that these
tough measures will be part of the plan to settle the Chechen
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Russian troops have intensified military
operations to wipe out the Chechen militants in the breakaway
republic.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Bois Yeltsin told
his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma today that he will visit
Ukraine on April 4-5 as scheduled, the Kremlin sources said tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation earlier today, Yeltsin and Kuchma
confirmed that the Russian President's Kiev trip will take place
at the time set previously, denying earlier rumors that the visit
may be postponed because of some differences over the Black Sea
Fleet division.
</P>
<P>
The rumor came following the meeting of Russian and Ukrainian
Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yevgeny Marchuk in Moscow
on Tuesday. They reportedly failed to resolve all the remaining
issues connected with the Black Sea Fleet dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian media have reported that Yeltsin's visit scheduled
for April 4-5 may be postponed.
</P>
<P>
In response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krylov told
reporters here that the planned friendship and cooperation treaty
has been drafted and can be signed, although differences over the
Black Sea Fleet remain.
</P>
<P>
"One meeting is enough to resolve the outstanding issues if
both sides want this," he said, adding that the treaty and other
documents have to be signed as a package.

states to join hands to check and contain the prospective hazards
resulting from the Israeli nuclear leak which constitutes grave
dangers to the lives and the very existence of the peoples of the

time when the Dimona reactor's potential life has expired while
the reactor itself is not subject to international inspection or
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
According to Syrian official sources, the nuclear leak will
affect the neighboring Arab states, hence, the need for Arab
coordination within the framework of the League of Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The objective of Arab coordination, the sources added, is to
mobilize public opinion with a view to exerting pressure on Israel
to place its nuclear establishments under the supervision and
guarantees of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
It is to table this issue for discussion by international
organizations and the United Nations to underline the dangers of
Israel's possession of a nuclear reactor and nuclear arms. It also
aims at persuading Israel to accede to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), especially that Israel possesses
more than 110 nuclear warheads that may be launched by rockets, an
impending threat to the whole region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not admitted the possession of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syria has renewed its call for the establishment of
a just and comprehensive peace in the region. It has also
supported the call made by the European Union to declare the
Middle East and the Mediterranean basin an area free of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here are of the opinion that the coming
phase will witness an intensive Arab diplomatic drive against
Israeli nuclear weapons and the danger they pose to the region.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Syrian president's call for action has coincided
with similar calls made by Egypt and the Arab League. Despite
Israel's failure to admit having nuclear weapons, an intensive
Arab diplomatic drive will certainly prompt fresh calculations in
the region.
</P>
<P>
A report by Israeli TV Sunday, warning of the hazards of a leak
at Israel's Negev Desert Dimona nuclear reactor, built with French
assistance during the 1960s, stirred an uproar in Israel and its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The report said huge containers of nuclear waste have been
buried in the Negev Desert for the past 30 years. Nuclear experts
who worked on the reactor warned that any earthquake in the region
could cause a deadly leak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Palestine and some parts of Saudi Arabia
have been hit by a series of mild earthquakes recently.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the danger to the entire region, an Egyptian
Foreign Ministry official said Cairo was anxiously following up
the report. "This issue will not be left without a proper
solution," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Time for Me to Go, Says Liebenberg </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- "I believe now is the right
time for me to leave," finance minister Chris Liebenberg said in
his farewell speech in parliament this evening.
</P>
<P>
"I came in here with the view that it should not be long
term," said Liebenberg.
</P>
<P>
In a special address to parliament earlier in the day,
President Nelson Mandela announced a major cabinet reshuffle,
including the resignation of Liebenberg and dismissal of Posts
and Telecommunications Minister Pallo Jordan.
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the interim constitution had been made
specially for liebenberg, who was not elected to parliament, to
take up the cabinet post in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Liebenberg thanked Mandela for giving him the
opportunity to serve under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg said as the infrastructure for transition is in
place, he has total confidence in the government and its ability
to see through the process which has been initiated.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing on the horizon to derail the process of
structural and institutional change which has been initiated, he
said, adding South Africa has a "window of opportunity" to make a
difference in Africa and a responsibility toward Southern Africa
in particular.
</P>
<P>
The minister of finance could do very little if he did not
have the support of others, he said, hinting this was the reason
he wanted to resign.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg would be replaced by Trade and Industry Minister
Trevor Manuel from April 4.
