<HEADLINE> Foreign-Born Population climbs in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The population in New York City
slightly decreased in the first half of the 1990's, but its
structure changed a lot with enormous number of native-born people
moving out of the city and foreign-born population increasing.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau figures released Friday show that New York
City's population decreased to 7,312,076 by last July 1 from
7,322,564 on April 1, 1990. While about 300,000 more people left
the city than moved to it, natural increase made up nearly all the
difference as the rate of births exceeded the rate of deaths.
</P>
<P>
However, during the period, more than 700,000 people moved out
of the city, about one tenth of the city's whole population. But
against the loss, foreign-born people contributed a net growth of
460,000 in the five years, filling much of the gap.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the city has been constantly remade by
immigration, with native-born people leaving the city for other
parts of the country, but the trend appeared to have accelerated
in the early 1990's, experts said .
</P>
<P>
The trend has brought changes in the city's culture and
economy.
</P>
<P>
"What we've found is that the domestic migrants out are
better-educated and higher-income than average," The New York
Times said, quoting Andrew Beveridge, professor of sociology at
Queens College. "This is a very significant trend, in that it
creates much more of a foreign city and a poorer city."

<HEADLINE> British Defense Secretary Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 9 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
Michael Portillo arrives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, late today on a
three-day visit for talks on joint defense issues with Second
Deputy Prime minister and Defense and Aviation Minister Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
British Embassy sources told Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) that
Portillo, who will also hold talks with other saudi officials,
will consider joint defense plans.
</P>
<P>
The embassy sources denied the talks would cover the purchase
of challenger tanks, one of the most sophisticated tanks in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Saudi Arabia have strong political, economic and
defense ties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also members of a defense cooperation
program known as Al-Yamama concluded in 1985.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, Britain supplied Saudi Arabia with 14
million pounds sterling worth of advanced military equipment over
two stages, the first in 1985 and the second in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The program also stipulates that Britain invests 1.6 billion
dollars in strategic projects in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already supplied a 100 million pounds sterling
worth of pharmaceutical factory which already began production in
Jeddah and another project for the manufacture of aircraft spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
As part of the project Saudi Arabia also received an advanced
mine sweeper from Britain and was expected to receive two others
during this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also signed an agreement last November
for the supply of two mine detectors to the Saudi Navy which will
ensure the safety of navigation in the regional waters and ports.
</P>
<P>
Britain will train crews for these ships.

<HEADLINE> Theft, Embezzlement Brings Ethiopian Hotels Enterprise To Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Workers of the ethiopian
hotels enterprise have voiced concern over existing
misappropriation of public funds and theft of equipment in
various hotels, the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian hotels enterprise, which administers eight
hotels including the Harambe Hotel and the Sky Restaurant, has
650 employees.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held yesterday to discuss the issue, the
workers blamed the management for failing to timely control the
embezzlement and properly managing the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Repeated theft of hotel equipment and misappropriation of
public fund have weakened the financial position of the
enterprise and thereby endangered the very existance of the
organization, the workers said.
</P>
<P>
Several cooking and food catering equipment were plundered,
the workers said, adding that the recent disappearance of
alcholic drinks amounting to 200,000 Birr (about 31,000 US
Dollars) from the Harambe hotel was a testimony to the fragility
of the management.
</P>
<P>
The workers said despite repeated reports about the
seriousness of the matter, no positive responses have so far been
made by the management.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Board Chairman of the enterprise
Eesera Kifetew said prompt measures would be taken after serious
investigation. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The first Conference of
African Ministers on Development and Environment ended here today
after calling for adopting four resolutions to back up protection
of environment and promotion of development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Four resolutions to this effect were adopted at the two day
meeting attended by ministers of 40 African countries or their
representatives with the presence of delegates from United
Nations agencies and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on "Implementation of Agenda 21" urged African
countries "to carry out continuous monitoring and evaluation as
an integral part of the activities of their national agenda 21
programs and establish a national database for such a purpose."
</P>
<P>
It also urged the African ministerial conference on
environment "to continue to promote all activities related to
capacity building and environmental monitoring, particularly the
establishment of national geographic information systems for that
purpose."
</P>
<P>
The "Resolution on Human Settlement" requested "member states
of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) to make human
settlements a development priority and to mobilize resources for
the formulation and pursuit of human settlements policy with a
view to reducing the imbalance between rural and urban areas."
</P>
<P>
It urged African countries to reflect the African common
position adopted at Johannesburg in October 1995 on the draft
habitat agenda in the documentation of the Istanbul conference."

<HEADLINE> Canada Won't Accept Aiming Anti-Cuba Bill at Its Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
has said that the U.S. anti-Cuba legislation is "completely
unacceptable" because it is the extraterritorial application of U.S.
law to foreign business operations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Helms-Burton bill, aimed at tightening the embargo against
Cuba, won legislative approval this week and President Bill Clinton
has said he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
The bill purports to give U.S. courts jurisdiction to try lawsuits
launched against foreign companies whose business dealings in Cuba
involve properties expropriated by the Cuba government. It could leave
Canadian companies with Cuban operations vulnerable to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislation "violates the rules of the new World Trade
Organization and the North American Free-trade Agreement", Chretien
said Friday in an interview broadcast on CTV's Canada AM. Canada will
not accept it, the prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, Russia and most European countries have also expressed
their strong opposition to the U.S. legislation.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said the anti-Cuba bill is the product of the political
silly season in the United States and it is always difficult for
foreigners to avoid getting hurt by domestic U.S. politics in a
presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the Canadian prime minister also slashed U.S.
Senator Jesse Helms, who said earlier this week that Canadians should
be ashamed of themselves for being appeasers of Hitler. Helms,
chairman of the U.S. Senate foreign relations committee, is the
co-sponsor of the anti-Cuba bill.
</P>
<P>
Canadians were battling Hitler's Nazis in 1939, two years before
the United States entered the Second World War, Chretien noted. Canada
was three years ahead of the U.S. in entering the First World War.
</P>
<P>
"Helms has nothing to teach Canada about the history of who stands
up to tyrants," Chretien said, adding that if the U.S. senator wants
to talk about appeasement of dictators, he might start by explaining
U.S. support for Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
Batista's regime was toppled in 1959 by a revolution led by Fidel
Castro.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda To Contest Zambian Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua)-- President of Zambia's biggest
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) Kenneth
Kaunda declared here today he would challenge President Frederick
Chiluba during the presidential elections late this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a huge rally in downtown Lusaka, Kaunda said
regardless of what the ruling party and its government would do
to bar him from contesting the presidential race, he would
challege President Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he was a Zambian citizen who could not be barred
from contesting the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"Only the people of Zambia will reject me as president not a
gang of thugs with selfish minds," stressed Kaunda, who is also
former Zambian president.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft constitution likely to be adopted by
parliament some time this year, Kaunda is not qualified for
presidential candidate because his father is Malawian citizen.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 27 years, was defeated in the
1991 presidential elections. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Former Foreign Minister
Hikmet Cetin said in Istanbul that the hijacking of the
Turkish-Cypriot Airline Boeing 727 passenger plane was not
beneficial to the solution to the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish waiter hijacked the passenger plane for the flight
between Nicosia and Istanbul which carried eight crew and 101
passengers including 18 foreigners when it took off from the Ercan
Airport in Northern Cyprus Friday night.
</P>
<P>
After surrendering to the police in Munich, Germany, the
hijacker said that his hijacking was aimed at drawing attention
of the world opinion to the Chechen Issue.
</P>
<P>
Cetin said that the hijacking would only create trouble for
Turkey which is very concerned about the Chechen issue and is
seeking a peaceful and democratic solution to it.
</P>
<P>
The plane hijacked by the 21-year-old man first stopped in
Sofia, bulgaria, for refueling, then flew to Germany, and landed
at Munich Airport.
</P>
<P>
German authorities immediately took measures to surround the
hijacked passenger plane and made close contacts with the Turkish
diplomats in Germany for the resolution to the hijacking incident.
</P>
<P>
Through six hours of talks between the hijacker and the German
officials, the hijacking incident ended peacefully earlier this
morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Eleven pro-democracy groups
in Swaziland have formed a loose alliance following landmark
talks earlier this week, the South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement released today in Mbabane,
capital of Swaziland, the United Front came after the talks
between parties at the Kwaluseni campus of the University of
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The alliance had been formed to ensure the democratisation
process in Swaziland was not reversed, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The new organisation included the main pro-democracy groups of
the kingdom, such as the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions,
which called a nationwide strike in January that paralysed the
mountain kingdom for a week.
</P>
<P>
These groups had been operating openly in defiance of the
23-year-old ban on political parties.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland Deputy Prime Minister Sishayi Khumalo yesterday
announced that the process of drafting a new constitution had now
begun and a constitutional review council was to be formed soon.
</P>
<P>
All organisations, including unrecognised political groups,
would be invited to send a representative to the council.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland King Mswati iii had also ordered cabinet ministers
to make preparations for a proposed national constitutional
forum, which would negotiate changes to the constitution
suspended by his father late King Sobhuza in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, the only southern African country where all
political activities are banned by a royal decree, is a small
land-locked country surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Terrorism Summit Doomed to Failure: Lebanese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul was quoted tonight by the Central News Agency as saying
that a world anti-terrorism summit to be held in Egypt next week
is doomed to failure since it is aimed at "satisfying Israel."
</P>
<P>
Dalloul described the anti-terrorism summit, which was called
by the United States and is to be held at Sharm El Sheikh
Wednesday, as a "astonishing strange summit."
</P>
<P>
Credible well-informed sources reported that Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi received Friday an invitation to the approaching
world summit and has not made a decision on the participation, but
the report has not been confirmed by the government.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts see a crucial role of Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon, in determining a Lebanese participation in the
conference, which is expected to be attended by heads of state or
government from more than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
In a dialogue with local residents in Bekaa valley last
evening, the pro-Syrian defense minister wondered whether those
carrying weapons for a liberation of their land are terrorists as
what has been claimed, when those occupying the land are against
the terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Israel which will attend the summit is occupying Arab land in
South Lebanon, Western Bekaa and Golan, how does the
international community classify it?" Dalloul asked.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as Israel refuses to implement
resolutions of the (U.N.) Security Council, and refuses to
respond to the international community, it remains a terrorist,
and a "aggressive country."
</P>
<P>
"From here," he added, "the conference is doomed to failure
and bankruptcy since it wants to satisfy Israel, which is a
spoiled child of the new world order and the West."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the anti-terrorism summit will not eliminate
the spirit of martyrdom and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
On whether a deployment of American forces in Jordan is for
pressuring Syria and Lebanon, the Lebanese minister said,
"Regardless the pressure, we are persisting in our rights and our
positions, and there will no peace in the region without us."
</P>
<P>
"Because of their spoiling for the Israeli entity which
commits agressions against our land, our rights and our people,
the Americans can not exert pressure upon us," the defense
minister pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today fired Jibril Rajoub, chief of the
Palestinian Prevention Security Forces, according to an Israel
Radio report.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that the move came after Rajoub's
refusal of PNA orders to arrest the leading members of the
Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)'s military wing
Izzedine Qassam.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Husseini Sheikh, PNA security chief in
the West Bank town of Ramallah, has been appointed to replace
Rajoub, whose brother is known as a leading Hamas member in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
No comment was available at the movement from Rajoub, or
officials from the office of PNA president Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two more leading Hamas members were arrested today
by the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
following the recent suicide bombing attacks in Israel, which
were carried out by the Izzedine Qassam and had left more than 50
dead and over 150 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A list of wanted Islamic extremists has been given by Israel to
Arafat, and Israeli officials said that Israel is waiting for the
arrest of those men.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Six Malawian policemen had been
suspended after 17 criminal suspects suffocated in an overcrowded
Lilongwe prison, a police chief revealed in Malawi's capital
today.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Police Inspector-General Patrick Chikapa said 16
prisoners died on Tuesday after being crammed into cells in the
capital Lilongwe and another died in hospital later, according to
reports from that country.
</P>
<P>
The postmortem results revealed that they died as a result of
suffocation, Chikapa said, adding "I seem to have seen a strong
element of negligence of duty."
</P>
<P>
The six policemen, including the officer in charge at the
police station and his deputy, had been suspended pending the
outcome of investigations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Malawian President Bakili Muluzi on Friday appointed a

<HEADLINE> Europeans, Asians into Nine-ball World Challenge Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A strong European team and a
persistent Asian side entered the final of the Nine-Ball Pool
World Challenge here tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a confrontation called by local media as "Europeans against
the rest of the world," snooker king Steve Davis of Britain led
the assault on the title with the help of compatriot Jimmy White
and Germany's 9-ball world champion Oliver Ortmann.
</P>
<P>
Davis, 38, six-time world snooker champion and winner of 70
major international titles, was the team captain.
</P>
<P>
White, 23, six-time finalist in world championships and ranked
12th in the world, is known as "whirlwind" for his swift and
aggressive play.
</P>
<P>
And it was Ortmann who scored the most individual wins for the
team before it qualified for the final.
</P>
<P>
Their Asian counterparts are nothing easy as team captain Efren
Reyes led all the three other team members in the victory of the
inaugural world Billiards Championships in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The United States team is led by 54-year-old veteran Dallas
West, the American ace and fourth-ranked player in the world.
Also in the team are ark Wilson, runner-up in 9-ball world
championships, and 9-ball experts C.J. Willey and Earl Strickland.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary rounds Friday and semi-finals this afternoon
were all conducted in doubles and the final is of individual
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Asian team collected a total of 11 points in the
semi-finals and the Europeans were one point behind. The
Americans with only seven were thus eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The team with any of its players collecting 16 points first win
the event and the top prize of 30,000 US dollars and the
runners-up are to take 10,000 US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Life Standstill in Pakistan During Cricket Match with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Life came to a grinding halt in
Pakistan today as the two traditional rivals, Pakistan and India,
confronted each other in the quarter-final of World Cup Cricket
tournament at Bangalore of India.
</P>
<P>
Cricket mania swept across the nation forcing all to remain
glued to their radio and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
People rushed back to their homes or to a place where they
could watch TV live broadcasting or at least hear the radio
commentary after work.
</P>
<P>
Traffic gradually decreased and by evening only a scattered
vehicles could be seen on the roads.
</P>
<P>
In this Muslim country, those with a religious faith knelt to
pray for a win, even those not so religious had little option but
to pray for the success of the Pakistani cricket team.
</P>
<P>
As the defending champion, Pakistan is having a tough target of
288 runs to win over this evening.
</P>
<P>
Before the match, both Pakistan and Indian teams expressed
their confidence to win over the rival.
</P>
<P>
Though the shops were open, neither the shopkeepers nor the
customers were interested in business.
</P>
<P>
"What's the score?" was the question of the day and even those
not interested in the game had little to do but to remain in touch
with the latest in the game.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly no issue in life seemed to be worth the trouble and
the only sound heard across the country was the commentary from
the radio and TVs.
</P>
<P>
The public places remained empty of the usual Saturday crowd
and the entire atmosphere reflected a strange tranquillity, broken
only by cheers and sighs.
</P>
<P>
Many tried their luck by betting on who will win and maintained
the high tempo of the game.
</P>
<P>
In the other quarter-final match held in Faisalabad of
Pakistan, Sri Lanka beat England comfortably by 5 wickets.
</P>
<P>
However, only 500 tickets out of 18,000 for this match were
sold out until Friday as Pakistanis wanted to watch nothing but
the game between their team and India's.

<HEADLINE> K-50 Airport Near Somali Capital Calm But Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISH, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The K-50 airstrip near the
Somali capital was calm but tense today despite yesterday's
fierce fighting between the opposing militiamen of faction
leaders Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Narcotic leaves imported from neighboring Kenya are arriving
as usual while the militia forces still remain in their defense
positions.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed and seven others wounded in
yesterday's fighting, in which both heavy and small machine guns,
rocket propelled grenades and 106 mm recoilless rifles were used.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out when the Aidid administration attempted
to relocate some militia brigades who have long been stationed at
the airstrip. Each group was set not to loose the control of the
lucrative airfield.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness at the airstrip, the fighting followed
a serious quarrel between the militia leaders over the transfer
issue.
</P>
<P>
The shooting stopped after clan militia elders intervened in
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
It seems that General Aidid will retreat from his decision of
changing the militiamen at the airport for the smooth running of
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Every day, a dozen of small airplanes carrying the narcotic
leaves land at the airfield, the busiest of all the dusty
airstrips in Somalia. More than 100 militiamen are constantly
stationed there to safeguard what they call the governmental
taxation programs imposed by General Aidid in July last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. weapons inspection team of
about 25 officers were allowed access to the building of Iraq's
Ministry of Irrigation today after nearly a 17-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that they saw the last two jeeps of the U.N.
Special Commission on scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
(UNSCOM) were driven into the gate leading to the courtyard of the
building at 3:40 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
No details are available for the U.N. team's activity inside
the building where it is reported that information related to
Iraq's weapons programs remain.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the Iraqi government and the
U.N. inspection team started at 9 p.m. Friday when the team was
carrying out one of its night inspection missions. The
U.N. inspectors stayed in their vehicles surrounding the ministry
building overnight.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source said that the head of the inspection team,

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Ends 16-day Voyage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Shuttle Columbia today wound up
a 16-day voyage marred by the loss of a tethered satellite,
landing at the Kennedy Space Center after a one day delay.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of a break in the clouds, Columbia touched
down the runway at 8:58 EST (1358GMT) without its main payloads, a
100 million U.S. dollar Italian-built satellite which was lost on
February 25 when its 20.8 kilometers of tether broke.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hoped to testify their theory that tether satellite
can generate electricity and could be used someday to provide
power and lift to space station.
</P>
<P>
Despite the satellite's loss, scientists were able to salvage
the mission by conducting surveys of the ionosphere and the
Earth's magnetic fields with the free-flier until its batteries
were used up. Now the satellite had become an expensive space
junk and would reenter atmosphere about two weeks later and burn
out.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts also conducted 25 combustion experiments,
setting fire to small pieces of paper, insulated wires and other
materials to study how flames move and spread in weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
Columbia's crew included four astronauts who had attended the
first tethered satellite experiment aboard Shuttle Atlantis in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The next shuttle flight, scheduled to begin on March 21, is
Atlantis' third visit to Russia's Mir space station.

<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today initiated discussions with the ruling party and the
opposition for resolving the country's prolonged political
impasse.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, the president firstly talked
to Sheikh Hasina, president of the largest opposition party -- the
Awami (People's) League, over phone and discussed matters relating
to resolution of the political stalemate through mutual dialogues
among the leading political parties and groups.
</P>
<P>
He also talked to Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, joint secretary general

parties on the issue of the formation of a non-party caretaker
government to hold the next general elections in a bid to meet the
opposition demand to resolve the country's prolonged political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an instant reaction to the prime minister's fresh move, the
opposition parties have described the move as "good sense" and
"good gesture" although they "are not budging an inch from our
basic demands -- resignation of the prime minister and scrapping
of the February 15 farcical polls" held by the BNP despite all
opposition parties' boycott.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in Grozny, but in Less Intensity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite Russian officials' claims
that they have controlled Grozny again after Chechen guerrillas'
surprise raid and capture of parts of the regional capital
Wednesday, fighting raged for the fourth day between Russian
troops and Chechen rebels in central Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The boom of Russian tank fire and powerful shelling could be
heard in downtown Grozny near the building of the Russian
administration. Automatic weapons fire also crackled throughout
the night and into the morning, ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke was seen spewing out near a burning big shop in the
city center, apparently from an oil refinery in the northern
outskirts, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
But Russian officials insisted they were rolling back the
Chechen assault.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, General Viacheslav
Tikhomirov, said late Friday that Russian forces "completely
controlled the situation in Grozny" although there remained "a
little cleaning up work."
</P>
<P>
He said rebel activity had "noticeably diminished" compared
with previous days, and "shooting in the city had practically
stopped" by 9:30 p.m. (1830 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Most pro-Dudayev Chechen rebels have pulled out of Grozny, he
said, and only small groups of gunmen were left for sporadic
ambushes from the hidings of rubble buildings.
</P>
<P>
The government forces had recaptured the central Minutka
district from the Chechens early Saturday, as well as command
posts in the Leninsky, Oktyabrsky and Staropromyslovsky areas, the
commander was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the southern Chernorechye district remained under rebel
control, he said, while "suspicious " people were on the move in
the northwestern suburbs of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Local TV reported that the rebels were holding at least 200
hostages, mostly immigrant workers from Russia hired to help
rebuild the shattered city.
</P>
<P>
Russian soldiers' casualty toll was put at 70 dead and 160
wounded, while about 40 missing until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya is an oil-rich, but tiny republic in the northern
Caucasus region that has opposed Russian rule since the 18th
Century.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus's Offshore Sector Sees Record Increase in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will
provide the necessary facilities and every possible service to
the offshore companies as part of its policy to promote the
island as an offshore business and services centre in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed by Cyprus' Interior Minister Dinos
Michaelides at an annual general meeting of the Association of
Offshore Companies, opened in Nicosia Friday, according to the
local press today.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that the offshore company sector is one of
the few sectors of the Cyprus economy that records steadily high
development rates.
</P>
<P>
According to a Central Bank report, the number of permits
issued by the Central Bank for the registration of offshore
enterprises reached the record level of 4,958 in 1995, compared
with 4,238 in 1994 and 2,893 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative number of permits issued since the start of
1976 rose to 22,216 by the end of 1995, from 17,258 and 13,020 at
the end of 1994 and 1993 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Cypriots employed by offshore enterprises
in 1995 rose to 2,170, compared to 1,990 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular development of offshore activity is reflected
in an increase of foreign currency flowing into Cyprus from this
sector, which in 1985 amounted to 30 million Cyprus pounds (about
60 million U.S. dollars) and in 1995 reached to 161.5 million
Cyprus pounds (about 323 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Michaelides noted that advanced telecommunications technology,
high quality banking and professional services, relatively low
costs, as well as Cyprus' geographical location have been the
reasons for attracting the offshore units to the island.
</P>
<P>
The Minister assured the meeting that the government would
continue to offer every possible assistance to the offshore
companies and try and enhance its good relations with the
Association of Offshore Companies.

Britain's agenda for European integration and "what we want out of
it."

He made it clear that the proposals were only intended as a
framework document to be discussed at the IGC conference, which is
aimed at reviewing the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We will not, nor should we, give away all the details of each

Meanwhile, former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit has urged the

the IGC conference.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship to Be Salvaged from Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The sunken cruiser "Chungshan"
will be salvaged on November 12, this year, on the 130th
anniversary of the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the
Chinese democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, was shut and sunk in
the Yangtze River in Wuhan October 24, 1938, after having shot
down three Japanese fighters in the War of Resistance Against
Japanese Aggression(1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
It is also connected with another historic event--"the Cruiser
Chungshan Incident"- - when Chang Kai-shek betrayed the
revolution, created the that incident and launched a surprise
attack on the Chinese Communist Party March 20, 1926.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the Chongqing Yangtze River Rescue and Salvage
Company, in charge of the salvage project, has been conducting
maritime surveys on the cruiser, which shows that its steel plates
are intact, though there are several serious damaged parts on it.
</P>
<P>
The whole project is divided into two phases, the first-phase
work completed recently did preparatory work for the second-phase
work, which will start in November and salvage the whole warship
from the river.
</P>
<P>
As many as 107 cultural relics such as shells, compass and flag
rope have been salvaged in the first-phase work.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Continue Backing Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe today said
Zimbabwe will continue to assist other countries in peaceful
resolution of conflicts and crisis situations as much as its
financial and material resources permit.
</P>
<P>
He said it is imperative that as a member of the Organization
of African Unity and the United Nations, Zimbabwe will continue
to assist other member states in times of need.
</P>
<P>
He was greeting a contingent of Zimbabwe's national army
soldiers who recently returned from a peacekeeping mission to
Angola at a function held in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city.
</P>
<P>
"International observer and peacekeeping missions will
continue to be one of the pre-occupations of defense forces
throughout the world because of the humane desire to seek
peaceful solutions to armed conflicts," said Mugabe, who is
Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwean Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was one of the countries which sent troops on similar
peacekeeping duties to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said prospects for permanent peace in Angola are
reasonably bright and praised Zimbabwean soldiers for their part
in the mission.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that you effectively executed your duties in all
these areas with professional efficiency. I personally praise and
exalt you for earning Zimbabwse such a good reputation," Mugabe
said.

<HEADLINE> UUP Leader Accepts Invitation from Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
which defends British rule over Northern Ireland, said today that
its leader David Trimble has accepted an invitation from U.S.
President Bill Clinton to attend the St Patrick's Day (Ireland's
national day) celebrations in the White House next week.
</P>
<P>
UUP's deputy leader John Taylor said in Belfast that Trimble
and other leading members of his party would have talks with
Clinton during their four-day visit in the US.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein, is
excluded from the St Patrick's Day party in the White House this
year because of the IRA's resumption of violence.
</P>
<P>
Taylor held that Adam's exclusion from the White House party
this year is a sign of Sinn Fein's growing isolation and this is
"a dramatic turn of events".
</P>
<P>
He maintained that this was a sign that London, Dublin and
Washington had all come to the same conclusion that the IRA and
Sinn Fein were about or had already given up attempts to reach a
negotiated settlement in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here today, US Senator Edward Kennedy, one
of Sinn Fein's most loyal Irish-American sponsors, has also
refused to meet Adams next week when the Sinn Fein leader arrives
in the US for St Patrick's Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's change of heart is a heavy blow for Admas because
Kennedy strongly lobbied Clinton to grant Adams a visa to visit
Washington last year and raise funds for Sinn Fein, commented the
Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, another supporter of Adams'
original visa, has urged the White House not to let the Sinn Fein
leader back into the US at all.
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, Sinn Fein was not invited to attend this weekend's
annual conference of the ruling Fine Gael Party led by Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton.
</P>
<P>
Bruton told a delegates' session of his party on Friday night
that the Irish and British governments would press ahead with
plans to hold all-party negotiations on the future of Northern
Ireland on June 10, but Sinn Fein would be excluded because of IRA
violence.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Adams could only be treated like the head of
any other Ulster political party when the IRA restores its
ceasefire.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Taiwanese journalists are to be
expelled on Sunday (March 10) after being caught by China's local
public security while illegally videotaping military targets.
</P>
<P>
News reporter Sui An-teh and cameraman Chuang Chi-wei of the
Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV) were caught on 18:30 Thursday
by Fuqing Municipal Public Security personnel while illegally
shooting video of military targets in a military exercise area.
</P>
<P>
Public security personnel collected some evidence against the
journalists on the spot.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the public security department shows that
the two journalists entered Fujian province and illegally shot
video of the military exercise in the coast, under TTV
instructions, after arriving in Beijing, in the name of covering
the annual sessions of China's National People's Congress, and the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
What the Taiwanese journalists did has violated articles of
China's State Security Law and regulations which cover mainland
residents visiting Taiwan and Taiwan residents visiting the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Chinese public security personnel have conducted an
investigation and interviewed the journalists, confiscated the
tools of the offense and video tapes.
</P>
<P>
The two Taiwanese journalists later confessed to stealing
military secrets, and they wrote a statement of repentance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tire Magnate Taylor Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) --U.S. multimillionaire tire
magnate Morry Taylor has officially given up his little-noted run
for the Republican Presidential nomination and endorsed GOP
presidential front-runner Bob Dole, Taylor's aides confirmed
today.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who won about one percent of the vote but earned no
delegates to the party convention in primaries of 20 states, was
the fourth GOP candidates to quit the race since the campaign
began in late January.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has urged Dole's other four rivals to withdraw, too, and
united behind the 72-year-old U.S. Senate Majority Leader.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them have admitted that there is no chance" to get the
nomination at the Republican National Convention in San Diego in
August, Taylor told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least 996 delegates are require to get the party's
nomination at the convention which will be participated by 1990
delegates.
</P>
<P>
As the front-runner, Dole has won 360 of the 492 delegates
chosen so far. Multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes is
following Dole with 67 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 51, spent some 6.5 million U.S. dollars of his won
money on the race, his aids told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said that he had got the idea to run for President from
an employee. The employee told him that a businessman was needed
to run the United States more efficiently.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) will cooperate with the Palestinian internal security
force and Israel's security police Shin Bet in fight against
rising terrorism in the Middle East, American officials said here
today.
</P>
<P>
A group of CIA counter-terrorism experts led by the agency's
Deputy Director George Tenet will meet tonight in Israel with
their counterparts from the Shin Bet and the secret police of
Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Authority, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Official meeting between a top U.S. intelligence official of
Tenet's rank and his Palestinian counterpart may be unprecedented,
the Washington Post said in today's edition.
</P>
<P>
The CIA group will offer help and encourage the Israelis and
Palestinian security forces to develop cooperation against the
suicide bombers of Hamas in advance of an international summit
meeting on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
This unusual level of intelligence sharing and collaboration
among the CIA, Shin Bet and the Palestinian secret police is part
of an international crackdown against Hamas, its financiers and
its factions, the officials stressed. Hamas has claimed
responsibilities for the recent bombing attacks in Israel that
killed 57 people in nine days.
</P>
<P>
In addition to offering American technical expertise including
information gathered from satellites and electronic-eavesdropping
technology, the top CIA official will press the Israelis and
Palestinians to share secret intelligence in their fight against
the terrorist attacks.

Kaelin was the runner-up to Tomba in February World

Tomba was second fastest but a series of errors in the second

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on Speeding up State Enterprises Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
called for more efforts made to speed up the revamping of the
state-owned enterprises at a panel discussion of the ongoing
National People's Congress session.
</P>
<P>
The large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are facing
difficulties, he said. "And we have to deepen the reforms in line
with the market orientation, strengthen management, adjust mix of
products and industries, and use more new technologies, in order
to make these enterprises more competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a major issue concerning the national economy to
invigorate the large and medium-sized enterprises, and the final
settlement lies in the implementation of in-depth reforms and
establishment of the modern corporate system, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged localities to conduct experiments in this field by
relying on the masses, and absorbing experience and advanced
management expertise from overseas.
</P>
<P>
New practical technical-how and the production of new products
are essential to retool traditional enterprises, the use of brand
names must be protected by law and violations severely punished,
Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
On how to separate the functions of governments from that of
enterprises in matters of business operation, Qiao said it is more
realistic to conduct experiments at grassroots levels.
</P>
<P>
He also raised some views concerning the building of a social
security framework to safeguard the enterprise reforms.

opposition-called indefinite non-cooperation movement against the
February 15 elections.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed that several people were injured and
five of them were brought to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital
after being wounded in separate bomb blasts in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The non-cooperation movement is the second in the past 15 days
launched by the mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami
(People's) League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are demanding cancellation of the
February 15 polls, resignation of the present government and fresh
national elections under a neutral undertaker government.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said attendance was normal in government, semi

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets HK Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
said here today that Hong Kong will act as a bridge in the
country's opening up drive after its return to the motherland
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks when he met a group of Hong Kong
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Wu discussed the future with Y.S. Wu, managing director of
Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, and his party today.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier stressed that after the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland on July 1, 1997, the Central Government's policy
towards Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and at the same time,
Hong Kong's position as an international financial, trade,
shipping and information center, will be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He said a prosperous Hong Kong will benefit the growth of the
whole of China, adding that Hong Kong is convenient for
communications, and serves as a bridge in the country's opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Noting the closer links between the mainland and Hong
Kong, Wu said that when the development of Pudong started, some
friends asked him whether it would replace Hong Kong as it grew.
</P>
<P>
He said that experiences have proved that the economies of the
two places are mutually complementary, and both will develop in
common.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he has full confidence in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Vice-Premier also briefed the visitors
on the current fourth sessions of the Eighth China's National
People's Congress, and the Eighth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Y.S. Wu gave an account of his investments in the mainland and
spoke of his future investment plans.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bangguo said he appreciated Y.S. Wu's active investments in the
mainland's infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> China Proposes New Asia-Europe Economic, Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said a new type of economic and
trade relations should be established between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Asia-Europe Summit Meeting proposed the
establishment of a new type of Asia-Europe relations; in my
opinion, a new type of Asia-Europe trade and economic relations
should also be established," said Wu Yi at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that, while some member countries in the European Union
are for free trade, some others practice trade protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"EU as a body, yielding to demands from these countries, has
imposed limits on the import of Chinese commodities and increased
"anti-dumping" actions against China," she said.
</P>
<P>
This has been one of the "serious problems" in Sino-EU economic
and trade relations, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the EU adopted a policy for EU-China
relations last July, which proposed establishing a long-term
bilateral cooperative relationship, which "China appreciates," she
said.
</P>
<P>
On the attitudes of EU and the United States toward China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, the minister said they
have both something in common and differences.
</P>
<P>
"What they have in common is that both ask for high prices from
China," she said. "Where they differ is a secret, which I won't
say here."
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to strengthen economic ties with European
countries, Premier Li Peng will lead a delegation of entrepreneurs
on his visit to France in April this year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, of which Wu said she will probably be a member,
will sign several economic and trade agreements, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said, since the normalization of Sino-French relations in
1994, leaders of the two countries exchanged more visits and their
bilateral trade relations have further developed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Chinese side, bilateral trade
reached 4.49 billion US dollars last year, up 33.5 percent over
1994.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, French businesses had invested in 975
projects in China, with a total investment of 1 billion US
dollars. And China bought 2 million tons of wheat from France last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The central government will give
policy preference in arranging leading state-funded construction
projects, to narrow regional economic disparity, said Vice-Premier
Zhu Rongji here today.
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion in the on-going session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), Zhu, also a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, told deputies from Gansu, a backward province
in northwest China, the government will also continue to transfer
payment from central budget to local budget in a bid to narrow the
gap.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic disparities, he said, have their historical
reasons. And the central and western regions have worked hard to
narrow the gap, hence contributing for economic progress and
social stability there.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier showed his care to the people's life in
poverty-stricken areas in Gansu, asking a lot of questions on
production when Gu Jun, prefectural party secretary of Dingxi, a
prefecture with poor conditions, was speaking during the panel
discussion.
</P>
<P>
To conclude the discussion, Zhu urged provincial officials to
solve key issues that hinder agricultural growth in the district.

<HEADLINE> China Has 124 Million Surplus Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The development of rural
enterprises has absorbed more than half of China's surplus
farmers, but it still leaves 124 million idling at home.
</P>
<P>
Wan Baorui, vice minister of agriculture, said that by the end
of 1995, rural enterprises, which appeared after the late 1970s,
when China started economic reforms, provided work for 126 million
farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the government would have had to spend
3,780 billion yuan to achieve the feat, had the rural enterprises
not been established.
</P>
<P>
China needs only 200 million farmers at the current rate of
agricultural productive forces.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that the ministry plans to have five million farmers
employed in newly-established rural enterprises every year during
the five years, starting from this year.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, about 150 million farmers should be working in rural
enterprises, with more than 40 percent of an average farmer's
income coming from rural enterprises, according to the ministry's
plan.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Press: Yes for Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 9 (Xinhua) -- In their editorial articles
today, the two Kuwaiti papers Al-Seyassah and Al-Qabas hailed the
first international anti-terrorism summit, due to be held in Sharm
El-Sheikh, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two papers underlined the importance of the one-day summit
in the light of the delicate conditions undergone by the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process requires an "international uprising" to put
on the right track the train of peace and the development of the
region, the two papers said.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is also in need of joint efforts to put an
end to the tragedies undergone by the peoples and individuals of
the region alike, they added.
</P>
<P>
Under the title "Yes for International Anti-Terrorism Summit,"
Al-Seyassah underlined the necessity of working out international
legislations for besieging terrorism and boycotting the countries
that support it.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, Al-Qabas said it was natural for such a
summit to meet after successive problems influenced the Middle
East and the world as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Calls for Water Conservancy Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) A nationwide call for water
conservancy measures was made today in a circular issued by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in all provinces and regions have been told
to improve the country's agricultural production conditions, and
the ecological environment, through sustained efforts in the next
five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The circular, released in Beijing, says local governments
should make painstaking efforts to bring about a bigger and
quicker improvement of China's water conservancy infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It explains that persistent efforts are needed to ensure stable
agricultural growth and prosperity of rural economy, sustained
national economic development, and the improvement of people's
lives and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts to promote construction of basic water facilities
for agriculture is a key measure for the country to achieve its
targets for agriculture, and rural work, between 1996 and 2000,
and through to 2010, says the circular.
</P>
<P>
China aims to increase its grain output to 500 million tons by
2000, from 465 million tons in 1995, on its dwindling farmland in
a bid to feed its 1.2 billion population that is growing by 14
million each year.
</P>
<P>
Tasks targeted for action include the consolidation of risky
water conservancy facilities, dredging of rivers, repair of
damaged water conservancy projects, building a number of small
water conservancy projects and expansion of irrigated farmland, it
says.
</P>
<P>
The circular also calls for the introduction of water-saving
farming technology, improvements in harnessing medium-sized and
small rivers and waters, soil conservancy, and more afforestation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The circular says central and local governments, and society,
should increase investment in water conservancy projects in the
coming years.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Emphasizes "Seeking Truth from Facts" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Seeking truth from facts is an
important content of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics as well as a guarantee for success, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC) National Committee, made the remark at a panel discussion
of Tianjin deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) in
session.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the CPPCC chairman to talk with NPC
deputies during the current session, which opened last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The late Chairman Mao Zedong found a correct path for CPC in
founding New China by relying on seeking truth from facts," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
"China's modernization drive, started over 17 years ago, has
also relied on this principle, which has led the country onto a
successful path," Li said, adding that the principle still works
for China for achieving the goals listed in the newly formulated
medium- and long-term development plans.
</P>
<P>
To seek truth from facts at present, Li said, people should
proceed from realities, pay closer attention to in-depth issues
and be fully aware of their own advantages.
</P>
<P>
However, the chairman of China's prestigious advisory body
reminded the deputies that emphasizing the principle of seeking
truth from facts doesn't mean that people should be
conservative.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, only by seeking truth from facts can people truly
emancipate their minds," Li concluded.

MAPUTO,March 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of trade unions in
Mozambique have called on the government to strengthen the
supervision of the enterprises which are undergoing or have just
finished their privatization.
</P>
<P>
The trade union leaders made the call at a meeting with

to prevent the possible loss of the assets of the privatizing
companies.

of the private companies. They hoped that talks would be held
between trade union organizations and those who had invested in
the new private enterprises to seek ways to protect the interests
of the workers.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the leaders also proposed that the government
should have discussions with Mozambican businessmen on ways to
control inflation which has greatly lowered the living standard
of the workers.

today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Sanzai, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid left here for home after winding up his six-day visit to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Rashid and his delegation first departed from Ankara Esenboga
Airport by plane for Diyarbakir, center of southeastern Turkey,
then will fly Diyarbakir to Habur Border Gate by helicopter and at
last will go to Iraq on highway.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iraq signed in Ankara Friday a memorandum of
understanding related to the technical talks between the
delegations of the two countries, aiming at reopening the
Kirkuk-Yamurtalik oil pipeline should Baghdad agree to
U.N.-supervised limited oil sales.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Turkey, Rashid held respective talks with
Turkish former Energy Minister Sinasi Altiner, newly-appointed
Energy Minister Husnu Dogan and former Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Rashid, Dogan said the oil pipeline is
very important for Turkey and Ankara losses 350 million dollars
each year since the closure of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Rashid went to Ceyhan Monday to examine the twin pipeline that
is the main outlet of Iraqi oil from the Kirkuk fields. He also
visited the port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey's Mediterranean
port, from which Iraqi oil had been distributed before the
pipeline was closed almost six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began talks last month with the U.N. on a deal to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a six-month period, on a
renewable basis, to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the talks ended two weeks ago without any
agreement. The second round is scheduled for March 11 in New York.

<HEADLINE> China Firm on Protection of Intellectual Property: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China has been doing a good job
of protecting intellectual property rights, and any attempt to
retaliate against China on false charges in this respect is
unjustifiable and will be met with counter retaliations, said
China's top trade official answering questions after a press
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,
accused some country of deliberately ignoring Chinese efforts at
the protection of intellectual property rights and attempting to
retaliate against China out of the need of domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government refuses to be bullied by this hegemonic
attitude, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, she said, attaches great importance to
the protection of intellectual property, regarding it as of great
significance to the promotion of scientific and technological
advancement, cultural prosperity and economic development.
</P>
<P>
She said protection of intellectual property will not only be a
guarantee for the smooth operation of a socialist market economy,
but conducive to developing scientific and technological,
economic, and cultural exchanges in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated laws on intellectual property protection
as quickly as it can, set up intellectual property courts in many
of its administrative regions, and is to establish such a court in
the Supreme People's Court, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has conducted a major shake-up of all
its CD (compact disc) plants, closing some down for breaking the
law on intellectual property, detaining and prosecuting violators
of the law, and having two supervisors stationed in each plant,
who are shifted regularly, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added the government has also publicized its policies on
intellectual property protection.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that China hopes to solve any trade
problems with other countries under the principle of mutual
respect and consultations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"If some country is determined to retaliate against China, we
will do what an old Chinese saying -- "a courtesy should be
returned" -- admonishes," she said. "We will definitely take
counter-retaliatory actions." she said.

rich labor, material resources and a vast market, blessed by the
same social customs.
</P>
<P>
He asked government departments to help do away with worries by
Taiwan businessmen in term of the present relations across the
strait. Efforts must also be made to improve the investment
environment for Taiwan businessmen and quickening the pace in
granting them the same preferencies in the interior areas.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Turning Barren Regions Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- More than four million ha of barren
areas in northwest China have been turned into green regions,
thanks to the afforestation project, which not only improves the
ecological environment but also brings about remarkable economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai, and the
Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions have poured
millions of yuan into the project, afforesting 13 million ha of
barren mountains and deserts.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation has protected more than 1.3 million ha of
farmland from sandstorms, saving more than two million ha of soil
from eroding and bringing about an over-20 percent decrease in
silt flowing into the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The number of days of sandstorms in the Yulin region of Shaanxi
has decreased from 66 to 24 annually, and each province's forest
coverage rate has increased by more than 100 percent compared to
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In addition, great progress has been made in the forest
industry. Every province and region has realized the goal of
creating more forest resources than it consumes.
</P>
<P>
The total output of Shaanxi's forestry industry has seen an
annual increase rate of 20 percent in recent years, and it boasts
10.8 million cu m of man-made forest, worth 3.2 billion yuan
(about 385 million US dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> IBM Tops PC Market Share in China in Late 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The global computer giant, IBM,
has taken the lead for the first time in China's expanding PC
market.
</P>
<P>
Xie Keren, general manager with IBM China's personal computer
business, said that in the fourth quarter of 1995, sales of IBM
PCs took the leading position for the first time in the Chinese
market, surpassing its two fellow-American rivals, Compaq and AST,
and China's Legend Group.
</P>
<P>
The company reported a more than double sales leap last
year. The sales volume of IBM PCs swelled by 118 percent in China
last year, according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
He said that IBM's aim this year is to be the largest PC
supplier in China, and expand its involvement in China's
information industry development through increasing investment,
transferring technology and participating in the country's key
projects.
</P>
<P>
There were 1.8 million PCs sold in China last year, with a
continuing market growth rate of more than 30 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to its ambitious expansion plan, IBM opened a PC
exposition this morning in Beijing, displaying all its latest
achievements, ranging from desktops, portable computers to
servers. It is the first large computer exhibition in China this
year.
</P>
<P>
Ranking among the most profitable multinational companies in

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member from HK Suggests Scale Retail Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A National Committee member of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from
Hong Kong suggested today that China practise scale operation in
its retail business to boost commodity circulation.
</P>
<P>
In China, business is still being done in a traditional and a
small-scale way because of its traditions, and there are such
problems as monotonousness in goods varieties, high purchase cost
and poor after-sale service, said Yang Xiang-bo, chairman of the
Shirble Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal practices of forcing up prices and selling fake goods
undermine the interests of both law-abiding producers and
consumers, and ruin mutual trust of producers and consumers in a
long run," he said.
</P>
<P>
Through optimizing the mix of retail business, large and small
retail stores can form supplementary networks to contribute to to
the circulation of goods.
</P>
<P>
"The state should take an active move to boost chained-stores
business to improve retail operation," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he urged the state to take measures to guide retail
businesses and practise unified management over its purchase,
pricing, and marketing of commodities.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, the state can experiment with some
goods distributing centers in a number of selected large- and
medium-sized cities, Yang said.

Coordinating Committee on African Statistical Development (CASD )
was held here from March 8 to 9.

coordina- tion of activities undertaken within the framework of
the strategy for the implementation of the Addis Ababa Plan of
Action to rehabili- tate, revitalize and develop the national
statistical systems in the region. Since then, demands for

</P>
<P>
Invited by China's Ministry of Culture, the orchestra will

world-class music director, on May 31 at the Great Hall of
People. The next evening the orchestra will perform another

<HEADLINE> China Not Afraid of Sanctions: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Any economic or trade sanctions
against China will be met with counter sanctions, Wu Yi, Chinese
foreign trade minister, said here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about possible trade sanctions by the
United States and other countries in the light of China's latest
missile-launch exercises in waters off Taiwan, Wu said those are
normal military exercises that aim to improve the military quality
of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
"To safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, we
think it necessary to conduct such exercises," she said.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises should not have any impact on China's
economic and trade ties with other countries, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"If some countries want to poke their nose into the affairs of
others and go ahead with their sanctions, China is absolutely not
afraid of any sanctions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a Chinese saying that a courtesy should be returned, Wu
said any sanctions will be reciprocated with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"If some countries impose sanctions on us, we will defend
ourselves and make counter sanctions," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, Wu said the WTO will be seriously flawed without the
participation of China, the world's largest developing country.
</P>
<P>
No matter when China joins the WTO, China will as always
independently implement its policy of reform and opening to the
outside world according to its own timetable, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Minister Denies Hiding Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid has denied the reports that his government was
trying to hide chemical or biological weapons by barring
U.N. inspectors from entering a ministry building Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rashid told a press conference here today that it was "one of
the means usually adopted to mislead the international opinion on
iraq."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that whenever Iraq was about to achieve some
progress in its talks with the U.N., there was always such kind
of incidents happening.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that there is absolutely nothing, either in
the building of the Ministry of Irrigation or in other buildings
in iraq, that runs counter to U.N. resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister added that his government was studying on
how to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Baghdad and the United Nations say an arms
inspection team consisting of 43 experts of the U.N. Special
Commission was blocked Friday from entering the Irrigation
Ministry building. The U.N. Security Council demanded that the
Iraqi government comply with the U.N. resolutions stipulating that
no building in Iraq is beyond the inspection of U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials in Baghdad said that they have retrieved five
footlockers of papers, computer disks and munitions from the
rubble of a major chemical weapons plant in Iraq destroyed by the
allied forces during the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered material may offer clues to whether Iraq
has met U.N. demands to destroy its chemical and biological
weapons, according to officials of the U.N. commission on
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> 11th Panchen Lama Worshiped in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Erdeni Losang Qamba Lhunzhub
Qoigyijabu, the 11th Panchen Lama, carried out his first religious
activity in China's capital today.
</P>
<P>
At the Xihuang Monastery in Beijing - known as the West
Monastery of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism - the living
buddha received religious homage paid by the mother of the 10th
Panchen Lama, as well as senior lamas, living buddhas of the
Tibetan Buddhism, and a great number of believers.
</P>
<P>
"I have not seen you for quite a long time. How are you?" said
Soinam Zhoima, mother of the 10th Panchen Lama, after dedicating a
piece of hada (silk scarf traditionally regarded as a token of
respect) to the reincarnated-soul boy.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his sacred seat, slightly patting the 80-year-old
believer on her hands, the 11th Panchen Lama smiled and said: "I
am very happy to see you today. I bless your good health."
</P>
<P>
Tears flowed down Soinam Zhoima's face, and the woman repeated
her thanks to the boy.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old living buddha was confirmed and approved by
the central government as the 11th Panchen Lama in November last
year after drawing lots from a golden urn. The search for the
reincarnated child for the 10th Panchen, which had lasted six
years, was strictly in accordance with rituals of the Tibetan
Buddhism and historical convention, according to the Religious
Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
At nine o'clock, the 11th Panchen Lama arrived at the Xihuang
Monastery, amid deafening sounds of religious trumpets and
drums. The lamas also burned joss sticks and chanted Buddhist
scriptures to welcome him.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a yellow Kasaya and a yellow hat, escorted by living
buddha Sengqen, honorary director of the Democratic Management
Committee of the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, which is the Panchen
Lama's seat, and Lama Cering, director of the same committee, the
soul boy walked along a lengthy Buddhist carpet, and paid his
homage before the Pagoda of the Sixth Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Panchen Lama stayed at the Xihuang Monastery when he
visited Beijing to offer congratulations on the birthday of the
Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty in 1780. Emperor Qianlong
then built the pagoda to commemorate the living buddha.
</P>
<P>
As for the Xihuang Monastery, it was constructed by the Emperor
Shizu of the Qing Dynasty in 1652 to accommodate the Fifth Dalai
Lama, who visited him in the Chinese capital in 1652.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the monastery is an Advanced Buddhist College of the
Tibetan Language Family of China, the highest seat for the study,
and research of the Tibetan Buddhism. The college's creation was
advocated by the 10th Panchen Lama, who then became the president
of the college.
</P>
<P>
Qoxi, a living buddha of the college, said: "we have been
looking forward to the return of our president."
</P>
<P>
The 10th Panchen Lama passed away in 1989. And his soul was
believed to have transferred into the body of a certain boy.
</P>
<P>
A search group paid a secret visit to the boy in the past few
years, and found that Gyaincain Norbu in northern Tibet was the
one with the luckiest signs. He finally became the 11th Panchen
Lama after the lot-drawing.
</P>
<P>
The boy then paid his homage to the office of the 10th Panchen
Lama in the college, placing a piece of hada before a big picture
of the previous Panchen.
</P>
<P>
At 9:30am the 11th Panchen Lama began to receive obeisances by
Soinam Zhoima, and senior lamas and living buddhas like
Gungtangcang, O'lhan, Dewacang, Songbo and Coru Cering. The
students of a special class for living buddhas, as well as many
believers, also came to worship the living buddha.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen accepted hadas, and articles of tributes
presented by the believers, and re-bestowed the hadas on the
believers, while auspiciously blessing them by touching their
heads, and giving them a piece of red silk ribbon.
</P>
<P>
The religious activity was held at the request of senior lamas
and living buddhas of the Tibetan Buddhism. The atmosphere was
enthusiastic, and the scene was exciting. The 11th Panchen Lama
was always full of vigor and showed a solemn expression.
</P>
<P>
Xianggong Badandoje, a living buddha, said that many believers
in his home town have begun to place, and worship the photograph
of the 11th Panchen Lama in their homes.
</P>
<P>
"He is the true reincarnated child for the 10th Panchen," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The living buddha met with Chinese president Jiang Zemin in
January this year. Now, he has started the religious practice
which will turn him into a real Buddhist.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China is to achieve a foreign
trade volume of 281 billion US dollars this year, strives for a
trade balance, and improves its use of overseas funds, China's top
foreign trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(Moftec), told a press conference that progress will be made in
the introduction of technology, project contracting overseas,
labor cooperation, and the promotion of multilateral and bilateral
economic and trade ties in 1996, the first year of China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts to change the country's economic system and
economic growth mode, the minister pointed out, reform of the
foreign trade system will continue.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a change in the trade growth mode, economic
efficiency will play a central role, she said.
</P>
<P>
Efficiency will be improved by promoting a joining of forces by
businesses, adjustment of the export structure, improvement of the
quality of foreign trade, a better use of overseas funds, and
efforts at bringing a better order to the foreign trade sector,
she said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, businesses from 160 countries and
regions had invested in 259,000 projects in China, with actual
overseas investment totaling 135 billion yuan, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
"In future, China will attract foreign investment mainly by
relying on a good investment environment, a well-developed legal
system, efficient management, good services, and an attractive
market," she said.
</P>
<P>
China has started adjusting its policy on the use of foreign
fund, Wu said. Preferential polices will be largely replaced by
market forces in attracting foreign direct investment, and there
will be a shift in taxation for foreign-funded enterprises, from
tax breaks to national treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with State Council regulations, the minister
said, more foreign investment will be channeled into
infrastructure, basic and pillar industries, the high-tech sector,
state-owned businesses, and medium- and low-grade housing
projects.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign businesses will also be encouraged to invest in
China's central and western regions, and foreign-funded ventures
in coastal areas to shift their labor-intensive and resource
developing projects to those regions," she said.

<HEADLINE> 200m US Dollar Plastics Plant for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The way has been paved for the
building of a 200 million US dollars plant in Shanghai to produce
200,000 tons of PVC a year.
</P>
<P>
Two Japanese companies are involved in the project along with a
Shanghai firm.
</P>
<P>
A letter of intent for the setting up of the polyvinyl
chloride plant in China's largest city has now been signed.
</P>
<P>
The plant will be jointly established by the Shanghai Tianyuan
Group and Japan's Itochu Trading Company, as well as Asahi Glass
of Japan in the Pudong new area.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, Tianyuan will account for 50 percent,
and the other half will be provided by the two Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to help Tianyuan add 1.6 billion yuan
annually in its output value, and earn 50 million US dollars in
foreign exchange from exports.
</P>
<P>
China needs annually to import 400,000 tons of PVC, one of the
world's three types of plastics for general use, owing to national
per capita PVC availability being less than one kg, while in
advanced countries the amount surpasses 15 kg.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Support Palestinian Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- In face of wide-ranging
accusations against Iran for being behind the bombing attacks in
Israel, Tehran today vowed to support the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference that "we strongly support the Palestinian cause because
the Palestinians have lost their territory."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that Israel, not Iran, should be blamed for the
recent bombing attacks that put the Arab-Israeli peace process on
hold.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in the occupied territory is based on the past
and present policies of Israel. This is the result of their
failure," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed doubts about the success of the peace process in
the Middle East, because it did not deal with the root cause of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He denied categorically that Iran had any part in the
bombings, saying that "they are trying to use Iran as a
scapegoat."
</P>
<P>
"We are not providing physical, financial or military support
for the Palestinian groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of our revolution in 1979, we have only
pledged moral support for the Palestinians struggling for their
rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
Velayati attacked Tel Aviv and Washington for pointing the
finger at Iran, saying that this was their smoke screen.
</P>
<P>
+Israel and the U.S. are trying to divert the attention from
the internal problem that the Israeli regime is facing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said his country itself was a "victim of terrorism."

<P>
He attacked the Western countries and some Arab countries for
hosting the armed opposition group called People's Mojahedin of
Iran (PMOI).
</P>
<P>
Based in Iraq, PMOI has offices in Europe and the U.S. and is
considered as the strongest armed opposition group of the Tehran
government.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that in the past 17 years PMOI had killed a
president, a prime minister, some ministers, a chief of judiciary
and many parliament members.
</P>
<P>
"They (PMOI) themselves have admitted that they have killed
and assassinated our people and our high-ranking officials," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. and Israel for being selective with
regard to the issue of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"What we say is that we have to fight against terrorism
indiscriminately, on the basis of international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would like to go to the anti-terrorism summit to be
held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Wednesday,
he said Iran would take part in any international conference that
was organized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N., as an organization which is responsible for peace
and security in the world, invites us to a conference for
fighting against terrorism, it would be quite justified that all
the U.N.-member countries would take an active part in such an
event," he added.

<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman has
said the deal for the modernization of Turkey's F-4 Phantom
fighters by Israel is on course and there is much scope for
cooperation between Turkey and Israel in the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News today quoted Weizman as saying that the
Israeli parliament had approved a 410-million-U.S. dollar credit
for the 650-million-dollar modernization deal.
</P>
<P>
The credit will have a grace period of two years.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president said that his country has now upgraded an
F-4 fighter and has called it the Phantom 2000.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) won the
contract to upgrade the Turkish Air Force' fleet of 54 Phantom
jets. The five-year contract has been finalized but not yet
signed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli state-run IAI will install new radar, computer,
electronic warfare, armament and navigation systems in the
Turkish jets along the lines of the upgrading of Israel's own
Phantom planes in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military sources also confirmed that the project was
proceeding on schedule.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, a Turkish military mission will
visit Tel Aviv soon to examine the Elta radar system.

<HEADLINE> SEZ to Proceed from Fresh Starting Point: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A deputy to the National People's
Congress (NPC) in session here suggested that China's special
economic zones (SEZs) proceed from fresh starting points instead
of relying on the past preferential policies granted to them.
</P>
<P>
"It is incompatible with the present practice of continuing to
maintain the preferential policies enjoyed by Zhuhai and other
SEZs," said Liang Guangda, secretary of the Zhuhai City Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai is one of the first four SEZs China established in 1980.
SEZs enjoy preferential treatment in access to funds, taxation and
a wide range of other areas, and have since been a showcase and
testfield of China's opening and reform policies.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the central government to grant some
preferential policies to the SEZs at the early stage of their
establishment, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
But in view of the current stage of reform and development in
the SEZs, the SEZs should no loger be "special", Liang told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping preferential policies for the SEZs does not comply
with the development of a socialist market economy, by which a
major play rule is fair competition," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about cooperation between Zhuhai and its neighboring
Macao, which will be returned to China in 1999, Liang said that
"the prospects for cooperation between the two sides are
"infinite".
</P>
<P>
Macao can serve as a beachhead for Zhuhai in developing economy
and foreign trade and the two can complement each other, as Zhuhai
has rich land and water resources, Liang said, adding that he is
convinced that their relationships will become increasing closer
after 1999.

and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said China's central government
will continue to promote economic and trade relations with Taiwan,
despite the present tensions across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark at a press conference here today in response
to a question about the impact of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army's military exercises on cross-Straits trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems" have
been the government's consistent stand on the Taiwan issue and the
development of cross-Straits economic and trade relations is a
major part of the reunification undertaking, she said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to promote economic and trade relations
between the two sides by following the policy announced earlier by
President Jiang Zemin that cross-Straits economic and trade
cooperation is not to be affected and interfered with by political
differences.
</P>
<P>
Because of the visit to the United States of Lee Teng-hui, who
openly created "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan,"
cross-Straits relations have become tense since last June, and
economic and trade relations have been directly affected, with
Taiwan investment in the mainland decreasing, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not willing to see the regrettable retrogression in
cross-Straits economic and trade relations," she said. "But the
responsibility does not rest with us."
</P>
<P>
Wu said her ministry has always been devoted to promoting
direct trade with Taiwan and has taken various active measures
toward this end.
</P>
<P>
Direct trade is an inevitable need in the development of
cross-Straits economic and trade relations, and it has also been
the urgent appeal of people in the industrial and commercial
communities of both sides, she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the two sides would take practical
and concrete measures, under the precondition of "one China," to
accelerate the pace of achieving direct trade across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to contact relevant departments in Taiwan to
discuss cross-Straits economic and trade relations and direct
trade at a time when cross-Straits atmosphere is appropriate, in
appropriate capacities, in an appropriate form and at an
appropriate location," she said.

for criticizing the ruling party," the KANU Secretary-General
stressed.

ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
will attend an international summit conference to be held in Egypt
on Wednesday to discuss means of pushing forward the Middle East
peace process and combating terrorism, a local daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News quoted a Turkish diplomat as saying that
"Turkey's top level representation shows the importance we attach
to international cooperation against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The diplomat added that Demirel, who plans to visit Israel and
Palestinian self-ruled areas on March 11-14, would go to Sharm
el-Sheikh, Sinai, Egypt by his private plane on Wednesday for the
one-day conference. He will then fly back to Israel. On Thursday,
the Turkish President will continue his visit to the autonomous

<P>
Turkey, which has severely denounced the four suicide attacks

Demirel's talks with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Arafat as
opportunities to condemn those countries that use terrorism, or
sponsor terrorism, as a foreign policy tool, said the diplomat.

Chinese democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, was shut and sunk in

<P>
Since last year, the Chongqing Yangtze River Rescue and Salvage
Company, in charge of the salvage project, has been conducting
maritime surveys on the cruiser, which shows that its steel plates
are intact, though there are several serious damaged parts on it.

The whole project is divided into two phases, the first-phase
work completed recently did preparatory work for the second-phase
work, which will start in November and salvage the whole warship
from the river.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Development of Central, Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The central government is
determined to enhance the accelerated pace for developing the
central and western parts so as to ease the widening regional
disparities, President Jiang Zemin said today.
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion with deputies from southwest China's
Guizhou Province, Jiang Zemin, also general secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, promised his
support to provinces like Guizhou which has been known as one of
the poorest Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond any doubt that the central government will give
more support to a province like Guizhou and we will encourage
other areas to follow suit," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the province to work still harder to maximize its
favorable factors while minimize its unfavorable ones in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president asked provincial officials to attach
prime importance to agriculture in economic development and speed
up the construction of infrastructure facilities. He also called
for carrying out in-depth reform of the state-owned enterprises by
tapping the potentials of the existing enterprises. Moreover, he
stressed on the education in science and technology in an effort
to bring prosperity to the province.
</P>
<P>
After hearing discussions of deputies from east China's Anhui
Province this morning, he said its experience of development has
proved that the provinces with poorer conditions can also quicken
economic growth once they adhere to the principles and policies of
the central authorities and work harder and self-reliantly.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, they can overtake others in many aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that Anhui will continue strengthening
agriculture as the basis of its economy and promote the shifts in
economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
He told the deputies and officials present to attach great
importance to solving practical difficulties for the masses of
people and guarantee the basic life for unemployed workers and
farmers in mountainous and dam areas.
</P>
<P>
"With joint efforts of our generation and coming generations,
we can put an end to the backwardness of the poverty-stricken
areas and bring economic prosperity to the central and western
China," Jiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Prices of tin, rubber and
crude palm oil (CPO) finished the week mixed in Malaysia, with tin
and rubber prices lower while the CPO price higher.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week 23 sen lower
to 15.34 Malaysian ringgit (about 6.13 US dollars) per kilogram
compared with 15.57 ringgit (about 6.22 US dollars) per kilogram
last week.
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher this week on speculative buying at
15.62 ringgit (about 6.24 US dollars) per kilogram, but it fell on
Wednesday and the bearish tone continued until the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said the weak note appeared when the tin price on
the overnight London Metal Exchange (LME) slid by 22 US dollars to
a nine-month low of 6,020 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The week's turnover was 509 tons from 504 tons last week with
European and Japanese and local buyers contributing a major
portion of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and the LME on Friday widened to
190 US dollars per ton from 150 US dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian rubber prices ended the week lower on heavy selling
following softer regional markets.
</P>

kilogram from 412.5 sen (about 1.65 US dollars) per kilogram last
week, while the SMR 20 was down 93 sen to 305.5 sen (about 1.22
dollars) per kilogram from 398.5 sen (about 1.59 US dollars) per
kilogram last week.
</P>
<P>
However, traders here were confident that the tin market would
remain at the 400 sen (about 1.6 US dollars) level next week
following poor production faced by the market.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals finished the week higher. The market started
the week lower, but went up Wednesday on the news that Pakistan
would tender for 6,000 tons of palm oil for late March shipment.
</P>
<P>
Talks that China was making inquiries also helped the market to
close higher.
</P>
<P>
Prices for Mrach-South closed the week at 1,215 ringgit (about
486 US dollars) per ton compared with 1,210 ringgit (about 484 US
dollars) per ton last week.

<HEADLINE> Development in Tumen River Area Speeds up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Development of the Tumen River
area, located along the borders of China, Russia and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is picking up speed,
an official from the northeastern province of Jilin said today.
</P>
<P>
"Some breakthroughs were made last year with active cooperation
among countries in northeast Asia," said Ding Shisheng, a
high-level provincial official in charge of the river area's
development.
</P>
<P>
Ding is here attending the on-going annual session of the
Eighth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The development program, put forward by the United Nations in
October 1991, is to be carried out by China, the DPRK, Russia,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
On December 26 last year, China, Russia, the DPRC, the ROK and
Mongolia signed agreements at the United States headquarters on
enhancing coordination among them.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, officials from China and Russia reached an
agreement on Chinese use of Russian ports around the area, opening
international shipping routes and setting up free economic and
trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the DPRK stepped up the construction of
infrastructure in the Tumen River area to improve the local
investment environment. It also sponsored a business fair in
Beijing last year to attract investors for the area.
</P>
<P>
Some big conglomerates from the Republic of Korea have launched
projects in China's Huichun there to produce steel and clothing,
among other things, he said.
</P>
<P>
During an investment fair held in Jilin Province last year,
foreign investors pledged to invest nearly 900 million US dollars
in the Chinese zone of the Tumen area.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisheng said that, at the NPC session, he would appeal to
the government to offer more favorable policies for the Chinese
area along the lower reaches of the Tumen River.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China is most concerned with Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity, and with Hong Kong people's
interests, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's interests are consistent with the national
interests," he said at a panel discussion of Guangdong deputies to
the National People's Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong includes the return of Hong Kong
people's hearts and mind," Qian said. "That requires us to unite
with them, work for popular support in Hong Kong of our policy of
'one country, two systems,' 'management of Hong Kong by Hong Kong
people' and 'a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong'."
</P>
<P>
Qian told the deputies that work of the Preparatory Committee

progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Guangdong's development, Qian said the province
has led the nation in reform and opening to the outside world, and
expressed the hope that the province will make greater progress
after Hong Kong's return in 1997 and Macao's in 1999, being the
one province most close to the two regions.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Steady, Rapid Economic Growth During 1991-1995 period (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic product
(GDP) set records during the 1991-1995 period in terms of total
output and the growth rate, according to the overseas edition of
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics
Bureau, as saying that the country's GDP, the value of goods and
services produced, came to 5.76 trillion yuan in 1995, 4.3 times
in real terms the figure for 1980 and up nearly 76 percent from
1990.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the GDP rose at an annual rate of 12 percent
during the 1991-1995 period, four percentage points higher than
the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
"This fully demonstrates the vitality of a market mechanism and
the improved ability of the government to exercise macro-economic
controls," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-95 period, agriculture's added value increased
at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's grain production totaled 2.24 billion tons,
200 million tons more than during the 1986-1990 period; output of
oil-bearing crops came to 93.23 million tons, up 20.93 million
tons; and meat production amounted to 199 million tons, an
increase of 76.23 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"China also scored a steady and rapid increase in industrial
production during the 1991-95 period," Zhang Sai said.
</P>
<P>
Industry's added value grew at an annual rate of 17.8 percent
during that period, 8.6 percentage points higher than the previous
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, added value of state-owned manufacturers rose at an
annual rate of seven percent, that of collectively-owned
enterprises at an annual rate of 19.3 percent, and that of other
types of enterprises with foreign-funded businesses as the
mainstay at an annual rate of 42.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, investment in fixed assets throughout China
amounted to 6.16 trillion yuan during the 1991-95 period, up 4.18
trillion yuan and growing at an annual rate of 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We have improved the investment structure and substantially
increased investment in such basic industries as energy,
transportation, and posts and telecommunications," he said.
</P>
<P>
China handled imports and exports totalling 1.01 trillion US
dollars during that period, more than double the amount during the
1986-1990 period, he said.

<HEADLINE> Proposals on Anti-Corruption Drive Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The strategy for China's
anti-corruption campaign should be incorporated in the country's
overall framework for building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In a joint speech, five non-communist party personalities today
said that the punishment of corrupt elements and establishment and
improvement of an effective mechanism channeling the campaign onto
legal tracks are essential to advancing the campaign in a
deep-going way.
</P>
<P>
All members of China's top advisory bodies, the five note
figures delivered their report on a plenary meeting of the current
session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
They proposed that an efficacious anti-corruption body, a
well-developed internal restriction mechanism and a social
supervision system be established and further improved.
</P>
<P>
Major factors impeding China's anti-corruption efforts, they
noted, include laxity in law enforcement concerning economic and
other social activities, authority overriding law enforcement in
many cases, and perversion of laws by law executers.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that it is central link to guard the sanctity of
law while improving China's legal system.
</P>
<P>
As legal supervisory bodies, procuratorates at various levels
should put emphasis on handling law perversion cases by law
enforcers, contesting against wrong verdicts on corruption cases,
and beefing up supervision on trials of civil cases and
administrative procedures.

<HEADLINE> Hijacking Ends Peacefully With All Hostages Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The hijacking of a Turkish Cypriot
airliner has ended peacefully in the German city of Munich
Saturday morning with all passengers and crew being released,
according to the German police.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, who has been detained by the police, turned out
to be an unarmed young Turk instead of an armed Chechen rebel as
earlier reports said, the police were quoted as saying by reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the young man, the police said the hijacker used
a toy gun and had no bomb.
</P>
<P>
The lone hijacker, apparently a sympathier of the Chechen
separatists, said he had acted to draw attention to what he called
the Chechen cause.
</P>
<P>
The young man first fooled authorities into thinking of a whole
gang of hijackers by referring to three accomplices, reports said,
adding that in the hijacking drama, most passengers appeared only
to have seen one hijacker.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 of the North Cyprus Turkish Airline, with 101
passengers and eight crew on board, was commandeered on Friday en
route from northern Cyprus to Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker ordered the plane to landed in Munich at 22:11 GMT
on Friday after a refuel in Sofia, Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Five passengers were initially freed after negotiations between
the police and the hijacker in Munich. Two crew members were
released later.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Manufacturing Performance Last Year One Of Worst In 15 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest tyre company
said production in the country's key manufacturing sector in 1995
was one of the worst in 15 years due to a host of problems, key
among them the devastating drought.
</P>
<P>
A statement published yesterday by the Dunlop Zimbabwe Ltd
said that indices of manufacturing production volume for the
first nine months of last year showed a decline of 14 percent
compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
''Although some improvement usually occurs in the fourth
quarter, a decline of 12 percent over the whole year is widely
predicted,'' the company said, describing overall performance of
the manufacturing sector in 1995 as ''one of the worst since the
country's independence''.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing contributes about 25 percent to the country's
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Dunlop said two droughts in four years had seriously affected
the agricultural sector, with disastrous effects on the
manufacturing companies which depended heavily on raw materials
from agriculture.
</P>
<P>
''Continuing high levels of inflation have increased
manufacturing inputs costs and reduced consumer's spending
power,'' said the company.
</P>
<P>
It said growing competion from imported manufactured goods,
particularly from South Africa, had also affected local
companies, many of whom no longer benefited from export
incentives their competitors had.
</P>
<P>
The company said the future, however, looked bright, now that
Zimbabwe, whose economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, had
received reasonable rains during the current season.

<HEADLINE> Enhanced Awareness for Economic Performance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputies from underdeveloped areas also feel the urgency to
make such shifts. Zhang Wule, who is also governor of northwest
China's Gansu Province, said, "A shift in economic growth mode is
especially important for narrowing the economic development gap
between the coastal and interior areas."
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped areas must refrain from building small-sized,
low quality repetitious projects but enhance economic progress by
upgrading and expanding existing factories and by technological
advances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gansu will concentrate on upgrading its raw material industries
for better efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Said Zhang Zhongli, president of the Shanghai Academy of
Sciences, "The old economic growth mode constitutes an important
factor for high investment, high consumption, poor economic
performance and a cycle of high inflation."
</P>
<P>
Economists among the deputies say they are glad to see an
enhanced awareness for better economic performance rather than a
higher economic growth rate, confident that such awareness will be
of critical importance for a stable economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that, before the NPC session opened here, a
dozen provinces and municipalities had made a shift in economic
growth mode a guiding principle in their respective economic
development plans.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has decided to adjust
its investment structure and spend more on developing farming
technology, said Tian Fengshan, governor of Heilongjiang.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Achieving a shift in economic
growth mode has been one of the most frequently discussed topics
among deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), China's
parliament, in session here.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of the annual session last Tuesday, in their
capacity as deputies, experts have promoted the idea and officials
are excited at the subject. It is regarded as a guarantee of sorts
for a sustained economic progress and a miraculous cure for
loss-making state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The idea is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
All the previous five-year plans and ten-year programs were
based on a planned economic structure, in which output value
increases were regarded the same as success. Local governments
were enthusiastic about seeking more investment projects and
greater speed, little concerned about whether products from new
projects can sell. A result: with their products stockpiled in
warehouses, many state enterprises have been operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
Effecting a change in the economic growth mode, from relying
mainly on building ever more production facilities to relying
mainly on improved management and advances in science and
technology is one of the two shifts proposed by the Chinese
Communist Party last September. The other is a shift from a
traditional planned economy to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng, in his report at the NPC session, called for
making these "two fundamental shifts" from now on.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Shanghai expressed approval for this policy
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Said Xu Kuangdi, one of the deputies, who is also mayor of
Shanghai, "It is not just a requirement of the central government,
but a necessity for Shanghai if it is to develop further."
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, Shanghai's per capita gross city
product has reached 2,500 yuan, and the prices of land, raw
materials and labor in the city are higher than those in interior
China.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai cannot afford to seek continued development by
expanding investment and building more projects," he said. "It
must maintain a sustained economic growth by improving economic
performance," said Xu.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Starts Non-Cooperation  Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's major opposition
parties today started a countrywide non-stop non-cooperation
campaign to press for the resignation of the government and fresh
elections under a neutral caretaker administration.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government program was announced on February 29 by the
Awami (People's) League, the Jatiya (National) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami amidst continuing political unrest in the wake of
last month's controversial general elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties called for the closure of all
government, semi-government and autonomous agencies, banks and
financial establishments, and educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the total halt of all mechanized
transports, rail and waterways, air services and operations of
seaports.
</P>
<P>
The "non-cooperation movement" follows a series of agitation
programs that have brought life and economic activities to a
virtual standstill across much of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the opposition, the government has agreed
to hold all future elections under a "non-party government" and
offered dialogue with the opposition to end the two-year old
political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition has rejected the government's offer and
stuck to their demand for the establishment of a caretaker
government by March 10 to pave the way for fresh elections in May.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Pledges High Returns from Agricultural Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Investment in agriculture in the
northernmost Heilongjiang Province, one of China's leading grain
producers, will prove rather profitable, Governor Tian Fengshan
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Heilongjiang enjoys exceptional advantages with regard to its
potentials in agricultural growth," said Tian, who is here to
attend the on-going annual session of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
China's medium- and long-range development programs have cited
his province as a major producer of marketable grain. "That will
bring new opportunities to foreign investors," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Business people from the Republic of Korean (ROK), Japan,
Thailand and Switzerland, as well as Hong Kong have signed
contracts with the province to be engaged in agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
The province bordering Russia is located in one of the world's
three black soil belts, where the soil is fertile and raining
season coincides with warm season. Therefore, It yields large
quantities of wheat, soybean, beet and flax.
</P>
<P>
The province has 8.6 million ha of arable land, and 1.6 million
ha of wasteland that can be cultivated through large-scale
reclamation operation. In addition, it boasts four million ha of
pastures.
</P>
<P>
More than five million ha of low and relatively low-yield
farmland will turn out much more grain if related conditions
are improved.
</P>
<P>
At present, Heilongjiang is able to produce 25.9 billion kg of
cereals a year, 60 percent of which is sold. But businesses
engaged in-depth processing of farm produce can make higher
profits, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in agriculture will produce high returns in the
province than in other places, he said. On the national average,
the increase of every kg of grain costs six yuan (about 0.72 US
dollar), but such an increase costs only 3.2 yuan in the province.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has worked out favorable policies and regulations
to attract agricultural investors, who are able to buy the
land-use right for 30 years to 70 years, Tian said. Moreover, he
added, both domestic and overseas investors are permitted to set
up solely-funded or joint ventures, and granted the right to
sell their grain and other farm produce to other provinces or
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Six members of an armed robbery
gang were executed, two were sentenced to life imprisonment and
two others with jail terms of two to three years in Fanyu city of
south China's Guangdong Province today.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang today flailed the
United States for trying to keep its military presence in Japan on
the pretext of "threat from North Korea."
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the official Rodong Sinmun said that by
spreading rumors that situation on the Korean Peninsula is intense
and Japan cannot manage the situation alone in case of emergency,
the U.S. tries to justify its continued military presence in Japan
as an important measure to thwart the "threat from North Korea."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bases in Japan, leftovers from the Cold War, are a
crucial factor threatening the security and peace on the Korean
peninsula and in Northeast Asia, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added, "This practice runs counter to the global trend of
detente and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
Instead of keeping a military presence in Japan on various
false pretexts, the U.S. should pull out its troops from Japan
and clear the vestiges from the Cold War from the peninsula, it
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A long spell of dry and unusually
cold weather plagues more than 23 million peasant households in
Vietnam and poses a big threat to the country's rice output in
this season, an official report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central highlands, the northwestern provinces and the Red
River Delta have not seen a drop of rain for three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rainfall in the northern and southeastern part of
the country was 20-80 percent less than the average level.
</P>
<P>
There were significant decreases in river flows and reservoir
storages, both essential to irrigation in central and northern
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Bac Thai province, north of the capital, has suffered most
and received no rain since August. Many reservoirs there dried up
and at least one-sixth of crops are facing a water-or-die fate.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a cold spell damaged about 2,000 hectares of rice
crop in the province.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a major crop failure looms large in Bac Thai.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has required
local authorities to take necessary measures immediately to cope
with situation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Urges Caretaker Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi opposition has urged
the country's president to cancel by Sunday the results of the
February 15 elections and form a neutral caretaker government to
hold fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, "all opposition political parties and professional
groups will form the caretaker government taking the people with
them for holding elections," said Sheikh Hasina, leader of the
largest opposition party -- the Awami (People's) League (AL).
</P>
<P>
"Only a people's representative government could ensure
democracy and political stability in the country," the opposition
chief said in an address to a rally last night in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, who is also chairperson of
the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), last night asked
President Abdur Rahman Biswas to invite all the political parties
for a dialogue on the issue of forming a non-party caretaker
government to hold fresh general elections.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction to the government's offer, AL General
Secretary Zillur Rahman said good sense had prevailed over the
prime minister if hers was a sincere request to the president and
not an attempt to frustrate the opposition's movement.
</P>
<P>
"However, the facts remain that we are not budging an inch from
our basic demands -- resignation of the prime minister and
scrapping of the February 15 "farcical polls," Zillur added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council to Set up Political Office in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Friday agreed to set up a political office in Rwanda to
coordinate U.N. agencies that will be involved in reconstruction
and development activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The political office will be based in Kigali, capital of Rwanda,
and will be staffed by up to 12 U.N. officers.
</P>
<P>
The council took the decision in view of the impending
withdrawal of a 1,230-member U.N. peace-keeping force from
Rwanda. The withdrawal, starting on March 9, is expected to take
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council paid
tribute to the work of the United Nations Assistance Mission for
Rwanda (UNAMIR) and to the personnel who served in it.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the Rwandan government to take all necessary
steps to ensure that UNAMIR personnel can be withdrawn in an
orderly and safe manner.
</P>
<P>
UNAMIR was established in October 1993 to help monitor the
implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement by the then
Hutu government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
After the ethnic killings of 1994, UNAMIR was assigned to help
build national reconciliation and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called on the international community
to continue assisting the reconstruction of Rwanda and the
rehabilitation of the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Chinese alternate representative He Yafei gave high marks to
U.N. mission in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He told the council meeting that since its establishment two
years ago, UNAMIR had contributed to the restoration of peace and
stability in Rwanda in cooperation with the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the world community to continue to help the
Rwandan people achieve political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
However, it was up to the Rwandan people themslves to make
efforts to reach national reconciliation and promote the return of
refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the people of Africa, who have long suffered from
conflicts and wars, needed a peaceful and stable environment.
</P>
<P>
China has always supported the African people's efforts to
establish a peaceful environment, rebuild their homeland and
develop their economy, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Hijackers Free Five Hostages in Munich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Five passengers have been released
following negotiations between police in Munich and the four armed
hijackers who seized a Turkish Cypriot airliner, Deutsche Presse
Agentur (DPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Two men, two women and a child were released by the hijackers
today. However, a police spokesman said the release appeared for
now to be a one-off rather than a prelude to the release of more
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The North Cyprus Turkish Airline Boeing 727 with 101 passengers
and eight crew aboard had landed in Munich at 11:21 p.m. (22:11
GMT) Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The 727 had flown from Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, where it had
refuelled after being diverted by the hijackers on its way to
Istanbul from Ercan airport in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in northern Cyprus have identified the
hostage-takers as two male and two female Chechens born in Baku,
who hold Russian passports.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPA report, police had begun contact with the
hijackers before midnight and learned that they wanted to make a
statement to the media.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of North Cyprus Turkish Airlines said the
passengers aboard included 47 Turks, 33 Turkish Cypriots, five
Belgians, three Iranians and two Russians, along with people from
America, Ukraine, Japan, Denmark and other nations.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed in
principle to sell Thailand eight F-18 multi-role jet fighters with
advanced missiles, the Thai military said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Air Force Commander-in-Chief Acm M.R. Siripong Thongyai
said the U.S. had sent the Thai Air Force a letter asking for
final inspection before the two countries could sign a formal
agreement on the deal.
</P>
<P>
The letter means that the U.S. has agreed to Thailand's
requests for the advanced medium range air-to-air missiles
(AMRAAM) together with the jet fighters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some changes would be made to the number of spare parts or
weapons, the Thai Air Force chief was quoted by local newspapers
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
After the official agreement is signed, he said, it would take
another three to four years for the aircraft, which would cost
Thailand an estimated 14.56 billion baht (582.6 million U.S.
dollars), to be delivered.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Encourages Deep Sea Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 9 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government has
recently decided to encourage the country's fishermen to engage in
deep sea fishing, according to Fisheries Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
A survey indicates there are nine varieties of fish available
in large quantities within Sri Lanka's Exclusive Economic Zone,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the National Aquatic Resources Agency
(NARA) says that Sri Lankan fishermen should venture into the
deep seas as the coast is fast being depleted of fish resources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Exclusive Economic Zone stretches for 200 miles
from the coast and the survey shows that three local boats
engaging in 18 trips a day could bring to shore 31 tonnes of fish
from this area.
</P>
<P>
The NARA will now encourage local fishermen to venture out into
the deep seas to exploit the vast resources.

BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has rejected a
U.S. State Department report on the human rights situation in
Thailand, saying that it is out-of-date, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Somsak Prisanananthakul said on Friday
that the Thai government has not ignored the human rights issue

The U.S. report alleged that Thai police officers had sometimes

The report also alleged that the Thai government had failed to
enforce laws against child prostitution.

In response, Somsak rejected the charges and said that Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa has instructed police to earnestly
tackle child prostitution and deal harshly with police officers
found guilty of torturing or mistreating suspects.

<HEADLINE> "China's Frog King" Wants to Breed More Frogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Called as "China's frog king", Chen
Weichang has established an industrialized frog breeding base in
Wuhu of east China's Anhui Province, which covers an area of 22 ha
and can breed 30 million frogs, the "Economic Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Chen, director of the Anhui Oriental Food
Scientific Research Institute, raised more than 100 million
yuan(about 12 million US dollars) to establish the Corporation,
which is to be built into the world's largest and most profitable
frog breeding base.
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary people have little knowledge about the frog, which is
full of vitality and value. If a frog is bred for eating, it worth
only dozens of yuan, but after certain processing procedures, it
can worth 100 to 200 yuan," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Although he had worked as the general manager of a department
store and the head of a factory, he has special interests in the
frog, spending dozens of years studying the breeding and
utilization techniques of the animal.
</P>
<P>
Once on his way to seeking advice from an expert, his car was
overthrown to a brook beside the road. Although he was seriously
injured by the accident, he continued his journey, enduring pains.
</P>
<P>
" I should keep my promise, it is a precious opportunity for me
to learn from an expert," he later explained.
</P>
<P>
After many years of research work, he succeeded in changing the
frog's winter sleep habit, and developed application technologies
to use the frog for pharmaceutical purpose.
</P>
<P>
He plans to breed 30 million frogs and provides 200 million
baby frogs for local peasants to breed and his frog base will be
developed into a comprehensive enterprise, which will combine the
industries of frog breeding, processing, and pharmaceutics.

<HEADLINE> Airbus to Develop New Jumbo Jet to Compete with Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- European aircraft consortium Airbus
is working on plans for an A3XX jumbo jet to compete with Boeing
747.
</P>
<P>
Airbus suffered major setbacks in recent years, with its market
share dropping from 30 percent a few years ago to 16 percent in
1995, while Boeing captured 52 percent of the world market.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's star product, the 747, is very popular among major
airlines around the world for its capacity and long range. The
success of the 747 also promoted sales of other Boeing jets
because for the airlines, buying jets from the same company can
lower the maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus's lack of such kind of jumbo jet then put itself
under a serious disadvantage in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Boeing is now developing new 500-seat and 600-seat
jumbo jets, aiming at greater share of the world market.
</P>
<P>
Facing the great challenge, Airbus is expected to make a
decision on its new jumbo jet soon. The expenses are estimated to
be 13 billion U.S. dollars, which equals to the whole sales of the
consortium in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka has denounced the killing
of civilians by terrorists around the world, including the January
31 bombing of the central bank in Colombo, according to a news
release issued by the Foreign Ministry last night.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has been deeply shocked by the death
and destruction caused by terrorism, most recently when the
central bank was bombed, killing and injuring hundreds of
civilians, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
The government is no less distressed by a series of other
bombings recently in different parts of the world which have
targeted civilians, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Though these individual manifestations of terrorism are
unrelated, the resort to violence, particularly against
defenseless civilians, when peaceful avenues for settlement of
grievances are available, calls for the strongest possible
condemnation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government and people extend their deepest
sympathies to the families and friends of civilians who have lost
their lives in such attacks, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga recently has
stressed on many occasions including at the United Nations, the
vital need for concerted international efforts against terrorists
who persist with violence and reject the option of peaceful
negotiations acceptable to all others.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo called today for equality between men and women in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the full enforcement ... in every day life, of
the equality between women and men," Zedillo said when presenting
the "1996 Women's National Program."
</P>
<P>
He said that "this is the moment to promote and assure women's
participation in the economic, social, political and cultural life
of the country."
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the Los Pinos official presidential
residence, the president noted that the country's Constitution
consecrates in Article 4 the juridical equality of men and
women.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this rule of equality "is frequently denied
in practice."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "1996 Women's National Program"
establishes a strategy to change attitudes, beliefs, practices and
behaviors of men and women, and to promote a culture of equality.
</P>
<P>
The program also seeks to preserve Mexican values and
traditions, he said.

<P>
PRAGUE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A leading member of the ruling
National Party today criticized Washington for trumping up a
report on the country's human rights conditions with "sheer
fabrications and lies."
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely prejudiced and unobjective," Anny Malikova,
Deputy Chairman of the Slovak National Party, said of the annual
report of the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
The report noted a trend in Slovakia away from democratic
principles, citing reports of abuse of power, dismissal of
officials out of political motives, threats against dissidents,
and meddling with mass media.
</P>
<P>
Scoffing the report as not quite up to the U.S. status as the
No. 1 world power, Malikova said, "maybe only 5 percent (of the
report) are true but the remaining are just fabrications."
</P>
<P>
As for the dismissal of officials, she said, "I would like to
ask one question: how many senior government officials are
dismissed with the change of a president in the United States?"

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said here today that to maintain
"an appropriate level of food security," it's important to prevent
unnecessary spending.
</P>
<P>
The annual spending on grains for developing countries is some
3 billion U.S. dollars, "That makes us consider whether to
increase grain production" in those countries, said FAO's general
director Jacques Diouf.
</P>
<P>
The general director currently is touring central American
countries, discussing with these countries issues concerning food
supply security, trans-border illnesses, and the preservation of
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern over the population growth in central
America, saying that the food supply is far from enough for so
many people.
</P>
<P>
FAO will also hold a world food summit between November 13 and
17 this year at its headquarters in Rome. Delegates from Latin
American and Caribbean countries will gather in July this year in
Paraguay to prepare the summit.

quarter-final of the ongoing Cricket World Cup between Sri Lanka
and England in Faisalabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Faisalabad said today that only 500
tickets had been sold so far for the 18,000 capacity stadium.
</P>
<P>
Many Cricket fans were quoted as saying that for them the

fixture.

The ongoing World Cup Cricket is co-sponsored by India,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The opening ceremony and the first
match were held in India last month. And the final will be
held in Lahore, Pakistan, on March 17.
</P>
<P>

in Karachi, Pakistan got the second place in Group B and had to
take on India, which got the third place in Group A, in a
quarter-final to be held in Bangalore on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, the top of Group A, will play England, the fourth

of going to Iqbal stadium to watch the other match", said a
shopkeeper in Faisalabad.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan-India match is the highlight of the World Cup and I
don't think that any Pakistanis will like to miss it", said a

</P>
<P>
In a bid to attract more fans for the Sri Lanka-England
match, Faisalabad administration had declared a local holiday
on Saturday, just for the quarter-final match.
</P>
<P>
However, observors said that most Pakistani fans will still
stay at home, watching the clash between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan cricket team is the defending world champion but
India also has the strength to win the title with one of the
world best teams.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Businessmen Welcome to Invest More in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China will step up its endeavor to
open to the outside and welcome foreign businessmen to bring more
investment, especially in agriculture, infrastructure and basic
industries, Minister in charge of the State Planning Commission
Chen Jinhua said.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, China welcomes foreign investors to the central
and western areas, where lie great potentials for development with
promising, abundant market resources," Chen said Friday at a press
conference during the on-going session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, he added, China will carry out the
appropriately tight monetary policy, and such a macro-control
measure will contribute positively to ensuring the steady
expansion of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central government will pay attention to the
problems that crop up in the course of implementing macro-control
economic policies, and promptly resort to micro-economic policies
to cope with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the country has scored remarkable
achievements in increasing productivity and comprehensive national
strength, improving infrastructure and economic pattern,
establishing a socialist market system, and appropriately

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Asked to Hold Dialogue With  Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia has asked President Abdur Rahman Biswas to take the
initiative for a dialogue with the opposition leaders on a
solution to the country's prolonged political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing last night, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan,
joint secretary general of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), urged the opposition to call off their planned
"non-cooperation movement" against the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties should call off such plans since the
prime minister had already asked the president to take the
initiative for a dialogue, as demanded by the opposition, said
Bhuiyan, who is also food and agriculture minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition had called on the president to take the
initiative for discussion with all parties by Sunday and form a
neutral caretaker government to hold fresh general elections in
May.
</P>
<P>
Expressing optimism that the prevailing political crisis would
be over soon, Bhuiyan said "We have already come very close to the
solution since we are ready to fulfill the opposition demands for
a non-party government for conducting future elections and holding
of a fresh election as early as possible."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has long suffered from the political conflict
between the BNP government and the opposition over the contentious
issue of forming a neutral caretaker government to supervise the
February 15 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The BNP went ahead with the elections along with some small
parties and independent candidates and won, but all opposition
parties boycotted the polls.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the prime minister's latest offer was a
positive sign, although the opposition has yet to respond to it.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's political crisis will by no means be
easily resolved as the two sides are still far apart over the key
issue of the February elections which the opposition would not
accept and call "farcical."

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso announced today on ocassion of the International
Women's Day a program to strengthen the rights of the 75 million
women of the country.
</P>

aggression, sexual harassment and rape are punished more severely.
</P>
<P>
On the health care area, the program foresees that women are
given attention to prevent breast and uterine cancer, as well as
counseling about family planning.
</P>
<P>
In the education area, The Brazilian government will offer
courses of modern formation and training so Brazilian women face
the labor market in better conditions and will promote more
respect for women among the population.

aims at improving the present situation of Brazilian women.

<HEADLINE> UN Police, Bosnian Serbs Agree on Joint Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the International Police
Force in Sarajevo Peter Fitzgerald said today that he had reached
agreement with Bosnian Serb officials on joint activities to
ensure the safety of the Serb population in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Pale, the Serb stronghold in the Sarajevo
suburbs, with Serb parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik and
Minister of Internal Affairs Dragan Kijac, Fitzgerald said the
Serbs had agreed to cooperate with the U.N. police in protecting
the Serbs who remain to live in the Muslim-Croat Federation
territory in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Most Serbs have fled the five Serb Sarajevo suburbs, which will
be reverted to the control of the Muslim-Croat Federation by March
19. But there are still thousands of Serbs, most elderly people,
who wish to stay in their homes even when the power in the areas
is being transferred.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on dealing with incidents in Sarajevo
districts being abandoned by Serbs, Tanjug quoted Fitzgerald as
saying in Pale.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. police official confirmed that some of the incidents
had been caused by federal police. He expressed the hope that they
would not be repeated.

<HEADLINE> Martic Claims Himself Not War Criminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- President of the Republic of Serb
Krajina Milan Martic said today that he was not a criminal but a
man who had struggled for his people.
</P>
<P>
Martic, in a statement to the Tanjug news agency, said that he
had known the Hague tribunal's decision to issue an international
warrant for his arrest as "indicting and issuing a warrant for the
entire Serb people."
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal for war crimes committed in the territory of
former Yugoslavia issued today an international warrant for
Martic's arrest under charges of being responsible for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
"If the court in the Hague really were a court of justice, I
would very gladly appear before it and prove that I am not a
criminal but a man who has struggled for his people," he told a
Tanjug reporter in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in
northwestern Bosnia. But unfortunately, he added, "arguments are
not essential for world power wielders."
</P>
<P>
"With a trial in the Hague, the world power wielders want to
shake guilt off themselves for the breaking of the sovereign state
of Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs in Croatia set up their own republic in 1991 and
fought for their independence from the Zagreb government. But the
Serb republic was wiped out in August 1995 when the government
troops launched a massive offensive and most of the Serbs in
Croatia fled their homes to Yugoslavia or the Serb state in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he feared arrest, Martic said that would be
"specific terrorism, to which one responds in a specific way." But
he stressed that he was neither afraid nor upset.
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal in its indictment against Martic said that
in May 1995, he ordered the shelling of the Croatian capital city
of Zagreb, which killed six people.
</P>
<P>
The charges are based, among other things, on video films of
Martic's statement that he had ordered the bombing in order to
stop Croatia's aggression on the Krajina region of western
Slavonija and prevent further destruction and killing of local
Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
The new charge brings the number of indictments by the Hague
tribunal to 53. Only seven indictments are against Bosnian Croats,
while all the others are against Serbs. No Muslims are yet being
indicted.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Rising employment in February
made the U.S. dollar zoom in the opposite direction of stock and
bond markets which plunged today.
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit highs against the German mark and the Japanese
yen not seen since last month, but retreated to less modest gains

from 105.25 yen late Thursday. The dollar was changing hands at
1.4840 marks, up from 1.4763 marks.
</P>

the country's unemployment rate in February dropping to 5.5
percent from 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Traders got their signal on the rising economy and the dollar
quickly climbed upward as hopes of rate cuts faded. They thought
the dollar should benefit if interest rates aren't cut, analysts

LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
is to attend the summit on Middle East terrorism to be held next
week in Egypt, said British government sources today.
</P>
<P>
The conference was demanded by Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat in the wake of a series of terrorist bomb attacks in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The British government welcomes such a conference and it will
make some contributions to the Middle East peace process, the
British Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is designed to shore up a Middle East peace
process which has looked increasingly fragile during a fortnight
of terrorist attacks against Israeli targets, according to a BBC
television report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and government leaders from other
countries are expected to attend the summit, due to be held next
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Top US Bosnian Peace Envoy Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Ambassador Robert Gallucci
has resigned as U.S. special envoy in charge of the implementation
of the Bosnian Peace agreement, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Gallucci has accepted an offer to become dean of the
prestigious Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in
Washington, department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Gallucci will be replaced by Ambassador
John Kornblum.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher praised Gallucci for
his efforts to negotiate what was described as the "landmark
nuclear agreement" with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Bob Gallucci is one of the most effective public servants with
whom I've had the privilege to work," Christopher said in a
statement. "On behalf of President Clinton and the entire
administration, I'd like to express my appreciation to Bob
Gallucci for his extraordinary accomplishments."
</P>
<P>
Gallucci's resignation came very soon after the departure of
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who brokered
the Bosnian peace accord last November at the three-week Dayton
talks.
</P>
<P>
The resignations of both Holbrooke and Gallucci were widely
believed as an apparent new blow to U.S. peace efforts in Bosnia.

UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General

The initiative will mainly improve basic education, health,
peace-building, good governance, water and food security in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the initiative will require up to 25 billion
dollars, mostly from the reallocation of existing resources at the

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Plunge on Good Economic News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange plunged today after the U.S. government announced the
brightest jobs rebound in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The report caught the financial markets off guard and sent
interest rates skyrocketing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 171.23 points at
5,470.44 at the close of trading. The Dow once dropped more than
200 points at midafternoon before recouping some of its losses.
That's the third-worst one-day point drop in history.
</P>
<P>
However, the Dow has risen so far since 1987 that today's drop
represented a percentage decline of just a 3 percent loss --
significant, but not even among the top 100 worst days for the
market.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow fell 508.00 to 1,738.74, a decline of
22.6 percent. On Oct. 13, 1989, the index fell 190.58 to 2,569.26,
or 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today, declining issues were crushing advancers by 13 to 1 in
the final hour. Big Board volume was heavy at more than 400
million shares, up substantially from Thursday's pace but not
anywhere near a record volume.
</P>
<P>
The selling was very broad, and broad-market indexes also
suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond lost more than 3 points.
Its yield, which rises when prices fall, hit 6.69 percent late in
the session, up from 6.46 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year bond is a sensitive barometer of interest-rate
trends.
</P>
<P>
Igniting today's furious sell-off was a long-awaited report
from the Labor Department, which said the country's businesses
added 705,000 jobs in February. That was the biggest monthly
increase since 1983 and more than doubled the figure analysts had
expected.
</P>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 5.5 percent from 5.8
percent, also a dramatic improvement.
</P>
<P>
The news, which means the economy is growing fast, quenched
investors' hope that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates
again when its policy committee meets on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Almost no sector of the stock market was left untouched by the
torrent of selling. Cyclical and non-cyclical issues, consumer and
financial issues, all were hit hard, market observers said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Angola to Accelerate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has urged the Angolan Government and the
UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) to
demonstrate their commitment to implement the Lusaka Protocol
without further delay.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council available today,
Boutros-Ghali said that the parties have taken some steps in the
right direction since the adoption of Resolution 1045 on February
8 by the Security Council which decided to extend the mandate the
United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVAM III) for three
months until May 8.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the meeting between Angolan President dos Santos
and Savimbi of the UNITA took place on March 1 in Libreville,
Gabon. "These high-level meetings can play an important role in
the promotion of national reconciliation and encourage the steady
advance of the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
While commending the Angolan government for the implementation
of its commitments, the U.N. chief said that the UNITA's
quartering of more than 16,000 troops was a step forward.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UNITA to complete the quartering in an expeditious
and orderly manner in accordance with the new timetable. "Equally
important are a transparent withdrawal of FAA (government forces)
to their barracks and the completion of the quartering of the
rapid reaction police."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, rapid conclusion of the talks on all
outstanding military matters is critical for the advancement of
the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also noted that the humanitarian crisis
in Angola is far from over, and the task of socio-economic
rehabilitation and reconstruction is yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
"The success of all these efforts depends on the establishment
of genuine peace and national reconciliation, a goal that can only
be achieved through the full commitment of the government and the
UNITA to honor their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol," he
said.

</P>
<P>
The 16 NATO ambassadors arrived in Sarajevo this morning on a
one-day visit to get first-hand knowledge of the IFOR's activities
in Bosnia, rather than to give the IFOR fresh instructions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency said the NATO delegation, headed by the
organization's Deputy Secretary General Sergio Baanzino, also
included NATO Supreme Commander for Europe General George Joulwan.
</P>
<P>
Haselock dismissed as "untrue" the reports on the IFOR's
participation in locating war criminals and in investigating mass
graves.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure to adopt more high-profile duties in civilian
affairs in Bosnia, the NATO Council approved in Brussels Wednesday
night a greater engagement of IFOR personnel for jobs not
necessarily of the military nature as the military aspect of the
peace accord has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The NATO delegation in Sarajevo will hold talks with IFOR
Commander Admiral Leighton Smith and with Ejup Ganic, acting
president of Bosnia as President Alija Izetbegovic is ill.

<HEADLINE> Monrovia Suspends Warlord from Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's council of state, the
country's interim collective presidency, has suspended Oosevelt
Johnson, the ousted leader of an armed faction ulimo-j, from the
post of Rural Development Minister, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
A government statement was quoted today as saying that Johnson
was suspended for "gross insubordination" following his failure
to attend a meeting on Wednesday with the council of state and
the faction's newly appointed leader.
</P>
<P>
The government decision came less than a week after most
members of the faction ulimo-j announced that Johnson had been
replaced as their leader.
</P>
<P>
The liberian council of state has "temporarily" recognized
William Karyee as the new leader of ulimo-j, pending a full
investigation into the faction's crisis.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed last weekend by 26 of ulimo-j 's 29
frontline commanders and nine of the 10 members of its executive
council announced that Karyee had replaced Johnson.
</P>
<P>
They accused Johnson of "running a one-man army" and failing to
move the peace process in Liberia forward since he became
chairman of ulimo-j in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's council of state gave the new ulimo-j leadership a
72-hour ultimatum to return all arms, ammunition and equipment it
seized from the west African peacekeeping force known as ecomog
during last December's attack on the peacekeepers in Tubmanburg,
some 60 kilometers north of capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja accord signed last August by all seven of
Liberia's factions, aimed at ending almost six years of civil
war, ecomog began deploying across Liberia last December in order
to disarm some 60,000 fighters of the armed factions.
</P>
<P>
Deployment was halted after the Tubmanburg incident.
</P>
<P>
The council of state has also directed ecomog and local
security forces to search the homes of Johnson and his loyalists
for weapons.

<HEADLINE> UN Weapons Inspector Says Iraq-UN Scheduled Oil-for-Food Talks Will Not Be Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here today
that Iraq's denial of U.N. weapons inspectors' access to a
government building will not affect the scheduled oil-for-food
talks between Iraq and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Charles Duelfer, deputy chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission on scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction (UNSCOM), said that the standoff between the Iraqi
government and the U.N. weapons inspection team has no relations
with the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the U.N. and the Iraqi side on strictly
controlled partial oil sale in exchange for humanitarian supplies
under U.N. resolution 986 are scheduled to resume in New York
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspection team headed by Russian weapons expert
Nikita Smidovich had not been allowed to enter Iraq's Irrigation
Ministry building from 9 o'clock Friday evening to 2:30 Saturday
afternoon. The U.N. inspectors said they have evidence that some
documents related to Iraq's past weapons program are stored in the
building.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer described the event as "very serious." He expressed
his regret and hope for no repetition of similar incident.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Iraq's move, the U.N. official said that Iraq
holds that allowing foreigners into the building is a violation of
its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UNSCOM,
held talks on telephone with Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz and
demanded the entry for the U.N. inspectors, Duelfer added.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer, who arrived here Thursday, also said that his
political dialogue with Iraqi officials is going on smoothly and
the Iraqi side is cooperative.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet with Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid after he returns from Turkey where he is now paying a
visit.
