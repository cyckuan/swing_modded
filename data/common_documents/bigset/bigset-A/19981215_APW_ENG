Ganguly scores 79 to lead India

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Saurav Ganguly scored 79 runs
Tuesday as India recorded a morale-boosting eight-wicket win on the
fourth and final day of their cricket match against Wellington at
the Basin Reserve.
	   Ganguly's innings gave the tourists the perfect tonic with the
first test against New Zealand starting at Carisbrook in Dunedin on
Friday.
	   The little lefthander hit nine fours and one six in his 77-ball
innings and shared an unbroken third-wicket partnership with Rahul
Dravid, who hit an unbeaten 66, of 136 in 109 minutes.
	   Chasing 174 for victory, India began the day at 30 for one and
they polished off the runs in the second over after lunch for the
loss of V.V.S. Laxman's wicket.
	   Ganguly continually found gaps in the Wellington field and was
particularly severe on left arm spinner Mark Jefferson, who went
for 37 runs from five overs.
	   Ganguly said the two first-class games had been beneficial as a
buildup to the test.
	   ``We haven't played that many test matches this year (four) so
the two matches here have helped us adjust our style away from
one-day cricket,'' he said. (djp)

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Garrison Hearst was the rushing star
instead of Barry Sanders, who was shut down by the injury-depleted
San Francisco defensive line.
	   Hearst ran for a team-record 198 yards and Steve Young threw for
one score and ran for another as the San Francisco 49ers beat the
Detroit Lions 35-13 Monday night.
	   The victory was the 49ers' 16th straight regular season win at
home, their second dominating game on Monday night in three weeks
and kept the Niners (11-3) a game behind Atlanta in the NFC West
with two games remaining.
	   Sanders went nowhere against a defense against a San Francisco
defense, playing inspired ball a week after giving up a season-high
203 yards rushing in a 31-28 overtime win at Carolina in its first
game without star tackle Bryant Young, out for the year with a
broken right leg.
	   San Francisco hardly need its league-leading passing attack,
setting a team record with 328 rushing yards. Young was just
12-of-18 for 82 yards.
	   Detroit (5-9) was eliminated from playoff contention with the
loss and the Lions also lost quarterback Charlie Batch in the
second quarter. He went out with a lower back injury after being
sacked by Chris Doleman and Brentson Buckner and was replaced by
Frank Reich.

Hyundai chief visits North Korea to discuss business ties

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The owner of South Korea's largest
industrial conglomerate crossed the heavily armed border into North
Korea on Tuesday to discuss tourism and other business
opportunities in the reclusive communist country.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, accompanied by several aides, walked into
North Korea through the neutral village of Panmunjom inside the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. It was his third
visit to the North so far this year.
	   ``I have many things to discuss,'' the founder of the Hyundai
group told reporters before crossing the border.
	   Chung said his discussions will include building an industrial
park on North Korea's west coast to accommodate textile, footwear
and other labor-intensive facilities to be moved from South Korea.
	   Aides said the industrial park would take 10 years to complete
and could produce dlrs 4.4 billion worth of goods a year. North
Koreans could expect to earn dlrs 400 million a year in wages, they
said.
	   Hyundai launched unprecedented sightseeing cruise tours of
Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east coast, on
Nov. 18.
	   Nearly 6,000 South Koreans have visited the mountain under the
largest inter-Korea joint venture since the Korean Peninsula was
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   In return for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay
North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years.
	   During his four-day visit this week, Chung will follow up other
joint venture projects discussed earlier, including a thermal power
plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial park, Hyundai
officials said.

Defiant town provides haven for war crimes suspects

<TEXT>
	   FOCA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ It has been called a ``closed,
dark place,'' run by Serb hard liners, a haven for war crimes
suspects, scene of some of the worst horrors of the Bosnian war.
	   As a result, Foca, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of
Sarajevo, has been virtually cut off from the international aid
earmarked to rebuild the country after the 1992-1995 war.
	   Before the war, Foca was a picturesque, multi-ethnic town,
nestled between towering, green hills along a narrow valley where
the Drina and the Cehotina rivers join.
	   About half the population of 40,000 was Muslim, the rest Serb
and a few Croats. The Serbs, however, drove out the Muslims and
Croats early in the war. To reinforce the town's new, all-Serb
image, the town was renamed Srbinje, although few other Bosnians
refer to it that way.
	   The once lively streets are now virtually empty, with only a
handful of pedestrians to be seen. The 400-year-old mosque which
had been a symbol of Foca was destroyed. The site is now a park.
	   An estimated 80 percent of the 22,800 residents are unemployed.
Shop windows stand almost empty. Although the town lies on a major
road between eastern Bosnia and the Adriatic coast, few cars pass
by.
	   The traditional means of transportation _ the horse-drawn wagon
_ appears to be replacing cars.
	   Anyone in the town who has 100 German marks (dlrs 60) is
considered rich, according to a 57-year-old woman who declined to
give her name, saying it would be dangerous to do so. She said city
officials had gotten rich from wartime plunder, but no one cared
about ordinary townspeople.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton agreement which ended the war, Bosnia's
three communities -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- are required to
allow minority refugees to return to their pre-war homes and
surrender those accused of war crimes and end ethnic
discrimination.
	   Communities that refuse to follow these rules will get no
international aid. According to human rights groups, Foca has a
long way to go to meet even minimum standards.
	   ``We think that this is a great injustice towards the Serbs,''
said Radojica Tesovic, the local governor and a member of the
Bosnian Serb hard-line party.
	   In a report entitled ``A Closed, Dark Place,'' the U.S.-based
Human Rights Watch said Foca was the scene of wartime atrocities
``beyond anyone's worst nightmare'' and was still providing safe
haven for Bosnian Serbs indicted by the International War Crimes
Tribunal.
	   ``Only eight of them,'' Tesovic stressed.
	   French troops patrol the town but have so far made no attempt to
arrest any of the eight suspects here. Instead, the suspects move
around freely in the streets or sip coffee in the bars.
	   In an apparent effort to appease international demands, one of
Foca's war crimes suspects, Milorad Krnojelac, surrendered to
French troops in June. Krnojelac, former warden of the town jail,
was, among other, indicted for rape _ the first time the offense
has been officially defined as a war crime.
	   The next day, protesters trashed the local offices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation and the United Nations
International Police Task Force.
	   Nevertheless, town authorities sent a request to international
agencies, arguing that with the surrender of Krnojelac, Foca had
met conditions for foreign aid.
	   So far, they have received no response.
	   Tesovic acknowledged that Foca has not been receptive to
requests by former non-Serb residents to return home. ``We are
receiving requests by pre-war citizens,'' he said. ``But until now,
we have not approved any of them.''
	   In its report, Human Rights Watch accused international agencies
of ``turning a blind eye'' to violations of the Dayton agreement in
Foca in the interest of keeping the peace.
	   ``I really don't understand what the international community
wants from us,'' Tesovic said. ``We are cooperative. Do they expect
us to take those people by the hand and hand them over to them?''

Leaders warn of dangers of globalization

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Despite claims of unity, Southeast Asian
leaders showed signs of division Tuesday, with some complaining
they are being hurt by globalization and others urging faster
economic liberalization.
	   The conflicting stances provided evidence of the difficulties
that foreign and economic ministers had at pre-summit meetings in
trying to forge consensus on action to restore confidence in a
region suffering its worst economic crisis in a half-century.
	   Although they put together a list of ``bold measures'' that the
leaders are expected to endorse at the two-day Association of
Southeast Nations summit, leaked reports on the plans have failed
to generate enthusiasm in world markets.
	   ASEAN includes both industrialized countries and some of the
world's poorest nations, leading to natural splits on the scope and
speed of tariff cuts and investor incentives.
	   Malaysia and Vietnam were at one end of the spectrum Tuesday,
warning of the dangers of globalization, while Singapore, Thailand
and the Philippines said it is inevitable and should be embraced.
	   As usual, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was the most
outspoken, speaking of world leaders who stood by as ``predatory
speculators'' set off the economic crisis, then blamed hard-hit
countries for causing their own problems.
	   ``Instead of reining in the currency manipulators, they allowed
them to destroy the economic tigers in order to force them to seek
the help and accept IMF (International Monetary Fund) prescribed
reforms,'' he said.
	   But Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai urged accelerated
integration of the regional economy, saying ASEAN countries must go
``at least one step beyond our pledged commitment.''
	   ``We cannot stop the process of globalization, but we can better
prepare ourselves to meet its challenges,'' Chuan said.
	   Accountability and transparency have to be extended to politics
in member countries, he said, underscoring Thailand's stance that
economic recovery is linked on more democracy and respect for human
rights.
	   That would not go over well in countries like Vietnam, Laos and
Myanmar, who have been criticized for their human-rights records
and have resisted any change in ASEAN's policy of non-interference
in members' internal affairs.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada called for ASEAN to ``move
and move boldly,'' on economic integration, and urged more frank
discussion between ASEAN countries.
	   ``We should be confident and open with one another so we can
communicate freely to solve our common concerns and strengthen the
ties of amity and partnership.''
	   Speaker after speaker highlighted the region's stability but
said the economic crisis has taken its toll. Indonesian Prime
Minister B.J. Habibie called it ``devastating.''
	   ``The economic crisis has impoverished ASEAN economies and
undermined national stability,'' Mahathir said.
	   The crisis has led to calls for affected countries to open their
markets more quickly. Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said
that creates both opportunities and problems.
	   ``Rapid economic globalization is bringing about greater market

As Samaranch glares, senior IOC official repeats corruption

charges &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Under the scornful glare of his
boss, the International Olympic Committee member who uncapped the
biggest scandal in the agency's history urged his colleagues Monday
to ``work for honesty.''
	   ``These have been the three worst days I have spent in my career
in sports,'' said Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official who rocked the
Olympic world with allegations of bribery and blackmail.
	   ``In times of crisis, you get to know who your friends are and
who your enemies are,'' he said at a news conference, alongside IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   ``I've had three nights without sleep,'' Hodler said. ``You have
time to pray. I was praying that the wise, the good, the strong and
the brave have the courage to work for honesty in the Olympic
movement and sports in general.''
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss member of the International Olympic
Committee's executive board, then spent the next two hours
surrounded by reporters and TV crews _ repeating most of the
allegations he first made on Saturday.
	   Hodler spoke again of shady ``agents'' _ including an IOC member
_ who promised to secure blocks of votes for payments of up to dlrs
3 million in campaigns for election of Olympic host cities.
	   While still refusing to identify the people involved, Hodler
provided a few more details of his allegations.
	   He said the IOC member who solicited payments for votes came
from Africa, and said the ``worst of the agents'' was based here in
the IOC's headquarters city and had unsuccessfully attempted to
become an IOC member.
	   This person, Hodler said, approaches bidding cities and claims
that ``no city in the last 15 years has won the Olympics without my
help.''
	   Hodler also said that one reason evidence of corruption had not
surfaced before was because losing cities often want to bid again
and don't want to make enemies.
	   Two hours after his round of interviews started, Hodler was
seated on a plastic chair next to a Christmas tree in the IOC
lobby. Samaranch, who had told Hodler on Sunday not to talk anymore
about the case, walked onto the mezzanine above the lobby and was
visibly annoyed to see one of his oldest lieutenants still holding
court. He grimaced, gave a dismissive wave and stalked off.
	   The allegations have triggered one of the gravest crises in
Olympic history. Samaranch has compared it to the political
boycotts of the 1970s and '80s and Ben Johnson's 1988 drug case.
	   ``We have been through crises before in the Olympic movement,''
he said. ``Now we are going through another crisis. ... If there
are cases of corruption, we can't permit it in the Olympic
family.''
	   On Monday, one of the organizers of Anchorage's unsuccessful
bids for the 1992 and 1994 winter games said he was solicited for
bribes by agents of the IOC.
	   Rick Nerland, who served as executive vice president with the
Anchorage Olympic Organizing Committee, said the incidents occurred
in the mid- and late 1980s. He refused to identify the IOC members
he said sought the bribes.
	   The head of Nagano's campaign to stage the 1998 Winter Olympics
denied allegations that officials bribed IOC members to back the
Japanese city's bid.
	   Nagano Prefectural Gov. Goro Yoshimura, who chaired the
committee that organized the successful bid, said IOC members were
not paid off for their votes.
	   Also, the chairman of Sion, Switzerland's 2006 Winter Olympics
bid invited the IOC to examine the accounts of both the current
Sion bid and its unsuccessful attempt for the 2002 Games.
	   The Sion 2006 candidacy ``strives for full transparency and fair
play,'' said a statement from the Swiss defense ministry, headed by
Sion chairman Adolf Ogi.
	   Despite calls for a full-scale investigation of all of Hodler's
allegations, Samaranch said Monday that for now, the IOC would only
investigate the Salt Lake City scandal.
	   The case centers on a scholarship fund set up by the Salt Lake
bidding committee, which won the rights to stage the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   The program provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people,
including six relatives of IOC members.
	   Salt Lake City officials apologized Sunday for the
``embarrassment'' caused by the scandal, while stressing they won
the games on the merits of the bid.
	   A high-level IOC panel is investigating the case.
	   Top officials of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee received a
warm welcome Monday at a long-scheduled appearance before leaders
of Winter Olympics sports federations, who ``unanimously and quite
movingly expressed their support,'' organizing chief Frank Joklik
said.
	   ``It was totally spontaneous and, to us, somewhat unexpected,''
Joklik said
	   Salt Lake officials met twice with the investigators over the
weekend. IOC vice president Dick Pound, who leads the inquiry, said
he expects to finish the investigation by the end of January.
	   Some officials have urged the IOC to investigate alleged
malpractice cited by Hodler in the election campaigns of Atlanta
(1996), Nagano, Sydney (2000) and Salt Lake City.
	   But Samaranch said the focus would stay on the Utah capital at
least for the time being.
	   ``If there is other proof, we will open other cases,'' he said.
	   Hodler said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the 115 IOC members
were open to bribery.
	   Hodler repeated his defense of the Salt Lake City scholarship
program. The Salt Lake bid committee operated a fund that provided
nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people, including six relatives of
IOC members.
	   Hodler, who has described the program as a bribe to sway votes
of IOC members, said Salt Lake City was not to blame.
	   ``For us, Salt Lake City was a victim of blackmail and not a
villain,'' he said. ``The real villains are the agents who put the
cities in awkward positions using blackmail. ... Salt Lake City had
been forced by blackmail to give financial favors.''
	   Hodler said he decided to go public after a senior Swiss
government official asked him about rumors of misconduct and
wondered whether Hodler had been bribed to keep quiet.
	   Until now, there has only been ``hearsay'' of bribery that would
not stand up as evidence in court, Hodler said. He said he had
heard complaints from previous unsuccessful Olympic bidders,
including Manchester, England, and Stockholm and Ostersund, Sweden.
	   But now there is written proof of corruption practices in the
case of the Salt Lake fund, Hodler said.

Nippon Credit Bank affiliate goes under
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese mortgage company went bankrupt
Tuesday, two days after the government took over its ailing main
bank.
	   The Tokyo District Court accepted an application for protection
from creditors filed by NCB Mortgage Co., said Shigeki Kawamoto, a
lawyer for the Nippon Credit Bank affiliate.
	   Nippon Credit Bank was placed under state control Sunday after
being declared insolvent with at least 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27.8
billion) in unrecoverable, or high-risk, loans and massive stock
evaluation losses.
	   NCB Mortgage had liabilities totaling 174.0 billion yen (dlrs
1.51 billion) and a total of 164.6 billion yen (dlrs 1.43 billion)
in loans from the ailing bank, Kawamoto said.
	   The company made the move after judging it was unable to obtain
financial support from Nippon Credit Bank, Kawamoto said.
	   The mortgage company's failure was the seventh largest by a
Japanese company this year in terms of liabilities, according to
Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a major private Japanese research firm.
	   It amassed its debts amid Japan's slumping real estate market
after the collapse of the nation's highly speculative ``bubble''
economy in the early 1990s, Teikoku Data Bank said.

Snyder says troops still needed in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; ph2fon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) _ After a trip to Russia and Eastern Europe,
Rep. Vic Snyder says now is not the time to remove U.S. troops from
Bosnia.
	   Snyder, D-Ark., said morale among the troops appeared good and
added that they should remain in Bosnia for an indefinite time.
	   ``It's clearly not the time to remove them now,'' Snyder said.
``They're doing very, very well at stopping the bloodshed that was
going on. But things such as the resettlement of refugees still has
a long way to go. ...The hard work of nation building is more
problematic.''
	   Snyder and four other Democrats on the House National Security
Committee returned from the trip last week. Snyder said Monday that
besides visiting with the troops, they also met with Russian
officials in St. Petersburg and talked with Czechoslovakian leaders
about their desire to join NATO.
	   Snyder said the United States needs to remain involved in
building fledgling democracies.
	   ``The threat to us is instability,'' Snyder said. ``So that
market economy needs to be nurtured and stabilized...and in Russia,
helping them safeguard their nuclear materials, that has to be a
priority to us.''
	   Were he a legislator in Czechoslovakia, Snyder said, he would
support the bid to join the military alliance originally exclusive
to Western European and North American nations.
	   But the Czech military has inadequate training, different
equipment and more of a top-down chain of command than most NATO
members, Snyder said.
	   The delegation was in St. Petersburg during local elections,
which Snyder said were both troubling and encouraging.
	   ``In the days leading up to it, the Mafia was involved in the
election in a major way,'' Snyder said. ``Money and vodka was being
used to buy votes, there was intimidation, an assassination....sham
candidates being put on ballots.... just a tremendous effort made
to thwart the reformers of democracy.''
	   But in a relatively high voter turnout, ``all the Mafia
candidates where defeated. It was interpreted as a tremendous boost
forward for democracy,'' Snyder said.
	   Snyder said he noticed that frustrations with the United States
were high among some Russian officials. One of the concerns of
those he talked with was the possibility of the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland joining NATO. Russians also had opposing views
about the United State's role in Bosnia, he said.

Australia retains the Ashes with a 205-run win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia trounced England by a
mammoth 205 runs to retain the Ashes for a record equaling sixth
successive time at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.
	   Fast bowler Glenn McGrath triggered another collapse either side
of lunch
	   on the last day as England, chasing a mammoth 443 runs to win,
was bowled out for 237 runs just 24 minutes after the break.
	   ``It hurts a lot,'' skipper Alec Stewart said after the
humiliating defeat. ``We came here with the intention of regaining
the Ashes but we haven't played to our full potential. We have
under-performed in this series so far.''
	   Stewart top-scored for England with an unbeaten 63 as his side
lost 5-16 off 27 balls in 24 minutes after resuming the day on 122
for four.
	   ``When it comes to the crunch we haven't performed. They are the
best side in the world and when they get in winning positions they
stay in winning positions.
	   ``We have good patches but we don't have enough good patches.
Australia batted and bowled better than us. I've played in a losing
Ashes side for the last 10 years and it hurts.''
	   England's second-innings collapse followed the first innings
debacle of losing 7-40 in just 64 minutes on the third morning.
	   ``If our top seven batsmen can get the runs on the board, you
can't expect the tail to do it for you,'' Stewart added. ``The
difference in the two sides have been the tail. Our's hasn't wagged
at all in the last few years.''
	   Stewart refused to agree that English cricket has deteriorated.
	   ```What I believe is that the other countries have improved. We
have to produce cricketers with mental strength and talent.''
	   Once Australia claimed the prized wicket of Mark Ramprakash for
57, the right hander took away with him England's hopes of
salvaging an unlikely draw.
	   But Stewart with his first major contribution in the series and
John Crawley (13) took the side within two balls of the break when
disaster struck.
	   Crawley's edge to second slip Mark Waugh began triggered the
collapse.
	   McGrath armed with the second new ball took 4-15 in 21 balls to
hurry an Australian win. He finished with 4-50 and enjoys an Ashes
tally of 58 wickets
	   in 11 tests.
	   Justin Langer, who complemented his career-best unbeaten 179
with a fine 52 in the second innings was voted man-of-the-match.
	   Mark Taylor, with his 25th win in 48 tests as captain, said his
side enjoyed the ``mental edge'' over their opponents and had
enjoyed doing it without bowler Shane Warne.
	   ``We have certainly got the mental edge over England, there is
no doubt about that, and that comes from a number of good
performances over the last 10 years or so,'' said Taylor.
	   ``The pattern has been set in the series with two tests
remaining. It is a feeling of relief as well as a great thrill
after the disappointment in Brisbane.''
	   England narrowly escaped defeat in the first test when the
weather intervened.
	   ``Lot of us treat the Ashes series very highly. We have taken on
different challenges in world cricket and Ashes is a very special
one.''
	   Taylor felt there was an ``enormous gulf'' between the two sides
because of Australia's depth.
	   ``There are a lot of players outside keeping the pressure on
everyone in the current team,'' said Taylor. ``That's the reason we
are so strong.''

Asia says World Cup boycott won't affect hosts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan and South Korea will be allowed
to proceed as co-hosts and play in the 2002 soccer World Cup even
if a threatened Asian boycott goes ahead.
	   The Asian Football Confederation is angry that world governing
body FIFA has given it just two qualification berths for 2002,
making a total of four teams including the co-hosts.
	   AFC general secretary Peter Velappan said the 16-member
executive committee decided Tuesday to send a delegation to meet
with FIFA president Sepp Blatter, probably in February. Velappan
said the remaining 43 teams in the Asian zone would boycott the
World Cup if the AFC's demands were not met at the FIFA committee
meeting planned for March.
	   ``All of the members spoke up very much in favor of a boycott of
2002,'' Velappan told a news conference Tuesday. ``But we will
honor the responsibility of hosting the World Cup.''
	   Asia had three direct qualification places for France 98 and an
extra chance that Iran claimed by beating Oceania winner Australia.
	   The AFC wants its 3 1/2 chances back, but Velappan admitted they
would accept 2 1/2 because the co-host arrangement gave them two
automatic qualifiers.
	   In essence, the AFC wants the third-ranked team in Asian
qualifying to have the chance of reaching the World Cup via a
playoff against another regional team.
	   ``Our decision is not irrational and is not unreasonable, our
decision is fair,'' Velappan said.
	   Blatter contacted the AFC before Tuesday's board meeting and
offered the body four places for the 2006 World Cup, without
mentioning 2002.
	   ``Why should he dangle a carrot at us about 2006? We're trying
to focus on 2002,'' Velappan said.
	   The AFC vice president, Sri Lankan Manical Fernando, said a
boycott would be the only route if FIFA rejects the AFC demand.
	   ``Blatter must find some way or another of solving this
problem,'' Fernando said. ``Otherwise he will push us to the wall.
They should know that if they don't help us we will boycott.''
	   The 16-member executive committee met for 2 1/4 hours to discuss
the issue Tuesday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prosecutors in the high-profile
trial of Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader Tuesday exhibited a
gray-colored mattress which police said had semen stains from Anwar
Ibrahim's alleged illegal sexual activities.
	   Silence fell over the packed courtroom as a senior police
officer cut open brown paper wrapping to reveal a queen-sized,
spring mattress from which 13 pieces of cloth had been snipped out
for testing by police experts.
	   Prompted by curiosity about the well-publicized exhibit, many
people peeked into the courtroom even before Tuesday's hearing
began to catch a glimpse of the mattress leaning against a wall.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove that Anwar had sex with the wife
of his former secretary and that he tried to abuse his powers as
deputy prime minister of the Southeast Asian country to cover up
sexual trysts.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
posh Kuala Lumpur suburb which Anwar is accused of using for secret
meetings with sex partners.
	   As the wrapping was removed, Anwar smiled and then jokingly made
a gesture of sleeping by clasping both palms onto the side of his
head.
	   Pieces from the cloth covering of the mattress had been sent for
testing to police laboratories along with samples of Anwar's blood
for DNA analysis.
	   The results of those tests have not been disclosed to the court.
Prosecutors were expected to call in forensic experts later and
even produce a pillow that was seized along with the mattress.
	   Anwar, fired in September, currently faces abuse of power
charges and will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged
in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule. Mahathir said his former protege
was morally unfit to rule.
	   ``While examining the mattress on July 10, 1998, I saw patches
on the cloth which I suspected to be seminal stain,'' said Musa
Hassan, the assistant commissioner of police who investigated the
charges against Anwar.
	   ``It was in the spots that had been slashed,'' he said after
uncovering the mattress with bits of sponge stuffing spilling out
from the areas where the cloth had been cut.
	   The new evidence has created obvious parallels with the case of
Monica Lewinsky, whose semen-stained blue dress has been touted as
vivid proof of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The prosecution's case was based on accusations by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar,
a former driver in the politician's household.
	   While Ummi has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife, Shamsidar Taharin, driver Azizan has claimed he was
repeatedly sodomized by Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi made the accusations in letters sent last year
to Mahathir. The pair retracted their allegations after being
arrested by police, but later said they were forced to do so.
	   The prosecution says Shamsidar, who has been attending the
hearings regularly, was taken to the apartment by an ally of Anwar,
who is now being tried for illegal possession of ammunition.
	   Later, the judge angered defense lawyers by blocking them from
trying to establish that police were fabricating evidence against
Anwar.
	   ``Mala fide is a very serious issue which you are brushing
aside,'' Raja Aziz Adrusse, Anwar's chief attorney, told Judge
Augustine Paul. Mala fide is the legal expression for bad
intention.
	   Defense lawyers are alleging that police had forced Anwar's
adopted brother, Sukma Dermawan, and his former speech writer,
Munawar Aness, to confess in a court that they had been sodomized
by Anwar.
	   The two are serving six-month jail sentences. Sodomy is illegal
in predominantly Muslim Malaysia.

Netanyahu in no hurry to carry out next West Bank withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Even though he won a major concession from the
Palestinians, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in no hurry to
return the favor.
	   In a post-midnight interview before meeting Tuesday with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
the Israeli prime minister said he would wait and see how
Palestinians followed up their vote to delete anti-Israel clauses
from their national charter.
	   ``They have done one thing, and I approve of it,'' Netanyahu
said. ``But it is one of many things that have to be done.''
	   Then he listed steps that Arafat would have to take:
	   ``They promised to stop the incitement. It still goes on. They
promised to stop violence. It still goes on. They promised to
collect illegal weapons. They haven't done that in any significant
way.''
	   Most of all, he added, Palestinian leaders repeatedly threatened
to declare a state May 4 even though they were committed to
negotiating a final status agreement.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters Monday
night she hoped Israel would adhere with minimal delay to the
timetable set by the Wye River accord for West Bank withdrawals.
	   Netanyahu said he would not succumb to pressure to match the
Palestinian concession.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' he declared. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep all the
provisions, and no amount of pressure is going to change this.''
	   Netanyahu said he was taking a go-slow approach because the
Palestinians turned the violence on and off ``like a tap.'' He said
he feared a new upsurge as soon as President Clinton departs.
	   ``When the president leaves, we are left with the Palestinians
who do violence and follow up with incitement on education
television that tells their children to ... pursue terror and all
become suicide bombers,'' he said. ``That's got to change.''
	   When it changes, he said, ``We will be the first ones to move.''
	   Netanyahu, who is fighting to keep his shaky coalition
government together, conceded he was taking a hard line but said,
``I'm being very tough on things that are necessary for Israel to
survive and thrive in a difficult region.''
	   Although he narrowly avoided defeat in the Knesset last week and
faces another key vote next Monday, Netanyahu said he would not shy
away from elections. ``If we need them, we will have them. I don't
fear elections.''
	   With a grin, he added: ``I've always liked to confound and
disappoint those who write my political obituary.''
	   Perhaps the most difficult issue is the Palestinian demand for
the release of jailed activists involved in attacks on Israel.
Israel pledged to release 750 of the 1,700 in Israeli jails, but a
dispute has arisen over whether those released should be
politically affiliated inmates.
	   Israel released the first installment of 250 last month, but
most were common criminals. That spawned a series of violent
protests by Palestinians in the West Bank.
	   ``Believe me, it's a very emotional issue for me. I don't
release terrorist murderers. I don't care what their views are.
They're not in there for their political views. They're in jail
because they murdered people,'' said Netanyahu.
	   Sitting in the Cabinet room at the prime ministry, Netanyahu
criticized Clinton's remarks Monday in Gaza comparing the children
of jailed Palestinians to Israeli children who lost their fathers
in attacks.
	   ``There's a world of difference between the children of the
murderers who are in jail and the children of those who are
murdered,'' said Netanyahu. ``These murderers, some of them
murdered children.''
	   ``The last thing we should do is make any parallelism between
the murderers and their victims,'' said Netanyahu.
	   Clinton told the Palestine National Council he had been touched
by his encounters with Israeli and Palestinian children.
	   ``Those children brought tears to my eyes. We have to find a way
for both sets of children to get their lives back and to go
forward,'' said Clinton.

Report: Indonesian minister prepared to issue Suharto travel ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's justice minister said he
is prepared to impose an overseas travel ban on ex-President
Suharto if asked by anti-corruption investigators, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   Ex-autocrat Suharto was questioned by state prosecutors last
week over allegations that he abused his power to enrich his family
and cronies during 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   ``I believe (Suharto) will not try to escape. But if the
attorney general asked me today, I would immediately impose a
travel ban,'' the Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted Justice
Minister Muladi as telling a parliamentary committee.
	   The newsmagazine Gatra reported Monday that the 77-year-old
ex-leader apparently had no intention of leaving Indonesia.
	   ``I was born in Indonesia, helped develop Indonesia as well. I
have become part of Indonesia. And I want to die here in Indonesia.
So do not worry about me running away overseas,'' Juan Felix
Tampubolon, one of Suharto's lawyers, quoted his client as telling
prosecutors last week, Gatra reported.
	   Suharto quit office last May after a wave of riots and protests.
	   He has since denied any wrong doing despite accusations by
opponents that the Suharto clan has amassed a fortune through
corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   Student protests have clashed with security forces several times
recently to press their demand that Suharto be sent to trial.
	   No charges have been filed against Suharto.
	   Muladi has placed travel bans on other people involved in a
range of corruption cases, including two of Suharto's millionaire
sons, Bambang and Tommy.
	   Separately, a constitutional expert and legal adviser to Habibie
said the president would be exempt from questioning about his past
dealings with Suharto.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto, served briefly as his
vice president and for 20 years was his research and technology
minister.
	   Other ministers and former ministers have been questioned.
	   ``In theory, he's Suharto's crony, so he can be grilled also,
but not as long as he is still president,'' The Jakarta Post quoted
University of Indonesia law professor Ismail Suny as saying.
	   Suny said Habibie also had the power to dismiss Attorney General
Andi Muhamad Ghalib if he did not like the way the investigation
was proceeding.
	   Nevertheless, newspapers on Monday quoted State Secretary Akbar
Tanjung, a Habibie aide, as saying the president would be willing
to cooperate with investigators.
	   State lawyers investigated Suharto soon after his resignation,
but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   Habibie ordered a new investigation after a recent wave of
protests.

Puerto Rico will get statehood, movement's patriarch insists

<TEXT>
	   ``If we are American citizens, then we must be given the tools
that our fellow American citizens in the Continental U.S. have to
solve their problems; and these tools are equal rights under
statehood.''
	   _ Luis A. Ferre, testimony before a House Labor and Education
Committee panel, Nov. 23, 1949.
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Days before last weekend's Puerto
Rico vote on statehood, Luis A. Ferre, 94-year-old patriarch of the
statehood movement, visited the Abraham Lincoln and Thomas
Jefferson memorials in Washington.
	   ``After 50 years I went back to visit these two altars of
democracy, and I read again the words of these two great men whom I
admire,'' Ferre recalled Monday.
	   ``And I said, well, that is what we are doing in Puerto Rico.
... We have learned in the great school of American democracy these
great principles, and we are practicing them.''
	   From such moments come inspiration for Ferre, who after six
decades remains a tireless advocate in congressional circles of
making his beloved Puerto Rico the 51st member of the United
States.
	   That cause suffered a blow Sunday, when statehood came in second
to a ``none of the above'' option backed by Puerto Rico's
commonwealth party, 50 percent to 47 percent.
	   Statehood fared little better than in 1993, when the proposal
lost to the existing arrangement of a semi-autonomous commonwealth
by 49-46 percent.
	   But Ferre _ a millionaire philanthropist and the island's first
pro-statehood governor _ insisted Sunday's nonbinding vote, in
which 70 percent of the electorate cast ballots, will be seen as a
step forward.
	   For one thing, he said, the statehood party can claim the
biggest support on the island: The commonwealth party's support was
mixed with other protest votes under ``none of the above.''
	   For another, federal lawmakers have repeatedly assured Ferre _
who sits on the Republican National Committee _ that they will,
eventually, take up the issue. Washington's support for the
commonwealth _ a dlrs 10 billion annual proposition _ is eroding,
he maintained.
	   ``We think that the Republican Party is morally committed'' to
statehood, he said.
	   And in historical terms, statehood has grown in strength, up
from just 20 percent support when commonwealth status was adopted
in 1952, Ferre said.
	   ``I have been at it for 60 years _ since 1938,'' Ferre said in
an interview at his Fundacion Luis A. Ferre offices in San Juan.
``I am convinced that this is the only way out.''
	   There are some signs his vision could bear fruit. Republican
Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana on Monday embraced the call for a
federally mandated voting process that will eliminate the
commonwealth and leave Puerto Ricans two choices: statehood or
independence.
	   Ferre, venerated among Puerto Ricans as ``Don Luis,'' also wants
such a clear choice.
	   He acknowledged that Sunday's vote confused voters and could
have been handled better.
	   Voters were offered five options: independence, statehood, a
``free association'' form of independence with U.S. treaty ties,
commonwealth, and ``none of the above.''
	   Puerto Rico's commonwealth party supported ``none of the above''
because it disputed the ballot definition of commonwealth, which
stated that Puerto Rico is under the full powers of the U.S.
Congress.
	   ``I think that it was not wise to confuse the people with this
kind of column,'' Ferre said of ``none of the above.''
	   In addition, he said, statehood votes were siphoned away by a
last-minute campaign by former Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, a
commonwealth supporter. Hernandez Colon argued _ wrongly, Ferre
said _ that in a transition period Puerto Ricans might have to pay
federal taxes before they obtained representation in Washington
under statehood.
	   Ferre was a member of the assembly that produced Puerto Rico's
1952 constitution, founded the pro-statehood New Progressive Party
in 1967 and was governor from 1969 to 1972.
	   He opened the Ponce Museum of Art in 1959 with 120 paintings
from his own collection. Renowned worldwide, it now houses more
than 500 paintings, including several noted pre-Raphaelites, and
hundreds of sculptures and artifacts.
	   But one dream has remained elusive.
	   ``I dreamt that I could do it, but I knew it would not be
simple,'' Ferre said, recalling his early advocacy of statehood for
his Spanish-speaking island.
	   The arguments remain the same: Statehood will promote
development in Puerto Rico, boosting demand for U.S. goods; Puerto
Ricans have paid their dues in all U.S. wars this century; they've
embraced democracy with a vengeance; Puerto Rico would enrich the
mainland's culture and provide a commercial bridge to Latin
America.
	   ``I hope I will live to see a final meeting of the minds between
Puerto Rico and statehood,'' Ferre said. ``But if I don't live that
long, I am certain it will happen.''

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Anti-corruption officials in Hong Kong said
Tuesday that they have arrested 13 people, including several former
and current jockeys, for allegedly fixing two horse races.
	   The jockeys are suspected of having been bribed to manipulate
the results of two races in 1996 through a middleman who was an
apprentice jockey at the time, a statement from the Independent
Commission Against Corruption said.
	   They allegedly accepted one million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
128 million) for each race, it said.
	   Those arrested included four jockeys, three apprentice jockeys,
four former apprentice jockeys and two others, the statement said.
	   Earlier this year, a Hong Kong court sentenced a businessman to
3 1/2 years in jail after he was found guilty of offering bribes to
jockeys to fix horse races.
	   The Jockey Club operates Hong Kong's only legal gambling and its
races generate huge revenues, which the club funnels to charities.

Little to celebrate at NBA Christmas party

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ There was little to celebrate when the NBA threw
its annual Christmas party while the lockout claimed more games,
threatened more jobs and was on the verge of costing the players
another paycheck.
	   Commissioner David Stern attended the party Monday at the new
NBA Store, which was closed to the public for almost four hours in
another ``lockout'' of sorts.
	   The real lockout entered its 168th day Tuesday, and 287 games
have been canceled in a dispute between owners and players on how
to divide dlrs 2 billion in revenue. Tuesday is the third missed
payday for the players.
	   Since the lockout began, more than 100 employees have left the
league office, cutting the staff to about 750.
	   Spokesman Brian McIntyre said all the workers left voluntarily,
and Stern said some of the remaining employees could face layoffs
if the season is canceled.
	   The league has had a hiring freeze and payroll freeze since July
1, and Stern has not been drawing his salary.
	   ``We're still hoping to make a deal, so we haven't contemplated
that yet. But obviously that would affect the situation
dramatically,'' Stern said.
	   ``Right now, we're 125 positions reduced from where we were in
June through attrition and the elimination of part-time work and
the like,'' Stern said. ``We're achieving very successful cutbacks
without mandating layoffs.''
	   A constant throng of holiday shoppers stopped outside the new
NBA Store on Fifth Avenue, but they were turned away by a pair of
league employees standing guard at the door.
	   The store, which sells a variety of basketball merchandise, was
closed to the public from 2:15 p.m. until about 6 p.m. for the NBA
office party.
	   ``I was going to buy a shirt for my son, but I can't because
they are closed,'' said Robert Gambardella, an electrician from
Staten Island. ``They must be having a good year in order to close
the store. Why didn't they just have it after hours?''
	   Almost all league employees have been instructed not to speak to
the media regarding the lockout. However, a handful said they were
not concerned about having to find employment elsewhere.
	   ``No. Not at all,'' employee Johnnie Banks said. ``I'm not
worried.''
	   There are no scheduled talks between the league and the union.
The two sides met Saturday for less than 30 minutes, one of their
shortest meetings of the 5 1/2-month-old dispute.
	   Hunter did not receive an invitation to the party, so an
agreement will have to wait at least one more day. The union, it
should be noted, will hold its Christmas party Dec. 21.

Palestinian-U.S. relations warmed by Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ten years after the United States began an
experimental dialogue with representatives of Yasser Arafat's PLO,
mutual suspicions are fading and friendship is growing.
	   And the Palestinians say they have Bill Clinton to thank for it.
	   In a speech in front of hundreds of Palestinian leaders, some
aging guerrillas, the U.S. president was repeatedly applauded and
greeted with open arms in territory where U.S. flags are more
likely to be burned than waved.
	   ``I hope you have begun to see America as your friend.'' Clinton
said in a historic address to the Palestinian parliament-in-exile
during a visit to Gaza, the first by an American president to
Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   In 1988, after a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in which
Arafat said he would recognize Israel, the United States decided to
change course and meet with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
	   At the time, Palestinians feared the United States, Israel's
staunchest ally, would never truly understand or support their
aspirations.
	   The United States provides economic and military aid to Israel.
It's foreign policies regarding Iraq, Iran and Sudan are viewed by
many Palestinians as anti-Muslim and anti-Arab.
	   On Monday, Clinton addressed each concern and made a special
note of a recent international donor pledge of nearly dlrs 1
billion to help the fledgeling Palestinian economy.
	   ``When it comes to relations between the United States and
Palestinians, we have come far to overcome our misperceptions of
each other,'' Clinton said. ``Americans have come to appreciate the
strength of your identity and the depth of your aspirations. And we
have learned to listen to your grievances as well.''
	   Hoping to assure Palestinians the United States was an honest
broker in the peace process it helped begin, Clinton told the
Palestinian people they are free to ``determine their own destiny
on their own land,'' a comment interpreted by Palestinians and even
Israelis as U.S. recognition of their statehood dreams.
	   The emotional speech was a turning point in relations, said
James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in
Washington, who helped get U.S.-Palestinian talks off the ground a
decade ago.,
	   ``Some of the biggest battles, recognition of the Palestinians
as a real people and ending stereotypes was achieved,'' Zogby said.
``We know can refer to this moment as the date when it became
possible to have a different discussion about Palestinians.''
	   Nasser Qidweh, the Palestinian representative to the United
Nations, characterized Clinton's remarks as an ``assertion of
Palestinian rights and will hopefully be translated into full
support for Palestinian independence.''
	   Zogby attributes the evolving friendship to Clinton's personal
devotion to the peace process and also, in part, to the hard-line
policies of the current Israeli government that unseated the dovish
Labor Party in 1996 and opposes Palestinian statehood.
	   ``Americans now see Israelis as just as responsible for harming
chances for peace as the Palestinians,'' he said, citing recent
opinion polls conducted by the institute.
	   Many in Netanyahu's government view the strengthening ties with
ambivalence. Nissim Smoliansky, a member of the right-wing National
Religious Party in Netanyahu's coalition, said Clinton purposely
tried to make Palestinians believe he was supporting statehood.
``We lost a lot,'' he said.
	   Zoe Danon Gedal, a research fellow at the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy, said the relationship would probably have
evolved regardless of changes in Israeli governments.
	   ``Even if Shimon Peres had won the 1996 elections, I think the
American-Palestinian relationship would have been going through the
same evolution _ it just wouldn't have bothered anyone,'' Gedal
said.
	   She said Clinton was in ``the unique position of having the
trust of both sides.'' Remarks by Hillary Rodham Clinton earlier
this year in support of Palestinian statehood helped win
Palestinian trust, she said.
	   The president, his wife and daughter Chelsea were making a
second stop to Palestinian-held areas Tuesday _ the West Bank city
of Bethlehem _ to light the Christmas tree above the place where
the Bible says Jesus was born.

Statehood backers receive unexpected boost from White House

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Supporters of statehood for Puerto
Rico got an unexpected boost from President Bill Clinton, who
suggested that their cause was not dead despite its defeat in a
public referendum.
	   That, together with a supportive statement from pro-statehood
Republican Rep. Dan Burton, bolstered Gov. Pedro Rossello's plans
to persevere with his crusade to make the Spanish-speaking
Caribbean island the 51st state.
	   Rossello argued at a news conference Monday that the statehood
movement had won in Sunday's nonbinding referendum, even though it
lost to a ``none of the above'' option backed by supporters of the
island's existing commonwealth status, 50 percent to 47 percent.
	   The independence option won only 2 percent _ underscoring that
while Puerto Ricans may be ambivalent about statehood, they have
little interest in ending a century of U.S. rule.
	   The pro-commonwealth party backed ``none of the above'' because
it disagreed with the definition of commonwealth listed on the
ballot. The definition stated that Puerto Rico is under the full
powers of the U.S. Congress and suggested that Congress could
revoke the islanders' U.S. citizenship.
	   Statehood, Rossello claimed, won a huge majority among people
who chose one of the actual definitions.
	   Backers of commonwealth status and the local media heaped scorn
on Rossello's argument.
	   But Clinton _ despite impeachment proceedings in Washington and
the rigors of a peacemaking trip to the Middle East _ found time to
issue a statement that noted that ``a majority of the vote was not
for any of the options.''
	   ``Among the rest, the overwhelming majority supported
statehood,'' Clinton said. ``I remain committed to implementing a
majority choice for Puerto Rico's future status.'' He pledged to
work with Congress and Puerto Ricans ``to clarify the choice.''
	   Rossello told a news conference that ``once the new Congress is
constituted, that will be the appropriate time to send the results
... saying to the Congress and the president, 'You respond to these
results.'''
	   He said that response might include another referendum.
	   Rossello's biggest rival, pro-commonwealth San Juan Mayor Sila
Calderon, said Monday that her Popular Democratic Party might agree
to another vote _ but only if a victory for commonwealth guaranteed
no further challenges to that status, which the United States
imposed as a temporary measure 46 years ago.
	   In the last referendum, in 1993, the commonwealth option beat
statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   The semi-autonomous arrangement devised in 1952 allows Puerto
Rico some trappings of an independent nation, like an Olympic team.
And although they pay no federal taxes, Puerto Ricans have U.S.
citizenship and received billions of dollars in federal aid.
	   Burton, a Republican from Indiana, warned Monday that given the
minuscule support _ less than 1 percent _ won by the commonwealth
definition on the ballot, ``and given the enormous economic burden
placed on the overtaxed American people, the Congress should, and
more than likely will, re-evaluate the federal subsidy of the
current status.''
	   Burton anticipated ``a long process'' that ultimately would
offer Puerto Ricans just two choices: independence or statehood.
	   That scenario, one many Puerto Ricans would prefer to avoid,
would likely produce a victory for statehood since Puerto Ricans
prize their U.S. citizenship.
	   ``We cherish our U.S. citizenship _ but we are Puerto Ricans,''
Calderon said Monday.
	   Puerto Rico-born Rep. Jose Cerrano, a New York Democrat, also
said the commonwealth arrangement is ``colonial'' and that Puerto
Ricans should choose between statehood and independence.
	   But at least one U.S. lawmaker said it was unlikely that
Washington would accept Rossello's reasoning.
	   ``It is disappointing to see the statehood forces subvert the
will of the people now that the balloting is over and now that the
statehood option has clearly failed,'' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an
Illinois Democrat of Puerto Rican descent.
	   Rossello called Sunday's vote in frustration after legislation
to hold a binding referendum died in the Senate after passing the
House by one vote. The measure was blocked by Republicans who fear
that making a Puerto Rican state would send mainly Democrats to
Congress.
	   Opponents also argue that statehood would cost the federal
government even more, while the majority of Puerto Ricans would
earn too little to pay federal taxes.

 &UR; Judge disallows defense pleas on police conspiracy

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for jailed dissident Anwar
Ibrahim erupted in anger Tuesday after the judge hearing the
controversial sex and corruption case blocked their attempts to
prove police had fabricated evidence.
	   ``Mala fide is a very serious issue which you are brushing
aside,'' Raja Aziz Adrusse, Anwar's chief attorney, told Judge
Augustine Paul. Mala fide is the legal expression for bad
intention.
	   Raja Aziz protested after another defense lawyer was stopped
from questioning a senior police official on whether two of Anwar's
allies had been coerced into confessing having illegal sex with the
former deputy prime minister.
	   ``You should be careful of your words. As a senior lawyer, you
should treat the court with respect,'' Judge Paul retorted.
	   Raja Aziz persisted: ``We have to establish facts to show mala
fide. We want to show that police have been consistently getting
witnesses to fabricate evidence.''
	   Tempers flared soon after prosecutors presented a gray-colored
spring mattress, which they say had semen stains, as evidence to
show that Anwar had indulged in extramarital sex with his former
secretary's wife.
	   Anwar's lawyers were trying to prove Tuesday that police had
forced his adopted brother, Sukma Dermawan, and his former speech
writer, Munawar Aness, to confess in a court that they had been
sodomized by Anwar.
	   Of the 10 counts, the more serious charges against Anwar are
ones relating to sodomy. He is being tried now for four counts of
abuse of power to cover up his alleged sexual misdeeds.
	   In separate affidavits, Sukma and Munawar, who are both serving
six-month sentences for homosexual acts, have alleged that they
were tortured by police to make their guilty pleas earlier this
year. Appeals against their conviction are pending in court.
	   ``Dr. Munawar said he had never had homosexual relations with
Anwar or anybody else. He was forced through torture and
humiliation by the police to fabricate evidence against Anwar,''
said Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's lawyers, before the judge
stopped him.
	   Defense lawyers have tried to argue that Anwar was a victim of a
political conspiracy involving senior politicians. Anwar, who was
fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has denied the charges,
saying they were fabricated to eliminate a political challenge.

More than 11,000 teachers strike for back wages in Siberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Some 11,500 teachers in the eastern Siberian
region of Buryatia went on an indefinite strike Tuesday to demand
months of back wages, a news report said.
	   According to local officials, classes were suspended at 245, or
about a third, of the region's schools because of the strike, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The teachers are owed 289 million rubles (dlrs 14 million) in
back pay, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The government has accumulated millions of rubles (dollars) in
wage debts to state employees since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Some workers have taken desperate measures, including hunger
strikes and suicide, to protest their condition.

	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Before heading home to resume
his struggle against impeachment, U.S. President Bill Clinton made
a final stab Tuesday at getting the Wye River peace accords back on
track.
	   He brought Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat together for the first time since the Maryland shore
conference.
	   Clinton's No. 1 goal is to persuade the Israeli prime minister
to resume a partial troop pullback on the West Bank.
	   White House officials had hoped for a three-way meeting as a
followup to their Wye River negotiations but it had not been on the
president's original Mideast trip schedule.
	   Before Clinton arrived at this border crossing between Gaza and
Israel, Netanyahu stood outside the building, waiting for Arafat.
The two leaders shook hands then walked into the building.
	   Even though Arafat led the Palestine National Council into
nullifying calls for Israel's destruction on Monday, Clinton's task
appeared difficult on the third and final day of a trip to the
region.

	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Before heading home to resume
his struggle against impeachment, U.S. President Bill Clinton made
a final stab Tuesday at getting the Wye River peace accords back on
track.
	   He brought Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat together for the first time since they signed a peace
agreement at the White House in October.
	   Clinton's No. 1 goal is to persuade the Israeli prime minister
to resume a partial troop pullback on the West Bank.
	   White House officials had hoped for a three-way meeting as a
followup to their Wye River negotiations but it had not been on the
president's original Mideast trip schedule.
	   Before Clinton arrived at this border crossing between Gaza and
Israel, Netanyahu stood outside the building, waiting for Arafat.
The two leaders shook hands then walked into the building.
	   As the leaders met, sitting in reclining leather chairs in a
small auditorium which is the headquarters of the Israeli army
commander, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``The
president is trying to renew the momentum of the Wye peace
accord.''
	   He described the atmosphere as ``businesslike.''

Bank chief: Australian economy strong but will slow next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's economy survived the
Asian financial crisis in 1998 but was set for slower economic
growth and a widening current account deficit next year, the head
of the central bank said Tuesday.
	   Ian Macfarlane, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said
a recent decision to slice official cash rates despite strong
growth was in anticipation of slower growth in 1999.
	   ``Our judgment was that even though most of the data coming in
was still suggesting good growth, the likelihood was that growth
would decline in 1999,'' Macfarlane told a parliamentary committee.
	   ``The external environment will remain difficult.''
	   Macfarlane said economic growth in Australia for 1998 was
expected to be four percent, up from the three percent he forecast
earlier this year.
	   He said the stronger growth had caused unemployment to edge
down.
	   Inflation was likely to be two percent at the end of the year,
while the current account deficit looked set to average five
percent of gross domestic product in 1998.
	   ``Australia's economic performance has exceeded our
expectations, and to my knowledge the expectations of virtually all
forecasters,'' Macfarlane said.
	   But the outlook for next year was not as good, with a slowdown
inevitable due to the weaker outlook for the world economy.
	   Economic growth was likely to fall to between 2.5 and 3.0
percent in 1998-99, he said.
	   Macfarlane said lower commodity prices could lead to a widening
in the current account deficit to about 5.5 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1998-99.
	   ``This set of outcomes or something like it would represent a
good performance for an economy in its eighth year of expansion,
facing a difficult but not disastrous external environment,'' he
said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Top seed Tamarine Tanasugarn, host
Thailand's hope for a tennis gold medal, advanced to the Asian
Games women's semifinals Tuesday with a 6-0, 6-4 victory over
Japan's Yuka Yoshida.
	   Tamarine, ranked No. 37 by the WTA, lost her serve three times
in the second set, but cashed in seven of 10 break points in the
baseline battle. Her ground strokes produced 14 winners, to four
for Yoshida.
	   China's Yi Jingqian also advanced, beating Irina Selyutina of
Kazakstan 6-1, 6-0.

third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia, No. 56, won their
quarterfinal matches Monday.
	   In men's quarterfinals, South Korea's Yoon Yong-il beat Japan's
Takahiro Terachi 7-5, 6-4, and India's Srinath Prahlad defeated
Uzbekistan's Vadim Kutsenko 6-4, 6-2.
	   India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st in the ATP
rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. He was the
only Asian in the rankings' top 100.

Cambodia sits on sidelines at Southeast Asian summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodia sat on the sidelines as a summit
of Southeast Asian leaders opened Tuesday, once again relegated to
observer status because of political turmoil at home.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had lobbied hard for
admission to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, did save
some face by being seated in the front row during the opening
ceremony.
	   In speech after speech, Hun Sen was assured Cambodia would soon
become the final member of the Southeast Asian brotherhood, as
envisioned when ASEAN was founded in 1967.
	   It will be admitted, the leaders said, in a ceremony in Hanoi
next year.
	   The nine-member group decided late Monday to admit Cambodia but
not in time for the summit, saying the long-troubled nation needs
more time to fully establish the credibility of a newly installed
coalition government.
	   ``We don't want to risk ASEAN being damaged by Cambodia,''
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said.
	   Much international criticism has been heaped on ASEAN for its
admission of Myanmar, also known as Burma, which is plagued by a
dismal human rights record.
	   Cambodia originally was scheduled to join ASEAN last year, but
before that could happen, Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a violent coup.
	   Now that a coalition government is in place in Phnom Penh, Hun
Sen has made entry into ASEAN a priority, seeing it as key to
establishing international legitimacy.
	   Earlier this month, the United Nations gave Cambodia a seat in
the world body after a 15-month vacancy.
	   Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines opposed Cambodia's entry
into ASEAN at this juncture.
	   ``There's no division within ASEAN on Cambodia's admission,''
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said. ``What is really at
issue is should we rush to make them a member at this Hanoi summit
or let them get all aspects of their own announced arrangements
implemented.''
	   Vietnam, Hun Sen's biggest backer, lost its battle to get its
former enemy admitted to ASEAN before the two-day summit.
	   ``From the bottom of our heart, we wish the Kingdom of Cambodia
peace, stability and prosperity,'' Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said during his speech Tuesday.
	   Khai said his country would be honored to host the induction
ceremony.
	   Hun Sen had earlier threatened to boycott the summit if Cambodia
was not admitted this time around. But assurances of pending entry
appeared to appease him.
	   ``It's just a question of the ceremony that needs to be done,''
he told reporters Monday night.

Yeltsin in Kremlin to meet with foreign ambassadors

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was in his office in the
Kremlin on Tuesday, where he was to hold a welcoming ceremony for
new ambassadors to Russia, his press center said.
	   Yeltsin was to greet new ambassadors from Albania, China, India,
Luxembourg, and other countries, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Though still recovering, Yeltsin was released from a hospital
last week after receiving treatment for pneumonia for more than two
weeks. He has stayed at a country residence outside the capital
since then, making occasional trips into the Kremlin.
	   Despite his repeated ailments, Yeltsin insists he will serve out
his term, which runs until the year 2000. He has looked healthy and
animated in public appearances since his release from the hospital.

Dollar rises against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks, midafternoon dollar, bond
prices; Yasuda Trust and Banking takes an ampersand.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged Tuesday following remarks by
the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency indicating a recent
rise in the yen was overdone. Japanese stock prices closed lower.
	   The dollar bought 116.74 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.12
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 115.49 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 100.43 points,
or 0.71 percent, to close the day at 14,011.19. On Monday, the
average closed down 294.02 points, or 2.04 percent.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar was boosted by
comments from EPA Director-General Taichi Sakaiya, who indicated a
recent rally by the yen came faster than expected and could hurt
exporters important to the economy, traders said.
	   That prompted speculation the yen was poised to fall. Investors
scrambled to cover short, or oversold, positions in reaction to the
remarks, which fueled the dollar's gain.
	   The dollar hit an intraday high of 116.87 yen, up from its
morning low of 115.40 yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices retreated for a fourth
day in a row amid worry more weak financial institutions could be
placed under state control after the nationalization of Nippon
Credit Bank Ltd. on Sunday.
	   ``There seem to be continuing fears that NCB may not be the last
bank'' to be nationalized, said Yuichi Kohashi of Daiwa Securities
Co.
	   Low-priced banking stocks such as Yasuda Trust and Banking were
among the hardest hit. One of the biggest decliners, the stock sank
to a new low for the year in intraday trading.
	   Concern over a report showing worsening business sentiment among
Japanese companies also pushed share prices down, traders said.
	   The closely-watched report, issued Monday by Japan's central
bank, showed business confidence to be worse than expected.
	   ``The market is in a very precarious state,'' said Louis Tseng,
the head of derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``The
likelihood of it going down is much greater than it going up.''
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 11.04 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,089.27. The
TOPIX closed down 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.270 percent, unchanged from Monday's
finish. Its price remained at 104.49 yen.

India won't negotiate away right to nuclear deterrent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister said Tuesday he
would not negotiate away his country's right to a nuclear defense,
including the missiles to carry the bombs.
	   But Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also reiterated his
commitment to bringing into force an international ban on nuclear
weapons testing. He was responding to questions in parliament about
the progress of talks with the United States on India's nuclear
policy that opened following its May underground nuclear tests.
	   Neighboring Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars in
the past 50 years, responded with its own underground tests.
	   After the tests, Vajpayee had said India needed nuclear weapons
because its neighbors China and Pakistan had them. He said Tuesday
India was determined to have a ``minimum credible deterrent.''
	   ``I wish to advise the house that the talks (with the United
States) are premised on this basis,'' he said.
	   The ongoing talks between his envoy Jaswant Singh and U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, of which six rounds have
already been held, have been marked by ``sense of responsibility,
candor and a sincere attempt to understand each other's concerns
and points of view,'' Vajpayee told Parliament.
	   Washington signaled its satisfaction with progress made earlier
this month, when U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted some of the
economic sanctions imposed to punish India and Pakistan for their
nuclear tests.
	   U.S. officials praised a moratorium announced by both countries
on further nuclear testing, their promises to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by September 1999, and their
commitments to controlling the production and transfer of nuclear
materials.
	   But the United States still wants both nations to sign the test
ban treaty, issue a formal moratorium on fissile material
production and adopt restraints on nuclear-capable missiles and
aircraft.
	   Vajpayee has never clearly promised to sign the test ban treaty,
but said again Tuesday he supports its coming into force by
September. The treaty as it is now written cannot come into force
without India's signature.
	   Vajpayee added in his speech to parliament that India could not
unilaterally end production of the fissile materials used to make
nuclear weapons, but was participating in talks in Geneva aimed at
an international production ban. He also said India ``will not
accept any restraints'' on developing missiles capable of carrying
nuclear warheads. Work on India's extended range Agni missile
continued, he said.

Kazakstan's parliament approves 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's parliament has approved a 1999 budget
which will leave the Central Asian nation with a sizable budget
deficit next year, a news report said.
	   The budget, approved Monday, predicts revenues of 291.7 billion
tenge (dlrs 3.4 billion) and expenditures of 354 billion tenge
(dlrs 4.1 billion), according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A third of the deficit will be paid for by foreign loans that
have been agreed upon already. Investment projects and state bonds
will cover the rest, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Kazakstan has struggled like most former Soviet republics to get
its economy off the ground in the 1990s, despite having massive oil
reserves.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Eager to get home to their families
and relax over the holidays, Endeavour's astronauts finished
packing up the space shuttle today for their late-night return to
Earth.
	   The shuttle was due back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
at 10:54 p.m. EST, although cloudy skies threatened to force a
delay.
	   If the first landing attempt were scrapped, the astronauts could
try again 90 minutes later. If that also failed, they would have
four additional opportunities to land on Wednesday _ two at Kennedy
and two at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
	   Endeavour has enough water and fuel to stay in orbit until
Thursday, and shuttle commander Robert Cabana said his crew
wouldn't mind a little more time to take in the view.
	   ``We'd be willing to stay here as long as we had the
capability,'' he said.
	   But some of the astronauts said they had work to do back on
Earth _ namely, a little last-minute Christmas shopping.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' said Nancy Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The astronauts gave NASA an early Christmas gift in the form of
a 77-foot international space station.
	   During their 12-day mission, they connected and wired together
the first two pieces of the outpost _ the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American Unity chamber. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The space station was released from the shuttle's cargo bay on
Sunday. Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow continue to
monitor it. The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   On Monday, the astronauts enjoyed some free time before they got
to work stowing gear for the ride home. They also released an Air
Force science satellite.

Study confirms long-term benefits of allergy shots, researchers
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A new study confirms the long-term benefits of
allergy shots, which virtually cured some children of their
reactivity to dust mites in a 10-year study in Japan, researchers
reported.
	   Allergy shots have been dogged by controversy despite their use
for 80 years. Two well-publicized U.S. studies two years ago found
they worked no better than the relatively new corticosteroid
inhalers for severe asthmatics.
	   But an expert not involved in any of the research said Monday
that most studies worldwide show that allergy shots work well when
they are properly prepared, given for the correct problem and
administered in high enough doses.
	   ``The preponderance of validated, peer-reviewed, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies shows immunotherapy effective for
allergic rhinitis, asthma and for insect-sting allergy,'' said Dr.
Ira Finegold, assistant chief of allergy and infectious disease at
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center in New York.
	   Immunotherapy is the medical term for allergy shots.
	   Allergic rhinitis is what many sufferers wrongly identify as
``sinus'' or ``year-round hay fever'' or a cold that won't go away
_ a runny or stuffy nose, itchy eyes, sneezing and coughing,
Finegold said.
	   Much misunderstanding and ignorance exists among doctors
themselves, who are not taught in medical school about treating
allergies, said Finegold, past president of the American College of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.
	   Many doctors who treat allergies fail to use properly prepared
extracts for shots or fail to give doses high enough to work, he
said.
	   Also, patients must get the shots for three or four years,
usually weekly at first and then tapering to monthly, to develop an
immune response to the offending substance.
	   Unlike drug therapies, allergy shots attack the underlying cause
of allergies, rather than just the symptoms, so patients achieve
more long-term recovery with less long-term treatment, Finegold
said.
	   Some appear to achieve a virtual cure, said Finegold and the
authors of the new study, published in the December issue of the
Archives of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, an American
Medical Association journal.
	   The study tracked the blood chemistry and allergic symptoms in
two groups of children allergic to dust mites. One group received
shots and the other drug treatment, in this case, cromolyn sodium,
a medicine marketed over-the-counter in the United States as
Normalcrom.
	   Ten of the 19 children who received allergy shots were
symptom-free at the study's end, and a year after treatment ended,
none had reported a return of symptoms, said the authors, led by
Dr. Yoshihiro Ohashi of the Osaka City University Medical School in
Osaka.

Malaysia, Singapore leaders illustrate divisions in ASEAN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The leaders of Malaysia and Singapore
presented starkly different views Tuesday of how Southeast Asia
should recover from its financial crisis, illustrating the
divisions plaguing a regional summit.
	   In opening speeches at the annual summit of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
blamed the global financial system for much of the region's
economic woes.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, however, said ASEAN must
solve its own economic problems and liberalize its markets more
quickly to prove it is not backing away from the world economy.
	   ``If we show that we can take the right policy decisions, and
are prepared to reform where necessary and whatever the pain to
vested interests, we will slowly regain international confidence,''
Goh said.
	   ``If we cannot do so, market confidence in our economies and in
ASEAN will be further eroded. Potential investors will stay away,
jeopardizing our economic recovery,'' he said.
	   Goh said a plan to be announced by the leaders to accelerate
trade and investment liberalization _ reached after several days of
difficult negotiations by Cabinet ministers _ was a ``good start''
but should be followed by more.
	   ``We can accelerate the pace,'' he said. ``In the midst of our
economic difficulties, this will be a powerful signal that we will
keep our markets free, that we will remain plugged into the global
economy, and that we are determined to move forward with
liberalization.''
	   Mahathir, however, said it was wrong to blame countries in the
region for the economic crisis, and accused foreign investors of
having ``abused'' free markets, forcing Malaysia to impose controls
on currency trading.
	   A regional economic recovery, he said, depends on global
financial reforms, including controls on sudden flows of money out
of countries.
	   Mahathir welcomed a decision in October by finance ministers of
seven industrialized nations to strengthen the international
financial system, but said ASEAN's views must be included.
	   ``We must remember that they are looking at it from their
exalted position. Our problems may not receive their attention. We
have to find a more suitable forum to discuss our needs,'' he said.
	   In contrast, Goh said globalization could confer ``huge
benefits'' if countries in the region are ready for competition.
	   Increased free trade and competition among ASEAN countries, he
said, would help them prepare for the ``stronger winds of
globalization.''
	   Mahathir and Goh both acknowledged that the differing views
within ASEAN toward the economic crisis had created divisions
inside the organization, which consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
	   It has ``created the impression of an ASEAN in disarray, its
members at odds with each other,'' Mahathir said.
	   Goh said the strains had loosened ASEAN cohesiveness.
	   The glue which binds the 31-year-old group now ``must be
strengthened to hold together a more disparate ASEAN,'' he said.

Report: Indonesian minister prepared to issue Suharto travel ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with protest, graf 2,3

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's justice minister said he
is prepared to impose an overseas travel ban on ex-President
Suharto if asked by anti-corruption investigators, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   Also about 300 students protested outside the justice ministry
demanding that Suharto be put on trial immediately for graft.
	   Tuesday's peaceful protest was held about 500 meters (yards)
from the heavily guarded presidential palace. Students have clashed
with security forces several times recently to press their demand
that Suharto be charged.
	   The ex-autocrat was questioned by state prosecutors last week
over allegations that he abused his power to enrich his family and
cronies during 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   ``I believe (Suharto) will not try to escape. But if the
attorney general asked me today, I would immediately impose a
travel ban,'' the Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted Justice
Minister Muladi as telling a parliamentary committee.
	   The newsmagazine Gatra reported Monday that the 77-year-old
ex-leader apparently had no intention of leaving Indonesia.
	   ``I was born in Indonesia, helped develop Indonesia as well. I
have become part of Indonesia. And I want to die here in Indonesia.
So do not worry about me running away overseas,'' Juan Felix
Tampubolon, one of Suharto's lawyers, quoted his client as telling
prosecutors last week, Gatra reported.
	   Suharto quit office last May after a wave of riots and protests.
	   He has since denied any wrong doing despite accusations by
opponents that the Suharto clan has amassed a fortune through
corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   No charges have been filed against Suharto.
	   Muladi has placed travel bans on other people involved in a
range of corruption cases, including two of Suharto's millionaire
sons, Bambang and Tommy.
	   Separately, a constitutional expert and legal adviser to
President B.J. Habibie said the president would be exempt from
questioning about his past dealings with Suharto.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto, served briefly as his
vice president and for 20 years was his research and technology
minister.
	   Other ministers and former ministers have been questioned.
	   ``In theory, he's Suharto's crony, so he can be grilled also,
but not as long as he is still president,'' The Jakarta Post quoted
University of Indonesia law professor Ismail Suny as saying.
	   Suny said Habibie also had the power to dismiss Attorney General
Andi Muhamad Ghalib if he did not like the way the investigation
was proceeding.
	   Nevertheless, newspapers on Monday quoted State Secretary Akbar
Tanjung, a Habibie aide, as saying the president would be willing
to cooperate with investigators.
	   State lawyers investigated Suharto soon after his resignation,
but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   Habibie ordered a new investigation after a recent wave of
protests.

Japan central bank decides to maintain current monetary policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese central bank's policy board voted
Tuesday to leave its monetary policy unchanged, a move likely to
keep key interest rates at a record-low.
	   The Bank of Japan's current overnight call rate _ the rate banks
charge each other for overnight loans _ is around 0.25 percent.
	   In September, the BOJ guided the rate down from around 0.5
percent in an effort to prevent Japan from falling into a
deflationary spiral.
	   The move marked the first change in monetary policy since
September 1995, when the BOJ cut its official discount rate, the
rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to a record low 0.5
percent.
	   The bank's nine-member board convenes every two weeks to discuss
monetary policy and economic developments.

Explosion in illegal Chinese mine kills 29, leaves 35 feared dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A small Chinese coal mine was operating in
defiance of government orders to close when an explosion killed as
many as 64 miners, the Worker's Daily reported Tuesday.
	   Only 12 of the 76 people working in the Daying No. 1 mine in
central China's Henan province were rescued after the gas explosion
on Saturday, the state-run newspaper reported. It said 29 were
killed and 35 were missing and feared dead.
	   Baofeng county officials ordered small mines to close for
inspections after an explosion at an illegal coal mine killed 28
miners on Sept. 18. Inspectors found serious problems at Daying No.
1, but the mine continued to operate despite several orders to
close, it said.
	   The central government is trying to close small illegal mines
throughout the country because of lax safety standards, heavy
pollution and oversupply.

Flooding claims 22 lives in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The latest bout of flooding in central
Vietnam has killed 22 people, local officials said Tuesday.
	   Tropical storms Gil and Faith, which hit the area Thursday and
Friday, dumped up to 500 millimeters (25 inches) of rain on the
area and submerged large swaths of land.
	   Provincial floods and storms control committees said 13 people
were killed in Khanh Hoa province, seven in neighboring Binh Dinh
province and two in Phu Yen. Large areas of newly planted rice
fields were destroyed.
	   Khanh Hoa officials said 226 houses were destroyed in that
province alone.
	   Three floods last month killed 267 people and caused damage of
some dlrs 90 million to the 12 central provinces, a huge amount for
one of the country's poorest regions.
	   Until mid-August, the region was suffering from its worst
drought in at least half a century.

South Korea wins semifinal against China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with Japan-Taiwan semifinal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kim Byung-hyun pitched six innings of
hitless relief and struck out 12 and Park Jae-hong hit two home
runs as South Korea beat China 9-2 Tuesday in the Asian Games
baseball semifinals.
	   In Wednesday's final, the Koreans will play the winner of
Tuesday's later semifinal, between Japan and Taiwan.
	   South Korea didn't need Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho
against the relatively inexperienced Chinese. Kim Won-hyong gave up
two second-inning runs and three hits before Kim Byung-hyun came on
and didn't allow a man on base. He struck out the first eight
batters he faced.
	   The Koreans scored one run in the first and went ahead to stay,
3-2, on Park Jae-hong's first homer of the game in the third, after
Park Han-yi had doubled.
	   Lee Byung-kyu and Park Jae-hong both homered in the fourth,
putting Korea up 5-2.
	   Back-to-back home runs in the fifth by Back Jae-ho and Shim
Jae-hak increased Korea's margin to 7-2. A Chinese pickoff at first
of leadoff batter Kang Hyuk ahead of Back's homer averted another
possible run.
	   In the eighth, Korean leadoff batter Lee Byung-kyu reached first
on a passed ball third strike, moved to second and third on
consecutive ground-outs, and scored on a double by Kim Dong-joo.
Kang Hyuk doubled home Kim for the final 9-2.
	   Chinese pitcher Ye Mingqiang yielded seven runs on 10 hits _
including five home runs _ in 4 1/3 innings, taking the loss, and
Wang Zhanpeng gave up two runs on four hits over the last 3 2/3.
	   China had topped the Pool B competition with lopsided victories
against the Philippines and Thailand. Korea finished atop Pool A,
with Japan second.

	   The winter meetings produced more than a half-dozen deals
Monday, plus this juicy tidbit: Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams was picked by Montreal in the major league draft, though
he may be headed to the Texas Rangers.
	   Yet there was absolutely no movement for another University of
Texas star athlete. Clemens is coveted by nine teams, and the Blue
Jays were planning to leave the Opryland Hotel tonight.
	   ``There's no chance it will happen here,'' Clemens' agent, Randy
Hendricks, promised.
	   The big deal of the day came shortly before midnight when the
Florida Marlins traded Renteria, their All-Star shortstop and hero
of the 1997 World Series, to the St. Louis Cardinals for three top
prospects.
	   Also, the New York Mets traded outfielder Butch Huskey to
Seattle, the Chicago Cubs dealt outfielder Brant Brown to
Pittsburgh for pitcher Jon Lieber, St. Louis sent pitcher Mark
Petkovsek to Anaheim and Minnesota moved outfielder Alex Ochoa to
Milwaukee.
	   A couple of free-agent catchers signed _ Bill Haselman with
Detroit and Chad Kreuter with Kansas City.
	   In off-the-field activity, general managers made no change to
the playoff format. Some had been in favor of allowing wild cards
to face their own division's winner in the first round.
	   The New York Yankees, Houston and Cleveland remained at the top
of the list of teams pursuing Clemens, with Texas, Colorado and the
Mets also in the mix.
	   ``All is quiet,'' said Blue Jays GM Gord Ash, who had wanted to
finish a deal for the five-time Cy Young winner at the meetings.
``We've had a few minor conversations, not anything of any
significant substance.''
	   As is often the case, the World Series champion Yankees remained
a wild card. Owner George Steinbrenner likes Clemens, but has not
indicated whether he wants to give up the necessary players and
cash to complete a trade. The Boss might make his intentions known
by the weekend.
	   ``In the end, when decisions have to be made, we'll make a
recommendation and he'll decide one way or another,'' Yankees GM
Brian Cashman said. ``Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't.''
	   The Marlins acquired minor league pitchers Braden Looper and
Armando Almanza and shortstop Pablo Ozuna for Renteria, 23. The
deal left Florida with just four players from its 25-man roster
that won the championship last year.
	   ``This is a deal we've been talking about for quite a while,''
Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said. ``We think we got the
No. 1 guy we wanted.''
	   Renteria ended the '97 Series with a two-out single off
Cleveland's Charles Nagy in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game
7, giving Florida a 3-2 victory.
	   Renteria hit .282 with three home runs and 31 RBIs, and also
stole 41 bases. He fills the hole created July 31 when the
Cardinals sent shortstop Royce Clayton to Texas.
	   Looper, 24, was the overall third pick in the June 1996 draft.
Ozuna, 20, hit a league-leading .357, stole 62 bases and was picked
as the Midwest League player of the year, and Almanza led the
Carolina League with 36 saves in 1997.
	   The Mets, already one of the majors' most active teams this
winter, sent Huskey to Seattle for minor league pitcher Lesli Brea.
	   Huskey, 27, hit .252 with 13 home runs and 59 RBIs last season.
	   ``I was prepared for this, but it's still a shock,'' said
Huskey, who joined the Mets organization in 1990. ``They made a
decision and I was the odd man out.''
	   Huskey will play right field for the Mariners and take the place
of Jay Buhner, moving to first base because of a surgically
repaired elbow.
	   Brea, a 20-year-old right-hander, was 3-4 with 12 saves and 2.76
ERA in 49 games for Class A Wisconsin in the Midwest League. He
struck out 86 in 58 2-3 innings.
	   Another minor leaguer with impressive numbers _ in football _
attracted attention in the draft of players left off 40-man
rosters.
	   At first, there was hardly a ripple in the room when Montreal
announced it had taken Errick L. Williams. As many soon found out,
that was really Ricky Williams, the Heisman winner and a cousin of
Cecil Fielder.
	   Williams hit .283 in Class A for Philadelphia last season, his
best average in four pro seasons. Texas was expected to trade in
the next few days for him.
	   ``It doesn't really matter what I think about him,'' Expos
general manager Jim Beattie said. ``He's an outfielder, I know
that. I know he has some value for our organization by way of
having value to another organization.''
	   Chicago, meanwhile, got rid of Brown, who nearly knocked the
Cubs out of the playoffs. Brown, 27, hit .291 last season with 14
homers and 48 RBIs but is best known for dropping a fly ball by
Geoff Jenkins on Sept. 23 at Milwaukee.
	   Lieber, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 8-14 with a 4.11 ERA
last season.
	   The Cardinals traded Petkovsek to the Angels for a player to be
named or cash. The 33-year-old right-hander was 7-4 with a 4.77 ERA
in 10 starts and 38 relief appearances for St. Louis.
	   The Twins sent Ochoa to the Brewers for a player to be named.
The 26-year-old outfielder hit .257 with two homers and 25 RBIs in
249 at-bats last season.
	   Haselman, 32, and the Tigers agreed on a dlrs 1.75 million,
two-year contract. He hit .314 with six homers and 17 RBIs in 40
games for Texas last season.
	   Kreuter, a 34-year-old switch-hitter, and the Royals agreed to a
dlrs 725,000, one-year contract. He batted .250 last season with
two homers and 33 RBIs in 252 at-bats with the Chicago White Sox
and Anaheim.

Among Arab-Americans, a tempered sense of hope for peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ Some Arab-Americans following
President Bill Clinton's visit to the Middle East say haggling and
delays over the Wye River agreement could overwhelm chances for a
lasting peace.
	   ``Witnessing what has been going on, it does not make me feel
hopeful that we will reach genuine peace in the Middle East,'' said
Imad Hamad, the Dearborn director for the Arab-American
Anti-Discrimination League. ``We see ourselves switching from
agreement to negotiations and finally negotiations of
negotiations.''
	   Clinton met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday as part of a drive to
keep the Wye River accord from falling apart.
	   The agreement calls for Palestinians to get another 13 percent
of Israeli-held territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River and
for Palestinians to fight terrorism by Islamic militants. But the
agreement has frayed over charges of bad faith from both sides.
	   Dearborn has a high concentration of Arab-Americans; the 1990
U.S. Census found 12,000 people who spoke Arabic in a city of
90,000, and many storefronts feature signs in Arabic and English.
	   Samir Fadallah, 30, stopped in at the Venice Barber Shop on
Monday to get haircuts for himself and his 5-year-old son,
Mohammed. He said the United States had historically favored Israel
over Arab countries, and reversing the effects would take time.
	   ``This peace agreement is going to hurt us,'' said Fadallah, who
was born in Lebanon. Palestinians ``shouldn't have to live like
animals. It's their land. So what if they have their own state?''
	   ``They call us terrorists for fighting,'' he said. ``But if
someone came and took your house, your rights _ you would fight
too.''
	   Haider Koussan, who spent the first 15 years of his life in a
Lebanese refugee camp, works at the market his family owns here. He
said he hopes the Wye River agreement and Clinton's mission bring
calm to the region.
	   ``I've seen people get killed for no reason,'' he said. ``They
should think of themselves as humans _ forget about nationality and
religion for a while.''
	   Neal Abunab, 36, a car dealer born in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, believes Clinton is doing all he can to achieve peace
amid strong pro-Israel sentiment in the United States.
	   ``The Israelis have to turn the corner to where the process
gives real benefits,'' he said ``Otherwise, Palestinians will lose
faith, and their poverty will lead to more misery and more
violence.''

Asia says threatened World Cup boycott won't affect hosts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with quotes, Asian sponsors
won't be affected &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian soccer officials on Tuesday put
on hold a threatened boycott of the 2002 World Cup and said that
even if it goes ahead, co-hosts Japan and South Korea will still be
allowed to play.
	   The Asian Football Confederation's executive committee, after an
emergency meeting, warned that the boycott would proceed unless
FIFA, the sport's world governing authority, expands the number of
slots allocated to Asia for the World Cup.
	   ``All of the members spoke up very much in favor of a boycott of
2002,'' AFC general secretary Peter Velappan told a news
conference. ``But we will honor the responsibility of hosting the
World Cup.''
	   The formula of a boycott exempting Japan and South Korea
balances the demands of Arab members to retaliate against FIFA
while taking into account the millions spent by the two East Asian
nations to jointly stage the cup finals.
	   Committee members said Asia was not ``treated fairly or taken
seriously'' by FIFA despite being home to 40 percent of the world's
population and comprising a large number of television viewers.
	   Asia had three direct qualification places for France '98 and an
extra chance that Iran claimed by beating Oceania winner Australia.
	   The AFC wants its 3 1/2 chances back, but Velappan admitted they
would accept 2 1/2 because the co-host arrangement gave them two
automatic qualifiers. But they insist on having the half-spot.
	   The dispute underscores the changes in the tournament with the
first-ever dual-host attempt. The World Cup host nation has always
qualified automatically and is not normally seen as coming out of a
continent's quota.
	   ``Our decision is not irrational or unreasonable, our decision
is fair,'' Velappan said.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter contacted the Asian confederation
before the meeting and offered the body four places for the 2006
World Cup, without mentioning 2002.
	   ``Why should he dangle a carrot at us about 2006? We're trying
to focus on 2002,'' said Velappan, who is also FIFA's coordinator
for the 2002 cup.
	   The committee decided to send a six-member delegation to meet
FIFA President Sepp Blatter in February ahead of a high-level FIFA
meeting in March to persuade him to restore the lost spot.
	   If the FIFA meeting fails to change course and satisfy the
Asians, the AFC will call another meeting to implement the boycott,
which would pull 40 teams out of the World Cup qualifying rounds.
	   The AFC's move puts the ball in Blatter's end.
	   ``Blatter must do something one way or the other to find a way
of resolving the problem. Otherwise, he will push us to the wall,''
said Manical Fernando, an AFC vice president from Sri Lanka. ``But
they should know if they don't help us, we will boycott.''
	   Velappan said that Asian corporations hoping to sponsor the
event would not be asked to join the boycott, saying sports and
business don't mix.

Report: Police lie in wait for five Anwar supporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police are lying in wait of five
people who went abroad to ``run down the country'' and are believed
to be supporters of Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   ``The police are waiting for them to return to the country to
begin investigations,'' Bernama news agency quoted Deputy Home
Minister Ong Ka Ting as saying in parliament.
	   The report appeared to be referring to five prominent supporters
of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial for sex-related
charges and abuse of power.
	   Foreign news reports last month detailed the whereabouts of the
five former aides to Anwar who had traveled to Indonesia and other
neighboring countries to drum up support for his pro-democracy
cause.
	   Ong said the five had been traced to Indonesia and the
Philippines where they issued irresponsible statements to discredit
the country.
	   Both Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie and Philippines
President Joseph Estrada are close friends of Anwar. In October,
the two angered Malaysia's leadership by meeting privately with
Anwar's eldest daughter, Nurul Izzah, who had visited them.
	   In the months following Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest, the Malaysian
capital, Kuala Lumpur, was rocked by antigovernment protests.
	   Ong said police had detained 27 people under the harsh Internal
Security Act on charges of organizing the rallies. Five people are
still in police custody. The ISA allows detention without trial.
	   Police also detained 72 civil servants for demonstrating to end
the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

Philippine government orders 45-Day Christmas cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government on Tuesday
ordered a 45-day Christmas suspension of military operations
against Communist rebels.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the cease-fire will take
effect beginning on midnight of Dec. 15, the start of the country's
traditional Christmas celebration and last until Jan. 20, 1999.
	   Mercado said the cease-fire will allow guerrillas to peacefully
come down from their mountain hideouts and join their families
without fear of being arrested by government forces ``provided they
do not carry weapons, explosives or ammunition.''
	   ``This is unilateral on the part of the government in the spirit
of Christmas,'' Mercado said.
	   He said the order does not cover normal law enforcement and
security functions and defense of government installations against
rebel attacks.
	   Mercado said the formal announcement will be made by President
Joseph Estrada, who is in Vietnam to attend the sixth leaders'
summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The New People's Army, military arm of the Communist Party of
the Philippines, customarily announces its own holiday cease-fires,
usually Dec. 24-25 and Dec. 31-Jan.1.
	   Mercado said there was no need to declare a separate holiday
truce with the Muslim Moro Islamic Liberation front because an
earlier cease-fire is in place.

Endeavour's astronauts packed up and ready for the trip home

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Eager to get home to their families
and relax over the holidays, Endeavour's astronauts finished
packing up the space shuttle today for their late-night return to
Earth.
	   The shuttle was due back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
at 10:54 p.m. EST, although cloudy skies threatened to force a
delay.
	   If the first landing attempt were scrapped, the astronauts could
try again 90 minutes later. If that also failed, they would have
four additional opportunities to land on Wednesday _ two at Kennedy
and two at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
	   Endeavour has enough water and fuel to stay in orbit until
Thursday, and shuttle commander Robert Cabana said his crew
wouldn't mind a little more time to take in the view.
	   ``We'd be willing to stay here as long as we had the
capability,'' he said.
	   But some of the astronauts said they had work to do back on
Earth _ namely, a little last-minute Christmas shopping.
	   ``Considering we went into quarantine on Thanksgiving Day, I
wasn't looking that far ahead,'' said Nancy Currie, who has an
11-year-old daughter.
	   With two toddlers at home, James Newman has more to buy, too,
even though he was busy wrapping Christmas presents right up until
the crew's Dec. 4 launch.
	   The astronauts gave NASA an early Christmas gift in the form of
a 77-foot international space station.
	   During their 12-day mission, they connected and wired together
the first two pieces of the outpost _ the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American Unity chamber. They also attached
antennas, tools and handrails for future crews.
	   The space station was released from the shuttle's cargo bay on
Sunday. Flight controllers in Houston and Moscow continue to
monitor it. The next construction team is due to arrive in May.
	   On Monday, the astronauts enjoyed some free time before they got
to work stowing gear for the ride home. They also released an Air
Force science satellite.

Tokyo stocks continue decline, dollar gains against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond prices; Yasuda Trust
and Banking, and Nomura Trust and Banking take ampersands.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices sank for the fourth day in a
row amid continuing worry that weak financial institutions may be
placed under state control. The U.S. dollar surged against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 100.43 points,
or 0.71 percent, to close the day at 14,011.19. On Monday, the
average closed down 294.02 points, or 2.04 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.58 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 1.96
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 115.49 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Sunday's nationalization of Nippon
Credit Bank Ltd. caused concern that other institutions might
suffer the same fate, pushing down share prices.
	   ``There seem to be continuing fears that NCB may not be the last
bank'' to be nationalized, said Yuichi Kohashi of Daiwa Securities
Co.
	   Low-priced banking stocks such as Yasuda Trust and Banking were
among the hardest hit. One of the biggest decliners, the stock sank
to a new low for the year in intraday trading.
	   Concern over a report showing worsening business sentiment among
Japanese companies also pushed share prices down, traders said.
	   The closely-watched report, issued Monday by Japan's central
bank, showed business confidence to be worse than expected.
	   ``The market is in a very precarious state,'' said Louis Tseng,
head of derivatives trading at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``The
likelihood of it going down is much greater than it going up.''
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 11.04 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,089.27. The
TOPIX closed down 17.85 points, or 1.60 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 409.56 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 319.71 the previous
day.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 804 to 327, with 172 shares
unchanged.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar was boosted by
comments from EPA Director-General Taichi Sakaiya, who indicated a
recent rally by the yen came faster than expected and could hurt
exporters important to the economy, traders said.
	   That prompted speculation the yen was poised to fall. Investors
scrambled to cover short, or oversold, positions in reaction to the
remarks, which fueled the dollar's gain.
	   ``There was a lot more short-covering than we thought there
would be, with (Japanese) institutional investors buying dollars,''
said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust
and Banking.
	   The dollar hit an intraday high of 117.60 yen, up from its
morning low of 115.40 yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.260 percent from Monday's finish of 1.270
percent, pushing its price up to 104.57 yen.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban, who rule Afghanistan with
an iron hand, urged people Tuesday to spend the next three days
praying for rain.
	   An unseasonable dry spell has left the capital of Kabul dry,
foggy and cold.
	   ``This weather is bad for everyone, but especially for
farmers,'' said Maulvi Qari Abdul Manan, who told his congregation
at the Mushtaba mosque to go into the fields and pray.
	   The Taliban army which rule 90 percent of Afghanistan have
imposed a rigid brand of Islamic law in the area they control.
	   For the next three days Manan said that people should leave
their homes and go to the countryside and pray ``even if it is just
for 10 minutes.''
	   But they should pray in a group of not less than 20 people and
everyone should be wearing ``simple clothes to please God.''

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's economy survived the
Asian financial crisis in 1998 but was set for slower economic
growth and a widening current account deficit next year, the head
of the central bank said Tuesday.
	   Ian Macfarlane, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said
a recent decision to slice official cash rates despite strong
growth was in anticipation of slower growth in 1999.
	   Macfarlane said economic growth in Australia for 1998 was
expected to be four percent, up from the three percent he forecast
earlier this year.
	   He said the stronger growth had caused unemployment to edge
down.
	   Inflation was likely to be two percent at the end of the year,
while the current account deficit looked set to average five
percent of gross domestic product in 1998.
	   ``Australia's economic performance has exceeded our
expectations, and to my knowledge the expectations of virtually all
forecasters,'' Macfarlane said.
	   But the outlook for next year was not as good, with a slowdown
inevitable due to the weaker outlook for the world economy.
	   Economic growth was likely to fall to between 2.5 and 3.0
percent in 1998-99, he said.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Office rental prices in Singapore's prime
financial district have dropped about 40 percent since the start of
a real estate slump two years ago and could fall another 15
percent, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The monthly average rent in the downtown Raffles Place district
has fallen to 6.10 Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.70) per square
foot from a peak of 9.90 Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 6) per square
foot in 1996, when the prices began tumbling, The Straits Times
reported.
	   The government introduced measures two years ago to dampen
speculation in the property market, where values had reached
historic highs. The financial and economic crisis which started
last year has further eroded property prices throughout the small
city-state.
	   One of Singapore's largest property consultants, CB Richard
Ellis, predicts prime office rents will drop another 10 to 15
percent next year before bottoming out, the report said.
	   Vacant office space in Singapore will reach a high of 16.5
percent in 1999, below the 22.1 percent vacancy rate during the
country's last recession in the mid 1980s, the paper quoted the
property company as saying.
	   Although spared the deep recessions plaguing many of its
regional neighbors, Singapore's economy has slowed and business
operations have suffered.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese mortgage company went bankrupt
Tuesday, two days after the government took over its ailing main
bank.
	   The Tokyo District Court accepted an application for protection
from creditors filed by NCB Mortgage Co., said Shigeki Kawamoto, a
lawyer for the Nippon Credit Bank affiliate.
	   Nippon Credit Bank was placed under state control Sunday after
being declared insolvent with at least 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27.8
billion) in unrecoverable, or high-risk, loans and massive stock
evaluation losses.
	   NCB Mortgage had liabilities totaling 174.0 billion yen (dlrs
1.51 billion) and a total of 164.6 billion yen (dlrs 1.43 billion)
in loans from the ailing bank, Kawamoto said.
	   The company made the move after judging it was unable to obtain
financial support from Nippon Credit Bank, Kawamoto said.
	   The mortgage company's failure was the seventh largest by a
Japanese company this year in terms of liabilities, according to
Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a major private Japanese research firm.
	   It amassed its debts amid Japan's slumping real estate market
after the collapse of the nation's highly speculative ``bubble''
economy in the early 1990s, Teikoku Data Bank said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The owner of South Korea's largest
industrial conglomerate crossed the heavily armed border into North
Korea on Tuesday to discuss tourism and other business
opportunities in the reclusive communist country.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, accompanied by several aides, walked into
North Korea through the neutral village of Panmunjom inside the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. It was his third
visit to the North so far this year.
	   ``I have many things to discuss,'' the founder of the Hyundai
group told reporters before crossing the border.
	   Chung said his discussions will include building an industrial
park on North Korea's west coast to accommodate textile, footwear
and other labor-intensive facilities to be moved from South Korea.
	   Aides said the industrial park would take 10 years to complete
and could produce dlrs 4.4 billion worth of goods a year. North
Koreans could expect to earn dlrs 400 million a year in wages, they
said.
	   Hyundai launched unprecedented sightseeing cruise tours of
Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east coast, on
Nov. 18.
	   Nearly 6,000 South Koreans have visited the mountain under the
largest inter-Korea joint venture since the Korean Peninsula was
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   In return for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay
North Korea dlrs 906 million over the next six years.
	   During his four-day visit this week, Chung will follow up other
joint venture projects discussed earlier, including a thermal power
plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial park, Hyundai
officials said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Sun
Microsystems Inc. of the United States are teaming up to develop
and sell digital home electronic appliances, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Matsushita will develop and sell products that can be easily
linked to computer networks through software developed by Sun, the
Nihon Keizai, Japan's top business daily, said.
	   Masashi Sakamoto, a Matsushita spokesman, refused to comment on
the report, saying that executives from the two companies would
hold a news conference in Tokyo on a joint project later Tuesday.
	   The Nihon Keizai said Matsushita will adopt Java programming
language in computer programs in its home appliance products, while
developing appliances applicable with Jini network software.
	   Through a tie-up with the Japanese consumer electronics giant,
Sun will try to gain ground in the home appliances area, where
Microsoft Inc., a leading U.S. computer software maker, has yet to
establish a foothold with its Windows CE operating system, the
report said.
	   Jini, introduced by Sun earlier this year, is a new network
technology enabling appliances to exchange data automatically via
networks.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese corporate bankruptcies fell 4.6 percent in
November from a year earlier, the first drop in 18 months, a
private credit research agency said.
	   But the good news was likely to be temporary given the
deterioration of the economy and corporate earnings, Teikoku
Databank Ltd. said Monday.
	   Credit risk remains extremely high and funding pressures at the
end of this year and the close of the fiscal year in March may
prompt another surge in corporate failures, Teikoku said.
	   Debts left behind by insolvent companies in November tumbled
67.8 percent to 649.72 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 5.62 billion), the
agency said. There were a total of 1,360 bankruptcies for the
month.
	   Teikoku said government efforts to ease the credit crunch
afflicting small and medium-sized companies, including a loan
guarantee plan introduced in October, caused business failures to
drop.
	   The bankruptcy figures came on the heels of a Bank of Japan
quarterly business survey that showed confidence at the country's
recession-hit small and medium-sized manufacturers has fallen to a
record low.
	   Confidence at major Japanese manufacturers also continued to
erode, falling to its worst level since February 1994, the central
bank's ``tankan'' survey, released Monday, showed.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ High food prices pushed up
Malaysia's annualized inflation rate to 5.6 percent in November,
the national news agency Bernama reported, quoting official
statistics released Tuesday.
	   For the first eleven months of the year, the consumer price
index rose 5.3 percent compared with the same period last year.
Inflation was at 5.2 percent in October.
	   With the exception of transport and communications, prices in
all other sectors had risen, the statistics department said.
	   Food prices rose by 8.9 percent, while those of miscellaneous
goods and services were up by 7.1 percent. Medical care was 6.2
percent higher.
	   The economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter of 1998, a
dramatic slowdown from the 7.8 percent expansion registered in 1997
and the once booming growth rates recorded over the past decade.
	   The government has even said the situation is so bad it may have
to revise its full year forecast of a 4.8 percent contraction
because of the effects of Asia's currency and stock market tumble
last year.

Three Nigeria parties registered for next year's vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Three of the nine political parties that
ran in recent local council elections have been registered to run
in next year's elections, including the presidential race.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party and the All People's party both
achieved at least five percent of the votes in 24 of Nigeria's 36
states to be registered for next year's gubernatorial, state
assembly and presidential polling, Nigeria's Electoral Commission
announced Monday.
	   The Alliance for Democracy, which only scored five percent
support in 14 states, was added under a law allowing the Electoral
Commission to register the country's third most popular party in
the event that only two parties met the initial registration
requirement.
	   Nigeria's military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took
power when dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died earlier this year, has
pledged to hand over power to elected civilians in May after
presidential elections on Feb. 27.
	   The local council elections were used by Nigeria's Electoral
Commission to decide which parties had the national popularity to
advance to the next stage in the voting.
	   The Alliance for Democracy won virtually all the seats in the
mainly Yoruba southwest during the council voting. Many observers
feared that if the party was not registered, many Yorubas _ who
already feel injured by the death of opposition leader Moshood
Abiola _ would lose interest in Nigeria's transition to civilian
rule.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party, which scored the most support in
the local elections, was formed earlier this year by 34 well-known
academics, politicians, tribal leaders and former military generals
opposed to Abacha's autocratic style.
	   It has a murky platform and no leader, although former military
ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5 million and is
campaigning for the party's presidential nomination.
	   The All Peoples Party is made up largely of politicians who
participated in Abacha's flawed transition to civilian rule.
	   Gubernatorial and state assembly elections are scheduled for
Jan. 9.

Holbrooke expected in Belgrade amid new tensions in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two more deaths from Monday night violence
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The death toll rose to 37 in the
deadliest clash between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo in months, Serb sources said Tuesday.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight.
	   The news came as U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was awaited here,
where he is to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
``emphasize the need to move ahead expeditiously'' on a peace plan,
the U.S. State Department said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO aistrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission aimed at ensuring the peace agreement is kept,
condemned the violence ``in the strongest terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.'' He said the verification
mission ``will intensify, in the light of the recent violence''
efforts to help create the conditions of confidence and respect for
human life.
	   In the gun battle in Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified
assailants opened fire Monday night in a Serb-run bar, killing four
Serbs and wounding five others. Two of the wounded died later,
Serbian sources said Tuesday.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two masked
``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with
automatic weapons fire.

3,000 tons of waste dumped in Cambodia believed toxic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The discovery of 3,000 tons of waste
left near Cambodia's only seaport has environmental officials
fearing their country is being used as a toxic dumping ground.
	   The waste _ a jumble of rubble and dirt _ was found 185
kilometers (113 miles) southwest of Phnom Penh on the outskirts of
the port town of Sihanoukville last week. It was shipped from
Taiwan by a local company in November, Environment Minister Mok
Mareth said Tuesday.
	   Secrecy surrounding the waste has led to fears that it is toxic,
he said. The ministry has asked the U.N. Development Program to
assist in bringing in a chemical expert to analyze the material.
	   ``It seems that the waste comes from an incinerator plant,''
said Mok Mareth, who surveyed the dump site last week. ``We don't
know clearly whether it is toxic or not. We need to have it
analyzed in a laboratory.''
	   A pollution control official was quoted in The Cambodia Daily
newspaper Tuesday as saying there have been reports that villagers
who have scavenged through the dump are now suffering from skin
rashes.
	   Mok Mareth said a customs invoice identifies the importer as a
local company named Muth Mony. The Interior Ministry has been asked
to assist in the investigation of the dumping, but the company has
so far not been located.
	   ``Toxic or not toxic, the company has violated the law because
waste is prohibited to come into Cambodia, so they must be
punished,'' Mok Mareth said.
	   An environmental law was passed by the Cambodian legislature in
1996, but sections of the law that would define acceptable levels
of pollution have not been written.
	   An American company approached the government earlier in the
year with a proposal to build a dlrs 300 million waste incineration
plant in Cambodia, but Mok Mareth said the plan and others like
them have been rejected.
	   ``All the investors who want to dump waste in my country ...
should stop their activities,'' he said. ``We cannot accept that.
Waste is something you must manage yourself.''

	   The way for the three-way meeting was cleared with the
Palestinian vote Monday _registered with a show of hands and
applause _ that removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964
from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   Netanyahu, the only leader to hold a formal news conference
after the meeting, said he would only withdraw troops in the West
Bank if the Palestinians fulfilled their obligations.
	   He said they would have to confiscate illegal weapons, stop
inciting to violence against Israel, publicly drop plans to declare
a state unilaterally in May and agree to Israel's criteria for the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``When they do this, we will do what we are required to do,''
Netanyahu said, adding that the faster the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations, the faster Israel would withdraw troops.

Jospin asks rioting youths to have faith in justice system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Tuesday
appealed to Toulouse youths angered by the police shooting death of
their friend to have faith in the country's justice system.
	   Jospin was speaking after rioting youths rampaged for a second
night in a working-class neighborhood of Toulouse, in the southwest
of France, protesting the weekend killing of a 17-year-old.
	   Jospin said interim Interior Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne has
``the impression that things did not happen as they should have''
when the youth was shot by police trying to stop him from stealing
a BMW before dawn Sunday.
	   ``The police have a very difficult job,'' Jospin said on RTL
radio. ``They must make people respect the law, which applies to
everyone. But clearly they must use judgment.''
	   Jospin added that rioting youths should take comfort from the
fact that two police involved in the shooting have been detained
for questioning and the head of the police unit has been suspended.
	   The violence in Toulouse is the latest outbreak stemming from
tension between French police and disaffected youth from poor
immigrant families in many cities in France.
	   The rioting in Toulouse began after police shot and killed
Habib, a 17-year-old from a poor neighborhood.
	   At least 150 police on Sunday faced off with up to 200 youths in
a working class district with an unemployment rate of 35 percent.
The angry youths threw stones and firebombs at security forces and
the clashes resumed Monday, continuing into early morning hours
Tuesday.
	   Authorities are awaiting the results of an autopsy on the youth
that was planned for Monday evening. The officers contend the
shooting was accidental.
	   Authorities were also searching for the youth's accomplice in
the attempted car theft.
	   Meanwhile, classmates of the youth killed by police fire are
planning a demonstration for later Tuesday.

Yugoslav basketball star sentenced for rape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Nikola Bulatovic, a center of
Yugoslav national basketball team, was sentenced to three years in
prison for raping a 15-year-old girl, media reported Tuesday.
	   Bulatovic, who plays for Montenegrin Buducnost team, reportedly
raped the girl when she came to his Belgrade flat last March to
interview him for her school newspaper.
	   Bulatovic was a member of the Yugoslav national team which won
World Championships in Greece last summer.
	   A Belgrade judge who sentenced Bulatovic on Monday said a
three-year prison term is minimal for such offenses.
	   Bulatovic has denied the charges and his lawyer said they would
appeal the sentence to a higher court.

Koreans show China still has some catching up to do in baseball
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Kim Byung-hyun struck out
the first eight batters he faced and 12 in all in a demonstration
Tuesday that Asian sports power China still lags in baseball.
	   The South Koreans didn't need their ace from the Los Angeles
Dodgers, Park Chan-ho, as Kim didn't allow a man on base in six
relief innings in a 9-2 victory over the Chinese.
	   That put the Koreans in baseball's gold medal team, against the
winner of a later semifinal between Japan and Taiwan.
	   Japan, meanwhile, gained two gold medals in sports where it long
has excelled _ synchronized swimming and karate.
	   But with 36 golds in all so far, it still trailed China, with
85, and South Korea, with 44.
	   Japan's Miya Tachibana won her second gold of these games when
she teamed with Miho Takeda for the synchronized swimming duet
title, ahead of South Korea's Yoo Na-mi and jang Yoon-kyeong.
	   Atsuko Wakai took gold in the women's kata competition of
karate, in which competitors are rated on style. She outscored
Indonesia's Ompi Omita-Olga, 42.9 to 41.9.
	   South Koreans Kang Ji-sook and Lee Mi-kyung defeated Taiwan's
Lin Li-jung and Cheng Shu-chen 5-3, 4-1, 4-2, 2-4, 4-2, 4-2, adding
gold in the women's doubles of soft tennis to their nation's
earlier victories in the men's and women's team competition.
	   China and Kazakstan each won individual pursuit races in
cycling. Kazakstan's Vadim Kravchenko beat Japan's Noriyuki Iijima
in the men's 4-kilometer race, 4 minutes, 42.799 seconss to
4:45.215. China's Wang Qingzhi defeated teammate Zhao Haijuan in
the women's 3-kilometer race.
	   In the baseball semifinal, in addition to Kim Byung-hyun's
pitching, the Koreans had four home runs, including two by Park
Jae-hong, in the third and fourth innings. They trailed 2-1 after
the second inning, but then overwhelmed China with their 14-hit
attack.

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A young track rider and a top contender
for the Perth Cup were killed by a lightning strike during
trackwork Tuesday, racing authorities said.
	   Licensed track rider Damion Beckett was working Brave Buck when
a lightning bolt struck the pair during a morning storm, said
Bernie Ryan, president of the Western Australia Jockey's
Association.
	   The strike happened at Ascot racetrack in Perth about 5.20 a.m.
local time (2120 GMT).
	   Ryan said another jockey went to Beckett's aid but found both
rider and horse apparently dead.
	   Radio reports said Beckett was rushed by ambulance to hospital
but was dead on arrival.
	   Brave Buck, who was third favorite for the Group Two Perth Cup
(3,200m) on Jan. 1, died almost instantly.
	   Ryan said the storm came in very fast, giving turf club
officials no time
	   to call jockeys off the track.
	   Trainer Graeme Webster, whose horse Matriculate was about 40
meters (yards) from Brave Buck when the bolt hit, said it was
raining heavily at the time.
	   ``We had some really big claps of thunder and the heavens opened
up like tropical rain, then a flash of lightning came from
nowhere,'' Webster said.
	   ``I actually saw the lightning hit Brave Buck and he went down
in a flash.''
	   Trackwork for the rest of the day has been canceled.
	   Ryan said Beckett, 23, was well-known and respected in racing
circles.
	   ``Everybody's quite shocked by it,'' Ryan said.

Kim back with a win

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Defending champion and former drug
offender Kim Jin-il made a strong return to Asian Games track
Tuesday, qualifying comfortably in the men's 800-meter semifinals.
	   Kim set the Asian record at 1 minute, 44.14 seconds in June
1994, a few months before he won the Hiroshima Asian Games title,
also in a record time.
	   Kim's career hit the skids in 1995 when he tested positive for
Clenbuterol, an anabolic agent commonly found in asthma treatments
but banned in sports. He maintained he unknowingly took the drug in
a cough mixture and was cleared by his national association.
	   He received a four-year ban, ruling him out of the Atlanta
Olympics, but the sentence was reduced to three years in 1997 as
the International Amateur Athletic federation moved toward maximum
bans of two years.
	   He said it felt ``very good'' to be back in competition after a
frustrating time out of the sport and that he was still only
running at 50 percent. He safely padded through to Thursday's final
with 1:51.85 as he won his semifinal but was seventh overall.
	   Kim's compatriot Kim Soon-hyung was the fastest qualifier,
winning the second semifinal in 1:50.13.
	   China's Asian champion Cheng Bing didn't like his chances of
winning the gold. He was fourth in the second semifinal and only
survived because it was the fastest of the three races.
	   Cheng tipped the man he beat to gold at the July Asian
championships, Qatar's Abdul Abdulla, as the favorite to win here.
	   ``He's really great, he'll definitely be No. 1,'' said Cheng of
his rival.
	   Abdulla made light work of his assignment, and a post-race
interview.
	   ``It was OK, man. My target's the gold,'' he said after posting
a 1:50.13.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdar, a surprise winner of the women's 1,500
Monday, was fourth fastest through to the women's 800 final.
	   Heading the field was Japan's Ryoko Takezawa in 2:04.35.

Netanyahu irked by Clinton remark on children of Arab prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israeli controversy over Clinton's
remarks. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Remarks by U.S. President Bill Clinton reacting
to the plight of both Israeli and Palestinian children brought a
bitter response Tuesday from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   The Israeli leader accused Clinton of equating the children of
Palestinian prisoners jailed for murder with Israeli children who
were the victims of Arab attacks.
	   In a post-midnight interview, the Israeli leader expressed his
indignation over the comments, and the controversy mushroomed into
a debate in Israeli media with victims of terrorism venting their
anger.
	   ``There's a world of difference between the children of the
murderers who are in jail and the children of those who are
murdered,'' said Netanyahu. ``These murderers, some of them
murdered children.''
	   ``The last thing we should do is make any parallelism between
the murderers and their victims,'' said Netanyahu, sitting in the
Cabinet room of the prime ministry.
	   The sensitivity of the issue was reflected in the morning
headlines. ``Rage in Israel: President Compares Victims of Terror
to Palestinian Prisoners,'' said the mass circulation Yediot
Ahronot.
	   ``Rage in Jerusalem: Clinton Compares Suffering of Children of
Palestinian Murderers to the Suffering of Children of Victims of
Murders,'' said the religious daily Hatzofe.
	   Clinton told the Palestine National Council he had been touched
by his encounters with Israeli and Palestinian children.
	   ``Those children brought tears to my eyes. We have to find a way
for both sets of children to get their lives back and to go
forward,'' said Clinton.
	   Four Palestinian girls met with The President and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in the presence of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Monday. In tearful appeals, they urged Clinton to
work for the release of their fathers.
	   The fathers of two of the four girls were serving life
sentences, one for killing an Israeli and the second for killing a
Palestinian accused of cooperating with Israeli officials.
	   ``I asked him to pressure Netanyahu to release all the prisoners
because they are heroes,'' said Nihad Zakout, 11, who handed a
letter to Clinton urging freedom for all the prisoners.
	   The prisoner issue is perhaps the most emotional issue on the
agenda. Palestinians demand the release of jailed activists
involved in attacks on Israelis, but Netanyahu vows not to release
those with ``blood on their hands.''
	   ``Believe me, it's a very emotional issue for me. I don't
release terrorist murderers. I don't care what their views are.
They're not in there for their political views. They're in jail
because they murdered people,'' said Netanyahu.
	   In explaining his hard line, Netanyahu cited the case of two
infants who were orphaned when a terrorist ambushed their car and
fatally wounded the parents who were in the front seat. The babies
in the back seat escaped unharmed.
	   ``What shall I say to them when they grow up that I let out the
murders of your mother and father? Nobody should do that.
Law-abiding societies keep murderers behind bars.''
	   At the Wye River summit, Israel pledged to release 750 of the
1,700 Palestinians in Israeli jails, but a dispute has arisen over
whether those released should be politically affiliated inmates.
	   Israel released the first installment of 250 last month, but
most were common criminals. That spawned a series of violent
protests by Palestinians in the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of fomenting violence and
riots in the West Bank on the ``trumped up'' charge that he had
agreed to free Palestinians involved in killings when he had not
done so.
	   The Israeli prime minister praised the Palestinians for removing
the ambiguity and clearly stating that they had deleted anti-Israel
clauses from the Palestinian national charter. But he said more had
to be done before Israel would carry out the next partial
withdrawal.
	   ``They have done one thing, and I approve of it,'' Netanyahu
said. ``But it is one of many things that have to be done.''
	   Netanyahu said he would not succumb to U.S. pressure to match
the Palestinian concession on the charter.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' he declared. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep all the
provisions, and no amount of pressure is going to change this.''
	   Netanyahu said he was taking a go-slow approach because the
Palestinians turned the violence on and off ``like a tap.'' He said
he feared a new upsurge as soon as President Clinton departs.
	   ``When the president leaves, we are left with the Palestinians
who do violence and follow up with incitement on education
television that tells their children to ... pursue terror and all
become suicide bombers,'' he said. ``That's got to change.''

Taylor set to play at least two more Ashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ After achieving what he had hoped to
as Australian cricket captain, Mark Taylor said Tuesday he would
make a decision on his future after the next two Ashes tests.
	   The 34-year-old said that after Australia's series win in
Pakistan earlier this year, he had fulfilled everything he wanted
to do as captain - now he just plays for the love of it.
	   On Tuesday, the man known as ``Tubby'' became only the third man
to lead Australia as it held onto the Ashes three times in a row.
	   The honor came as Taylor and his team thumped England by 205
runs in the third test to take a 2-0 lead for the series and hold
the Ashes for a sixth consecutive time overall.
	   It topped off an outstanding year for the Australian test
skipper following his history-making 334 not out against Pakistan
in the second test in Peshawar in October _ and the Australian
season is far from over.
	   Taylor has a record of 25 wins from 48 tests as captain.
	   ``I'm only playing because I really enjoy it,'' Taylor said.
	   ``I never thought I'd get the opportunity to captain Australia
for 40-odd test matches and then have a side with the ability that
we have got and win in places like the West Indies, win Ashes
series and then go to the sub-continent and win there.
	   ``So I've achieved everything I ever dreamed of as test captain.
The good thing from my point of view is I'm enjoying trying to do
it over and over again so that's why I'm still playing.''
	   When asked if that meant he would continue to play, Taylor
replied with a grin and a laugh, answering: ``The next two Test
matches.
	   ``I don't like to look too far ahead, I've said that a number of
times over the last six months.
	   ``The side's playing well, I'm still playing well, although I
would have liked to have made a few more runs myself, but I've been
contributing well and hitting the ball well.
	   ``I'll see how the next two test matches go and make a decision
then.''
	   Taylor said he would like to retire on home soil, meaning that
if he opted to stay on beyond this series, he would tour the West
Indies, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe before playing another series in
Australia.
	   The only other Australians to lead their country to three
consecutive Ashes series wins were Joe Darling (1899-1902) and
Allan Border (1989-1993).
	   Taylor contributed 59 runs in Australia's first innings of the
third test before he was caught by Nasser Hussain off the bowling
of Peter Such.
	   He managed 29 in the second innings before falling again to
Such, lbw. His performance added to his 46 and 0 in the first test
in Brisbane and 61 and three in Perth for the second test.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The death toll rose to 37 in the
deadliest clash in months between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo, Serb sources said Tuesday.
	   Two out of five people wounded in a ``terrorist attack'' on a
bar in western Kosovo city of Pec late Monday died overnight, Serb
sources in Kosovo said.
	   The news came as officials prepared for a visit by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke, who is to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to ``emphasize the need to move ahead expeditiously'' on
a peace plan, the U.S. State Department said Monday.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   William Walker, head of the OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission
aimed at ensuring the peace agreement is kept, condemned the
violence ``in the strongest terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.'' He said the verification
mission ``will intensify, in the light of the recent violence''
efforts to help create the conditions of confidence and respect for
human life.
	   In the gun battle in Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified
assailants opened fire Monday night in a Serb-run bar, killing four
Serbs and wounding five others. Two of the wounded died later,
Serbian sources said Tuesday.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two masked
``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with
automatic weapons fire.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ An outspoken politician who
participated in opposition-led street demonstrations following a
controversial July election pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges
that he incited violence.
	   Kem Sokha, former chairman of the Cambodian parliament's human
rights commission, was a prominent figure in the demonstrations
against Prime Minister Hun Sen's narrow victory in the polls.
	   The Phnom Penh Municipal Court charged Kem Sokha with
destruction of property, incitement of violence and incitement of
racial hatred.
	   ``I never committed any criminal or violent acts, nor did I ever
appeal, incite or order demonstrators to commit any violence,'' he
told reporters as he left the court.
	   Kem Sokha also denied that he had encouraged protesters to
deface a statue erected in remembrance of the Vietnamese army's
ouster of the genocidal Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh in 1979.
	   ``I was not responsible for that,'' he said.
	   Kem Sokha was prevented from leaving the country after the July
protests were violently dispersed by police. He went into hiding,
fearing for his safety as the opposition blocked Hun Sen's efforts
to form a new government and continued its claims that fraud and
intimidation were used to win the election.
	   The court had been unable to deliver warrants issued for the
politician to appear for questioning.
	   He resurfaced soon after Hun Sen struck a deal with his former
rival Prince Norodom Ranariddh last month. The agreement made Hun
Sen prime minister and the prince was named president of the
National Assembly.
	   Officials in Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party said at the time of the
agreement that charges against Kem Sokha and other opposition
politicians would be dropped by the court, but a judge said Tuesday
that pleas by Kem Sokha for the case to be thrown out were not
granted.
	   ``I and the prosecutor will examine evidence. If there is a
need, we will summon him again, including other witnesses,''
Investigating Judge Mong Moni Chariya said.
	   Many Cambodians resent Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia
after the invasion, and opposition leaders during the
demonstrations often denounced Hun Sen, who was placed in power by
the Vietnamese in 1985, as a puppet ruler loyal to Hanoi.

Taylor says he doubts Waugh, Warne will testify
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark
Taylor said Tuesday he would be surprised if teammates Mark Waugh
and Shane Warne gave evidence to a Pakistan inquiry into
allegations of match-fixing and bribery.
	   The Pakistan inquiry has sent a summons to Waugh and Warne to
appear this weekend after revelations of their involvement with an
illegal Indian bookmaker four years ago.
	   Waugh and Warne were fined by the Australian Cricket Board in
February 1995 for providing pitch and weather information to the
bookmaker during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   Mark Waugh gave evidence to the Pakistan inquiry last October
but did not
	   inform the investigation of his ties with the Indian.
	   His evidence is seen as crucial to the inquiry after he, Warne
and former
	   Test spinner Tim May alleged former Pakistan captain Salim Malik
offered bribes to throw a match in Pakistan in 1994.
	   Taylor said a decision on whether to travel to Pakistan to give
evidence was likely to be left with Waugh and Warne.
	   ``I'm not part of the decision-making process, that will
probably be down to Mark and Shane in the final analysis,'' Taylor
said. ``I would be very surprised if they go.
	   ``To go over there for another court hearing would be something
I'm sure they wouldn't be jumping out of their skins to do.''
	   Taylor said whether Waugh's evidence had lost credibility was
not his call.
	   ``That's up to the judge to decide and that's what he will have
to do,'' he said.
	   The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was likely to
establish its own inquiry into match-fixing and bribery allegations
at a meeting in New Zealand in January.

Warne may not be back by end of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Shane Warne's dream of returning to
the Australian cricket side for the Dec. 26 test in Melbourne is
beginning to fade with the leg spinner admitting that goal may have
been unrealistic.
	   Warne has managed just six wickets at the unflattering average
of 62.83 in his three domestic shield appearances since returning
from shoulder surgery, one of those coming in his most recent
outing against Queensland which ended in a draw on Monday.
	   While failing to take wickets, Warne has also not been his usual
economical self, conceding more than five runs an over in his
second game against South Australia while his seven second-innings
overs against Queensland went for 39 runs.
	   Warne was disappointed with the Queensland effort and admits his
dream of a Dec. 26 return is beginning to fade.
	   ``It is getting a bit tight for Boxing Day,'' he said. ``I've
only got one game between now and then and I guess we'll have to
wait and see how I go in that next game.''
	   That match is at the spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground against
a test-strength New South Wales side, starting Saturday.
	   Australia has already retained the Ashes without the man who is
one of only two Australians to take 300 test wickets. The West
Indies tour in late February is now looking like a more realistic
goal for Warne.
	   Both his replacements, leg spinning understudy Stuart MacGill
and veteran
	   Colin Miller, have been major contributors to the home side's
unbeatable 2-0
	   lead after just three tests against England. (djp)

General strike brings Greece to standstill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Strikes and labor protests brought
transportation chaos and a bureaucratic standstill Tuesday in a
nationwide display of anger against government fiscal reforms.
	   The 24-hour general strike _ joined by a range of unions from
doctors to bus drivers _ was called to oppose efforts to streamline
Greece's economy and qualify for participation in the European
Union's single currency by 2001.
	   Labor groups are fighting government plans such privatizations
of state holdings and wage freezes to lower inflation. They also
fear losing job security and other benefits as Greece tries to
conform with the strict EU guidelines.
	   The parliament budget debate opens Thursday, possibly launching
another round of labor unrest. But Premier Costas Simitis has vowed
to stick to his austerity program.
	   Public transport workers held work stoppages during the morning
rush hour, causing widespread gridlock in Athens. Only trolleys,
which operate mainly in the center, continued working.
	   Three separate protest marches led to many of the city's major
roads being blocked off to vehicles, making traffic disruptions
even worse.
	   School students and teachers joined in the demonstrations,
protesting government education reforms. They are already occupying
1,500 schools around the country. They are refusing to hold classes
until the government backs off on the changes, which include
expanding the university entrance exams beyond just a single test.
	   Olympic Aviation, the subsidiary of Greece's national carrier,
carried out only one flight to each domestic destination.
International flights were not expected to be affected.
	   Public hospitals were accepting only emergency cases, while
hospital doctors also held a six-hour work stoppage.
	   Port workers were also scheduled to walk off the job for two
hours, but passenger ships the country were unable to leave ports
due to gale-force winds.
	   Banks, post and tax offices and other state services remained
shut throughout the day.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Karol Jezik, editor in chief of
Slovakia's leading opposition daily died from complications from a
head injury, the paper reported Tuesday. He was 45.
	   Jezik died on Monday after a week in a coma, following a head
injury sustained at a music concert, Sme said.
	   Jezik helped found Slovakia's Sme daily in 1993, when he also
became editor in cheif. For several years, the daily was the only
newspaper to report objectively on the authoritarian regime of
former Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
	   Under Meciar, Sme was the only paper to give voice to the
opposition that was voted into power last September. Some of Sme's
reporters were persecuted and threatened for their reporting during
the Meciar's rule.
	   ``I'm sorry that the heart of this generous man, a warrior for
freedom of press and democracy, stopped beating,'' wrote former
president Michal Kovac in a condolence letter to the daily on
Tuesday.
	   Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, Culture Minister Milan
Knazko, deputies of the Slovak parliament, sportsmen and
celebrities also sent open condolence letters to the paper.
	   ``Karol always talked about our readers, as if he knew them all.
He was convinced that we have to keep the enormous workload because
of them, because we are presenting values which are important to
them and which help to improve this world,'' wrote Alexej Fulmek,
director of VMV publishing house that owns Sme, in a front-page
editorial.
	   Throughout the past week, the paper has been publishing updates
on Jezik's health, along with the letters of support from his
readers.
	   Jezik is survived by his wife and a daughter.

Taliban reject fresh appeal for bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban rejected the latest
American appeal for suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden Tuesday,
accusing the United States of behaving like a bully.
	   The U.S. State Department renewed its appeal for bin Laden on
Monday and warned of possible fresh attacks by his followers
against U.S. interests.
	   Washington believes bin Laden masterminded the August attack on
two U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people.
	   ``America wants bin Laden without providing any evidence or
proof,'' Deputy Interior Minister Mohammed Khaqzar told The
Associated Press in an interview. ``America is just trying to show
how powerful it is.''
	   Last month the Taliban conducted a Supreme Court inquiry into
accusations that bin Laden finances Islamic terrorists worldwide
and is targeting specifically U.S. interests.
	   The inquiry concluded that the international community, and in
particular the United States, had failed to provide any evidence of
their claims against bin Laden.
	   Washington did not provide the Taliban's Supreme Court with
evidence and the U.S. State Department later issued an official
statement saying that bin Laden's crimes were well known.
	   In retaliation for the attacks on its embassies in Africa, the
United States on Aug. 21 fired several Tomahawk cruise missiles at
suspected camps run by bin Laden in eastern Afghanistan. At least
26 people were killed. The Taliban said they were students at
religious schools.
	   Bin Laden escaped unhurt.
	   Khaqzar said a mighty superpower like the United States should
be ``ashamed'' of its attack on Afghanistan -- a poor country that
has endured 20 years of relentless war.
	   ``We have had 20 years of war. Two million of our people died
for our independence. We have thousands of widows and amputees. It
is shameful for a superpower to fire rockets at a poor man. The
United States should be ashamed,'' he said.
	   A U.S. Court has indicted bin Laden on charges that he was
behind the deadly bombing attack in eastern Africa.
	   Khaqzar said bin Laden has promised the Taliban ruler Mullah
Mohammed Omar that he will not use Afghanistan as a staging arena
for terrorist attacks. The guarantee has been given in writing, he
said.
	   The Taliban also say bin Laden is their honored guest and in
keeping with Afghan tradition a guest cannot be turned away.

Russia's budget on hold until next week, parliament says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament probably won't begin debating
the country's 1999 budget until the middle of next week, despite
pressure to approve the document as soon as possible, parliament's
speaker said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government wants the budget
passed before January so it can chart a course for taking the
country out of its economic depression.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget document probably wouldn't
start until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and would not finish quickly,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Russia's economy suffered a major setback in August after the
government devalued the ruble and froze some debt payments.
Primakov has moved cautiously to develop a plan that would end the
crisis and reverse years of economic decline.
	   The passage of the budget could also help Russia attract loans
from international lenders, who have frozen disbursements since the
crisis hit.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's team
has widespread support in the Communist-dominated Duma, raising
hopes that the budget can be approved without lengthy debate.
	   Primakov has called for the state to play a larger role in the
economy, but both he and President Boris Yeltsin say the country
will not backtrack on political and economic reforms.
	   ``No economic hardship will make us turn around on the road to
democratic reform,'' Yeltsin said during a meeting with foreign
ambassadors at the Kremlin, according to Interfax.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament probably won't begin debating
the country's 1999 budget until the middle of next week, despite
pressure to approve the document as soon as possible, parliament's
speaker said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government wants the budget
passed before January so it can chart a course for taking the
country out of its economic depression.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget document probably wouldn't
start until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and would not finish quickly,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Russia's economy suffered a major setback in August after the
government devalued the ruble and froze some debt payments.
Primakov has moved cautiously to develop a plan that would end the
crisis and reverse years of economic decline.
	   The passage of the budget could also help Russia attract loans
from international lenders, who have frozen disbursements since the
crisis hit.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's team
has widespread support in the Communist-dominated Duma, raising
hopes that the budget can be approved without lengthy debate.
	   Primakov has called for the state to play a larger role in the
economy, but both he and President Boris Yeltsin say the country
will not backtrack on political and economic reforms.
	   ``No economic hardship will make us turn around on the road to
democratic reform,'' Yeltsin said during a meeting with foreign
ambassadors at the Kremlin, according to Interfax.

Sri Lankans upset over Jayasinghe's exit

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe's abrupt
withdrawal from the Asian Games has upset both officials and fans
from Sri Lanka, who were counting on her for medals, at least in
relay races.
	   ``No one in our camp is sure if she really sustained injuries,
or she was scared to run and not win in her personal events,'' said
a Sri Lankan sports official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Jayasinghe, 23, the world 200-meter silver medalist, did not
show up for the 100-meter gold medal race Monday. After her
semifinal the previous day, she pleaded a headache and a sore leg,
possibly a pulled hamstring.
	   Her departure for home Monday was the latest chapter in a
troubled year in which she accused unnamed Sri Lankan officials of
sexual harassment and tested positive for a steroid. Her own
nation's track federation cleared her after she said she used the
drug to control her menstrual cycle, but she now is awaiting an
international arbitration hearing. Meanwhile, she remains eligible
to compete.
	   ``We don't know what really happened in Bangkok. We only this
much _ that if she was there and running, we could have won some
medals at the relays,'' said Sujatha de Silva, a Colombo resident
reached by the telephone from Bangkok.
	   After her semifinal Sunday, Jayasinghe said she had been down
with flu and could not practice.
	   ``She told us she is injured and we got her examined by
doctors,'' said Daya Gunasekhara, chief of the Sri Lankan team. ``I
am unable to comment on how serious were her injuries, but then if
an athlete does not want to run you cannot make him or her run.''
	   A leg injury was not apparent in her semifinal race.
	   Even without her, Sri Lanka won its first two Asian Games gold
medals in 24 years Monday with victories in the women's and men's
400-meter races by Damayanthi Darsha and Sugath Tillekeratne.
	   That had led to high hopes for the 4 x 400 women's relay.
	   Jayasinghe originally had been counting on these games to help
rise above the controversies swirling around her.
	   She had won silver at the 1997 World Track Championships in
Athens, finishing ahead of Jamaican runner Merlene Ottey, making
her war-scarred nation proud.
	   Her rewards included money and a three-bedroom flat in Colombo,
capital of the island nation off India's southern coast.
	   But the good times did not last long.
	   After her positive drug test, she told The Associated Press that
she feared her urine samples were tampered with. She said it was
part of an effort to defame her and end her career because she had
made public the sexual advances of Sri Lankan sports officials.

Pinochet lawyers ask Britain's highest court to set aside judgment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 6th graf, UPDATES with new judges sitting; 11th graf, CORRECTS
to show Kingsley Napley is law firm, not person; court hearing
scheduled to start 1030 GMT
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a highly unusual move, lawyers for Gen. Augusto
Pinochet are asking Britain's highest court to set aside its own
ruling that denied him immunity from arrest, arguing that one of
the judges has close ties to Amnesty International.
	   A hearing, scheduled to last two days, opens Tuesday before a
five-judge tribunal at the House of Lords. It is the first time
since 1823, according to one report, that the court has been asked
to sit in judgment of itself. The previous challenge, involving a
land ownership case, failed.
	   The return of Pinochet's British lawyers to the Lords marks the
next step in a long legal battle by the 83-year-old former Chilean
dictator to avoid extradition to Spain on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while recuperating
from back surgery. He is now under police guard at a rented mansion
at Wentworth, an exclusive residential estate 20 miles (30 kms)
west of London.
	   In a 3-2 decision, the Lords ruled Nov. 25 that Pinochet has no
immunity from prosecution under British law as a former head of
state. None of the judges at Tuesday's hearing was involved in the
Lords' first Pinochet ruling.
	   One of the three who ruled against Pinochet was Lord Justice
Leonard Hoffmann, the unpaid director of the fundraising arm of
Amnesty International, the human rights group which has played a
key role in a long campaign to have Pinochet arrested.
	   Hoffmann, a native-born South African and opponent of apartheid,
settled in Britain in the 60s. His wife, Gillian, also a South
African, is a secretary in the London press office of Amnesty.
	   The human rights group says the Hoffmanns played no part in its
campaign to get Pinochet arrested. Pinochet's lawyers could have
found out before the hearing about the Amnesty link, it says.
	   As well as the attempt in the Lords, Pinochet's lawyers also
plan to challenge a British Cabinet member's decision to allow
Spain to try to extradite him.
	   The London firm of attorneys Kingsley Napley said Monday it
would ask England's High Court to challenge Home Secretary Jack
Straw's approval of the Spanish extradition request.
	   Such applications normally contend a decision was wrong in law
or that Straw did not properly exercise discretionary powers.
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people, including
Spaniards, were murdered or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's
secret police after he overthrew an elected Marxist in a violent
coup. Chile wants Pinochet freed, partly because he is a
senator-for-life in the new democratic government built on
compromise.
	   On Monday, Chile said it will suspend some arms deals with
Britain and Spain. A commission has been appointed to choose
projects.

	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace accord, but he
declared the Mideast peace process ``back on track.''
	   Clinton held out hope the pullback would take place soon. ``We
will have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine,''
he said after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success.
	   ``I think we are back on track again and we're going to see this
thing through,'' he told reporters at this border checkpoint. ``I
have achieved what I came here to achieve.''
	   He was returning to Washington later in the day.
	   Clinton said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would return
to the region soon for further talks.
	   In Tuesday's three-way meeting at this border crossing, the
leaders discussed the work of committees set up under the October
accords negotiated at Wye River, Maryland, to work out sticky
issues such as weapons confiscation and the size of police forces,
Clinton said.
	   ``We now have to decide practical means to go forward,'' he
said.
	   Clinton said the meeting was frank.
	   Arafat left the meeting without speaking to reporters.
	   ``The atmosphere was an open exchange,'' Netanyahu said at a
news conference.
	   Netanyahu repeated his insistence that he would only withdraw
troops in the West Bank if the Palestinians fulfilled their
obligations under the Wye River deal. He said they would have to
confiscate illegal weapons, stop inciting to violence against
Israel, publicly drop plans to declare a state unilaterally in May
and agree to Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``When they do this, we will do what we are required to do,''
Netanyahu said, adding that the faster the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations, the faster Israel would withdraw troops. This
phase of the withdrawal was supposed to begin Friday.
	   ``It would be unfortunate if get too far behind schedule,''
Clinton said. He stressed that Netanyahu had reaffirmed Israel's
obligation to complete the agreed troop withdrawals, even as he
refused to go ahead now.
	   After the meeting, Clinton headed to Bethlehem to visit the
Church of the Nativity in Manger Square with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.
	   It was the first time that Netanyahu and Arafat had met since
signing the Wye accords in Washington.
	   The way for the three-way meeting was cleared with the
Palestinian vote Monday _registered with a show of hands and
applause _ that removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964
from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   Speaking to hundreds of Palestinians on Monday, Clinton did not
discourage statehood hopes. In fact, he said he sought ``legitimate
rights for Palestinians'' along with ``real security for Israel.''
	   Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem that the Palestinians'
revocation of anti-Israel language in their charter would ``lead to
a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long peace.'' But at
the same time, he said Arafat must renounce plans to declare
statehood and take steps to end the violence in the region.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' Netanyahu declared in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep all the provisions, and
no amount of pressure is going to change this.''
	   Albright lodged a familiar plea for both leaders to stop making
statements that appeared to prejudge the outcome of negotiations on
an overall settlement. She also suggested Palestinian complaints
that Israel was releasing common criminals but not political
prisoners should be taken up directly with Israel.
	   ``It clearly is a very sensitive point for the Palestinians,''
she said. ``It can be resolved by having honest and frank
discussions.''

IOC official says bribes could be hospitality
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's International
Olympic Committee (IOC) representative Tay Wilson believes some of
his colleagues may be confusing bribe attempts with genuine
hospitality.
	   Wilson, speaking Tuesday on the controversy which has broken out
at the IOC over corruption in the bidding process for hosting
Winter and Summer Olympics, said he had personally never been
approached with a bribe to buy his vote.
	   ``Each time we go (to a bidding city) we are offered various
souvenirs and certainly are treated very, very well,'' Wilson, one
of 111 IOC members, said Tuesday.
	   ``Some years ago the IOC took steps to ensure as far as they
could that cities were restricted in what they could do. They made
it very clear gifts have to be limited to 100 US dlrs _ that's the
total for gifts.
	   ``(But) it's done in such a way of friendliness that maybe some
members accepted them at face value, only to have it turn on them
at a later stage.''
	   Wilson said what he might consider an illegal approach from a
bidding city, or anyone acting for that city, might not be viewed
the same way by some of his IOC colleagues.
	   ``If I lived behind the Iron Curtain, or was from a very poor
country and wanted to have some education for my family which was
not otherwise available, and it was generously offered, who says
what I might have done.
	   ``We each come from different backgrounds and cultures, so what
is quite unacceptable to me could well be acceptable to those who
live in a society which has different standards.'' (djp)

Report: Bid committee warned against gift-giving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee was
warned repeatedly against giving gifts to members of the U.S.
Olympic Committee, according to a member of the USOC site selection
team.
	   Howard Peterson, who now lives in Salt Lake City, told KTVX that
a decade ago the Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee offered him
expensive clothes, alcohol and other gifts when he was a member of
the selection team, which inspects cities seeking to stage the
Olympic Games.
	   ``We cautioned Salt Lake about crossing the line on gift-giving
practices and, shortly thereafter, Salt Lake acknowledged they
would be more careful in the future,'' Peterson told the television
station.
	   Peterson pointed to a 1989 internal USOC evaluation which said,
``Site inspection team cautions gift giving practices. Salt Lake
Winter Games Organizing Committee may have stepped over the line in
this area.''
	   The committee was warned about its practices on other occasions,
said Peterson, and a letter that bears bid committee chairman Tom
Welch's name said that the committee was taking steps toward the
``establishment of review to assure that gifts or mementos are
appropriate in nature.''
	   Salt Lake Organizing Committee spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said
the committee will not have any information on Peterson's
allegations until a full inquiry into the bid records is conducted.
	   Questions arose in late November when it was learned that the
Salt Lake Bid Committee paid nearly dlrs 400,000 for scholarships
to 13 people, including six relatives of International Olympic
Committee officials.
	   Some, like Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler, have
called the practice bribery. On Sunday, IOC Salt Lake Organizing
Committee president Frank Joklik apologized for the embarrassment
caused by the scandal.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has appointed a special
committee to investigate the scholarship fund.

Taiwanese party plans visit to Chinese military sites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A pro-unification political party said
Tuesday it plans to send a delegation to visit Chinese military
sites next year in a move to help ease tensions between the two
sides.
	   China extended the invitation to the New Party two months ago,
but the visit was put off because of national and mayoral elections
in Taiwan, said Yok Mu-ming, the party's secretary general.
	   The party, formed by former members of the ruling Nationalist
Party, strongly advocates reunification with China.
	   ``Taiwanese have been worried about possible Chinese military
actions against us,'' Yok said. ``The visit could demonstrate that
the Chinese communists are sincere about resolving differences by
peaceful means.''
	   Yok's comments came one day after the daily Hong Kong Standard
reported that Beijing may open several of its most sensitive
military sites to Taiwanese visitors to promote military exchanges.
	   The sites, it said, include the military bases in Xiamen in the
southeastern province of Fujian, which faces Taiwan's offshore
frontline, and an M-9 ballistic missile base in the central
province of Jiangxi.
	   China's Central Military Commission has approved the exchanges,
the Standard quoted sources as saying.
	   Taiwan and China have been politically separated following a
civil war in China in 1949, but Beijing still considers Taiwan a
renegade province to be reunified by force, if necessary.
	   A Taiwanese Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Taiwan has moved toward military transparency by
issuing defense policy papers and opening a website on the Internet
to provide military information.
	   ``We welcome any moves (by China) that could help foster
positive interaction,'' he said.
	   New Party officials said they had earlier asked former premier
Hau Pei-tsun to lead the delegation to China, but Hau rejected for
fear Taiwanese would view the visit as a concession to China's plan
to force reunification with the island.

Dan Reeves has heart surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Dan Reeves, who has the Atlanta Falcons on the
brink of the best record in franchise history, had quadruple bypass
surgery Monday and probably will miss the rest of the regular
season.
	   The 54-year-old coach is expected to be discharged Friday and
recover in time for the playoffs.
	   Reeves, who had less serious heart problems in 1990 and '91,
checked into Piedmont Hospital a day after feeling ill during a
27-17 victory over the New Orleans Saints, which gave the Falcons
their franchise-tying 12th victory.
	   Rich Brooks, the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach,
will be the interim head coach for Sunday's game at Detroit. Tears
welled in his eyes when he spoke of Reeves' importance to the NFC
West-leading Falcons (12-2), who have only five playoff appearances
in 32 years before this season.
	   ``We're talking about a guy who has meant everything to this
organization,'' Brooks said. ``It's just been a remarkable
turnaround. And the one rock-solid, steady ingredient is Dan
Reeves.''
	   A team physician, Dr. Charles Harrison, stressed that Reeves did
not have a heart attack and there was no permanent damage to the
organ.
	   Harrison said the high-stress world of coaching may have
contributed to Reeves' condition. NFL coaches Bill Parcells and
Mike Ditka also have experienced heart problems.

Holbrooke in Serbia amid new tensions in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke arriving, heading for Kosovo, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia Tuesday to try and revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight.
	   The news came as U.S. envoy Holbrooke arrived here and
immediately headed for Kosovo. Later Tuesday he was to return to
Belgrade to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
``emphasize the need to move ahead expeditiously'' on a peace plan,
the U.S. State Department said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO aistrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission aimed at ensuring the peace agreement is kept,
condemned the violence ``in the strongest terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.'' He said the verification
mission ``will intensify, in the light of the recent violence''
efforts to help create the conditions of confidence and respect for

	   In the gunbattle in Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified

``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with

mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.

	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace accord, but he
declared the Mideast peace process ``back on track.''
	   Clinton held out hope the pullback would take place soon. ``We
will have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine,''
he said after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success.
	   ``I think we are back on track again and we're going to see this
thing through,'' he told reporters at this border checkpoint. ``I
have achieved what I came here to achieve.''
	   He was returning to Washington later in the day.
	   Clinton said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would return
to the region soon for further talks.
	   In Tuesday's three-way meeting, the leaders discussed the work
of committees set up under the October accords negotiated at Wye
River, Maryland, to work out sticky issues such as weapons
confiscation and the size of police forces, Clinton said.
	   ``We now have to decide practical means to go forward,'' he
said.
	   Clinton said the meeting was frank.
	   Arafat left without speaking to reporters, but an adviser,
Marwan Kanafani, accused Netanyahu of ``doing away with all the
hopes'' that Palestinians and Israelis had in Clinton's visit.
	   ``He is intentionally crushing all efforts that Clinton exerted
and is stopping the implementation of an agreement he personally
signed,'' said Kanafani.''
	   Netanyahu, the only leader to hold a formal news conference
described the meeting as ``an open exchange.''

General strike brings Greece to standstill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Strikes and labor protests brought
transportation chaos and a bureaucratic standstill Tuesday in a
nationwide display of anger against government fiscal reforms.
	   The 24-hour general strike _ joined by a range of unions from
doctors to bus drivers _ was called to oppose efforts to streamline
Greece's economy and qualify for participation in the European
Union's single currency by 2001.
	   Labor groups are fighting government plans to privatize state
holdings and freeze wages to lower inflation. They also fear losing
job security and other benefits as Greece tries to conform with
strict EU guidelines.
	   The parliament budget debate opens Thursday, possibly launching
another round of labor unrest. But Premier Costas Simitis has vowed
to stick to his austerity program.

China puts dissidents on trial in biggest crackdown in three years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE McDONALD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two months after its highly publicized signing of
a key human rights treaty, China is putting two dissident leaders
on trial Thursday in its biggest political crackdown in more than
three years.
	   Veteran activist Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, a student leader
of 1989 pro-democracy protests, could be imprisoned for life if
convicted of subversion for challenging the Communist Party's grip
on power by trying to start an opposition party.
	   The campaign against the China Democracy Party highlights
Beijing's determination to crush political challengers even as it
opens up the economy and other facets of Chinese life.
	   ``The battle over changing China politically is a long-term one,
and we've had enough thaws over the decades to know that they are
always followed by frosts,'' said Gerald Segal of the International
Institute of Strategic Studies.
	   The crackdown follows a busy season of high-level diplomacy,
including a state visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, regarded by
China as mostly successful. With no more major events scheduled,
Chinese leaders have a freer hand to crush dissent without fear of
repercussions.
	   The Clinton administration and other Western governments already
have dropped links between human rights and trade, and largely
stopped criticizing China in the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
	   ``The U.S. and the West have given up all their material and
symbolic sanctions,'' said Andrew Nathan of Columbia University.
``All they have left is verbal intercessions.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing protested the detentions, but Nathan
said, ``there was nothing at the political level _ at the White
House level _ in the way of an expression of disapproval.''
	   Wang and Qin are the most prominent dissidents to stand trial
since Wang Dan, another former student leader in 1989, was
sentenced in 1995 to 11 years in prison on subversion charges. He
was released last April on the condition he go into exile _ a
tactic used by the Chinese government to rid itself of its most
vocal domestic critics.
	   Arrested with Qin on Nov. 30 was Xu Wenli, another veteran
activist and cofounder of the China Democracy Party. He also is
accused of subversion, but prosecutors haven't said whether he will
be put on trial.
	   As many as 12 other people associated with the party have been
detained in various Chinese cities. A law student who circulated a
petition calling for Wang's release is missing and believed to have
been detained.
	   In Washington, two U.S. senators joined Chinese dissidents at a
protest Monday outside the Chinese Embassy, demanding the release
of the detainees.
	   ``These activists simply tried to exercise their freedom to form
and register a democratic political party,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, a Republican from Arkansas. ``But in the eyes of the
Chinese government, democracy is a crime.''
	   A statement released Tuesday in Beijing by a group of activists
said the formation of the China Democracy Party was in the
country's best interests, because it was intended to promote
peaceful reform.
	   Qin's activism stretches back to the Democracy Wall movement of
the late 1970s. That political opening, which followed the death of
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, ended with a crackdown and
prison terms for Qin and others when critics began pointing out
government faults.
	   The latest tightening is a disappointment to human rights groups
that welcomed China's signing of the International Covenant of
Civil and Political Rights on Oct. 6. The agreement backs the right
of self-determination, prohibits torture and provides for freedom
of movement, religion, expression and association.
	   ``It's just really a sign that they're determined to show that
they're not prepared to go as far as many people had hoped,'' said
Louise Vischer, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International in London.
	   The Chinese government says those detained are suspected of
criminal offenses, and insists that the recent detentions don't
contradict the covenant or other human rights agreements that it
has signed.
	   ``This has nothing to do with human rights,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said last week.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kang Ji-Sook and Lee Mi-Young gained
South Korea's third gold medal in Asian Games soft tennis events
Tuesday by defeating Taiwan's Lin Li-jung and Cheng Shu-chen in the
women's doubles final, 5-3, 4-1, 4-2, 2-4, 4-2, 4-2.
	   South Korea previously had won the women's and men's team events
in the sport, an Asian variant of tennis that uses soft rubber
balls, smaller rackets and a different scoring system.
	   It was the second gold for Kang and Lee in the games. They were
also part of the champion team.
	   In doubles, they lost once in qualifying play but beat
previously unbeaten Chang Shu-chuan and Hsu I-chia of Taiwan in the
opening round of the final competition. Kang and Lee went on to
beat Japan's Naoko Higashi and Yuko Miyaji in the semifinals.
	   Higashi and Miyaji won the bronze over China's Liu Ya and Bai
Xia 4-0, 4-2, 4-2, 2-4, 4-1, 2-4, 4-2.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An announcement paging Kim in the Asian
Games athletes' village might cause some confusion. The organizing
committee has counted 113 people there by that common Korean
surname.
	   In a report Tuesday on games facts and figures, the organizers
also said they spent the equivalent of dlrs 56,000 to buy eight
tons of kimchi, a favorite Korean food, for the athletes' dining
rooms.
	   They also bought 2,592 table tennis balls, an average of 20.7
for each of the 125 players.
	   The organizers said that despite having the fewest rivers, Iran
had the fifth largest canoeing team among the 17 nations competing
in that sport, with five men and five women.

ASEAN to urge China to show restraint on the Spratlys
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Philippines' foreign secretary said
Tuesday that the disputed Spratly Islands have become ``an accident
waiting to happen,'' and urged China and other countries with
troops stationed there to show restraint.
	   Leaders of the Philippines and the other eight countries in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations plan to meet with China's
vice president on Wednesday to discuss conflicting claims to the
islands in the South China Sea.
	   But Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said ASEAN will
use the meeting to urge all six countries that claim the islands to
calm down.
	   ``We all should exercise restraint. It's not just China,''
Siazon told reporters Tuesday, the opening day of the annual ASEAN
summit.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
	   Each country except Brunei has soldiers stationed there, and all
except China and Taiwan are ASEAN members.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a protest with Beijing after Chinese
workers began enlarging buildings erected at Mischief Reef, part of
the Spratly chain. Both countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but Manila says they could be used militarily because of their
extensive docking areas and satellite communications equipment.
	   On Wednesday, ASEAN leaders are to meet with Chinese Vice
President Hu Jintao to discuss the Spratlys and other regional
issues, such as the Asian economic crisis.
	   Siazon said the ASEAN leaders have prepared a statement that
they will present to Hu, but denied it will single out China for
criticism.
	   ``This is a wake-up call for all of us because there are four
ASEAN countries claiming the area, or parts of it,'' said Siazon.
``China and Taiwan also are involved, and this very limited area is
just an accident waiting to happen.''
	   However, an ASEAN source said foreign ministers were sharply
critical of China's role in the Spratlys during a private meeting
on Saturday, and that an internal document reflects that position.
	   ASEAN also includes Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore and
Thailand.

Holbrooke in Serbia amid new tensions in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia Tuesday to try and revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight.
	   The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived here and immediately
headed for Kosovo. Later Tuesday he was to return to Belgrade to
meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ``emphasize the need
to move ahead expeditiously'' on a peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said Monday.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission aimed at ensuring the peace agreement is kept,
condemned the violence ``in the strongest terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.'' He said the verification
mission ``will intensify, in the light of the recent violence''
efforts to help create the conditions of confidence and respect for
human life.
	   In the gunbattle in Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified

Inflation again hits government target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation hit the government's 2.5 percent
target in November, the fourth consecutive month.
	   The underlying inflation rate has held steady since it dropped
from July's rate of 2.6 percent, the government said Tuesday.
	   At the same time, headline inflation _ which includes mortgage
interest payments _ dropped 0.1 percent for the month.
	   The figures are expected to be seen as further justification for
last week's half-point cut in interest rates by the Bank of England
and will intensify demands for more rate reductions in the new
year.
	   Industry and unions are warning that unless the bank takes
further action to combat the effects of the global downturn, the
manufacturing sector could slip into outright recession.
	   Some analysts believe that interest rates, currently standing at
6.25 percent, will have to come down to around 5 percent next year
as the economic downturn deepens.
	   A reluctance by clothing and footwear retailers to raise prices
after the autumn sales helped to keep inflation down last month,
while motoring costs also fell, largely due to a drop in the price
of gasoline.
	   However, the downward pressure on prices was largely offset by
non-seasonal food prices, which fell less than they did at the same
time last year.
	   The fall in the headline rate of inflation was almost entirely
due to mortgage lenders cutting their rates following the Bank of
England's quarter-point interest rate cut in October.

Two injured, homes destroyed in Turkish quakes and aftershocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAYSERI, Turkey (AP) _ Two people were slightly injured and some
20 homes collapsed from aftershocks that followed two moderate
earthquakes near this central Turkish city, reports said Tuesday.
	   Two earthquakes with preliminary magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5
struck the nearby town of Bunyan Monday afternoon. Twelve minor
aftershocks followed throughout the night, the Anatolia news agency
reported.
	   The two were injured overnight, after being hit by debris from
walls that caved in during the aftershocks. Cracks also appeared on
the walls of over a hundred other houses, Anatolia said.
	   A magnitude-4 quake can cause moderate damage in populated
areas.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.
	   In June, a southern town was leveled by a 6.3-magnitude quake,
killing 144 people.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six people died of hypothermia over the weekend in
Moscow, as temperatures dipped to minus 15 Celsius (5 degrees

Inflation again hits government target
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation hit the government's 2.5 percent
target in November, the fourth consecutive month.
	   The underlying inflation rate has held steady since it dropped
from July's rate of 2.6 percent, the government said Tuesday.
	   At the same time, headline inflation _ which includes mortgage
interest payments _ dropped 0.1 percent for the month.
	   The figures are expected to be seen as further justification for
last week's half-point cut in interest rates by the Bank of England
and will intensify demands for more rate reductions in the new
year.
	   Industry and unions are warning that unless the bank takes
further action to combat the effects of the global downturn, the
manufacturing sector could slip into outright recession.
	   Some analysts believe that interest rates, currently standing at
6.25 percent, will have to come down to around 5 percent next year
as the economic downturn deepens.
	   A reluctance by clothing and footwear retailers to raise prices
after the autumn sales helped to keep inflation down last month,
while motoring costs also fell, largely due to a drop in the price
of gasoline.
	   However, the downward pressure on prices was largely offset by
non-seasonal food prices, which fell less than they did at the same
time last year.
	   The fall in the headline rate of inflation was almost entirely
due to mortgage lenders cutting their rates following the Bank of
England's quarter-point interest rate cut in October.

Thai Air president guarantees insurers will pay victims of crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The president of Thai Airways on
Tuesday guaranteed that insurers will pay dlrs 100,000 to each
family of the 101 people who died in the crash of one his company's
planes.
	   Local papers reported on Monday that Dhipaya Insurance was
refusing to honor the pledge company president Thamnoon Wanglee had
made following the crash of Flight TG261.
	   But Thamnoon said he called the insurer on Tuesday and had
convinced them to pay in full the amounts he had promised, and to
start paying immediately.
	   Flight TG261 crashed during heavy rains in Friday Surat Thani,
530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of Bangkok, as it attempted
its third landing at the airport.
	   Forty five people survived the crash. Thamnoon said their
medical bills will be completely taken care of by the airline and
they will received 200,000 baht (dlrs 5,555) in additional
compensation.
	   An investigation by the government, civil aviation authorities
and Airbus of France, the manufacturer of the A310-200 plane is
underway.
	   Thamnoon said that while the investigation is underway, no one
at the airline has the right to comment on possible causes of the
crash.
	   Survivors have blamed the pilot, who died of his injuries after
the crash, for trying to land a third time in bad weather after
failing twice.
	   Surat Thani airport officials have also been questioned for
removing the airport's instrument landing system, a navigation
system that is considered safer than radio navigation when
visibility is poor.
	   The head of Thai Airway's Technical Division, said on Tuesday,
however, that the removal of the device should not have made a
difference.
	   ``As a former pilot myself, I don't think the lack of the
instrument landing system was the cause of the crash,'' said Chusak
Bachaiyud.
	   Sa-ad Sobsatrasorn, vice president of operations at Thai
Airways, said the pilot, Captain Pinit Wechsilpa, was well-trained
and had 12 years experience before being made a pilot earlier this
year.
	   ``There is no corruption in the selection of pilots for Thai
Airways. All our pilots are well-trained and qualified,'' he said.
	   Thamnoon disputed comments from an anonymous Thai Airways pilot
in Tuesday's The Nation newspaper who alleged that the airline's
pilots are under pressure to complete flights and not turn back
because of bad weather so they can save on fuel.
	   ``Safety is our highest priority,'' Thamnoon said. ``We are very
strict about this.''

Japan finance chief signals need for Asian fund to ward off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister signaled his support
Tuesday for a new Asian-based program to provide emergency funding
to countries in the region which would help fend off speculative
attacks on their currencies.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa also said that while the
Japanese economy is in ``shambles'' and will take at least two
years to fully recover, there have been some signs of improvement.
	   Speaking to a gathering of foreign reporters, the finance chief
and senior statesman of Japan's ruling party said rapid changes in
exchange rates and sudden surges in monetary flows have
destabilized emerging economies.
	   As a remedy, he urged consideration of a ``regional currency
support system,'' suggesting it could grow out of an existing
Japanese plan to pump dlrs 30 billion into Asian nations hurt by a
currency crisis last year.
	   The proposal resembles a plan for an ``Asian Fund'' which Japan
broached last year, but later abandoned in the face of strong
opposition from the U.S. amid fears it would encroach on the
International Monetary Fund's turf.
	   ``The IMF's job is to take care of after these attacks take
place. But my purpose is to prevent, forestall these attacks from
coming by having a fund to protect...these emerging countries,''
Miyazawa said.
	   He said American officials now may be willing to sanction such
efforts, indicating Washington has had second thoughts about its
initial response to the Asian financial crisis, which relied
heavily on IMF prescriptions.
	   The IMF's policy of linking aid to the implementation of
stringent economic reforms has been blamed by some observers in
Asia and elsewhere for prolonging the region's economic slump.
	   Miyazawa chastised the IMF by urging it to ``refrain from
requiring too broad or too ambitious structural reforms'' from
borrower nations. He added that controls on the flow of capital
might be justified in certain cases.
	   The finance minister also said Japan's economy may be poised for
a rebound, predicting that a quarterly Bank of Japan survey of
business community sentiment due out in March will show increased
optimism.
	   ``There are some signs of some improvement'' in the coming year,
he said. But he said unemployment could skyrocket as companies shed
redundant workers.
	   Japan has struggled to pull out of its deepest recession since
World War II by implementing limited tax cuts and increasing
spending on public works. It has also earmarked substantial funds
for stabilizing the banking system.
	   Miyazawa, who served as prime minister earlier this decade,
defended the government's decision to nationalize a major bank over
the weekend after the sudden disclosure last week that the lender,
Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., had become insolvent months ago.
	   ``That is really symbolic of the change in our system, in our
philosophy,'' he said, referring to the apparent abandonment of a
long-standing practice of propping up troubled banks.

Bomb explodes in minister's house in Nepal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A bomb exploded Tuesday at the house of a
government minister representing an area torn by Maoist insurgency,
but no one was injured, police said.
	   Land Reforms Minister Chiranjivi Wagle was not at home when the
bomb exploded, knocking down the boundary wall and shattering
windows.
	   Police said the bomb was detonated by a timing device.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. Police
have circulated a sketch of a youth seen in the area Monday night.
	   Wagle was elected from Gorkha, a district hit by a
three-year-old Maoist insurgency that has claimed nearly 400 lives.
The rebels oppose Nepal's constitutional monarchy and want Nepal to
be turned into a republic.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
rebounded Tuesday after three straight sessions of declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,

General strike brings Greece to standstill

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Strikes and labor protests brought
transportation chaos and a bureaucratic standstill Tuesday in a
nationwide display of anger against government fiscal reforms.
	   The 24-hour general strike _ joined by a range of unions from
doctors to bus drivers _ was called to oppose efforts to streamline
Greece's economy and qualify for participation in the European
Union's single currency by 2001.
	   Labor groups are fighting government plans such privatizations
of state holdings and wage freezes to lower inflation. They also
fear losing job security and other benefits as Greece tries to
conform with the strict EU guidelines.
	   The parliament budget debate opens Thursday, possibly launching
another round of labor unrest. But Premier Costas Simitis has vowed
to stick to his austerity program.
	   Public transport workers held work stoppages during the morning
rush hour, causing widespread gridlock in Athens. Only trolleys,
which operate mainly in the center, continued working.
	   Three separate protest marches led to many of the city's major
roads being blocked off to vehicles, making traffic disruptions
even worse.
	   High school students and teachers joined in the demonstrations,
protesting government education reforms. They are already occupying
1,500 schools around the country. They are refusing to hold classes
until the government backs off on the changes, which include
expanding the university entrance exams beyond just a single test.
	   During the demonstrations, youths threw stones and a gasoline
bomb at one of Athens' main post offices, causing minor damage.
There were no injuries.
	   Olympic Aviation, the subsidiary of Greece's national carrier,
carried out only one flight to each domestic destination.
International flights were not expected to be affected.
	   Public hospitals were accepting only emergency cases, while
hospital doctors also held a six-hour work stoppage.
	   Port workers were also scheduled to walk off the job for two
hours, but passenger ships the country were unable to leave ports
due to gale-force winds.
	   Banks, post and tax offices and other state services remained
shut throughout the day.

Guinea-Bissau rivals meet with Togo, Nigeria heads of state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The president and the rebel leader of
Guinea-Bissau have agreed on the composition of a government of
national unity, Togolese officials said Tuesday.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane
Mane met late into the night Monday with Togolese President
Gnassigbe Eyadema and Nigerian head of state Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, discussing the formation of their new government.
	   All the posts were not announced but Mane would be made minister
of defense and security, Togolese Foreign Ministry officials
confirmed.
	   Vieira and Mane began the talks separately but eventually met
together, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   The leaders also discussed planning for general elections, which
are to be held in March, and the deployment of West African
peacekeepers to Guinea-Bissau.
	   Those peacekeepers will replace troops from Senegal and Guinea,
which sent troops to the small West African country and former
Portuguese colony in June to help Vieira contain a military
rebellion lead by Mane.
	   About half of Guinea-Bissau's 1 million inhabitants were
displaced by the fighting triggered by the rebellion that ended in
November when Vieira and Mane agreed to cease hostilities and form
a government of national unity.
	   Both sides have agreed that rebel leader Francisco Fadul will be
the new prime minister.
	   Civil war broke out June 7 when disenchanted colonial war
veterans rebelled against Vieira's allegedly corrupt regime.
	   Under the peace agreement, presidential elections are to be held
by March.

gray-colored mattress which police said had semen stains from Anwar
Ibrahim's alleged illegal sexual activities.
	   Silence fell over the packed courtroom as a senior police
officer cut open brown paper wrapping to reveal a queen-sized,
spring mattress from which 13 pieces of cloth had been snipped out
for testing by police experts.
	   Prompted by curiosity about the well-publicized exhibit, many
people peeked into the courtroom even before Tuesday's hearing
began to catch a glimpse of the mattress leaning against a wall.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove that Anwar had sex with the wife
of his former secretary and that he tried to abuse his powers as
deputy prime minister of the Southeast Asian country to cover up
sexual trysts.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
posh Kuala Lumpur suburb which Anwar is accused of using for secret
meetings with sex partners.
	   As the wrapping was removed, Anwar smiled and then jokingly made
a gesture of sleeping by clasping both palms onto the side of his
head.
	   Pieces from the cloth covering of the mattress had been sent for
testing to police laboratories along with samples of Anwar's blood
for DNA analysis.
	   The results of those tests have not been disclosed to the court.
Prosecutors were expected to call in forensic experts later and
even produce a pillow that was seized along with the mattress.
	   Anwar, fired in September, currently faces abuse of power
charges and will be tried separately for allegedly having engaged
in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the charges against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule. Mahathir said his former protege
was morally unfit to rule.
	   ``While examining the mattress on July 10, 1998, I saw patches
on the cloth which I suspected to be seminal stain,'' said Musa
Hassan, the assistant commissioner of police who investigated the
charges against Anwar.
	   ``It was in the spots that had been slashed,'' he said after
uncovering the mattress with bits of sponge stuffing spilling out
from the areas where the cloth had been cut.
	   Musa surprised the court when he admitted during
cross-examination that blood samples from Anwar were taken for the
DNA tests without the politician's consent. Anwar was told that it
was for testing for the HIV virus.
	   The defense suggested that presence of semen stains on the
mattress did not imply Anwar had indulged in illegal sex because it
could be one of the mattress he had left behind in the official
residence of the deputy prime minister which he vacated soon after
being fired.
	   The new evidence has created obvious parallels with the case of
Monica Lewinsky, whose semen-stained blue dress has been touted as
vivid proof of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The prosecution's case was based on accusations by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar,
a former driver in the politician's household.
	   While Ummi has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife, Shamsidar Taharin, driver Azizan has claimed he was
repeatedly sodomized by Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi made the accusations in letters sent last year
to Mahathir. The pair retracted their allegations after being
arrested by police, but later said they were forced to do so.
	   The prosecution says Shamsidar, who has been attending the
hearings regularly, was taken to the apartment by an ally of Anwar,
who is now being tried for illegal possession of ammunition.
	   Later, the judge angered defense lawyers by blocking them from
trying to establish that police were fabricating evidence against
Anwar.
	   ``Mala fide is a very serious issue which you are brushing
aside,'' Raja Aziz Adrusse, Anwar's chief attorney, told Judge
Augustine Paul. Mala fide is the legal expression for bad
intention.
	   Defense lawyers are alleging that police had forced Anwar's
adopted brother, Sukma Dermawan, and his former speech writer,
Munawar Aness, to confess in a court that they had been sodomized
by Anwar.
	   The two are serving six-month jail sentences. Sodomy is illegal
in predominantly Muslim Malaysia.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
said Tuesday that reports he had suffered a heart attack were
exaggerated.
	   Alatas was hospitalized overnight Sunday while attending
meetings in advance of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
summit.
	   The hospitalization sparked rumors that Alatas, who has had
heart bypass surgery in the past, had suffered a heart attack.
	   ``That was a bit exaggerated,'' Alatas said as he emerged from
the first day of summit talks, looking a bit pale but otherwise
healthy. ``I was going for a checkup and everything is fine. Thank
God.''
	   Indonesian officials earlier said that Alatas was feeling tired
when he was admitted Sunday to Vietnam International Hospital. He
was released the next morning.

Delay in ASEAN entry displays neighbors' uncertainty in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Even though it was pulled off with
face-saving grace, the decision by Southeast Asian leaders to delay
Cambodia's entry into their regional bloc revealed uncertainties
about Prime Minister Hun Sen's new government, analysts said
Tuesday.
	   Just weeks after cementing a coalition government with his
former enemy Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen lobbied hard in
Hanoi to be accepted into the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations at the grouping's two-day summit.
	   But Southeast Asian leaders decided Monday at the summit to
again postpone Cambodia's entry. The rejection was quickly and
repeatedly followed by assurances to Hun Sen that his country's
membership would be approved in the near future.
	   ``A delay is a delay,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, executive director
of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a local think
tank. ``Membership has been delayed with an ASEAN way of
face-saving, but in the end it shows that there was no consensus.''
	   Cambodia was originally scheduled to join ASEAN last year along
with Laos and Myanmar, but the country's application was put on
hold following Hun Sen's violent ouster of Ranariddh, his co-prime
minister at the time.
	   Memories of the military confrontation that shook Phnom Penh
just 17 months ago when the prince was deposed may have been too
fresh for some ASEAN countries, Kao Kim Hourn said.
	   ``People think we are still going through a transition, so we
are viewed as somewhat unstable,'' he said, adding that vocal
support for a delay by Cambodia's opposition leader Sam Rainsy also
may have hurt Hun Sen's chances.
	   Sam Rainsy's party applauded the decision to delay membership in
a Tuesday statement, saying concerns of stability in the new
coalition voiced by Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines were
legitimate.
	   ``The timing of this admission must depend on Cambodia's
stability, a satisfactory and equitable resolution of power-sharing
issues, the maturation of effective legal institutions, the rule of
law and respect for human rights,'' the opposition party said.
	   Adding to the political uncertainties, are concerns that
Cambodia will have difficulties meeting ASEAN requirements to
liberalize its economy.
	   Cambodia currently relies heavily on customs duties as a source
of tax revenue, and ASEAN membership requires a phasing out of
import duties over the next several years.
	   Local economist Bith Seanglim, a former adviser to the Finance
Ministry, said the delay may be a blessing in disguise that will
give Cambodia more time to prepare for the changes.
	   ``Since we are not in, we should use this as a blessing instead
of getting an ill feeling,'' he said. ``The more time the better.
We can use this as an advantage.''
	   Cambodia's next opportunity to join ASEAN may be at a July
meeting of the nine member countries' foreign ministers in
Singapore.

Soldier who attacked American teacher charged with assault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A soldier who beat up an American
teacher last month was charged with hooliganism and assault, and
faces up to three years in prison, police said Tuesday.
	   The 61-year old teacher, identified as Bob Joyce, from
Cambridge, Mass., was knocked down, beaten and kicked on Nov. 21,
after he defended a group of Gypsies whom the 20-year-old soldier
verbally attacked.
	   The incident occurred in front of a local restaurant in the town
of Hodonin, where Joyce works as a teacher. Security cameras of a
nearby gas station captured it on tape, leading police to identify
the soldier as Nikola Holub.
	   Joyce has been living in the Czech Republic since 1993,
state-run CTK news agency reported. Since last year, he has lived
in Hodonin, 300 kilometers (187 miles) southeast of Prague,
teaching English at the local Caledonian School.
	   The charges were handed down last Friday, police said.

Thailand's upstarts dream of final; Iran, China clash again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Red cards will take their toll in the
Asian Games soccer semifinals Wednesday as China faces Iran in
their second grudge match in five days and host Thailand takes on a
Kuwaiti side that has forgotten how to score.
	   Thawatchai Sajakul, Thailand's manager, told a news conference
Tuesday that Thailand's stunning quarterfinal triumph over South
Korea was a ``miracle'' that could be repeated and take Thailand to
the finals.
	   ``The team is on a tour out of town to pray at the temples in
Ayutthaya,'' a historic capital, Thawatchai said. ``They're trying
to relax as much as they can.''
	   Thawatchai appealed for Thailand's rowdy fans _ who started
hurling bottles toward the pitch Monday when the Koreans equalized
in the final minutes of regulation time _ to be on their best
behavior.
	   Meanwhile, Bayern Munich star Ali Daei is on the verge of
seizing the top spot in the competition's goal-scoring charts, with
his second-half hat trick Monday in Iran's 4-0 victory over
Turkmenistan giving him a total of eight.
	   Two Kuwaitis who also have amassed eight goals, Jasem al-Huwaidi
and Farj Laheeb, failed to score in their last two matches.
Suddenly on fire, the Thais could run over the Gulf side if the
once deadly strikers can't again find some energy and the goal.
	   East Asian power China, which brought a largely young squad to
the games, is still looking to avenge a pair of defeats against
Iran that kept the Chinese out of the World Cup in France. But in
last week's preliminary play, Daei led a 2-1 victory over China.
	   The Englishman coaching China, Bobby Houghton, said that most of
his players hadn't been called to the national side until recently
and have no inherent defeatist complex against Iran.
	   But the absence of Hao Haidong, who put away a goal Monday
against Uzbekistan but was sent off after disputing a yellow card,
could fatally weaken China in what would always have been a tough
game.
	   The Chinese will rely on the scoring talents of Li Jinyu, who
put in the other two goals in the 3-0 shutout for a games total of
six, but are again likely to suffer against the bigger, bruising
Iranians in mid-field.
	   The Iranian side, packed with World Cup veterans, has clearly
emerged as the favorite for gold. After a sluggish first round,
Daei has found his stride and formed a deadly attack force with
Karim Bagheri.
	   If Iran was always a favorite, Thailand never was. But the Thais
are now staring at a spot in the finals. The fire and grit
displayed by the Thais _ beating the highly favored Koreans 2-1 in
extra time with just nine men _ could overcome Kuwait.
	   Thailand will miss its top scorer, Woorawoot Srimaka, and
defender Surachai Jirasirachote, who were both sent off Monday.
	   But the Kuwaitis looked so tired against Qatar _ allowing the
weaker side to take them to a penalty shootout _ that the Thais,
with a stadium full of supporters, are favored to beat them.
	   English coach Peter Withe has given the Thais confidence since
taking over last month. Last weekend, he scoured Bangkok markets to
find tapes of two songs he considers inspirational _ ``Eye of the
Tiger'' and ``We Are the Champions.''
	   Withe played the first to pump up his players at halftime
Monday. After they won, he mused whether the old Queen standby was
predicting a gold medal for his side.
	   ``Maybe.''

Embassy warns about travel between Lamu and Somali border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U. S. Embassy is warning American
citizens to exercise caution when traveling between Lamu Island and
the Somali border in northeastern Kenya following an armed robbery
at a resort in the area, spokesman Chris Scharf said Tuesday.
	   Scharf said some of those who were robbed Nov. 19 said the dozen
or so men asked specifically for Americans to come forward and
identify themselves. He said no Americans were staying at the
luxury resort, which he declined to identify, north of Lamu Island
at the time of the robbery.
	   Scharf said the witnesses, who volunteered the information, said
it wasn't clear why the bandits were looking for Americans.
	   Lamu Island, south of Kiwayu Island, where the robbery occurred,
is a small, traditional Swahili town that has turned into a resort
popular with foreigners.
	   Scharf said U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell would visit Lamu
Island Wednesday as part of her regular touring of the country.
	   ``We do not regard Lamu Island as a place where there is a
security threat,'' he said.
	   Scharf discounted local media reports linking the incident and
subsequent warning to friends or relatives of Mohamed Sadeek Odeh,
one of six people indicted in the United States in the Aug. 7
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in which 213 people, 12 of
them Americans, died.
	   Some members of Odeh's Kenyan wife's family come from Witu west
of Lamu, and he was reported to have spent time in the area in the
months before the bombing.
	   The German Embassy has also warned its citizens about traveling
in the region north and northeast of Lamu Island because of the
high incidence of armed banditry there.

Pollution forces Iran to shut schools, limit traffic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran shut more schools in Tehran and ordered
traffic restrictions Tuesday due to air pollution that is so bad
that residents of the capital have begun to wear face masks.
	   Air pollution levels Tuesday were more than six times higher
than acceptable levels set by the World Health Organization,
state-run Tehran radio reported.
	   For a second day, it urged people with heart problems and the
elderly to stay indoors until the pollution clears.
	   The government closed elementary schools Monday and extended the
closures to high schools on Tuesday, Tehran radio reported.
	   The decision to close the schools was based on a recommendation
by the Environmental Protection Organization.
	   Drugstores reported brisk sales of face masks, which many
residents of the capital of 10 million wore due to the thick haze
of smog enveloping the city.
	   The radio said that starting Wednesday cars would be allowed on
the roads only on alternate days, depending on whether their
license plates began with odd or even numbers. It did not say how
long the plan would remain in force.
	   The pollution and smog were worsened due to stagnant weather,
lack of rain and the city's fleet of old cars which emit noxious
exhaust fumes. Most of the cars are more than 20 years old.

Congolese rebels say they killed two Zimbabwean commanders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
on Tuesday said they had dealt a major blow to government efforts
to recapture southeastern Congo when they killed two senior
Zimbabwean commanders and captured a gunnery sergeant.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda said Zimbabwe, the main ally of Congolese
President Laurent Kabila, lost operations commander Col. Kufa and
squadron commander Lt. Col. Herbert Funi Fudler when Congolese
government forces and their allies on Monday tried to retake
Kabalo, a rebel-held Congo River port, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
southeast of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   A Zimbabwean gunner identified as Sgt. Edison was taken
prisoner, the radio said.
	   The radio said two helicopter gunships and tanks were destroyed
during a five-hour government assault across the Nzofu Bridge,
which guards entrance to Kabalo, 14 kilometers (8 miles) from the
town.
	   On Monday, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said one
Zimbabwean MiG-21 fighter jet and a helicopter gunship had been
downed. He later changed this to two helicopters destroyed.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
	   In Zimbabwe, military officials reported loosing one helicopter
gunship and an unspecified number of troops in fighting for Kabalo,
a staging point for the rebel advance into mineral-rich Katanga
Province and the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi in neighboring
Eastern Kasai Province.
	   The rebel coalition of ethnic Congolese Tutsis, disaffected
soldiers and opposition politicians took up arms Aug. 2 against
Kabila, accusing him of misrule, corruption and ethnic
war-mongering.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and arms to
support Kabila. So far, their counteroffensive has slowed down but
not stopped the rebels, who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   International efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed over
Kabila's persistent refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels,
whom he accuses of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   On Tuesday, Rwandan officials said they will participate in
another round of talks on the Congo situation sponsored by the
Organization of African Unity Thursday and Friday in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, but said they expected no results.
	   It was not clear whether rebel representatives have been
invited.
	   In an apparent lead-in to the Ouagadougou meeting, Congolese
Ambassador Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza told reporters in Nairobi, Kenya
Tuesday that the rebels were nothing more than a front for a
Rwandan Tutsi plan to take over central and eastern Africa.
	   ``The Tutsis believe that, like Hitler's dream in 1940, they can
dominate the Central and East Africa. They are encouraged by the
Americans,'' he said. ``The Congolese people are not
stupid....there is already an anti-American feeling in Congo.''
	   Tutsis are a minority in Rwanda but control the government and
the army since Tutsi rebels overthrew the majority Hutu government
in July 1994, putting an end to the government-orchestrated
slaughter of more than half a million Tutsis.
	   Rwanda and Uganda say they are backing the rebels to protect
their western border areas from attacks by Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels allowed by Kabila to set up bases inside eastern Congo.
	   Meanwhile, Angolan troops who helped fend off Congolese rebel
attacks on Kinshasa in August were continuing to withdraw from the
Atlantic airbase at Kitona and from Mbuji-Mayi, said Rwandan
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The pullout of at least 1,000 Angolans was apparently in
response to attacks by UNITA rebels on the government-held towns of
Cuito and Huambo in the central Angolan highlands.
	   The redeployment of Angolan troops to the home front could
seriously undermine Kinshasa's efforts to keep up the pressure on
the Congolese rebels.

<SLUG> Report: Japan to introduce 1,000 percent rice import tariff </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a move that could exacerbate U.S.-Japan trade
friction, Tokyo has decided to impose duties on foreign rice to
slow a rise in imports caused by quota requirements, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   The tariff on imported rice will be 350 yen (dlrs 2.98) to the
kilogram _ a rate of 1,000 percent _ and is expected to be
introduced in April next year, the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun
reported.
	   On Monday, U.S. Ambassador Tom Foley warned Japan against
implementing a rice tariff, saying it could ``cripple'' U.S. rice
imports to Japan and trigger a ``very serious (trade)
disagreement.''
	   Tokyo has brushed aside U.S. complaints on the issue, saying the
duty conforms with World Trade Organization regulations, the Asahi
said. The United States is a major exporter of rice to Japan.
	   Japan's Agriculture Ministry declined to confirm a final
decision has been made on the import tax.
	   A 1993 GATT trade agreement committed Japan to import four
percent of its rice in 1995 and to gradually increase that amount
to about eight percent by 2000. The Japanese government hopes an
import tariff will ward off a serious rice glut in Japan in
upcoming years, the Asahi said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was reportedly scheduled to
announce the plan on Friday upon his return from the summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian States in Vietnam.
	   Rice imports have long been a bitter issue in trade talks
between Japan and the United States. In September, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky pressured Tokyo to further open
its rice and other markets to foreign trade.

Soldier who attacked American teacher charged with assault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A soldier who beat up a
Massachusetts teacher last month was charged with hooliganism and
assault, and he faces up to three years in prison, police said
today.
	   The 61-year old teacher, identified as Bob Joyce, from
Cambridge, Mass., was knocked down, beaten and kicked on Nov. 21,
after he defended a group of Gypsies whom the 20-year-old soldier
verbally attacked.
	   The incident occurred in front of a local restaurant in the town
of Hodonin, where Joyce works as a teacher. Security cameras of a
nearby gas station captured it on tape, leading police to identify
the soldier as Nikola Holub.
	   Joyce has been living in the Czech Republic since 1993,
state-run CTK news agency reported. Since last year, he has lived
in Hodonin, 300 kilometers (187 miles) southeast of Prague,
teaching English at the local Caledonian School.
	   The charges were handed down last Friday, police said.

Pollution forces Iran to shut schools, limit traffic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran shut more schools in Tehran and ordered
traffic restrictions Tuesday due to air pollution that is so bad
that residents of the capital have begun to wear face masks.
	   Air pollution levels Tuesday were more than six times higher
than acceptable levels set by the World Health Organization,
state-run Tehran radio reported.
	   For a second day, it urged people with heart problems and the
elderly to stay indoors until the pollution clears.
	   The government closed elementary schools Monday and extended the
closures to high schools on Tuesday, Tehran radio reported.
	   The decision to close the schools was based on a recommendation
by the Environmental Protection Organization.
	   Drugstores reported brisk sales of face masks, which many
residents of the capital of 10 million wore due to the thick haze
of smog enveloping the city.
	   The radio said that starting Wednesday cars would be allowed on
the roads only on alternate days, depending on whether their
license plates began with odd or even numbers. It did not say how
long the plan would remain in force.
	   The pollution and smog were worsened due to stagnant weather,
lack of rain and the city's fleet of old cars which emit noxious
exhaust fumes. Most of the cars are more than 20 years old.

Li Meisu wins title 16 years after previous success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's one-time Olympic bronze
medalist Li Meisu on Tuesday won her second Asian Games shot put
gold medal 16 years after her first and two years after doctors
warned her to quit.
	   While the Chinese distance runners seem to be missing their Ma,
the oldest member of the team stepped up to dedicate her comeback
gold to her son, completing a remarkable comeback after a six-year
retirement.
	   Li, 39, was the Asian Games champion in 1982 and in 1988 was the
bronze medal winner at the Seoul Olympics.
	   She retired soon after and had a child but returned at the
Atlanta Olympics in 1996, where she missed a medal. Her son Tian
Zizhong turned 6 Tuesday and Li said ``the gold medal is the best
present.''
	   Li was in front with a second throw of 18.77 but improved it to
18.86 with her final attempt. Compatriot Cheng Xiaoyan, who had
18.55 with her third attempt, finished with silver.
	   Li, who was told by doctors to quit after she suffered a
post-Atlanta lung infection, and who competes on two dodgy knees,
said she persists to show that athletes don't have to walk away too
early.
	   She said Tuesday's win was ``sweeter'' than her Olympic bronze.
``I'm old now and getting this gold wasn't easy,'' Li said.
	   With enigmatic Chinese coach Ma Junren and his army of runners
staying away, Japan has taken a stranglehold on the distance medals
so far.
	   After claiming the women's marathon and both 10,000-meter races,
Japan picked up the men's 3,000 steeplechase through Yasunori
Uchitomi, who made up for the disappointment of four years earlier
when he was third in his hometown Hiroshima.
	   The time was a pedestrian 8:41.00, but Uchitomi took over with
800 to run and did just as much as necessary to keep ahead of
silver medalist Hamid Sajdjadi-Hazaveh of Iran. Iran's Jafar
Rassoulov trailed a long way back in third.
	   ``I was very disappointed four years ago and this time I wanted
the gold,'' said Uchitomi. ``I was confident in the last 400 meters
because I have raced (Sajdjadi-Hazaveh) four times before and
beaten him.''
	   Pole vault favorite Igor Potapovich, fourth in the event at the
1996 Olympics, gave Kazakstan a gold medal with 5.55 meters. His
compatriot Alexandr Korcahgin, the Asian championship silver
medalist, entered the event at 5.30 and failed all three attempts.
	   Kim Chul-kyun of South Korea was second at 5.40 while Japan's
Fumiaki Kobayashi got bronze.
	   China's Xu Gang had a bad fall attempting 5.40 and finished
fourth.
	   Games officials inexplicably put 11 finals on the program
Monday, including the glamor 100, 400 and 1,500 races. Tuesday's
session lacked luster in comparison, with three field finals, the
steeple and two 4x100-meter relays.
	   China's 100 champion Li Xuemei anchored a Chinese gold in the
women's event while men's 100 winner Koji Ito led a Japanese win in
the men's.
	   Masaki Morinaga of Japan won the men's long jump with 8.10
meters, ahead of Liu Hongning of China with 8.05.
	   Former drug offender Kim Jin-il of South Korea made a strong
return to the Asian Games, qualifying comfortably in the men's
800-meter semifinals.
	   Kim set the Asian record at 1:44.14 in June 1994, a few months
before he won the Hiroshima Asian Games title, also in a record
time.
	   But Kim tested positive for banned drug Clenbuterol in 1995 and
was out of the sport for three years. He said it felt ``very good''
to be back in competition but he was only running at 50 percent.
Kim's compatriot Kim Soon-hyung was the fastest qualifier, winning
the second semifinal in 1:50.13.
	   China's Asian champion Cheng Bing just scraped in and tipped his
silver medalist from that race, Qatar's Abdul Abdulla, as the
favorite for gold.
	   ``It was OK, man. My target's the gold,'' Abdulla said after
posting a 1:50.13.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdar, a surprise winner of the women's 1,500
Monday, was fourth fastest through to the women's 800 final.
Leading the field was Japan's Ryoko Takezawa in 2:04.35.

Chechnya declares state of emergency to fight crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament declared a one-month state
of emergency Tuesday to combat the rampant crime in the breakaway
territory, where hundreds of people have been kidnapped in recent
years, a report said.
	   Four Western hostages were beheaded in Chechnya last week in a
gruesome display of the lawlessness that has plagued the region
since the end of a 1994-6 independence war with Russia.
	   Chechnya's parliament declared the emergency at a session
Tuesday, deputy Rizvan Lorsanov told the Interfax news agency in
Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   ``The time for talking has passed and it is no longer possible
to tolerate the crime wave,'' Chechnya's Security Minister Aslambek
Arsayev said Monday.
	   Chechnya's security forces are trying to mobilize many of the
young men who served as rebel fighters in the war against Russia,
which saw the Russian forces depart in humiliation two years ago.
	   However, with Chechnya's economy shattered, many of the young
men have turned to crime and armed gangs roam operate freely
throughout the mostly Muslim territory.
	   ``We do not want to shed blood of the young and innocent
people,'' Arsayev said. ``But if they do not go home and defend
their leaders, they will be eliminated.''
	   Any attempt to crackdown on crime could provoke battles with
heavily armed outlaw groups.
	   In this lawless environment, kidnapping has become one of the
most lucrative businesses in Chechnya. Hundreds of people, many of
them ethnic Russians and foreigners, have been kidnapped for
ransom.
	   Three Britons and a New Zealander, kidnapped in October while
installing a telephone network, where beheaded last week,
apparently during a failed rescue operation.
	   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov, widely respected as a
military commander during the war, has been unable to impose his
authority since winning a landslide election almost two years ago.
	   His impoverished government barely functions, and many of the
young rebel fighters who served under him during the war have since
turned against him.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from his
latest illness, held a welcoming ceremony Tuesday for new
ambassadors to Russia, his press center said.
	   Yeltsin traveled to the Kremlin and greeted new ambassadors from
China, India, Qatar, Luxembourg, and 10 other countries, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Russia is interested in developing and stepping up further
relations with Latin American states, Mideast countries and states
situated in the Gulf,'' Yeltsin said. ``We firmly favor turning
this region into a zone of peace and stability.''
	   Though still recuperating, Yeltsin was released from a hospital
last week after receiving treatment for pneumonia for more than two
weeks. He has stayed at the Rus country residence since then,
making occasional trips into the Kremlin.
	   Despite his repeated ailments, Yeltsin insists he will serve out
his term, which runs until the year 2000. He has looked healthy and
animated in public appearances since his release from the hospital.

Coal miners defy return-to-work order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Most of Australia's coal miners defied
labor commission orders and stayed on strike Tuesday, following a
high-risk strategy against low prices.
	   Mine companies lamented ``severe weakness'' in the industrial
process when all but four of the country's 120 coal mines stood
idle.
	   The mining and energy division of the Construction, Forestry,
Mining and Energy Union applauded its members' determination to
continue its 48-hour strike.
	   The union called on the federal government to address a crisis
in the coal industry which it claims has cost 4,000 jobs in recent
years.
	   The union says Australian coal companies' willingness to accept
lower prices while opening new mines is behind the industry's
malaise.
	   It called a 48-hour strike on Sunday in protest at several
mining companies accepting U.S. dlrs 9 a (metric) ton for coal.
	   Workers were due to return to mines at 11 p.m. local time (1200
GMT).
	   The union risks massive fines and jail sentences for officials
for breaching the Workplace Relations Act and defying Australian
Industrial Relations Commission Gregory Harrison's order on Monday
for the miners to return to work.
	   Mining company Rio Tinto, which sought a separate return-to-work
order from the Supreme Court, was the only company whose mines
operated in New South Wales and Queensland states Tuesday.
	   Federal Court judge Michael Moore will on Thursday begin hearing
a case in which 20 coal companies claim the union breached
Harrison's orders.
	   Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith said through a
spokesman the union had no right to disobey Harrison's order.
	   ``The (union) should have observed the ruling of the independent
umpire, the (commission),'' he said.

Sri Lankans upset over Jayasinghe's exit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jayasinghe comment &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe's abrupt
withdrawal from the Asian Games has upset both officials and fans
from Sri Lanka, who were counting on her for medals, at least in
relay races.
	   ``No one in our camp is sure if she really sustained injuries,
or she was scared to run and not win in her personal events,'' said
a Sri Lankan sports official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   At her home in Colombo, Jayasinghe angrily denied public
speculation that fear of losing to the Chinese runners had made her
pull out of the 100-meter final Monday. She showed reporters a
report from the doctor on call at the Athletes Village in Bangkok,
advising her to rest her injury for a week.
	   ``How could I run, when I am injured?'' said Jayasinghe, 23, the
world 200-meter silver medalist.
	   After her 100-meter semifinal Sunday, she pleaded a headache and
a sore leg, possibly a pulled hamstring.
	   Her departure for home Monday was the latest chapter in a
troubled year in which she accused unnamed Sri Lankan officials of
sexual harassment and tested positive for a steroid. Her own
nation's track federation cleared her after she said she used the
drug to control her menstrual cycle, but she now is awaiting an
international arbitration hearing. Meanwhile, she remains eligible
to compete.
	   ``We don't know what really happened in Bangkok. We only this
much _ that if she was there and running, we could have won some
medals at the relays,'' said Sujatha de Silva, a Colombo resident
reached by the telephone from Bangkok.
	   After her semifinal Sunday, Jayasinghe said she had been down
with flu and could not practice.
	   ``She told us she is injured and we got her examined by
doctors,'' said Daya Gunasekhara, chief of the Sri Lankan team. ``I
am unable to comment on how serious were her injuries, but then if
an athlete does not want to run you cannot make him or her run.''
	   A leg injury was not apparent in her semifinal race.
	   Even without her, Sri Lanka won its first two Asian Games gold
medals in 24 years Monday with victories in the women's and men's
400-meter races by Damayanthi Darsha and Sugath Tillekeratne.
	   That had led to high hopes for the 4 x 400 women's relay.
	   Jayasinghe originally had been counting on these games to help
rise above the controversies swirling around her.
	   She had won silver at the 1997 World Track Championships in
Athens, finishing ahead of Jamaican runner Merlene Ottey, making
her war-scarred nation proud.
	   Her rewards included money and a three-bedroom flat in Colombo,
capital of the island nation off India's southern coast.
	   But the good times did not last long.
	   After her positive drug test, she told The Associated Press that
she feared her urine samples were tampered with. She said it was
part of an effort to defame her and end her career because she had
made public the sexual advances of Sri Lankan sports officials.

US envoy optimistic over Turkish route for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Richard Morningstar, a U.S. envoy for
Caspian energy development, sounded optimistic on Tuesday in
convincing oil companies to chose Turkey as the main export route
for Caspian oil.
	   ``I think that the AIOC position has modified because they
understand the political realities of Baku-Ceyhan,'' said
Morningstar in reference to the 11-company consortium. ``They are
fully prepared to reach a joint conclusion. That is a constructive
step.''
	   The Clinton administration has been actively lobbying for the
Turkish option which they see as a strategic goal of developing
east-west oil and gas transportation corridors in central Asia,
avoiding Russia and Iran.
	   The oil companies have been reluctant to support the Turkish
route because of the high cost and uncertainty over how much oil
the Caspian fields will produce.
	   The projected 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline runs from
Azeri capital Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port town of Ceyhan.
	   On Monday, Morningstar urged Turkish officials to urgently
address concerns of the consortium over the financing of the
pipeline.
	   ``As long as we can do that, I think the companies will be able
to come to a conclusion,'' Morningstar said.
	   There is a huge discrepancy between the cost forecasts of Turkey
and the consortium, which allegedly based its calculations on
higher construction costs.
	   Morningstar said other independent studies confirmed that the
cost of pipeline was closer to the Turkish estimate of dlrs 2.3
billion. The consortium estimates the cost at dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   ``Over the next few weeks, it is going to be important that the
companies, Turkey and Azerbaijan come together and really go over
those cost numbers so that everybody is sure that we're comparing
apples and apples,'' Morningstar said. ``I think the gap can be
narrowed.''
	   Turkey has offered incentives including tax exemptions to reduce
construction costs.
	   The main alternative to Baku-Ceyhan, reportedly favored by the
companies, is an existing pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black
Sea port of Supsa.
	   But that would involve large tanker traffic through the Turkish
straits which Turkey opposes for safety and environmental reasons.
	   Morningstar said the companies would make a final decision on
the pipeline within months.

China pledges fair trials for democracy advocates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China promised Tuesday that subversion trials for
two leading organizers of a budding opposition party would be fair
and free from government interference.
	   Chinese courts will hold trials in two different cities for Wang
Youcai and Qin Yongmin on Thursday, part of a swift, sustained
crackdown against the China Democracy Party.
	   ``These people's activities violated the criminal law of
China,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said.
	   Despite the condemnation, Sun added that China's courts operated
according to law and without government meddling.
	   ``They will investigate the cases independently and make their
independent judgments. The government cannot interfere,'' Sun said
at a news briefing. ``The trial process will be conducted according
to law and a fair judgment will be made, eventually.''
	   In just 16 days, authorities have arrested or questioned nearly
30 members and supporters of the China Democracy Party. Wang, Qin
and a third member arrested in the crackdown, Xu Wenli, are among
the most influential members of the dissident community. All tried
to set up party branches, challenging the Communist Party's
monopoly on political power.
	   Eleven China Democracy Party members and supporters urged the
government in two separate statements Tuesday to halt the trials,
hold talks and recognize the party's peaceful aims.
	   Nine supporters, including veteran dissident Ren Wanding, wrote
that suppressing dissent would not ensure social stability in the
long run.
	   High-profile trials in China almost always produce guilty
verdicts. Although China has moved tentatively to bring its legal
system closer to international norms, odds are overwhelmingly
against the accused in criminal cases.
	   Qin's family was only notified Monday that his trial for
inciting the subversion of state power _ one of the most serious
charges used against dissidents _ would be held in three days. One
lawyer who wanted to defend Wang has reportedly been detained
several times since the end of last week.
	   Authorities refused Tuesday to tell Xu Wenli's wife whether he
will be put on trial.
	   He Xintong said neither police nor prosecutors in Beijing
claimed to have jurisdiction over Xu's case. Prosecutors told her
they were not investigating Xu, contradicting information given to
her by police last week. Police insist the prosecutors have
jurisdiction.
	   ``Maybe the case is on the road on its way to the prosecutors,''
she quoted one officer as telling her.
	   ``They are making a joke over a matter that concerns one
person's fate,'' said He.
	   Xu, who lives in Beijing, and Qin, from the central city of
Wuhan, were active in the Democracy Wall movement of the late
1970s, and Wang, from Hangzhou in east China, was a leader in the
1989 student democracy demonstrations.

Russian Prime Minister sets dates for visit to India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will visit India
next week to further develop economic ties and possibly sign
military agreements, a news report said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had planned to visit India in November,
but canceled his trip after falling ill several times in recent
months.
	   Primakov will travel to India on Dec. 20-22, though details of
his itinerary were not released. He is expected to sign a number of
economic agreements, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We treat carefully the traditionally friendly relations with
India and are inclined to develop cooperation further with that
great Asian power,'' Yeltsin said Tuesday, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov and his Indian counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, may
sign an agreement on military and technical cooperation through
2010, Interfax said. The two countries have an agreement now that
expires in 2000.
	   India is a leading buyer of Russian arms, and is building two
nuclear reactors purchased from Russia in a dlrs 2.6 billion
contract. Both sides say the reactors are for energy purposes and
cannot be used for military means.

Capital's zoo gets Russian leopards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; dg5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) _ Zoo Boise has two new and rare Amur leopards
on display.
	   The big cats are named for the Amur River region of Russia near
the Chinese border, although Zoo Boise's are California natives.
Only 30 of the animals remain in the wild, and 260 in captivity.
	   ``Zoo Boise is fortunate to receive these beautiful animals,
since there are so few of them left in the world,'' said Steve
Burns, Friends of Zoo Boise director. The leopards are brother and
sister: a 6-year-old male and a 3-year old female.
	   The 100-plus-pound cats were born in a breeding facility and
came to Boise as part of a national conservation program run by the
American Zoologic and Aquarium Association.
	   Poachers kill them for their skins and their body parts, used
for medicine in Asia. Logging and mining are destroying their
habitat.
	   Burns said the Amurs pave the way for arrival next spring of two
Siberian tigers from the same region of Russia.

Asia says threatened World Cup boycott won't affect hosts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thai official acknowledging World Cup can't bore
spectators, Asian sides weak, graf 6-7; letter awaited, graf 8 &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian soccer officials on Tuesday put
on hold a threatened boycott of the 2002 World Cup and said that
even if it goes ahead, co-hosts Japan and South Korea will still be
allowed to play.
	   The Asian Football Confederation's executive committee, after an
emergency meeting, warned that the boycott would proceed unless
FIFA, the sport's world governing authority, expands the number of
slots allocated to Asia for the World Cup.
	   ``All of the members spoke up very much in favor of a boycott of
2002,'' AFC general secretary Peter Velappan told a news
conference. ``But we will honor the responsibility of hosting the
World Cup.''
	   The formula of a boycott exempting Japan and South Korea
balances the demands of Arab members to retaliate against FIFA
while taking into account the millions spent by the two East Asian
nations to jointly stage the cup finals.
	   Committee members said Asia was not ``treated fairly or taken
seriously'' by FIFA despite being home to 40 percent of the world's
population and comprising a large number of television viewers.
	   There was no immediate FIFA reaction. The Asian confederation
planned to inform the Switzerland-based authority of its decision
in an official letter.
	   The manager of Thailand's team, Thawatchai Sajakul, noted later,
however, that soccer is heavily commercialized and FIFA has a duty
not to bore spectators with weak teams competing in poor games.
	   ``We have to admit that in the recent World Cup, the performance
of the Asian soccer teams was very disappointing,'' Thawatchai
said.
	   Neither Iran, Saudi Arabia, Japan or South Korea made the second
round in France '98. Asia had three direct qualification places and
an extra chance Iran claimed by beating Oceania winner Australia.
	   The AFC wants its 3 1/2 chances back, but Velappan admitted they
would accept 2 1/2 because the co-host arrangement gave them two
automatic qualifiers. But they insist on having the half-spot.
	   The dispute underscores the changes in the tournament with the
first-ever dual-host attempt. The World Cup host nation has always
qualified automatically and is not normally seen as coming out of a
continent's quota.
	   ``Our decision is not irrational or unreasonable, our decision
is fair,'' Velappan said.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter contacted the Asian confederation
before the meeting and offered the body four places for the 2006
World Cup, without mentioning 2002.
	   ``Why should he dangle a carrot at us about 2006? We're trying
to focus on 2002,'' said Velappan, who is also FIFA's coordinator
for the 2002 cup.
	   The committee decided to send a six-member delegation to meet
FIFA President Sepp Blatter in February ahead of a high-level FIFA
meeting in March to persuade him to restore the lost spot.
	   If the FIFA meeting fails to change course and satisfy the
Asians, the AFC will call another meeting to implement the boycott,
which would pull 40 teams out of the World Cup qualifying rounds.
	   The AFC's move puts the ball in Blatter's end.
	   ``Blatter must do something one way or the other to find a way
of resolving the problem. Otherwise, he will push us to the wall,''
said Manical Fernando, an AFC vice president from Sri Lanka. ``But
they should know if they don't help us, we will boycott.''
	   Velappan said that Asian corporations hoping to sponsor the
event would not be asked to join the boycott, saying sports and
business don't mix.

Chinese keep top place in fencing medals with team foil win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China stayed at the top of the Asian
Games fencing medal charts Tuesday, defeating Japan and chief rival
South Korea in men's team foil.
	   Wang Haibin, Dong Zhaozhe, Lin Liang and Liu Yuntao completed
China's near-sweep of the foil events. The only gold that eluded
them was the women's team event Monday, which went to the Koreans.
	   The Chinese men beat Japan, 45 touches to 35, in Monday's final.
South Korea defeated Kuwait, 45-34, for the bronze.
	   The victory brought China's fencing medal tally to four golds,
two silvers and four bronzes, edging Korea's three golds, four
silvers and two bronzes.
	   Between them, China and Korea won all the individual event
medals.
	   Japan netted the men's team foil silver and women's team foil
bronze.

Too old to drive? Not in Germany _ yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Getting a German driver's license is an arduous,
expensive undertaking. But once the little pink card is yours, it's
yours for life.
	   Or maybe not.
	   Worried that an aging population could lead to more accidents on
the roads, Transport Minister Franz Muentefering is suggesting
setting an upper age limit for driving.
	   He wasn't specific about how old is too old, but the very idea
that seniors could lose their licenses set off a storm of protest
Tuesday in this car-crazed country.
	   ``Bonn wants to take driver's licenses away from old people''
the Berliner Morgenpost blared on its front page. ``Driving Ban for
Seniors'' cried the BZ tabloid.
	   Muentefering told the BZ he simply wanted to raise the issue for
discussion. ``People today are getting much older and driving cars
longer,'' he said.
	   Senior citizen groups and car clubs denounced the idea of a
standard age limit as ``absolute nonsense,'' pointing to statistics
that show young people fresh out of driving school are the most
dangerous.
	   ``My husband drove long distances until he was 75 and never had
a problem,'' Ruth Stephan, a 77-year-old widow, told the BZ.
	   ``A doctor should decide,'' said 75-year-old Richard Schaedel.
``Many people are finished at 50, others are still on top of it at
80.''
	   Germans must spend long hours in private driving schools,
costing a minimum of 1,500 marks (dlrs 900), before they can even
apply for the driver's license tests, which cost extra.
	   But once the license is granted, it never has to be renewed and
is only revoked if the driver gets in trouble, for example through
drunken driving.
	   Some politicians, legal and medical experts suggested it may be
time for Germany to require regular vision and fitness tests.
	   Trude Unruh, chairwoman of Germany's Gray Panthers, said that
might be acceptable. ``But then for everybody please, old or
young,'' she told the Morgenpost.
	   To be effective, though, the checkups would have to be
mandatory, said Hans-Juergen Gebhardt, chairman of an association
of traffic attorneys. ``I wouldn't count on people doing it
voluntarily,'' he said on German radio.

Asian stock markets mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Tuesday, with prices falling in Tokyo for a fourth consecutive
session but rebounding in Hong Kong.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 100.43
points, or 0.71 percent, to close the day at 14,011.19. On Monday,
the average closed down 294.02 points, or 2.04 percent.
	   Sunday's nationalization of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. caused
concern that other institutions might suffer the same fate, pushing
down share prices.
	   Concern over a report showing worsening business sentiment among
Japanese companies also pushed prices lower, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.58 yen in
late-afternoon trading, up 1.96 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York level of 115.49 yen overnight.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong rebounded after three straight
sessions of declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 127.63 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at
9,952.84. On Monday, the index had slumped 126.79 points.
	   Brokers attributed the rise to bargain-hunting following recent
sharp falls.
	   Trading was light because many investors were staying on the
sidelines to await the outcome of the impeachment vote against
President Bill Clinton in the U.S. House of Representatives on
Thursday.
	   Prices on the Seoul Stock Exchange also closed sharply higher,
with the key index surging 3.7 percent on continued massive inflow
of funds into the stock market amid falling local interest rates.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 20.56 points to
579.86.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher after five straight sessions
of declines. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 47.32
points, or 0.68 percent, to 6,936.82.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by a
rise in New Zealand brewing concern Lion Nathan Ltd. The benchmark
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 20.78 points, or 1.0 percent, to
1,940.33.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed lower, dragged down by
overnight declines on Wall Street. The 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index fell 4.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,796.73.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed mixed after a recovery in
resource stocks was countered by weaker finance-related blue chips.
The All Ordinaries Index rose 11.4 points, or 0.4 percent, to
2,87.9.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed. The benchmark
Composite Index rose 2.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 543.79.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower, pushed down by Wall
Street's overnight fall. The Straits Times Index closed 11.21
points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,368.29.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand Index rose 4.29 points, or 1.2 percent, to 349.18.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Composite Index fell 3.938 points, or 0.9 percent, to 400.765.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
arrived in Amman Tuesday to brief Jordanian leaders on President
Bill Clinton's Middle East trip.
	   Albright met with Crown Prince Hassan shortly after she arrived
at an Amman hilltop royal compound by helicopter from neighboring
Israel. Hassan is acting as regent while King Hussein is in the
United States receiving cancer treatment.
	   Albright was scheduled to return to Israel later in the day to
join Clinton's entourage on a flight back home.
	   Government officials said high on the agenda is a Jordanian
request for a dlrs 50 million increase in U.S. economic aid. U.S.
annual aid to Jordan is dlrs 225 million.
	   President Clinton is on a three-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian territories.
	   Following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday, Clinton
declared that the Middle East peace process is ``back on track.''
	   Clinton, however, appeared to have failed to persuade Israel to
carry out further West Bank troop withdrawals called for under
peace accords.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is an
ardent supporter of U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East.

Li Meisu wins title 16 years after previous success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details. EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's one-time Olympic bronze
medalist Li Meisu on Tuesday won her second Asian Games shot put
gold medal 16 years after her first and two years after doctors
warned her to quit.
	   While the Chinese distance runners seem to be missing their Ma,
the oldest member of the team stepped up to dedicate her comeback
gold to her son, completing a remarkable comeback after a six-year
retirement.
	   Li, 39, was the Asian Games champion in 1982 and in 1988 was the
bronze medal winner at the Seoul Olympics.
	   She retired soon after and had a child but returned at the
Atlanta Olympics in 1996, where she missed a medal. Her son Tian
Zizhong turned 6 Tuesday and Li said ``the gold medal is the best
present.''
	   Li was in front with a second throw of 18.77 but improved it to
18.96 with her final attempt. Compatriot Cheng Xiaoyan, who had
18.55 with her third attempt, finished with silver.
	   Li, who was told by doctors to quit after she suffered a
post-Atlanta lung infection, and who competes on two dodgy knees,
said she persists to show that athletes don't have to walk away too
early, even if they're reduced to limping as she is.
	   She said Tuesday's win was ``sweeter'' than her Olympic bronze.
``I'm old now and getting this gold wasn't easy,'' Li said.
	   With enigmatic Chinese coach Ma Junren and his army of runners
staying away, Japan has taken a stranglehold on the distance medals
so far and leads the track and field gold standings 9-8 over China
after 23 of 43 events.
	   After claiming the women's marathon and both 10,000-meter races,
Japan picked up the men's 3,000 steeplechase through Yasunori
Uchitomi, who made up for the disappointment of four years earlier
when he was third in his hometown Hiroshima.
	   The time was a pedestrian 8:41.00, but Uchitomi took over with
800 to run and did just as much as necessary to keep ahead of
silver medalist Hamid Sajdjadi-Hazaveh of Iran. Iran's Jafar
Rassoulov trailed a long way back in third.
	   ``I was very disappointed four years ago and this time I wanted
the gold,'' said Uchitomi. ``I was confident in the last 400 meters
because I have raced (Sajdjadi-Hazaveh) four times before and
beaten him.''
	   Pole vault favorite Igor Potapovich, fourth in the event at the
1996 Olympics, gave Kazakstan a gold medal with 5.55 meters. His
compatriot Alexandr Korcahgin, the Asian championship silver
medalist, entered the event at 5.30 and failed all three attempts.
	   Kim Chul-kyun of South Korea was second at 5.40 while Japan's
Fumiaki Kobayashi got bronze.
	   Games officials inexplicably put 11 finals on the program
Monday, including the glamor 100, 400 and 1,500 races. Tuesday's
session lacked luster in comparison, with three field finals, the
steeple and two 4x100-meter relays.
	   China's 100 champion Li Xuemei anchored a Chinese gold in the
women's relay while men's 100 winner Koji Ito led a Japanese win in
the men's.
	   Masaki Morinaga of Japan won the men's long jump with 8.10
meters, ahead of Liu Hongning of China with 8.05.
	   Former drug offender Kim Jin-il of South Korea made a strong
return to the Asian Games, qualifying comfortably in the men's
800-meter semifinals.
	   Kim set the Asian record at 1:44.14 in June 1994, a few months
before he won the Hiroshima Asian Games title, also in a record
time.
	   But Kim tested positive for banned drug Clenbuterol in 1995 and
was out of the sport for three years. He said it felt ``very good''
to be back in competition but he was only running at 50 percent.
Kim's compatriot Kim Soon-hyung was the fastest qualifier, winning
the second semifinal in 1:50.13.
	   China's Asian champion Cheng Bing just scraped in and tipped his
silver medalist from that race, Qatar's Abdul Abdulla, as the
favorite for gold.
	   ``It was OK, man. My target's the gold,'' Abdulla said after
posting a 1:50.13.
	   India's Jyotirmoy Sikdar, a surprise winner of the women's 1,500
Monday, was fourth fastest through to the women's 800 final.
Leading the field was Japan's Ryoko Takezawa in 2:04.35.

Japanese leader to discuss aid plan during ASEAN summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said
Tuesday that his country will try to flesh out concrete details of
the so-called ``New Miyazawa Plan'' during the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations summit in Hanoi.
	   ``Japan is in a tight fiscal situation, but we would like to
help each other in rebuilding Asia,'' Obuchi told a Dow Jones
Newswires reporter during his flight to Hanoi.
	   Obuchi said the aid plan, unveiled by Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa in October, calls for Japan to provide dlrs 15
billion for medium and long-term financial needs for economic
recovery in Asian countries, and another dlrs 15 billion for
possible short-term capital needs during the process of
implementing economic reform.
	   The prime minister also said Japan would try to set concrete
details for further yen-denominated loans to Asian nations.
	   Japanese media have reported that Tokyo plans to unveil
approximately 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in loans to Asia
during the summit, which began Tuesday and ends Wednesday. The
loans would be used to finance public works projects and
infrastructure development. Priority will be given to projects that
create business for Japanese companies.
	   The loans are part of 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.5 billion) that
Tokyo has earmarked to help regional countries as part of its
recently announced 24 trillion yen (dlrs 204 billion) economic
stimulus package.
	   In addition to ASEAN officials, Obuchi was scheduled to meet
with leaders from China, South Korea, and Cambodia during his
four-day trip. He also will hold talks with Vietnam's prime
minister, Phan Van Khai.
	   Obuchi will travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he
will visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

U.S. anthropologist fights ban on visiting Stone Age Indian tribe

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Napoleon Chagnon helped make the
Yanomami Indians one of the most famous tribes on earth with a
groundbreaking study that became a classic among anthropologists.
	   But Venezuelan officials don't want him anywhere near the
endangered Stone Age tribe. They claim his accounts of
wife-beating, club fights and deadly raids on enemy villages are
exaggerations, and that he is provoking conflicts among the tribe.
	   Venezuelan authorities have banned him from Yanomami territory
on-and-off since the mid-70s. In August, they rebuffed his latest
attempt to return after a five-year absence.
	   Chagnon is fighting back, though, and getting support from
prominent colleagues. The ban is ``outrageous,'' says Robin Fox, an
anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ``I consider
him one of the truly great anthropologists of our time.''
	   Chagnon says he is being punished because he has criticized a
powerful group of Catholic missionaries and angered left-wing
anthropologists by contradicting the myth of primitive people as
``noble savages.''
	   ``My views are absolutely politically incorrect,'' says Chagnon,
an anthropologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
	   Without a trace of modesty, he adds: ``I know more about the
Yanomamo and their numbers and their villages than anyone on
earth.''
	   His detractors scoff at that assertion.
	   ``There's not a single Yanomami specialist who agrees with
Chagnon's theories. He's completely wrong,'' says French
anthropologist Jacques Lizot, one of a handful of experts on the
tribe.
	   Until a decade or so ago, the Yanomami _ or Yanomamo, depending
on the transliteration _ were living in isolation in one of the
least explored areas of South America.
	   Today, some still go naked or wear loincloths, pierce their
noses or lower lips with sticks, and live in communal thatched huts
called ``shabonos.''
	   The tribe has about 23,000 members in Venezuela and neighboring
Brazil. Critics contend that contact with illegal gold miners and
Christian missionaries is threatening their traditions and their
survival.
	   Chagnon, now 60, moved into one village in Venezuela in 1964.
Four years later he published ``Yanomamo: The Fierce People.'' The
book sold 800,000 copies.
	   In it he writes that violence and warfare are common. His
studies showed that one in four Yanomami men were axed, clubbed or
shot to death with arrows. What's more, those who kill enemies get
more wives and have more children than those who don't kill.
	   ``The Yanomamo themselves call themselves fierce,'' he says.
	   Critics were aghast.
	   The Yanomami are ``a generally fun-loving and peaceful people,''
says a pamphlet published by London-based Survival International,
an Indian rights group. Chagnon ``has greatly exaggerated Yanomami
belligerence.''
	   Chagnon says he came up with the findings because he is the only
anthropologist who has ever lived in a Yanomami village at war and
collected statistics on violent deaths.
	   Later he accused the Salesian missionaries of distributing
shotguns to the Yanomamis and setting off a spate of killings. He
also says they caused deadly epidemics by introducing new diseases
and then failing to provide adequate medical care.
	   ``Chagnon has accused us of genocide,'' complains the Rev. Jose
Angel Divasson, the Salesian bishop of Amazonas state. He says the
missionaries quickly reversed the shotgun policy after killings
increased, and their health services have saved hundreds of lives.
	   Chagnon charges that as the dispute grew hotter the Salesians
spread a rumor that identification photos he had taken of the
Indians were causing their babies to die.
	   In 1991 he landed by helicopter at one village he had long been
friendly with, but the Yanomamis surrounded him with bows and
arrows and the chief raised an ax over Chagnon's head and
threatened to kill him.
	   Chagnon says he calmed them down and eventually convinced them
the rumor was a lie. The priests vehemently deny Chagnon's
accusation.
	   Gabriela Croes, head of Venezuela's national indigenous affairs
office, says such conflicts are one reason why officials are
barring Chagnon from Yanomami territory.
	   She adds that his blunt portrait of the tribe presents a false
image and that some Indians no longer want him to visit, partly
because he makes them violate a sacred taboo by repeating the names
of their dead ancestors so he can chart their genealogical lines.
	   Chagnon says the allegations are part of a smear campaign.
	   If he continues to be blocked from working with the Yanomami,
says Fox, it will be a ``tragedy for anthropology.''

Report: Russia late on contract to upgrade Indian fighter jets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian company is years behind schedule on a
contract to upgrade 125 MiG-21s of the Indian air force because of
financial and equipment problems, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The Moscow Times said the Sokol aircraft company would not
complete the contract before 2004, some three years behind the
deadline set in the 1996 deal.
	   Sokol is to upgrade the MiGs by fitting them with advanced
French, Israeli and Russian radar and other equipment, the report
said. But work has been hampered by Russia's economic crisis and
problems making French and Israeli equipment compatible with the
Soviet-designed fighters, it said.
	   India was a major buyer of Soviet weapons and continues to be a
major client for the Russian arms business.

 &UR; Holbrooke in Serbia amid new tensions in Kosovo
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke arriving in Kosovo, changes dateline

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia Tuesday to try and revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight.
	   The news came as U.S. envoy Holbrooke arrived in Kosovo, where
he was to meet with William Walker, head of the OSCE's
still-forming Kosovo Verification Mission and ethnic Albanian
leaders.
	   Later Tuesday, Holbrooke was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to ``emphasize the need to move ahead
expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO aistrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   Walker, who leads the team aimed at ensuring the peace agreement
is kept, condemned Monday's violence ``in the strongest terms.''

	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace accord, but he
declared the Mideast peace process ``back on track.''
	   Clinton held out hope the pullback would take place soon. ``We
will have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine,''
he said after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success.
	   ``I think we are back on track again and we're going to see this
thing through,'' he told reporters at this border checkpoint. ``I
have achieved what I came here to achieve.''
	   In remarks to reporters later, Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, qualified Clinton's remark about the
peace process being on track. ``It's a bumpy track,'' he said with
a smile.
	   Clinton said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would return
to the region soon for further talks.
	   In their three-way meeting, the leaders discussed the work of
committees set up under the October accords negotiated at Wye
River, Maryland, to work out sticky issues such as weapons
confiscation and the size of police forces, Clinton said.
	   ``We now have to decide practical means to go forward,'' he
said.
	   Arafat left without speaking to reporters, but an adviser,
Marwan Kanafani, accused Netanyahu of ``doing away with all the
hopes'' that Palestinians and Israelis had in Clinton's visit.
	   ``He is intentionally crushing all efforts that Clinton exerted
and is stopping the implementation of an agreement he personally
signed,'' said Kanafani.''
	   Netanyahu, the only leader to hold a formal news conference,
described the meeting as ``an open exchange.''
	   The Israeli leader repeated his insistence that he would only
withdraw troops in the West Bank if the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations under the Wye River deal. He said they would have
to confiscate illegal weapons, stop inciting to violence against
Israel, publicly drop plans to declare a state unilaterally in May
and agree to Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``When they do this, we will do what we are required to do,''
Netanyahu said, adding that the faster the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations, the faster Israel would withdraw troops. This
phase of the withdrawal is supposed to begin Friday.
	   Netanyahu was asked at his news conference whether his tough
stance wasn't sacrificing Israel's relationship with the United
States for his own political considerations, such as appeasing
hard-liners in his governing coalition. ``We are not engaged in a
confrontation with the United States and President Clinton,'' he
replied. ``There is no toughening of (our) positions in the last
few days.''
	   ``It would be unfortunate if get too far behind schedule,''
Clinton said. He stressed that Netanyahu had reaffirmed Israel's
obligation to complete the agreed troop withdrawals, even as he
refused to go ahead now.
	   It was the first time that Netanyahu and Arafat had met since
signing the Wye accords in Washington.
	   The way for the three-way meeting was cleared with the
Palestinian vote Monday _registered with a show of hands and
applause _ that removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964
from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   Speaking to hundreds of Palestinians on Monday, Clinton did not
discourage statehood hopes. In fact, he said he sought ``legitimate
rights for Palestinians'' along with ``real security for Israel.''
	   Netanyahu said revocation of anti-Israel language in the charter
would ``lead to a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long
peace.'' But at the same time, he said Arafat must renounce plans
to declare statehood and take steps to end the violence in the
region.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' Netanyahu declared in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep all the provisions, and
no amount of pressure is going to change this.''
	   Albright lodged a familiar plea for both leaders to stop making
statements that appeared to prejudge the outcome of negotiations on
an overall settlement. She also suggested Palestinian complaints
that Israel was releasing common criminals but not political
prisoners should be taken up directly with Israel.
	   ``It clearly is a very sensitive point for the Palestinians,''
she said. ``It can be resolved by having honest and frank
discussions.''
	   After the Tuesday meeting, Clinton flew by helicopter to
Bethlehem where he was greeted again by Arafat. The president
visited the Church of the Nativity in Manger Square with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.
	   The Clintons also were to tour Masada in Israel, where the
remnants of a Jewish rebel force in the first century took their
own lives rather than surrender to conquering Romans. Afterward
Clinton was flying back to Washington to resume his impeachment
fight.
	   Asked by a reporter whether he was able to separate his personal
problems from his official duties, Clinton replied, ``Absolutely
... you need to show up for work every day. It's not a complicated
thing.''

Bill opening up insurance sector blocked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Turmoil in parliament Tuesday over a
bill opening up the insurance business to foreigners underlined the
continuing divide over economic policy in once-socialist India.
	   Leftist legislators shouted ``take the bill back!'' as Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha rose to introduce a measure that helped
spark a nationwide strike last week by unions and leftists parties.
The bill also has been opposed by rightist nationalists who say
India doesn't need outsiders to boost its economy.
	   Sinha, of the Bharatiya Janata Party that leads the governing
coalition, was eventually able to introduce the bill, but it was
immediately sent to a parliamentary committee where its progress is
likely to be stalled for some time. The bill is unlikely to come up
for vote in this session of Parliament, which ends next week.
	   India's main opposition Congress party requested the referral to
committee. Congress says it broadly supports the bill, but has
questions about such issues as the level of foreign investment to
be allowed and the scope of powers of a proposed regulatory
authority.
	   Congress itself proposed opening the insurance business when it
was in power in the early 1990s and had begun selling off
state-owned companies and welcoming foreign investment. After
decades of socialist-style policy, the road to free-market
capitalism has been rocky.
	   BJP moderates overrode objections from the party's right wing to
propose allowing private insurance companies to be established with
up to 40 percent foreign investment. All India's insurance
companies are now owned by the government.
	   ``The government has succumbed to the pressure of
multinationals,'' Roop Chand Paul of the Communist Party of
India-Marxist said after the bill was introduced.
	   Reformers say the Indian economy will be strengthened by foreign
money, ideas and entrepreneurs. Leftists who staged last week's
nationwide protest against the BJP's economic policies argue
working people will be hurt because foreigners will destroy
indigenous businesses.

Cochetel in surprisingly good health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Vincent Cochetel, the French aid worker released
after more than ten months in captivity in southern Russia, is in
``surprisingly good'' health, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees said Tuesday.
	   Cochetel was released by Russian security forces in a shootout
with his kidnappers Saturday. He is now recovering in a Geneva
hospital.
	   ``Vincent's medical condition is surprisingly good despite the
fact that he lost 22 kilograms (48 pounds) and despite having been
ill-treated while in captivity,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   This was largely thanks to Cochetel's discipline in persevering
with daily mental and physical exercises for the 317 days in
captivity, she said.
	   Cochetel, 37, was head of the UNHCR office in the North Ossetia
region. He was kidnapped last January.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by gangs who are mostly
motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive.
	   His release came four days after the severed heads of four
western hostages were found. They had apparently been killed after
a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   Kumin said UNHCR's internet site had been swamped with messages
of congratulations from well-wishers following the release.

Gligorov, Prime Minister Ljubco Georgijevski and parliament speaker
Savo Klimovski. The two sides were also to sign a friendship and
cooperation agreement.
	   Five other inter-governmental agreements were due to be signed,
including documents on cultural and educational cooperation,

APEC to move fast on financial crisis, liberal trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations will act quickly over the
next 10 months to produce a credible response to the economic
crisis, while moving forward on trade liberalization, an official
said Tuesday.
	   With a shorter than usual time frame between annual Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summits, ``we are getting moving quickly on
dealing with the social impacts of the crisis,'' said Timothy
Hannah of New Zealand, executive director of the APEC Secretariat.
	   Building employment and taking care of the poor are very
important, Hannah said in a briefing for diplomats and journalists
about the work APEC will do before next September's leaders'
meeting in Auckland, New Zealand.
	   For example, he said, Chile and Mexico have already initiated a
program to help APEC member nations reform pension funds.
	   Hannah said that the attitude of leaders at the APEC meeting in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in November ``proves that obvious
protectionism has not taken hold, as might be expected when times
are bad.''
	   The APEC response to the crisis is ``to focus on capacity
building to support structural changes needed to strengthen markets
and proceed to recovery.''
	   He said there are no targets for reducing unemployment rates or
raising certain numbers of people from poverty, but APEC countries
would share ideas, work to reduce restrictions on trade, and ease
the environment for cross-border business.
	   New Zealand, which chairs the group until next September, will
push for progress on mutual recognition of food standards and
safety standards for toys within APEC, he said.
	   Also, priority will be given to small and medium businesses,
which are seen as the major driving force in many of the
Asia-Pacific economies. They can be helped especially by developing
stable and efficient capital markets, he said.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, Vietnam and the United States.

Opposition figure also rejects Kosovo settlement formula

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Any formula to solve the Kosovo crisis
by changing the borders of Serbia or elevating the province to
republic status within Yugoslavia would be unacceptable, a Serbian
opposition figure was quoted Tuesday.
	   In an interview with the Vienna newspaper Die Presse, Vuk
Draskovic noted that the West has long supported the principle that
borders of Croatia, Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia
should not be altered by force.
	   ``The West must respect its own principles,'' Draskovic said.
Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewel Movement, claimed that
principle ruled out options such as elevating Kosovo to the status
of a full republic along with Serbia and Montenegro, which form
that is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels have been fighting for independence for
Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
	   Draskovic is a longtime opponent of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. On the issue of Kosovo, however, Draskovic's position
appears little different from that of the Milosevic government.
	   That raises doubts about whether any change in the leadership of
Yugoslavia would necessarily encourage compromise on the Kosovo
issue.
	   Echoing positions taken by both the Serbian government and
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Draskovic said the latest American plan
for resolving the crisis is ``absolutely unacceptable.''
	   ``No one can change the fact that Kosovo is part of Serbia,''
Draskovic said. ``Would anyone in the United States accept giving
Florida to Cuba or California to Mexico?''
	   Draskovic added that ``it is very clear'' that ``on the
territory of Serbia there is no place for another republic.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia Tuesday to try and revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight.
	   The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived in Kosovo, where he was
to meet with William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming
Kosovo Verification Mission and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Later Tuesday, Holbrooke was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to ``emphasize the need to move ahead
expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 30 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
sent a team to the site, confirmed 31 people had been killed,
including one woman. Nine others were taken prisoner, two of whom
were wounded, officials said.
	   Walker, who leads the team aimed at ensuring the peace agreement
is kept, condemned Monday's violence ``in the strongest terms.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China continued to flaunt its all-round
shooting power as it surged into the semifinals of the men's
basketball competition with a 106-55 defeat of Kazakstan at the
Asian Games on Tuesday.
	   The defending champion, aiming to match the Philippines' record
of four straight Games titles, had six players in double figures
including leader Sun Jun.
	   Sun shot 5-for-5 at 2-point range and hit both 3-point attempts
for 16 points in the Group A match.
	   The win gave China a 2-0 record in its quarterfinal pool,
ensuring a passage to the semis. Also advancing was 1994 silver
medalist South Korea, which won its Pool B game 106-51 against
United Arab Emirates.
	   South Korea also had a balanced offensive performance. It shot
60 percent from the field and out-rebounded the UAE 27-15 for a 2-0
record win in Group B.
	   Kang Dong-hee scored 19 points, including three 3-point shots,
for the Koreans.

Cruise ship runs aground off St. Maarten, passengers got to land

<TEXT>
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ A 74,000-ton cruise ship crashed
into a reef of the Caribbean island of St. Martin on Tuesday.
Fishermen and yachters helped ferry hundreds of passengers to
safety.
	   ``It was quite a drama this morning, but no one was hurt and
eveyone is safe,'' said hotel auditor Nicolaas Martina, who watched
the rescue from the Holland House Beach Hotel overlooking Great Bay
on the Dutch side of the island. The other side is shared with
France.
	   The Monarch of the Sea, owned by Royal Caribbean International,
ran aground near the harbor peer before dawn, he said.
	   Martina did not know how many passengers were on the cruise
liner, but it is high season in the Caribbean and the 6-year-old
ship can hold 2,354 passengers, according to company's Internet Web
site. Telephones at the company's office in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
rang unanswered before business hours.
	   It also was too early to reach government officials in St.
Maarten.
	   Martina said government officials found hotels for the stranded
tourists and were trying to book flights for them to leave the
island, which is east of Puerto Rico. The Monarch picks up
passengers in San Juan and cruises the southern Caribbean.

Thick fog forces down helicopter carrying heir to Dutch throne

<TEXT>
	   NEELTJE JANS, Netherlands (AP) _ Thick fog shrouding the Dutch
North Sea coast forced a helicopter carrying Dutch Crown Prince
Willem-Alexander to make an unscheduled landing, a Royal House
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   The helicopter with the heir to the Dutch throne on board had
been airborne for only 15 minutes when its pilot aborted the flight
because of poor visibility and landed near a dike in the southern
province of Zeeland on Saturday afternoon.
	   Royal House spokeswoman Charlotte Kappelle refused to call the
unscheduled stop an emergency landing, but added that, ``the
helicopter couldn't fly through that mist.''
	   The prince, who was returning home to The Hague from an official
visit to the southern Dutch town of Vlissingen, waited for half an
hour in the helicopter before continuing his journey in a car.

Philippine shares end lower, peso weakens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: C and P Homes takes an ampersand.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended lower
Tuesday, hurt by Wall Street's decline the previous day and a
report about debt payment problems at blue-chip real estate firm, C
and P Homes, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 4.07 points,
or 0.2 lower, lower at 1,796.73, but not before losing as much as
17 points at mid-session.
	   Tuesday's decline followed its 34.81-point, or 1.9 percent, loss
to 1,800.80 in the previous session.
	   Traders said the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 126.16-point, or
1.4 percent, decline to 8695.60 on Monday gave investors an excuse
to sell the market.
	   A newspaper report which cited the serious financial condition
of low-cost housing developer C and P Homes also contributed to the
lackluster performance of Manila shares, they added.
	   C and P Homes reportedly is trying to forge a deal with
creditors to allow it to cover some of its short-term debts using
its properties and other assets.
	   The company has yet to comment on the report.
	   Meanwhile, the Philippine peso closed slightly lower against the
U.S. dollar.
	   Dealers said the peso's failure to breach the key level of 38.90
to the dollar on the back of a stronger Japanese yen gave the U.S.
currency short-term support.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 38.983 pesos on the Philippine
Dealing System, up from Monday's reference rate of 38.956. The
dollar closed at 39.010.

Turkey's Ecevit seeks rival leftist party's support to form
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ While Turkey's premier-designate prepared
to seek a rival, center-left party's support for his proposed
minority government, the party appeared ready Tuesday to push for a
coalition.
	   Bulent Ecevit wants to form a minority government under his
Democratic Left Party.
	   He already has the backing of two center-right parties, but also
needs the support of his longtime rival, Deniz Baykal, who leads
the social democrat Republican Peoples' Party, to be able to
command a majority of votes in parliament.
	   Newspapers reported Tuesday that Baykal would instead propose a
coalition between the two center-left parties that would be
supported in Parliament with the votes of pro-secular center-right
parties.
	   Baykal addressed his party's parliamentary group meeting shortly
before his meeting with Ecevit and indicated that the reports were
accurate.
	   ``We will keep our minds open. We hope to see the same
understanding from Ecevit,'' Baykal said. ``This would be a brand
new opportunity for the country.''
	   However, Baykal also signaled that he would not support a
minority government under Ecevit's premiership if the
premier-designate refused his offer of a coalition partnership.
	   He said he would instead, insist on a low-profile government led
by an ordinary member of parliament instead of a party leader.
	   ``We believe that a government under the leadership of a
lawmaker who would prepare a cabinet list in consultation with the
president, would be more suitable,'' Baykal said.
	   The social democrat movement, which in the 1970's always emerged
as the second largest group in elections got fragmented in the
1980s. Efforts to reunite the movement have failed because of
personal animosity between Ecevit and Baykal.
	   The Islamic movement has highly benefited from the division.
With the votes of the leftist movement divided the parties have
lost their historically dominant positions, helping the Islamic
party to emerge as largest group in parliament.
	   Newspapers on Tuesday called on the two leaders to capture the
historic occasion to reunite the two parties.
	   Ecevit was asked to form the government after the previous
coalition government, led by outgoing premier Mesut Yilmaz,
collapsed last month following corruption and mafia scandals.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwan broke South Korea's gold medal
monopoly in Asian Games soft tennis Tuesday as Kuo Hsu-tung and
Fang Tung-hsien beat compatriots Liau Nan-kai and Yeh I-ming for
the men's doubles title.
	   Earlier Tuesday, South Korea had added the women's doubles gold
to its collection from the men's and women's team events in the
sport, an Asian variant of tennis that uses soft rubber balls,
smaller rackets and a different scoring system.
	   In the men's doubles final, Kuo and Fang won 3-5, 4-0, 5-3, 3-5,
4-0, 5-3, 4-0.
	   South Koreans Jun In-soo and You Young-dong won the bronze.
	   In the women's doubles, Kang Ji-Sook and Lee Mi-Young defeated
Taiwan's Lin Li-jung and Cheng Shu-chen 5-3, 4-1, 4-2, 2-4, 4-2,
4-2.
	   It was the second gold for Kang and Lee in the games. They were
also part of the champion team.
	   In doubles, they lost once in qualifying play but beat
previously unbeaten Chang Shu-chuan and Hsu I-chia of Taiwan in the
opening round of the final competition. Kang and Lee went on to
beat Japan's Naoko Higashi and Yuko Miyaji in the semifinals.
	   Higashi and Miyaji won the bronze over China's Liu Ya and Bai
Xia 4-0, 4-2, 4-2, 2-4, 4-1, 2-4, 4-2.

Cruise ship runs aground off St. Maarten, passengers get to land

<TEXT>
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ A 74,000-ton cruise ship crashed
into a reef off the Caribbean island of St. Maartin on Tuesday.
Fishermen and boat owners helped ferry hundreds of passengers to
safety.
	   ``It was quite a drama this morning, but no one was hurt and
everyone is safe,'' said hotel auditor Nicolaas Martina, who
watched the rescue from the Holland House Beach Hotel overlooking
Great Bay on the Dutch side of the island. The other side is the
French territory of St. Martin.
	   The Monarch of the Sea, owned by Royal Caribbean International,
ran aground near the harbor pier before dawn, he said.
	   Martina did not know how many passengers were on the cruise
liner, but it is high season in the Caribbean and the 6-year-old
ship can hold 2,354 passengers, according to the company's Internet
Web site. Telephones at the company's office in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, rang unanswered before business hours.
	   Government officials in St. Maarten also could not be reached.
	   Martina said government officials found hotels for the stranded
tourists and were trying to book flights for them to leave the
island, which is east of Puerto Rico. The Monarch picks up
passengers in San Juan and cruises the southern Caribbean.

Jospin takes offensive, calls for increase in jobless allowance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin went on the
offensive Tuesday, calling for an increase in social allowances to
end jobless protests and accusing President Jacques Chirac of
borrowing his ideas.
	   The Socialist prime minister in recent weeks has wrestled with
labor unrest, jobless demonstrations and discord within his
government, just as the conservative Chirac has seen his popularity
ratings soar.
	   In a radio and television interview, Jospin said his government
has decided to raise two welfare allowances by 3 percent Jan. 1 to
ease the plight of France's unemployed. The increases will be
retroactive to Jan. 1, 1998.
	   Jospin was responding to recent protests across the country by
thousands of jobless demanding a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end
bonus.
	   Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7
percent, reflecting a slight improvement in the country's high
jobless rate.
	   Jospin said that Chirac, who has raised his profile in recent
weeks, has ``borrowed a lot'' from his government, particularly
regarding reform of the justice system, term limits and equal
representation of women in politics.
	   Jospin also said that although his government is still targeting
a 2.7 percent growth rate for France's gross domestic product in
1999, this goal will be hard to reach because of uncertainties on
the world global market.
	   In 1998, he said, France will post 3 percent growth, ``maybe
even 3.1 percent.''
	   Recent opinion polls have shown Chirac gaining in popularity and
even beating Jospin in a presidential election with 53 percent of
the vote.
	   Chirac, the leader of the moderate-right Rally for the Republic
party, was forced to share power with Jospin, a Socialist, when he
lost his majority in legislative elections in 1997.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The western peace coordinator for Bosnia
appealed Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption
to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself off massive
foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   The West also wants to see Bosnia strengthen institutions like
its courts into truly functioning, multiethnic bodies so people in
the war-scarred country that saw the worst fighting in Europe since
World War II feel they have rights that are protected.
	   However, the biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even
though production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council.
	   ``We have to change all that if the economy is ever to act as
the dynamo for growth able to create the jobs that are so
desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in western aid
Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. ``So we must, in 1999, forge
ahead with a radical program that installs the legal and regulatory
structure essential to a market economy,'' he said.
	   ``We must step up the fight against corruption, fraud and fiscal
evasion,'' he said.
	   The Council, established to make the Dayton peace accord work,
includes representation from some 40 countries.
	   The council will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps
aimed at furthering postwar reconstruction in Bosnia.
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   NATO Secretary-general Javier Solana and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott are among those attending the two-day
Madrid conference.
	   The 1995 accords promised a safe return home and compensation
for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled
Bosnia or were internally displaced during the 1992-95 ethnic-based
war involving Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The council is also expected to discuss the town of Brcko _ a
key strategic location claimed by both the Muslim-Croat Federation
and the Serb Republic and the last territorial issue still
outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.

Largest newspaper group charges government intimidation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's largest newspaper group
accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government Tuesday of
intimidation, harassment and heavy handed tactics, all aimed at
muzzling a press that has been critical of his administration.
	   The Jang group of newspapers, the country's largest with a
combined circulation of 1.7 million, has published stories of
corruption allegations against Sharif, as well as editorials
critical of attempts by Sharif to impose Islamic law in Pakistan.
	   ``This government cannot countenance any criticism,'' said
Maleeha Lodhi, senior editor of the independent English-language
daily newspaper, The News, which is owned by the Jang group.
	   The newspaper group _ the most powerful in Pakistan _ owns the
largest circulation Urdu-language newspaper, The Jang, as well as
several evening newspapers.
	   ``Nawaz Sharif believes in democracy without dissent, it is
indicative of the authoritarian democracy'' espoused by the prime
minister, said Lodhi. ``For us it is clearly a situation of attacks
on freedom of the press.''
	   On Monday officials of the government's domestic investigation
agency raided the Jang newspaper in neighboring Rawalpindi
generating widespread criticism.
	   Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto condemned the raid calling
it a ``desperate bid by a fascist regime which was tottering on the
brink of collapse.''
	   Newspaper reporters blocked traffic for 30 minutes to protest
the raid after government officials came into the office demanding
to see the stockpiles of newsprint.
	   In Pakistan the government controls the amount of newsprint
given to newspapers and successive regimes, including Ms. Bhutto's,
have threatened to withhold newsprint stocks if a newspaper
appeared to be too independent.
	   In Pakistan the electronic media is under government control,
something Ms. Lodhi said Sharif would like to impose on the print
media.
	   But Sharif's government denied both the raid and accusations of
harassment.
	   ``Let it be clear that there was no raid and no harassment of
workers'' said a government statement carried in The News.
	   The News, however, is not the first to complain of government
intimidation in recent months.
	   Pakistan's respected monthly magazine, Newsline, accused the
government of conducting a campaign of terror and intimidation
against its staff.
	   According to Rehana Hakim, the editor of Newsline magazine, the
campaign is the result of several articles alleging corrupt
practices by Sharif, his family and his accountability chief
Saif-ur Rehman.
	   It published a story that Rehman, a wealthy man, does not pay
any income tax. Rehman is the man behind government-sponsored
investigations into Ms. Bhutto and her jailed husband Asif Ali
Zardari.

Angolan government berates United Nations for renewed civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A senior government official has condemned
the United Nations for failing to hold the rebel group UNITA to a
U.N.-brokered 1994 peace deal that has now apparently collapsed
amid renewed fighting.
	   Faustino Muteka, the Minister for Territorial Administration,
said late Monday that the U.N. observer mission in Angola, UNOMA,
had not acted on reports that UNITA was rearming in preparation for
the Dec. 4 resurgence of its conflict with the government.
	   ``UNOMA is not doing anything here,'' Muteka told reporters.
	   The minister said he had sent ``thousands of notes of protest''
to inform the mission that UNITA was not demobilizing its rebel
army as it had agreed to do in the 1994 deal.
	   ``The (UNITA) men being demobilized were not soldiers, the
weapons handed over were obsolete, and UNITA was still training
troops and receiving new weaponry,'' Muteka said.
	   U.N. officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The mission currently has fewer than 1,000 staff charged with
overseeing the remaining military provisions of the 1994 peace
agreement, as well as issues of policing, human rights,
humanitarian aid, public information and institutional development.
	   After the peace deal was signed, the United Nations deployed a
7,000-strong verification force in this vast southwest African
nation to monitor demobilization and disarmament.
	   But full implementation of the accord has been stymied by
lingering hostility between the foes who fought a two-decade civil
war after the country's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ refused to hand over its central
highland strongholds to the government.
	   The army tried to take the towns by force earlier this month,
but met stronger resistance than expected from UNITA which has used
its revenue from illegal diamond mining to buy sophisticated new
weaponry, according to analysts.
	   The fighting has since spread through the central highlands.

Pinochet lawyers ask Britain's highest court to set aside judgment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of hearing, details of judge's Amnesty
International links; trims pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Declaring that public confidence in the courts is
at stake, lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet argued Tuesday that a
judge's close links with Amnesty International risked bias.
	   ``We submit that confidence in the judiciary must be earned and
not assumed,'' said Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for Pinochet, who is
asking Britain's highest court to set aside its own ruling that
denied the former Chilean dictator immunity from arrest as a former
head of state.
	   The return of Pinochet's British lawyers to the House of Lords
marks the next step in a long legal battle by the 83-year-old
general to avoid extradition to Spain on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Ms. Montgomery said Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, who voted
against immunity for Pinochet in the Lords' 3-2 decision on Nov.
25, had a longstanding, intense relationship with Amnesty
International, a human rights group that played a key role in the
campaign to have Pinochet arrested.
	   The relationship ``gave rise at the very least to a real danger
of bias,'' Ms. Montgomery told a tribunal of five new judges.
	   Amnesty has said Hoffmann _ the unpaid director of its
fundraising arm _ played no part in its Pinochet campaign, and
noted that the general's lawyers could have found out about the
link before the first hearing.
	   The judge himself, a native-born South African and opponent of
apartheid, has not commented publicly.
	   Ms. Montgomery said Hoffmann appeared as a lawyer on Amnesty's
behalf when the human rights group was seeking charitable status in
1982. After that application was refused on the grounds the group
is a political body, it set up Amnesty International Charity Ltd,
which raises funds.
	   Hoffmann has been a director of the charity since 1990, and is
now its chairman. His wife, Gillian, has been a secretary at
Amnesty's London press office since 1977.
	   Ms. Montgomery said both Hoffmanns' activities reveal ``a
longstanding, deep-rooted family connection which continues with
Amnesty to this present day.''
	   The fact that Hoffmann receives no pay is either irrelevant or
reveals a degree of commitment, she said.
	   The Lords hearing, scheduled to last two days, apparently marks
the first time since 1823 that the court has been asked to sit in
judgment of itself. The previous challenge, involving a land
ownership case, failed, according to one news report.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while recuperating
from back surgery. He is now under police guard at a rented mansion
at Wentworth, an exclusive residential estate 20 miles (30 kms)
west of London.
	   As well as the attempt in the Lords, Pinochet's lawyers also
plan to challenge a British Cabinet member's decision to allow
Spain to try to extradite him.
	   The London firm of attorneys Kingsley Napley said Monday it
would ask England's High Court to challenge Home Secretary Jack
Straw's approval of the Spanish extradition request.
	   Such applications normally contend a decision was wrong in law
or that Straw did not properly exercise discretionary powers.
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people, including
Spaniards, were murdered or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's
secret police after he overthrew an elected Marxist in a violent
coup. C
	   hile wants Pinochet freed, partly because he is a
senator-for-life in the new democratic government built on
compromise.

Jospin wants 50 percent of Euro Parliament candidates to be women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Tuesday
suggested that political parties reserve half of each ticket for
women in next year's European parliamentary elections.
	   ``Every party must make an effort,'' Jospin said in a television
interview.
	   He spoke as the National Assembly prepared to open discussion on
a proposed Constitutional revision that would affirm the principle
of equal access of men and women to public or elected posts.
	   In the June elections for European Parliament, ``each (party)
can put 50 percent of women on its list,'' Jospin said, adding that
the format using lists of candidates makes such a quota feasible.
	   ``Every party must make an effort,'' Jospin added.
	   The project to revise the French Constitution will need to be
voted on in both the National Assembly, or the lower house, and the
Senate.
	   While French women make up 51 percent of the population, they
hold only 11 percent of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, the
lower house. Women hold 6 percent of Senate seats.
	   On the local level, less than 8 percent of city halls are run by
women.
	   Jospin is not the first to say the disparity needs to be
corrected. His predecessor, conservative Alain Juppe, also called
the situation unacceptable. However, his efforts failed to bring
change.

India clinches kabaddi gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Defending champion India beat Sri Lanka
76-13 and Japan 59-25 Tuesday, assuring itself of another Asian
Games gold medal in the South Asian sport of kabaddi.
	   The Indians finished their games with a 6-0 record. The
tournament's other six teams wind up round-robin play Wednesday,
but India's closest rivals _ Pakistan and Sri Lanka _ have only
three victories each. Bangladesh and Japan each have two, and
Thailand and Nepal are winless.
	   In other games Tuesday, Pakistan beat Thailand 55-11 and Sri
Lanka 57-15, and Bangladesh defeated Thailand 84-13.
	   In kabaddi, teams of 10 players each send raiders into each
other's territory. Raiders score points for each opponent tagged,
but must keep chanting ``kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi ...'' in one
breath. If the raider is held down long enough that he can't return
to his own territory in that one breath, the raider is out.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The western peace coordinator for Bosnia
appealed Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption
to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself off massive
foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   The West also wants to see Bosnia strengthen institutions like
its courts into truly functioning, multiethnic bodies so people in
the war-scarred country that saw the worst fighting in Europe since
World War II feel they have rights that are protected.
	   However, the biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even
though production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council.
	   ``We have to change all that if the economy is ever to act as
the dynamo for growth able to create the jobs that are so
desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in western aid
Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. ``So we must, in 1999, forge
ahead with a radical program that installs the legal and regulatory
structure essential to a market economy,'' he said.
	   ``We must step up the fight against corruption, fraud and fiscal
evasion,'' he said.
	   The Council, established to make the Dayton peace accord work,
includes representatives from some 40 countries.
	   The council will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps
aimed at furthering postwar reconstruction in Bosnia.
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   NATO Secretary-general Javier Solana and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott are among those attending the two-day
Madrid conference.
	   The 1995 accords promised a safe return home and compensation
for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled
Bosnia or were internally displaced during the 1992-95 ethnic-based
war involving Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The council is also expected to discuss the town of Brcko _ a
key strategic location claimed by both the Muslim-Croat Federation
and the Serb Republic and the last territorial issue still
outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.

Flooding destroys tens of thousands of schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Tens of thousands of schools were destroyed by the
unusually severe flooding in Asia and Latin America this year,
disrupting education for millions of children, the U.N. Children's
Fund said Tuesday.
	   The disastrous flooding of the Yangtze River basin in China
badly damaged or wrecked nearly 49,000 schools and affected nine
million children, UNICEF said. The estimated value of the
destruction was dlrs 1.2 billion, it said.
	   Some 14,000 schools were destroyed in Bangladesh by the long
monsoon season which left millions without food or shelter.
	   With only 14 percent of girls enrolled in secondary schools, the
devastation ``multiplies the effects of any already desperate
situation,'' the agency said in a statement.
	   UNICEF said it had no figures on the impact of Hurricane Mitch,
which devastated much of Honduras and Nicaragua in November. But it
urged the rebuilding of schools to be high on the list of
priorities.
	   Hurricane Georges, which swept through the Caribbean in
September, destroyed 1,400 schools in the Dominican Republic at a
rebuilding cost of dlrs 20 million, it said.
	   ``1998 will go down in history as a year when acts of nature
closed school doors to millions of children,'' UNICEF chief Carol
Bellamy said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Tuesday, with prices falling in Tokyo for a fourth consecutive
session but rebounding in Hong Kong. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average lost 100.43 points, or 0.71 percent, to close
the day at 14,011.19. On Monday, the average closed down 294.02
points, or 2.04 percent. Sunday's nationalization of Nippon Credit
Bank Ltd. caused concern that other institutions might suffer the
same fate, pushing down share prices. Concern over a report showing
worsening business sentiment among Japanese companies also pushed
prices lower, traders said. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Despite claims of unity, Southeast Asian
leaders showed signs of division Tuesday, with some complaining
they are being hurt by globalization and others urging faster
economic liberalization. The conflicting stances provided evidence
of the difficulties that foreign and economic ministers had at
pre-summit meetings in trying to forge consensus on action to
restore confidence in a region suffering its worst economic crisis
in a half-century. Although they put together a list of ``bold
measures'' that the leaders are expected to endorse at the two-day
Association of Southeast Nations summit, leaked reports on the
plans have failed to generate enthusiasm in world
markets.(ASEAN-SUMMIT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister signaled his support
Tuesday for a new Asian-based program to provide emergency funding
to countries in the region which would help fend off speculative
attacks on their currencies. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa also
said that while the Japanese economy is in ``shambles'' and will
take at least two years to fully recover, there have been some
signs of improvement. Speaking to a gathering of foreign reporters,
the finance chief and senior statesman of Japan's ruling party said
rapid changes in exchange rates and sudden surges in monetary flows
have destabilized emerging economies. (JAPAN-FINANCE CHIEF)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. launched
a fresh assault on Microsoft Corp. by promoting a new simplified
business computer that doesn't require full operating systems such
as those sold by Microsoft Corp. Some analysts were skeptical the
latest attack on Bill Gates' empire will make a big dent, noting
that a similar earlier effort by the two companies
flopped.(US-ORACLE-SUN)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sun
Microsystems Inc. of the United States are teaming up to develop
and sell digital home electronic appliances, a newspaper reported
Tuesday. Matsushita will develop and sell products that can be
easily linked to computer networks through software developed by
Sun, the Nihon Keizai, Japan's top business daily, said. Masashi
Sakamoto, a Matsushita spokesman, refused to comment on the report,
saying that executives from the two companies would hold a news
conference in Tokyo on a joint project later Tuesday.
(JAPAN-MATSUSHITA-SUN)
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ In an attempt to combat online piracy, top
officials at five large recording companies will launch an
initiative that seeks to create a secure method for Internet music
distribution. Chief executives from BMG Entertainment, EMI Recorded
Music, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner
Music Group will participate in the plan, expected to be announced
Tuesday afternoon in New York. The Secure Digital Music Initiative
would marry music with high-tech by creating a rival to MP3, the
high-quality format currently used to compress, store and
distribute audio files. (US-RECORDING REVOLUTION)

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip _ U.S. President Bill Clinton failed
Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace accord, but he
declared the Mideast peace process ``back on track.'' Clinton held
out hope the pullback would take place soon. ``We will have fits
and starts but we will get through this just fine,'' he said after
a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Clinton called his three-day
Mideast trip a success. In remarks to reporters later, Sandy
Berger, the president's national security adviser, qualified
Clinton's remark about the peace process being on track. ``It's a
bumpy track,'' he said. (CLINTON-MIDEAST)
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
on Tuesday said they had dealt a major blow to government efforts
to recapture southeastern Congo when they killed two senior
Zimbabwean commanders and captured a gunnery sergeant. State-run
Radio Rwanda said Zimbabwe, the main ally of Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, lost operations commander Col. Kufa and squadron
commander Lt. Col. Herbert Funi Fudler when Congolese government
forces and their allies on Monday tried to retake the rebel-held
Congo River port of Kabalo. (CONGO-RWANDA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A pro-impeachment trend has Clinton
administration aides in a grim but fighting mood, while the outcome
of the House's first presidential impeachment vote in 130 years
remains in doubt. Republican Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey,
Jim Walsh of New York, and Fred Upton of Michigan, all of whom had
been on Democratic-compiled lists of potential impeachment
opponents, said Monday they would instead vote for impeachment. But
President Bill Clinton could take some comfort from Rep. Virgil
Goode Jr., a Virginia Democrat who was widely assumed to be
pro-impeachment but declined in an interview to say how he would
vote. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia on Tuesday to try and revive the
stalled Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in
months in the province claimed at least 37 lives. According to Serb
sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded in a ``terrorist
attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec late Monday died
overnight. The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived in Kosovo, where
he was to meet with William Walker, head of the OSCE's
still-forming Kosovo Verification Mission and ethnic Albanian
leaders. Holbrooke also was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to urge him to move forward on the Kosovo
peace plan.
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ A 74,000-ton cruise ship crashed
into a reef off the Caribbean island of St. Maartin on Tuesday.
Fishermen and boat owners helped ferry hundreds of passengers to
safety. Hotel official Nicolaas Martina, who watched the rescue
from the Holland House Beach Hotel overlooking Great Bay on the
Dutch side of the island, said no one was hurt. The Monarch of the
Sea, owned by Royal Caribbean International, ran aground near the
harbor pier before dawn, he said. It was not immediately known how
many people were aboard, but the ship can hold 2,354
passengers.(ST. MAARTEN-CRUISE SHIP-AGROUND)

Matsushita to use Sun's Java technology for consumer devices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with announcement from Matsushita and Sun

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan said
Tuesday it will team up with Sun Microsystems Inc. to use the
American firm's JAVA technology in a wide range of consumer
electronics products.
	   JAVA, developed by Sun, is a computer programming language used
widely for Internet applications. It was designed as a versatile
language that software developers can use to write applications for
any computer, not just the Windows system found on most PCs.
	   ``Adaptation of JAVA technology will help Matsushita to develop
and deliver a new breed of consumer appliances that allow consumers
to exploit the benefits of the network,'' Kazuhiro Sugiyama,
executive vice president of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,
said at a new conference.
	   Many Japanese electronics companies are developing products that
incorporate computer features, such as televisions and stereos that
can exchange information with eachother.
	   Matsushita did not announce any specific products that will use
the technology.
	   Kenichi Nakamura, another company official, said Matsushita will
study the first products would be available by 2000 at the
earliest, he said.
	   Jay Purie, a vice president of Sun Microsystems, said ``this is
an auspicious day for Sun because we are getting endorsement for
JAVA from leading consumer electronics company Matsushita.''
	   The companies said they will form a licensing agreements for
Sun's Personal JAVA programming technology and work together to
adapt JAVA to digital TV products.
	   They will also study ways to use JAVA in a wide-range of
electrical appliances such as audio-video equipment and home
appliances.
	   Nakamura, however, declined to discuss how much Matsushita will
invest in the project.
	   Through a tie-up with the Japanese consumer electronics giant,
Sun will try to gain ground in the home appliances area, where
Microsoft Inc., a leading U.S. computer software maker, has yet to
establish a foothold with its Windows CE operating system, the
Nihon Keizai an economic journal, reported.

Cambodia sits on sidelines at Southeast Asian summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Vietnam saying Cambodia should be
considered ASEAN member, comments from analysts in Phnom Penh &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodia sat on the sidelines as a summit
of Southeast Asian leaders opened Tuesday, once again relegated to
observer status because of political turmoil at home.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had lobbied hard for
admission to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, did save
some face by being seated in the front row during the opening
ceremony.
	   In speech after speech, Hun Sen was assured Cambodia would soon
become the final member of the Southeast Asian brotherhood, as
envisioned when ASEAN was founded in 1967.
	   It will be admitted, the leaders said, in a ceremony in Hanoi
next year. Vietnam, which had lobbied strongly for Cambodia's
entry, went so far as to insist by day's end that Cambodia had
already been admitted and the ceremony was only a formality.
	   ``Although the admission ceremony has not yet occurred,
everybody should consider Cambodia as the 10th member of ASEAN,''
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said.
	   The nine-member group decided late Monday to admit Cambodia but
not in time for the summit, saying the long-troubled nation needs
more time to fully establish the credibility of a newly installed
coalition government.
	   ``We don't want to risk ASEAN being damaged by Cambodia,''
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said.
	   Much international criticism has been heaped on ASEAN for its
admission of Myanmar, also known as Burma, which is plagued by a
dismal human rights record.
	   Cambodia originally was scheduled to join ASEAN last year, but
before that could happen, Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a violent coup.
	   Now that a coalition government is in place in Phnom Penh, Hun
Sen has made entry into ASEAN a priority, seeing it as key to
establishing international legitimacy.
	   Earlier this month, the United Nations gave Cambodia a seat in
the world body after a 15-month vacancy.
	   Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines opposed Cambodia's entry
into ASEAN at this juncture.
	   ``There's no division within ASEAN on Cambodia's admission,''
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said. ``What is really at
issue is should we rush to make them a member at this Hanoi summit
or let them get all aspects of their own announced arrangements
implemented.''
	   Hun Sen had earlier threatened to boycott the summit if Cambodia
was not admitted this time around. But assurances of pending entry
appeared to appease him.
	   ``It's just a question of the ceremony that needs to be done,''
he told reporters Monday night.
	   Back home in Phnom Penh, political analysts weren't putting such
a good spin on Cambodia's entry.
	   ``A delay is a delay,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, executive director
of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a local think
tank. ``Membership has been delayed with an ASEAN way of
face-saving, but in the end it shows that there was no consensus.''
	   Memories of the military confrontation that shook Phnom Penh
just 17 months ago when the prince was deposed may have been too
fresh for some ASEAN countries, Kao Kim Hourn said.
	   ``People think we are still going through a transition, so we
are viewed as somewhat unstable,'' he said, adding that vocal
support for a delay by Cambodia's opposition leader Sam Rainsy also
may have hurt Hun Sen's chances.
	   Sam Rainsy's party applauded the decision to delay membership,
saying concerns of stability were legitimate.

	   It's time to pick the top sports stories of 1998. The Associated
Press each year asks its international media subscribers _ sports

Swiss judge issues arrest warrant for Argentina's Massera
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge who last week requested the arrest
of former Argentine military leader Jorge Videla said Tuesday she
has also issued an arrest warrant against Emilio Massera, another
leading member of the former ruling junta.
	   Geneva investigating judge Christine Junod is investigating the
case of Alexis Jaccard, a Swiss-Chilean student who disappeared in
the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, in 1977.
	   As in the case of Videla, the warrant was issued in case Massera
is able to leave Argentina in future.
	   The Jaccard case already has led to Switzerland formally
requesting the extradition from Britain of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet.
	   Geneva's state prosecutor has said there is no prospect of an
extradition request in Videla's case as he, like Massera, has been
detained in Argentina.
	   Former army chief Videla and former navy chief Massera were
among the original members of the junta that ousted Isabel Peron in
a 1976 coup.
	   Massera was arrested in Buenos Aires last month and Videla, a
former army lieutenant general, was detained earlier this year,
both on charges of child kidnapping and falsifying documents.
	   A civilian court sentenced Massera and Videla to life in prison
in 1985 for human rights violations, but they were pardoned in 1990
by President Carlos Menem. The child kidnapping charges are not
covered by the pardon.
	   An Argentine government report says more than 9,000 people
disappeared between 1976-83 when the military cracked down on
leftists and political dissidents. Rights groups put the figure
closer to 30,000.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power there in 1973. He fled to Argentina and
on to Switzerland after being released from prison the following
year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Following a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by Jaccard's
widow, Switzerland requested Pinochet's arrest with a view to
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   Switzerland has launched an inquiry into the role of its embassy
in Argentina in Jaccard's disappearance.

Protesting students detained in police headquarters

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police detained a group of female
students on Tuesday, forcing them into a police station as they
protested the arrest of two fellow students.
	   About 60 students, all women, were protesting in front of the
Jakarta Police headquarters, demanding the release of two activists
captured early this month during a predawn attack by police on a
private university in eastern Jakarta.
	   Police contended that the two were involved in the kidnapping of
a plainclothes officer during an earlier protest near the station.
	   Plainclothes police often infiltrate student protests and
sometimes are caught by protesters and beaten.
	   As the female students gathered in front of the headquarters and
repeatedly chanted ``release our fellow students,'' hundreds of
policemen rounded them up and forced them into the headquarters.
	   Later, a bus carrying another group of students was forced to
leave the site by policemen who took it over from the driver. It
was not clear to where the students were driven.
	   Witnesses said a student, identified as Faisal Basri, was taken
by police for questioning.
	   The female students were still inside the headquarters, and no
police officials were available for comment.
	   University students have almost everyday staged protests in the
capital.
	   They want Suharto to be tried on charges of corruption and human
rights abuses. On several occasions protesters have tried to march
to his heavily-guarded house in an affluent neighborhood of the
capital.
	   Hundreds of students also staged protest Tuesday at the Supreme
Court and near the parliament building, but all were peaceful.

US envoy optimistic over Turkish route for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Richard Morningstar, a U.S. envoy for
Caspian energy development, sounded optimistic on Tuesday in
convincing oil companies to chose Turkey as the main export route
for Caspian oil.
	   ``I think that the AIOC position has modified because they
understand the political realities of Baku-Ceyhan,'' said
Morningstar in reference to the 11-company consortium. ``They are
fully prepared to reach a joint conclusion. That is a constructive
step.''
	   The Clinton administration has been actively lobbying for the
Turkish option which they see as a strategic goal of developing
east-west oil and gas transportation corridors in central Asia,
avoiding Russia and Iran.
	   The oil companies have been reluctant to support the Turkish
route because of the high cost and uncertainty over how much oil
the Caspian fields will produce.
	   The projected 1,730-kilometer (1,081-mile) pipeline runs from
Azeri capital Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port town of Ceyhan.
	   On Monday, Morningstar urged Turkish officials to urgently
address concerns of the consortium over the financing of the
pipeline.
	   ``As long as we can do that, I think the companies will be able
to come to a conclusion,'' Morningstar said.
	   There is a huge discrepancy between the cost forecasts of Turkey
and the consortium, which allegedly based its calculations on
higher construction costs.
	   Morningstar said other independent studies confirmed that the
cost of pipeline was closer to the Turkish estimate of dlrs 2.3
billion. The consortium estimates the cost at dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   ``Over the next few weeks, it is going to be important that the
companies, Turkey and Azerbaijan come together and really go over
those cost numbers so that everybody is sure that we're comparing
apples and apples,'' Morningstar said. ``I think the gap can be
narrowed.''
	   Turkey has offered incentives including tax exemptions to reduce
construction costs.
	   The main alternative to Baku-Ceyhan, reportedly favored by the
companies, is an existing pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black
Sea port of Supsa.
	   But that would involve large tanker traffic through the Turkish
straits which Turkey opposes for safety and environmental reasons.
	   Morningstar said the companies would make a final decision on
the pipeline within months.

Platt reportedly front-runner for Sampdoria job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Former England captain David Platt is the
front-runner to take over as coach of Italian League club Sampdoria
of Genoa, Italian newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Platt, who helped Sampdoria win an Italian Cup during his
playing days, will join the team next week, the Corriere dello
Sport daily said.
	   At 32, he would be the youngest coach in Serie A.
	   Platt retired as a player over the summer, following a 14-year
career in which he played for Serie A sides Sampdoria, Bari and
Juventus, plus English clubs Crewe, Aston Villa and Arsenal. He
scored 209 goals in 500 matches.
	   Sampdoria (3-4-6) fired first-year coach Eugenio Spalletti
following a 5-2 loss at Lazio of Rome on Sunday. The defeat dropped
the club into 14th place in the 18-team league, just one point out
of the relegation zone.

Communist lawmaker accuses Yeltsin, Jews of genocide against
</HEADLINE>
Russians &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist lawmaker, leading efforts to impeach
Boris Yeltsin, on Tuesday accused the president and Jews in his
office of waging ``genocide'' against the Russian people.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, who heads parliament's security affairs
committee, became the latest Communist legislator to blame the
country's problems on its small Jewish minority.
	   Ilyukhin and other Communists charged that liberal reforms
carried out by Yeltsin's government this decade amounted to a
genocide against the Russian people.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel that is considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   After the session, reporters asked Ilyukhin about his remarks,
and he repeated his charges.
	   ``Representatives of one ethnic group have been dominant in the
president's inner circle and the government during the past seven
years. I have already named this ethnic group,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   ``It appears to be the cause, or one of the factors that have
contributed to the genocide we have witnessed,'' he added. ``If
there had been more representatives of Russia's main ethnic groups,
they would have thought more about the consequences for the
country.''
	   Yeltsin has frequently reshuffled his advisers over the years.
The majority have been ethnic Russians, though Jews and other
minority groups have also been represented.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, sparked a major
controversy in October when he blamed Russia's problems on
``zhidy,'' or yids, a slur against Jews.
	   His comments outraged many officials, but the
Communist-dominated Duma refused to censure Makashov. The
government has been investigating the cases as ``political
extremism,'' but has not acted against Makashov or any other
mainstream politicians.
	   Jews suffered systematic discrimination in czarist Russia and
during the Soviet era. The Russian constitution bars discrimination
against any group, but many Russians express anti-Semitic
sentiments.
	   Meanwhile, the impeachment panel planned to continue its
sessions next week. Several previous impeachment efforts have
collapsed, and the current one also has little chance of success.
	   Yelena Mizulina, a member of the impeachment panel who
represents the liberal Yabloko faction, said the genocide charges
against Yeltsin could not stand up to a legal challenge.
	   ``The panel must prove that Yeltsin planned to worsen the

Communist lawmaker accuses Yeltsin, Jews of genocide against
</HEADLINE>
Russians &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist lawmaker, leading efforts to impeach
Boris Yeltsin, on Tuesday accused the president and Jews in his
office of waging ``genocide'' against the Russian people.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, who heads parliament's security affairs
committee, became the latest Communist legislator to blame the
country's problems on its small Jewish minority.
	   Ilyukhin and other Communists charged that liberal reforms
carried out by Yeltsin's government this decade amounted to a
genocide against the Russian people.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel that is considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   After the session, reporters asked Ilyukhin about his remarks,
and he repeated his charges.
	   ``Representatives of one ethnic group have been dominant in the
president's inner circle and the government during the past seven
years. I have already named this ethnic group,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   ``It appears to be the cause, or one of the factors that have
contributed to the genocide we have witnessed,'' he added. ``If
there had been more representatives of Russia's main ethnic groups,
they would have thought more about the consequences for the
country.''
	   Yeltsin has frequently reshuffled his advisers over the years.
The majority have been ethnic Russians, though Jews and other
minority groups have also been represented.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, sparked a major
controversy in October when he blamed Russia's problems on
``zhidy,'' or yids, a slur against Jews.
	   His comments outraged many officials, but the
Communist-dominated Duma refused to censure Makashov. The
government has been investigating the cases as ``political
extremism,'' but has not acted against Makashov or any other
mainstream politicians.
	   Jews suffered systematic discrimination in czarist Russia and
during the Soviet era. The Russian constitution bars discrimination
against any group, but many Russians express anti-Semitic
sentiments.
	   Meanwhile, the impeachment panel planned to continue its
sessions next week. Several previous impeachment efforts have
collapsed, and the current one also has little chance of success.
	   Yelena Mizulina, a member of the impeachment panel who
represents the liberal Yabloko faction, said the genocide charges
against Yeltsin could not stand up to a legal challenge.
	   ``The panel must prove that Yeltsin planned to worsen the
people's condition and exterminate part of the population when he
launched (free-market) reforms,'' she said. ``This is not serious,
to put it mildly.''
	   Yeltsin has vowed to serve out his term until the year 2000
despite his repeated health problems.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament probably won't begin debating
the country's 1999 budget until the middle of next week, despite
pressure to approve the document as soon as possible, parliament's
speaker said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government wants the budget
passed before January so it can chart a course for taking the
country out of its economic depression.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget document probably wouldn't
start until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and would not finish quickly,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Seleznyov said, however, that the Duma already supports much of
the draft budget.
	   ``The Duma will back a number of bills the government has
submitted,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's team
has widespread support in the Communist-dominated Duma, raising
hopes that the budget can be approved without lengthy debate.
	   For the first time in several years, Russia is ``living under
the conditions of political consensus,'' Seleznyov said.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Russia's economy suffered a major setback in August after the
government devalued the ruble and froze some debt payments.
Primakov has moved cautiously to develop a plan that would end the
crisis and reverse years of economic decline.
	   The passage of the budget could also help Russia attract loans
from international lenders, who have frozen disbursements since the
crisis hit.
	   Primakov has called for the state to play a larger role in the
economy, but both he and President Boris Yeltsin say the country
will not backtrack on political and economic reforms.
	   ``No economic hardship will make us turn around on the road to
democratic reform,'' Yeltsin said during a meeting with foreign
ambassadors at the Kremlin, according to Interfax.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday expressed
its ``satisfaction'' toward an agreement to try two suspects in the

Cathay Pacific staff to work longer for less pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways said Tuesday some of its
employees will work longer hours for less money because it sees no
immediate turnaround in the company's fortunes.
	   Beginning next month, roster-duty staff will work an extra two
hours a week and office employees will work an extra 30 minutes a
day for no extra pay, the Hong Kong flag carrier's in-house
newsletter said.
	   The year-end bonus for ground staff has been capped at 50,000
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,410), and the normal pay increase
and promotion of senior staff will be suspended in 1999, it said.
	   But some other staff will still receive pay rises, it said.
	   The measures, agreed between the management and the local staff
unions, were necessary because there's been no sign of an immediate
improvement in the airline's fortunes, the airline's chief
operating officer, Philip Chen, said in the newsletter.
	   In a separate article, Cathay Pacific Chief Executive David
Turnbull described 1998 as ``devastating'' for revenues.
	   The airline has been hard hit by Asia's currency turmoil, as
well as a slew of local factors including the problem-plagued
opening of the territory's new airport in July, and an outbreak of
avian flu in late 1997.
	   Last week, it said the airport's problems cost it about 400
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 51.3 million) in revenue.
	   Earlier this year, the airline reported its first-ever losses of
175 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 22.4 million) for the first
half of 1998, compared with a profit of 1.07 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 137 million) in the same period in 1997.
	   It has cut staff by about 1,000, either through layoffs or
natural attrition.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two masked attackers robbed a tourist bus
traveling from Ukraine to Turkey after wounding the bus driver and
one of the passengers, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The bus, carrying 20 Ukrainian tourists to Turkey from the
eastern coal-mining Donetsk area, was stopped by attackers in
Ukraine's southeast on Monday night, local police spokesman
Anatoliy Kyreyev told the daily Fakty newspaper.
	   Kyreyev said the attackers escaped with dlrs 5,400 in cash, gold
jewelry belonging to the passengers, and 360 Ukrainian hryvna (dlrs
105).
	   The driver, a 48-year-old Turkish citizen, and a 37-year-old
male tourist were lightly wounded in the assault, the report said.
It was not immediately clear whether the attackers had been on the
bus before the attack.

Chinese shot putter comes back to win second gold in 16 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Asian Games-Track &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Competing with creaky knees, a limp and
against her doctors' advice, Li Meisu captured a special birthday
present Tuesday for her 6-year-old son: an Asian Games gold medal.
	   The burly Chinese shot putter first captured an Asian Games gold
in 1982. On Tuesday, 16 years after her first, she did it again,
winning with a throw of 18.96 meters.
	   Li got a lung infection after the Atlanta Olympics and walks
with a limp because of injured knees. Her doctors have advised her
to call it a day. But Li, who holds the Asian record of 21.76
meters, said the urge to compete just won't go away. The
39-year-old said she also wanted to prove that athletes don't
necessarily have to hang up their shoes as they head into middle
age.
	   ``I feel that in some events athletes retire too early,'' she
said. Li also won a bronze in the 1988 Olympics but said her second
Asian Games gold was ``sweeter,'' on a par even with having a
child.
	   ``I'm old now and getting this gold wasn't easy,'' she said.
``Getting a gold and having a kid, both are really exciting.''
	   Her son, Tian Zizhong, turned 6 Tuesday and Li said the medal is
``his birthday present.''
	   Li stopped competing in 1989 to have her son and to coach in her
native Hebei province in northern China. Six years later, she began
training again and qualified first among Chinese shot putters in
selection for the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, although she failed to
win a medal there.
	   To prepare for the Asian Games, Li left her son for two months'
training in the southwest city of Chengdu and ``trained every
day,'' said her coach, He Zengsheng.
	   Li has a few gray hairs and the coach said it takes her longer
to recover from injury because of her age.
	   ``The doctors said the best thing would be for her not to
train,'' the coach said. ``Even at the Olympics and in all these
years, I've never seen her as happy as today.''
	   Nor did Li say she was now ready to call it a day. ``Sometimes I
think I still want to compete,'' she said when asked if she would
retire.
	   ``I really admire her,'' said Liu Hao, who won Asian Games gold
for China in men's shot putting. ``She's overcome so many
difficulties.''

	   Libya has accepted in principle the trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The handover
of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for a
guarantee that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   The statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention over whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament, however, is expected to
continue meeting throughout the day.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve
their prison term in Britain.

OSCE's Geremek condemns Kosovo bloodshed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The chairman of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe on Tuesday condemned the latest
violence in Kosovo and warned continued bloodshed could wreck
chances for a peaceful settlement.
	   In a statement issued here, Bronislaw Geremek, who is also
Poland's foreign minister, said violence ``could reverse the
progress made over the past couple of months toward a peceful
settlement of the conflict.''
	   ``The federal Yugoslav authorities and the people of Kosovo must
comment themselves to negotiations and not resort to further
violence,'' OSCE said in a statement. ``Fighting will not lead to
peace and prosperity but to a future of instability.''
	   The statement was issued as U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
in Serbia to try to revive stalled peace efforts after the worst
clashes in months left at least 37 people dead in the secessionist
province.
	   The death toll rose after two more people wounded Monday in a
``terrorist attack'' on a bar in Pec, a city in western Kosovo,
died overnight, according to Serb sources in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke arrived in the Yugoslav capital and headed immediately
for Kosovo. He was to return later Tuesday to Belgrade to meet
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and ``emphasize the need to
move ahead expeditiously'' on a peace plan, the State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from his
latest illness, held a welcoming ceremony Tuesday for new
ambassadors to Russia, his press center said.
	   Yeltsin traveled from his country residence to the Kremlin and
greeted new ambassadors from China, India, Qatar, Luxembourg, and
10 other countries, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Russia is interested in developing and stepping up relations
with Latin American states, Mideast countries and states situated

into a zone of peace and stability.''
	   Yeltsin also met the head of Russia's Federal Security Service,
Vladimir Putin, to discuss last month's killing of prominent
lawmaker Galina Starovoitova, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin told Interfax.
	   Starovoitova, a liberal parliament deputy, was found slain in
the entrance to her St. Petersburg apartment on Nov. 20, and
Yeltsin said soon after he would take personal control over the
investigation.
	   After the meetings, Yeltsin returned to his Gorky-9 country home
just west of Moscow, Yakushkin said, according to Interfax.
	   Though still recuperating, Yeltsin was released from the
hospital last week after receiving treatment for pneumonia for more
than two weeks. He had stayed at another country residence most of
the time since then, making occasional trips into the Kremlin.
	   Despite his repeated ailments, Yeltsin insists he will serve out
his term, which runs until the year 2000. He has looked healthy and
animated in public appearances since his release from the hospital.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from his
latest illness, held a welcoming ceremony Tuesday for new
ambassadors to Russia, his press center said.
	   Yeltsin traveled from his country residence to the Kremlin and
greeted new ambassadors from China, India, Qatar, Luxembourg, and
10 other countries, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Russia is interested in developing and stepping up relations
with Latin American states, Mideast countries and states situated
in the Gulf,'' Yeltsin said. ``We firmly favor turning this region
into a zone of peace and stability.''

ASEAN a boost, but Vietnam tourism blues linger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ In a week when hundreds of delegates to
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit descended on this
sleepy capital, hoteliers and organizers are facing unfamiliar
challenges of hosting a major international event.
	   Most in the hospitality business say Vietnam has done a
commendable job, considering the communist state's long closure to
the outside during the Cold War. Hanoi had just one five-star hotel
three years ago, while today it has seven.
	   Those in the industry hope attention generated by the conference
will boost Vietnam's tourism industry, left mired in the doldrums
by the Asian economic crisis.
	   Tourist arrivals will fall 200,000 short of the government's
target of 1.4 million arrivals this year, industry watchers say,
and hotel occupancy rates are only about 40 percent range
nationwide.
	   Not all has gone smoothly at the summit. Security arrangements
have been either too lax, such as failing to check passes at an
airport arrival ceremony, or over-enthusiastic, as when a scrum
between media and security guards led to Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen being hit by a falling lamp.
	   Special arrangements also had to be made, including finding a
long bed for Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. At well over
six foot (nearly two meters) tall, he towers over most Vietnamese _
and other ASEAN leaders.
	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung wanted a low key check-in at
his hotel, without flowers or photos, while Philippines President
Joseph Estrada posed with Hanoi's Filipino community.
	   The Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, a strict Muslim,
requested that no female service staff attend to his rooms.
Delegates from Muslim nations Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia
required pork-free Islamic menus.
	   Delegations have filled some of the larger hotels, though
managers say greater support from tourism authorities is needed to
draw return business.
	   ``It's very positive to have a meeting like this. It puts us on
the map,'' said David Thornton, sales manager of the Hanoi Horison
Hotel.
	   While the summit brings ``lots of pressure, a lot of new things,
and a bit of confusion,'' Hanoi will benefit from the exposure,
said Meritas Hotel General Manager Eugene Auer.
	   ``We're letting the world know about the changes here, and it's
a tremendous chance for us to show that we are a force to be
reckoned with,'' Auer said.
	   Ironically, one that apparently hasn't benefited is the ASEAN
Hotel, named to commemorate Vietnam's 1995 entry into the
organization.
	   Fewer than 40 percent of its 56 rooms are occupied this week, an
even lower proportion than usual, said a deputy general manager,
who gave his surname as Kiem.

Witness: Police tested Anwar's blood for AIDS virus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Anwar Trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police obtained a blood sample
from jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim to test whether he was HIV
positive, a senior police officer testified Tuesday at Anwar's
corruption and sexual misconduct trial.
	   ``Anwar allowed his blood sample to be taken only once ... for
an HIV test,'' assistant commissioner of police Musa Hassan told
Judge Augustine Paul in the High Court.
	   He didn't say what the results of that test were or why police
felt compelled to test him for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
which leads to the deadly AIDS disease.
	   But he surprised the court by admitting during cross-examination
that the sample had been used to obtain a DNA fingerprint. Anwar
was not told about the DNA test, Musa said.
	   ``Yes, it was used for other purposes. No consent was obtained
from Anwar for the DNA tests,'' he said.
	   The test has been used to determine whether DNA in the semen
stains on a mattress, produced as evidence in court Tuesday,
matched the DNA in the sample. The court wasn't told of the result.
	   Prosecutors say the mattress was seized from an apartment that
Anwar allegedly used for his secret sexual encounters. The former
deputy prime minister is being tried for abusing his powers to
cover up alleged sexual misdeeds, including sodomy. He will be
tried later for illegal sex charges.
	   Musa said police took Anwar's blood on Sept. 28, eight days
after he was arrested for organizing mammoth antigovernment
protests in the capital.
	   Under further grilling by defense lawyers, Musa said he
subsequently asked Anwar's lawyers to obtain another blood sample
for a DNA test. His requests were turned down.
	   ``Anwar's lawyers rejected my request to obtain blood samples,''
Musa testified. ``They also rejected my request to conduct a
thorough examination of his private parts, and to have pictures
taken of his genitalia.''
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, had expressed fears shortly after
his arrest that police might inject him with the virus to prove
allegations that Anwar indulged in homosexual acts. Police denied
her charges.
	   On Tuesday, Azizah declined to comment on the court proceedings.
	   But she expressed surprise that a medical report on Anwar's
beating in police custody on the night of his arrest had still not
been released.
	   ``After three months, why is the report not yet out?'' Azizah
asked.

U.N. advises against turning back on Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT Wednesday, Dec. 16. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Western nations should avoid treating Russia as an
economic basket case and help it get back on its feet, according to
a U.N. survey released Wednesday.
	   ``There's a general tendency to despair of Russia and walk away
from it at the moment, but that doesn't seem to us very sensible or
politically very wise,'' said Paul Rayment, head of economic
analysis at the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe.
	   Uncertainty in Russia posed the greatest potential risk to
improving economies in East Europe, the commission said in its
178-page Economic Survey of Europe.
	   East European exports to Russia are expected to drop by 20 to 25
percent for 1998 on last year, Rayment said.
	   Slow growth rates in Western Europe _ with estimates being cut
to 2 1/4 percent from 3 percent _ will also hit eastern Europe hard
next year, he said.
	   Russia's economic collapse is ``by no means a unique event,''
the survey cautioned, pointing to smaller downturns in Ukraine and
Moldova.
	   Russia itself should present a ``carefully sequenced program''
to create the basic structures of a market economy and convince the
G-7 group of industrialized nations to provide help, the survey
added.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund has been frozen since Russia defaulted
on some of its debts and devalued the ruble in mid-August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans.

China's trade minister leaves for talks in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China sent its trade minister Tuesday to talks in
the United States, glossing over U.S. anger over a soaring trade
deficit.
	   Shi Guangsheng, who heads the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, and U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley
will host a meeting of a joint commerce and trade commission on
Thursday.
	   For several months, U.S. officials have criticized China for
running up trade surpluses and keeping its markets closed. On the
eve of Shi's departure, an aide to Daley warned that China's
projected dlrs 60 billion trade surplus with the United States was
becoming a prominent political issue in Washington.
	   ``I believe we are at a turning point in our commercial
relationship with China,'' U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce David
Aaron told a think tank in Washington Monday. ``It may well be that
trade is the most disturbing factor in the relationship.''
	   China's state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Shi as saying he
hoped his Washington meeting would reduce disagreements between the
two countries.
	   In keeping with that tone, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
played down previous criticism of new U.S. rules on wood packaging
materials from China as a form of protectionism. Washington insists
the rules are intended to prevent infestation by the Asian
long-horned beetle, which burrows into the wood crates.
	   ``This question will be resolved through dialogue and
consultation. It will not affect the Sino-U.S. relationship nor
will it affect the normal proceeding of Sino-U.S. trade ties,'' the
spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said at a media briefing.
	   Shi was accompanied by a 24-person delegation from the State
Development Planning Commission, the Ministry of Information
Industry and the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
	   The United States is China's biggest export market and the
estimated dlrs 60 billion surplus in Beijing's favor would be a 20
percent increase over last year.
	   Washington has accused Beijing of tightening its already closed
markets and insisted on greater access before allowing China into
the World Trade Organization.
	   During a trip to Beijing in September, Aaron said China was
erecting new barriers to trade and investment in power plants,
telecommunications and pharmaceuticals.

Greek picks Swedish-Brazil radar plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Turning its back on U.S. military
contractors, Greece awarded a dlrs 570 million contract Tuesday for
Swedish-Brazilian surveillance aircraft.
	   The four-plane order marks the first major outside military
contract for the Erieye radar system of Swedish telecommunications
giant Ericsson AB. The equipment is fitted onto an EMB-145 aircraft
built by the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer.
	   The deal, announced by government spokesman Dimitris Reppas, was
a blow for U.S. contractors seeking another piece of the nation's
dlrs 24 billion arms modernization program. The United States
traditionally has been Greece's main military supplier.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s C-130J and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s E-2C
Hawkeye 2000 were also considered for the radar plane contract.
	   The Erieye doppler radar system, with a range of about 350
kilometers (210 miles), is presently used by the Swedish military
but not on the EMB-145 jet, said Henrik Bremer, a spokesman for
Ericsson Microwave Systems.
	   A system similar to the Greek order is being fitted by Brazil
for surveillance of the Amazon River region.

Sir Bobby Charlton to attend Asian Games semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ English soccer legend Sir Bobby
Charlton will attend the Asian Games semifinal Wednesday between
host Thailand and Kuwait.
	   The match is expected to pack 60,000 frenzied Thai supporters
into the Rajamangala National Stadium, where 3,000 police officers
will be deployed for crowd control.
	   Peter Withe, the English coach of Thailand's team, will invite
Charlton, a longtime friend, to watch the Thai team train Thursday.
Even if the Thais lose their semifinal, they still will play for
the bronze medal.
	   ``Sir Bobby is still very fit and you never know, he might even
want to train with the team, which would be a great inspiration to
them,'' Withe said.
	   Britain's Minister for Sport Tony Banks and Charlton are in
Thailand for England's campaign to be chosen host of the 2006 World
Cup.
	   Charlton was the inspirational playmaker when England hosted and
won the World Cup in 1966, the only time that the country where the
sport originated has won its most prestigious prize.

Libyan parliament gives tacit approval to Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines pvs, ADDS background

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday expressed
``satisfaction'' toward an agreement to try two suspects in the
Netherlands for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, but did not explicitly
say whether Libya would hand the men over for trial.
	   The blast aboard the Pan Am jet killed 270 people.
	   ``The General People's Congress expresses satisfaction for the
agreement of the Libyan, British and American sides on trying the
two suspects in the Lockerbie incident in a third country,'' the
statement said.
	   But the congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing
any obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as
soon as possible.''
	   Libya has accepted in principle the trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The handover
of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   The statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament, however, is expected to
continue meeting throughout the day.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve their
prison term in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.

Government mulls options for selling its stock holdings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After spending 118.1 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 15.1 billion) to prop up stock and futures markets, the
government is now considering how to sell off its massive stock
holdings, the chairman of its investment fund said Tuesday.
	   The fund will appoint advisers from investment banks in Hong
Kong to hasten the selling of its stocks, which are now valued at
158.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 20.4 billion), said Yang
Ti-liang, chairman of Exchange Fund Investment Ltd., the company
formed by the government to manage its shares.
	   The government is considering public auctions, placements and
convertible bond issues as possible means to unload its holdings.
	   The sell-off will be a gradual, orderly process to avoid
disrupting the stock market, Yang stressed.
	   ``Given the sheer size of the portfolio, it will not be
realistic to expect that the disposal program would be completed
over a short period of time,'' Yang said.
	   Before it sells off its stocks, the government will adopt a
largely hands-off policy in the management of companies in which it
holds a significant stake, Yang said.
	   However, he said the government may exercise its voting rights
as a shareholder in some cases. Yang declined to elaborate.
	   The government's largest holdings include 12.7 percent of
conglomerate Swire Pacific Ltd., 12.5 percent of property
conglomerate New World Development Ltd., and 10.8 percent of
property giant Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd.
	   The government also holds 8.8 percent of HSBC Holdings PLC., the
multinational bank makes up about a quarter of Hong Kong's blue
chip index's capital.
	   In a two-week period in August, the government snapped up the
shares in an effort to drive what it called ``market manipulators''
out of the stock, futures and currency markets.
	   The government later introduced a series of regulations to
restrict speculative activity and stabilize the markets.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Despite claims of unity, Southeast Asian
leaders showed signs of division Tuesday, with some complaining
they were being hurt by globalization and others urging faster
economic liberalization.
	   The conflicting stances provided evidence of the difficulties
that foreign and economic ministers had at pre-summit meetings in
trying to forge consensus on action to restore confidence in a
region suffering its worst economic crisis in a half-century.
	   Although they put together a list of ``bold measures'' that the
leaders were expected to endorse at the two-day Association of
Southeast Nations summit, leaked reports on the plans have failed
to generate enthusiasm in world markets.
	   ASEAN includes both industrialized countries and some of the
world's poorest nations, leading to natural splits on the scope and
speed of tariff cuts and investor incentives.
	   Malaysia and Vietnam were at one end of the spectrum Tuesday,
warning of the dangers of globalization, while Singapore, Thailand
and the Philippines said it is inevitable and should be embraced.
	   As usual, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was the most
outspoken, speaking of world leaders who stood by as ``predatory
speculators'' set off the economic crisis, then blamed hard-hit
countries for causing their own problems.
	   ``Instead of reining in the currency manipulators, they allowed
them to destroy the economic tigers in order to force them to seek
the help and accept IMF (International Monetary Fund) prescribed
reforms,'' he said.
	   But Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai urged accelerated
integration of the regional economy, saying ASEAN countries must go
``at least one step beyond our pledged commitment.''
	   ``We cannot stop the process of globalization, but we can better
prepare ourselves to meet its challenges,'' Chuan said.
	   Accountability and transparency have to be extended to politics
in member countries, he said, underscoring Thailand's stance that
economic recovery is linked to more democracy and respect for human
rights.
	   That would not go over well in countries such as Vietnam, Laos
and Myanmar, who have been criticized for their human-rights
records and have resisted any change in ASEAN's policy of
non-interference in members' internal affairs.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada called for ASEAN to ``move
and move boldly,'' on economic integration, and urged more frank
discussion between ASEAN countries.
	   ``We should be confident and open with one another so we can
communicate freely to solve our common concerns and strengthen the
ties of amity and partnership.''
	   Speaker after speaker highlighted the region's stability but
said the economic crisis has taken its toll. Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie called it ``devastating.''
	   ``The economic crisis has impoverished ASEAN economies and
undermined national stability,'' Mahathir said.
	   The crisis has led to calls for affected countries to open their
markets more quickly. Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said
that creates both opportunities and problems.
	   ``Rapid economic globalization is bringing about greater market
access and new partners for development, but also putting the
weaker economies in a more vulnerable and disadvantageous position,
and in an uneven competition,'' Khai said.
	   Mahathir has long been critical of international currency
traders, blaming their unregulated activities for sparking the
Asian economic crisis 19 months ago.
	   He made a pitch for the currency and stock-market controls that
his country have imposed.
	   ``Until the international community agrees on an international
regime that will remove the kind of dangers we have been exposed
to, we will have to continue with our controls,'' Mahathir said.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said ASEAN needed the
assistance of the international community in dealing with its
economic problems.
	   ``Strictly speaking, it's beyond us,'' Goh told reporters after
the first day of meetings. ``ASEAN on its own can't solve the
problems.''
	   Despite the apparent conflict, Goh said the first day of
meetings had gone well.
	   ``It was a very good meeting. We had several practical ideas.
They are not all big ideas, there are some small ideas, but they
are practical ideas which will allow ASEAN to be more unified,'' he
said.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Egyptian excavations reveal possible earliest writing by man

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German archaeologist said Tuesday he has
found what could be the earliest known writing by mankind _ records
of linen and oil deliveries made about 5,300 years ago during the
reign of a king named Scorpion in southern Egypt.
	   The discovery throws open for debate a widely held belief among
historians that the first people to write were the Sumerians of the
Mesopotamian civilization sometime before 3000 B.C., or 5,000 years
ago.
	   While the exact date of Sumerian writing remains in doubt, the
Egyptian discoveries are carbon dated with certainty to between
3300 B.C. and 3200 B.C., Gunter Dreyer, head of the German
Archaeological Institute, told reporters.
	   The writings _ in the form of line drawings of animals, plants
and mountains _ are the first evidence that hieroglyphics used by
later-day Pharaonic dynasties did not ``rise as Phoenix from the
ashes'' but developed gradually, Dreyer said.
	   ``Linguists now have a larger history (of writing) to regard,''
he said.
	   The bulk of Dreyer's discovery was from the tomb of a king
called Scorpion in a cemetery in the Suhag province, 500 kilometers
(300 miles) south of Cairo.
	   Kings in pre-Pharaonic times used to take names of animals and
many records have been found of chieftains named Mouse, Falcon,
Double Falcon and Elephant. The first Pharaonic dynasty began in
2920 B.C. with King Menes and the Great Pyramid was not built until
nearly 400 years later.
	   Since 1985, Dreyer and his team have unearthed about 300 pieces
of written material on clay tablets barely bigger than postage
stamps and clay jars and vases with ink impressions.
	   Two-thirds of them have been deciphered as documentary records
of linen and oil delivered to King Scorpion I in taxes, short
notes, numbers, lists of kings' names and names of institutions.
	   Apart from the academic question of who came first, the Egyptian
writings prove that the society then was far more developed than
previously thought, Dreyer said.
	   He said man's first writings was not a creative outpouring but
the result of economics: when chieftains expanded their areas of
control they needed to keep a record of taxes, which in those days
were in the form of commodities.
	   Fish, the word for delivery, appears on many tablets against the
names of settlements. For example, the city Ba-set was written with
a throne, known as Ba, and a stork, called Set.
	   Although the Egyptian writings are made up of symbols, they can
be called true writing because each symbol stands for a consonant
and makes up syllables _ Ju Gereh was the Mountain of Darkness, a
reference to its location in the west where the sun set.
	   ``In principle they were able to express themselves clearly,''
Dreyer said.
	   He said writings similar to the Egyptian tablets were found in
Mesopotamia but they make no sense, indicating that they were
transported there from Egypt as art.
	   It is also possible that writing was invented in Mesopotamia and
Egypt simultaneously, Dreyer said. While the fact remains
uncertain, it is clear that the Suhag writings are far more
developed than Sumerian examples, he said.

China hopes Olympics bribery charges won't affect Beijing bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed concern Tuesday over allegations
bribery may have influenced the selection of Olympics venues and
hoped the scandal would not affect Beijing's bid for the 2008
games.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said China had taken note of
the controversy.
	   ``We are racing for the qualification to host the 2008 Olympic
Games and we hope our activities will not be affected by this,''
Sun said at a media briefing.
	   Over the weekend a senior member of the International Olympic
Committee said four people had been involved in vote-buying and
that the selections of at least four cities may have been
influenced. One of those cities, Sydney, Australia, narrowly beat
Beijing in 1993's bidding for the 2000 Olympics.
	   Wu Shouzhang, a leader of China's delegation to the Asian Games,
now underway in Thailand, said Monday that ``non-sports factors''
may have partly cost Beijing the games.

German spy agency's bugging is challenged in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's foreign intelligence service
faced charges in court Tuesday that its widened eavesdropping
powers after the end of the Cold War violate privacy laws and press
freedom.
	   The unusual hearings in Federal Constitutional Court, the
nation's highest, followed legal challenges by three journalists, a
law professor and a left-leaning newspaper, Tageszeitung.
	   At issue is a 1994 law allowing the agency to scan German
telephone and telefax traffic with other countries for evidence of
organized crime, arms or drug trafficking and terrorism. With some
restrictions, it can pass on information to courts and law
enforcement authorities.
	   A senior Interior Ministry official, Claus Henning Schapper,
rejected the charges before testifying at the two-day hearing.
	   ``The Federal Intelligence Service is not a secret police and
doesn't want to become one,'' he told reporters.
	   The main purpose of the surveillance is to provide intelligence
analysis for the government, for example on Iraqi weapons programs,
Schapper said.
	   The plaintiffs argue the law breaches legal rights to privacy in
telecommunications and limits press freedom.
	   Previously, the spy agency could bug phone conversations only if
Germany was threatened with a military attack.
	   The service's head, August Hanning, also was due to testify. He
was appointed by the new center-left government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.

Euro bank chief doesn't rule out more interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Wim Duisenberg, president of the
European Central Bank, told a German newspaper that he wouldn't
rule out further rate cuts after the single currency project is
initiated Jan. 1.
	   In an interview with the weekly Die Zeit released Tuesday,
Duisenberg noted that interest rates in the euro zone are at
historically low levels.
	   But when price stability has been reached, meaning there is no
risk of inflation or deflation, ``we must try to get rates as low
as possible,'' he said.
	   The central banks of the 11 euro area countries cut rates on
Dec. 3, making clear that the euro will start with a short-term
rate of 3 percent. Many analysts expect the ECB to cut rates by
another quarter of a percent during the first half of 1999.
	   ``Monetary policy can't do much more'' to boost growth,
Duisenberg said. Rates only have a ``limited effect on investment.
Now it's up to others to boost the conditions for growth and
employment so that more will be invested.''
	   Getting rates as low as possible during periods of price
stability is the ``maximum contribution'' of monetary policy.
	   Asked if he is waiting to see how strong a drop in growth will
be before deciding about a further interest rate cut, Duisenberg
said: ``We aren't waiting. Among the central banks there's
agreement that the individual nations and the wage negotiators must
ensure above all that jobs markets become more flexible.''
	   Duisenberg reiterated his calls for national governments to
remain committed to cutting budget deficits.

Saudi border guard killed by assailants in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi border guard has been shot
dead by assailants in Iraq, the official Saudi Press Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Saiq Ibrahim Jahoosh, a guard on the northern border, was on
duty when he was shot by assailants in a car on the Iraqi side of
the border, the agency said.
	   The agency did not say when the incident took place and gave no
other details.
	   It was the first report of violence on the Saudi-Iraqi border
since the 1991 Gulf War in which a U.S.-led coalition drove Iraqi
forces out of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament declared a one-month state
of emergency Tuesday to combat the rampant crime in the breakaway
territory, where hundreds of people have been kidnapped in recent
years, a report said.
	   Four Western hostages were beheaded in Chechnya last week in a
gruesome display of the lawlessness that has plagued the region
since the end of a 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya's parliament declared the 30-day emergency at a session
Tuesday, deputy Rizvan Lorsanov told the Interfax news agency in
Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   ``The time for talking has passed and it is no longer possible
to tolerate the crime wave,'' Chechnya's Security Minister Aslambek
Arsayev said Monday.
	   However, parliament turned down a request by President Aslan
Maskhadov to mobilize army reservists as part of the anti-crime
effort. Lawmakers said Monday that reservists can only be mobilized
in the face of an external threat.
	   With Chechnya's economy shattered, many young men who fought
against the Russians have turned to crime, and armed gangs roam
operate freely throughout the Muslim territory.
	   ``We do not want to shed blood of the young and innocent
people,'' Arsayev said. ``But if they do not go home and defend
their leaders, they will be eliminated.''
	   Any attempt to crackdown on crime could provoke battles with
heavily armed outlaw groups.
	   In this lawless environment, kidnappings have become one of the
most lucrative businesses in Chechnya. Hundreds of people, many of
them ethnic Russians and foreigners, have been seized for ransom.
	   Three Britons and a New Zealander, kidnapped in October while
installing a telephone network, where beheaded last week.
	   Maskhadov, Chechnya's president, was widely respected as a
military commander during the war, has been unable to impose his
authority since winning a landslide election almost two years ago.
	   His impoverished government barely functions, and many of the
young rebel fighters who served under him during the war have since
turned against him.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two months after its highly publicized signing of
a key human rights treaty, China is putting two dissident leaders
on trial Thursday in its biggest political crackdown in more than
three years.
	   Veteran activist Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, a student leader
of 1989 pro-democracy protests, could be imprisoned for life if
convicted of subversion for challenging the Communist Party's grip
on power by trying to start an opposition party.
	   The campaign against the China Democracy Party highlights
Beijing's determination to crush political challengers even as it
opens up the economy and other facets of Chinese life.
	   ``The battle over changing China politically is a long-term one,
and we've had enough thaws over the decades to know that they are
always followed by frosts,'' said Gerald Segal of the International
Institute of Strategic Studies.
	   The crackdown follows a busy season of high-level diplomacy,
including a state visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, regarded by
China as mostly successful. With no more major events scheduled,
Chinese leaders have a freer hand to crush dissent without fear of
repercussions.
	   The Clinton administration and other Western governments already
have dropped links between human rights and trade, and largely
stopped criticizing China in the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
	   ``The U.S. and the West have given up all their material and
symbolic sanctions,'' said Andrew Nathan of Columbia University.
``All they have left is verbal intercessions.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing protested the detentions, but Nathan
said, ``there was nothing at the political level _ at the White
House level _ in the way of an expression of disapproval.''
	   Wang and Qin are the most prominent dissidents to stand trial
since Wang Dan, another former student leader in 1989, was
sentenced in 1995 to 11 years in prison on subversion charges. He
was released last April on the condition he go into exile _ a
tactic used by the Chinese government to rid itself of its most
vocal domestic critics.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi on Tuesday accused Qin and
Wang of committing crimes but promised Chinese courts would give
them a fair trial free from government interference.
	   Arrested with Qin on Nov. 30 was Xu Wenli, a veteran dissident
who advised China Democracy Party founders before deciding to set
up a branch in Beijing. He also is accused of endangering state
security, but prosecutors haven't said whether he will be put on
trial.
	   As many as 12 other people associated with the party have been
detained in various Chinese cities. A law student who circulated a
petition calling for Wang's release is missing and believed to have
been detained.
	   In Washington, two U.S. senators joined Chinese dissidents at a
protest Monday outside the Chinese Embassy, demanding the release
of the detainees.
	   ``These activists simply tried to exercise their freedom to form
and register a democratic political party,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, a Republican from Arkansas. ``But in the eyes of the
Chinese government, democracy is a crime.''
	   A statement released Tuesday in Beijing by a group of activists
said the formation of the China Democracy Party was in the
country's best interests, because it was intended to promote
peaceful reform.
	   Qin's activism stretches back to the Democracy Wall movement of
the late 1970s. That political opening, which followed the death of
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, ended with a crackdown and
prison terms for Qin, Xu and others when critics began pointing out
government faults.
	   The latest tightening is a disappointment to human rights groups
that welcomed China's signing of the International Covenant of
Civil and Political Rights on Oct. 6. The agreement backs the right
of self-determination, prohibits torture and provides for freedom
of movement, religion, expression and association.
	   ``It's just really a sign that they're determined to show that
they're not prepared to go as far as many people had hoped,'' said
Louise Vischer, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International in London.
	   The Chinese government says those detained are criminal
suspects, insisting that their detention doesn't contradict its
endorsement of the covenant or other human rights pacts.
	   ``This has nothing to do with human rights,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said last week.

Thai Cabinet postpones discussion of controversial power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday did not
take up the promised cancellation of three power plant projects
that sparked violent confrontations last week between thousands of
police and environmental protesters.
	   Protest leaders said on Sunday that if the Cabinet did not
announce it was scrapping the projects they would once again stage
demonstrations.
	   The Cabinet gave no reason for not considering the issue on
Tuesday.
	   More than 60 people were injured in two days of clashes last
week between 5,000 protesters who had blocked a major highway and
3,000 police.
	   The protesters are against the building of three power plants
fueled by coal in Prachuab Khiri Khan, 233 kilometers (145 miles)
southwest of Bangkok.
	   At least one will use lignite, which the demonstrators say will
pollute their environment and ruin their health.
	   The plants are being built by consortia that have Finnish,
Japanese and American partners who have all said they expect the
government to honor the contracts it awarded them to build the
plants.

African summit to discuss conflicts on the continent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African envoys will recommend
sending a regional intervention force to the island of Anjouan in
the troubled Comoros archipelago when African leaders meet later
this week to discuss continental conflicts, an OAU official said
Tuesday.
	   The 16-nation Organization of African Unity central organ on
conflict prevention and resolution is to meet Thursday and Friday
in Ouagadougou, capital of the West African nation of Burkina Faso.
	   An official at the Addis Ababa headquarters of the 53-nation
OAU, speaking on condition of anonymity, said civil conflicts in
the Comoros and the Democratic Republic of Congo and between
Ethiopia and Eritrea will top the agenda.
	   Renewed fighting Angola and Sierra Leone will also be addressed.
	   The official said an OAU delegation sent last week to look into
clashes that erupted Dec. 6 on Anjouan was to submit its report to
the summit calling for the immediate dispatch of African
peacekeeping troops to the Indian Ocean island that broke away from
the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros last year.
	   There were reports that at least 40 people were killed in the
fighting between supporters of Anjouan's self-declared president,
Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim, and his former prime minister, Chamassi
Said Omar.
	   The summit is expected to call for a peaceful resolution of the
four-month rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has
drawn in troops from six African countries.
	   Rwanda and Uganda are backing rebels who have captured most
major towns in eastern Congo, while Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and
Chad have sent troops and equipment to bolster President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Kabila refuses to meet with the rebels, who he claims are
puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, indicating little likelihood that an
effective cease-fire will be signed in Ouagadougou.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea have been locked in a border dispute since
May, when heavy fighting over disputed border regions left hundreds
dead. Although there has been no fighting reported since June, both
sides continue to mass troops along their common 1,000-kilometer
(620-mile) border.
	   Discussions of that conflict are expected to center on an
11-point OAU proposal accepted by Ethiopia; Eritrea rejects the
provision calling for the withdrawl of Eritrean troops from
disputed territory.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that U.S. special envoy Anthony
Lake, who has been shuttling between Addis Ababa and Asmara to
broker a settlement, would attend the summit.

IAAF boss Nebiolo meets with prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ World athletics boss Primo Nebiolo met
Tuesday with a prosecutor looking into the use of
performance-enhancing susbstances in Italian sports.
	   Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello reportedly questioned the
IAAF president, who is also a powerful member of the International
Olympic Committee, about the use of creatine, a dietary supplement
used to build muscles and speed recovery from training; the battle
against doping in athletics; and the status of Italy's
IOC-accredited drug-testing laboratory.
	   The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down in October after an IOC
inspection deemed it unsatisfactory.
	   Guariniello has been conducting his investigation since July,
when allegations of drug use surfaced. He has questioned dozens of
players, coaches and trainers.

Scandal-tainted legislator arrested on new corruption charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors on Tuesday arrested a disgraced former
lawmaker, who had already been charged with misappropriating
campaign funds, on suspicion of accepting bribes from Fuji Heavy
Industries.
	   Yojiro Nakajima allegedly received 5 million yen (dlrs 42,500)
in kickbacks from Fuji Heavy in exchange for using his influence to
secure a defense contract for the machinery company, said a Tokyo
District Prosecutors spokesman, who declined to give his name.
	   Fuji Heavy Chairman Isamu Kawai, 76, and Yasuyuki Kogure, 64, a
former managing director, had earlier been arrested on suspicion of
offering the bribes.
	   Nakajima, 39, allegedly abused his position as parliamentary
defense minister to help Fuji Heavy get chosen as one of the
developers of search-and-rescue amphibian craft for Japan's Marine
Self-Defense Forces.
	   In October, Nakajima, a former Liberal Democratic Party member
of Parliament, was arrested on separate charges of ordering false
receipts made to account for party funds he allegedly pocketed.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru automobiles, has also
admitted to donating 4 million yen (dlrs 34,000) to Nakajima since
1993, and to buying 740,000 yen (dlrs 6,320) worth of tickets for
fundraising parties for the lawmaker.
	   In a separate scandal involving the Defense Agency, ministry
officials are being investigated for allowing NEC Corp. to inflate
defense contracts bills in exchange for cushy executive posts for
retiring bureaucrats.
	   Two Defense Agency officials have been indicted in the scandal,
as have a dozen employees at NEC and two of its subsidiaries.

Libyan parliament gives tacit approval to Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday expressed
``satisfaction'' about an agreement to try two suspects in the
Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet, but did not
explicitly say whether Libya would hand the men over for trial.
	   The blast over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people.
	   ``The General People's Congress expresses satisfaction for the
agreement of the Libyan, British and American sides on trying the
two suspects in the Lockerbie incident in a third country,'' the
statement said.
	   But the congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing
any obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as
soon as possible.''
	   Libya has accepted in principle the trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The handover
of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   The statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament, however, is expected to
continue meeting throughout the day.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve their
prison term in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.

Former diplomat, senator named to head new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Smail Hamdani, senator and former
ambassador, was officially named on Tuesday Algeria's new prime
minister to run a caretaker government charged with preparing early
presidential elections.
	   President Liamine Zeroual named Hamdani, as expected, a day
after the widely unpopular Ahmed Ouyahia resigned from the post.
	   It was not immediately clear when the new government would be
announced. It's main task will be overseeing preparations for
presidential elections set for April.
	   Preparations for an Organization of African Unity summit in
Algiers in May or June also should fall upon his government.
	   Zeroual, whose five-year term ends in 2000, announced in
September plans to step down early.
	   Hamdani, 68, began his career in the diplomatic service,
eventually serving as Algeria's ambassador to France. Before being
called upon to head the government, he was a senator in the
recently created upper house of parliament.
	   Ouyahia, who served as prime minister for three years, has been
roundly criticized on a range of issues, from electoral fraud in
November 1997 local elections to failing to lift the foundering
economy or end a Muslim insurgency.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in violence since
the start of the insurgency in 1992, triggered by the army's
decision to cancel legislative elections that a Muslim
fundamentalist party was on the verge of winning.

17-year-old boy reportedly dies playing Russian roulette
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; mb1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) _ Police were investigating reports that a
17-year-old boy died while playing Russian roulette.
	   Investigators said they have questions about the shooting on
Sunday _ since the gun has not been found and some of the youths
who were at the party when the shooting occurred have disappeared,
said police spokesman Joe Vargas.
	   A boy and girl, both 15, who witnessed the shooting were
detained on murder charges, in case the Russian roulette story was
concocted to cover up an intentional shooting, he said.
	   ``We are investigating all the options,'' Vargas said.
	   Manuel Cruz Guardado was pronounced dead about 2:30 a.m. Sunday,
Vargas said.
	   About 30 minutes earlier, police received a call reporting that
someone had shot himself in a home in central Anaheim. Police
arrived and found the victim and the two other teen-agers.
	   Vargas said Guardado and several others attending the party were
gang members.
	   A spokesman for the coroner's office said it will take about six
weeks to get results of a test to see if Guardado had gun-powder
residue on his hands, to determine whether he had fired a gun.
	   Guardado's grandmother, Mary Gonzales, said the boy had just
earned a high school graduate equivalency diploma in September and
was looking for work.

Louisiana company to manage Nzoia Sugar Factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The government of Kenya has signed a
management agreement with Louisiana-based F.G. Schaefer
International to manage the cash-strapped Nzoia Sugar Factory for
the next three years.
	   The U.S. firm will be expected to implement the stalled Kenya
shillings 5.6 billion (dlrs 933.3 million) expansion project of the
factory.
	   ``The company will bring in expatriates but will still work with
few local staff,'' a spokeswoman for the Kenya Sugar Authority said
Tuesday.
	   ``The company was chosen on the basis of its c.v (curriculum
vitae). It manages the Kenana Sugar Co. in Sudan, which is the
largest, and others,'' said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be
further identified.
	   The government holds 97.9 percent of the shares in Nzoia sugar
factory in near Kisumu in western Kenya.
	   It is also the major shareholder in four of the other seven
Kenyan sugar factories and holds a minority share in the sixth.
	   Western sugar, the seventh refinery, is privately owned.
	   At the weekend KSA Chief Executive Officer Francis Chahonyo said
the local industry is unable, due to inefficiency, to attain
self-sufficiency in sugar production despite huge government
investments in the sector.
	   Nzoia Sugar has an installed capacity to crush 3,000 tons of
cane per day and has over 28,000 contracted cane outgrowers.
	   The company plans to expand capacity to crush 7,000 tons a day.
	   Sugar consumption in Kenya has been estimated at 716,455 tons
this year.
	   Local production is projected at 485,000 tons.
	   The government has also issued a tender for bids for the
management of South Nyanza sugar factory.

Russian missile chief supports START II ratification
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia must ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States because its nuclear weapons will soon
reach the end of their service life anyway, the country's missile
force chief said Tuesday.
	   ``Just like human life, the lifetime of any piece of equipment
is limited,'' Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander-in-chief of
Russia's Strategic Missile Force, said at a news conference. ``We
can only have these weapons on combat duty for 25-27 years.''
	   Many of the weapons have already served 21 years, he said. By
the year 2007, the treaty's deadline for dismantling the weapons,
most of Russia's heavy missiles will have to be decommissioned even
if the country doesn't sign the treaty.
	   ``We aren't taking a single missile off combat duty before its
service life expires,'' Yakovlev said.
	   START II, which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified the agreement in 1996, but the
Communist-led opposition in the Russian parliament has balked,
claiming that dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's
security and be too expensive.
	   Yakovlev said the government had convinced lawmakers to drop
their objections.
	   ``All differences are now settled,'' he claimed.
	   Despite his optimism, parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
continues to drag its feet over ratification. Lawmakers are still
working on a bill outlining the future of Russia's nuclear weapons
program. Many legislators want the bill passed before it acts on
the START II treaty.
	   Yakovlev also praised Russia's new single-warhead Topol-M
missile, which is intended to replace the aging missiles.
	   One of the missile's six recent launches was a failure, but
Yakovlev said, ``never before has a new missile shown such
accuracy.''
	   Later this month, several Topol-Ms will be placed on combat
readiness.
	   The transition from Russia's older, multiple-warhead missiles to
the Topol-Ms will allow the country to save a third of the funds it
now spends on the missile force, Yakovlev said.
	   Unlike most Russian military officials, who bemoan the state of
their forces and plead for more money, Yakovlev was upbeat about
the condition of the strategic forces.
	   He said 92 percent of all missiles, satellites and other
equipment were combat-ready, he said.
	   The strategic forces have also found a cheap solution to the
so-called millennium bug, he said. Computers that mark the year
with only two digits could become confused and malfunction when the
year 2000 arrives.
	   ``We will do the work next year, and it will cost us only 10
million rubles (less than dlrs 500,000),'' he said without
elaboration.

Holbrooke in Serbia amid new tensions in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke's quotes; TRIMS. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia on Tuesday to try to revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way deter
the international community to carry out its obligations'' to work
for peace in the troubled province.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived in Kosovo, where he met
William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Later Tuesday, Holbrooke was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to ``emphasize the need to move ahead
expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order is
still in place'' and that peace ``progress must be made because we
are concerned that the fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   Holbrooke said ``yesterday was not a good day'' in Kosovo, but
added: ``We are determined to continue our effort ... We want to
tell all the people involved (in fighting) that they are playing
with dynamite.''
	   Walker, who leads the team aimed at ensuring the peace agreement
is respected, condemned Monday's violence ``in the strongest
terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.''
	   In Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified assailants opened fire
Monday night in a Serb-run bar, killing four Serbs and wounding
five others. Two of the wounded died later, Serbian sources said
Tuesday.
	   All the sources spoke on condition they not be named.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two masked
``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with
automatic weapons fire.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 peace agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.

Russian missile chief supports START II ratification
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia must ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States because its nuclear weapons will soon
reach the end of their service life anyway, the country's missile
force chief said Tuesday.
	   ``Just like human life, the lifetime of any piece of equipment
is limited,'' Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander-in-chief of
Russia's Strategic Missile Force, said at a news conference. ``We
can only have these weapons on combat duty for 25-27 years.''
	   Many of the weapons have already served 21 years, he said. By
the year 2007, the treaty's deadline for dismantling the weapons,
most of Russia's heavy missiles will have to be decommissioned even
if the country doesn't sign the treaty.
	   ``We aren't taking a single missile off combat duty before its
service life expires,'' Yakovlev said.
	   START II, which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified the agreement in 1996, but the
Communist-led opposition in the Russian parliament has balked,
claiming that dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's
security and be too expensive.
	   Yakovlev said the government had convinced lawmakers to drop
their objections.
	   ``All differences are now settled,'' he claimed.
	   Despite his optimism, parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
continues to drag its feet over ratification. Lawmakers are still
working on a bill outlining the future of Russia's nuclear weapons
program. Many legislators want the bill passed before it acts on
the START II treaty.
	   Yakovlev also praised Russia's new single-warhead Topol-M
missile, which is intended to replace the aging missiles.
	   One of the missile's six recent launches was a failure, but
Yakovlev said, ``never before has a new missile shown such
accuracy.''
	   Later this month, several Topol-Ms will be placed on combat
readiness.
	   The transition from Russia's older, multiple-warhead missiles to
the Topol-Ms will allow the country to save a third of the funds it
now spends on the missile force, Yakovlev said.
	   Unlike most Russian military officials, who bemoan the state of
their forces and plead for more money, Yakovlev was upbeat about
the condition of the strategic forces.
	   He said 92 percent of all missiles, satellites and other
equipment were combat-ready, he said.
	   The strategic forces have also found a cheap solution to the
so-called millennium bug, he said. Computers that mark the year
with only two digits could become confused and malfunction when the
year 2000 arrives.
	   ``We will do the work next year, and it will cost us only 10
million rubles (less than dlrs 500,000),'' he said without
elaboration.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British reaction, Libyan parliament ending
meeting, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN BENEDYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday expressed
``satisfaction'' toward an agreement to try two suspects in the
Netherlands for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, but did not explicitly
say whether Libya would hand the men over for trial.
	   The blast aboard the Pan Am jet killed 270 people.
	   ``The General People's Congress expresses satisfaction for the
agreement of the Libyan, British and American sides on trying the
two suspects in the Lockerbie incident in a third country,'' the
statement said.
	   But the congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing
any obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as
soon as possible.''
	   Libya has accepted in principle the trial of the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The handover
of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   The statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.

WW II concentration camp commander indicted for war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dinko Sakic, a commander in one of
Croatia's most notorious World War II concentration camps was
indicted Tuesday for war crimes against civilians.
	   A Zagreb district attorney charged that Sakic, 76, ``by his
acts, caused death of more than 2,000 people'' in Jasenovac during
1944, when he ran the camp, thereby committing crimes against
humanity and breaking international law, state-run news agency HINA
reported.
	   District attorney, Radovan Santek, requested that Sakic stay in
custody until the trial. No date for the trial has yet been set. If
convicted he faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
	   Sakic has been in prison in Zagreb since June, when he was
extradited from Argentina. He had previously lived there peacefully
since the end of the World War II, after a wartime Croatian Nazi
puppet state was crushed.
	   Sakic's arrest followed an interview he gave in April to an
Argentine television station, in which he admitted running
Jasenovac, but claimed that ``nothing happened there.''
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-fascist
Croats were killed in Jasenovac from 1942-45.
	   Croatia requested Sakic's extradition and based the indictment
on the four-month-long criminal investigation.
	   Sakic's wife Nada was also extradited from Argentina, in
November. She is suspected of committing crimes against civilians
in the female block of the Jasenovac camp.
	   She has not been formally charged yet.

Sao Tome President shocked by disappearance of state funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ President Miguel Trovoada
said Tuesday he was dismayed by revelations that dlrs 1 million in
government funds have gone missing from an account at a French bank
in Paris.
	   Trovoada told reporters he was ``shocked'' and ``troubled'' by
the disclosures and pledged a full investigation into the scandal
that has prompted a public outcry.
	   Central bank governor Carlos Quaresma last week confirmed a
report in daily paper Noticias that the money was transferred out
of the account without official authorization.
	   Quaresma has sent a team to the French capital to try and trace
the money. He declined to name the bank.
	   Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary hearing into

Portugal's Benfica signs Ukrainian defender Luzhny
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Benfica has signed Ukrainian
international defender Oleg Luzhny from Dynamo Kiev, beating rival
bids for the 30-year-old player from three English Premier League
clubs, a Benfica spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Luzhny signed a three-and-a-half year contract with the Lisbon
outfit last weekend, club spokesman Eladio Parames said. He
declined to reveal the transfer fee.
	   English clubs Tottenham, Arsenal and West Ham were also in the
race to sign the Ukrainian, according to Parames.
	   Benfica's Scottish coach Graeme Souness said he had been
searching for a quality defender since the summer.
	   ``Luzhny plays on the right of the defense, but he can also play
along the entire right flank,'' Souness was quoted as saying by
sports daily A Bola.
	   ``He's powerful, strong and experienced,'' Souness said.
	   Benfica also signed striker Dean Saunders from English First
Division club Sheffield United this month.

U.S. envoy in Serbia amid new tensions in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia on Tuesday to try to revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way deter
the international community to carry out its obligations'' to work
for peace in the troubled province.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived in Kosovo, where he met
William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming mission to verify
terms of the peace process and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Later Tuesday, Holbrooke was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to ``emphasize the need to move ahead
expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order is
still in place'' and that peace ``progress must be made because we
are concerned that the fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gunbattle near the border
with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   Holbrooke said ``yesterday was not a good day'' in Kosovo, but
added: ``We are determined to continue our effort ... We want to
tell all the people involved (in fighting) that they are playing
with dynamite.''
	   Walker, who leads the team aimed at ensuring the peace agreement
is respected, condemned Monday's violence ``in the strongest
terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.''
	   In Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified assailants opened fire
Monday night in a Serb-run bar, killing four Serbs and wounding
five others. Two of the wounded died later, Serbian sources said
Tuesday.
	   All the sources spoke on condition they not be named.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two masked
``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with
automatic weapons fire.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.

Japan trade group says East Asian economies to grow 3.1 percent in
</HEADLINE>
1999

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ East Asian economies, excluding Japan, will grow an
aggregate 3.1 percent in 1999 after expanding just 0.1 percent this
year, the government-affiliated Japan External Trade Organization
forecast Tuesday.
	   The dramatic depreciation of currencies in Indonesia, Thailand
and other East Asian nations which occurred over the last 17
months, will slow next year, the trade-promotion group said in a
report.
	   And stable currencies will lead to lower inflation rates and
higher economic growth, it said.
	   The group forecast an aggregate inflation rate for the region of
6.6 percent, down from an estimated 10.4 percent this year.
	   China will grow 7.2 percent this year, and 7.0 percent next
year, as a policy of expanding domestic demand through
infrastructure construction makes up for weak exports to its
neighbors, JETRO said, quoting a study by its Institute of
Developing Economies.
	   JETRO forecast Hong Kong will shrink 4.9 percent this year and
another 1.0 percent in 1999 as property prices continue to falter.
	   South Korea's economy was forecast to shrink 5.2 percent this
year, but grow 0.3 percent in 1999. Thailand will likely contract
7.7 percent this year but shrink only 0.2 percent next year, JETRO
said.
	   JETRO predicted that Indonesia would shrink 14.3 percent this
year, and another 5.0 percent in 1999 as both investment and
consumption remain sluggish.
	   JETRO forecast that Singapore's economy will grow 1.9 percent
next year, compared with 0.7 percent this year while Malaysia's
would shrink 0.1 percent in 1999, compared with a contraction of
6.2 percent this year.
	   A recovery in exports of electronic goods, including
semiconductors, would help both Malaysia and Singapore, the group
said.
	   It said the Philippine economy is forecast to grow by 2.6
percent in 1999, stimulated by public investment, compared with no
growth this year.
	   Taiwan is forecast to grow 5.1 percent this year and 4.8 percent
next year, while Vietnam will grow by 5.7 percent this year and 4.6
percent next year, JETRO said.

Electronics company reportedly bids for Magpies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Electronics giant Sony reportedly is
the company behind a 160 million pound (dlrs 267.2 million) bid for
Newcastle United.
	   Newcastle said Tuesday that a takeover bid has been received
although it declined to say who from. It also said that any
takeover rested with a decision by the Monopolies and Mergers'
Commission over a proposed BSkyB bid for Manchester United.
	   ``Newcastle United plc has noted the recent movement in the
company's share price and the speculation regarding a possible
offer for the company,'' Newcastle said in a statement.
	   ``The company confirms that a preliminary approach has been made
which may or may not lead to an offer for the club.''
	   ``The company has been informed that any offer would not be made
until the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has reported on the
offer by BSkyB plc for Manchester United plc,'' the statement said.
	   BSkyB, owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, has bid 623
million pounds (dlrs 1 billion) for Manchester United and the MMC
has to make a ruling on whether it breaches the rules of fair
trading.
	   Although the Newcastle statement did not say who had made the
bid, several reports indicated it was Sony.
	   The ownership of the Newcastle has been in the headlines for a
year. Former chairman Freddy Shepherd and deputy Douglas Hall were
controversially reappointed to the board of directors last week
eight months after stepping down for reportedly making derogatory
comments about the women of Newcastle and calling star striker Alan
Shearer ``Mary Poppins.''
	   The company chairman, Denis Cassidy, and non-executive directors
Tom Fenton and John Josephs resigned in protest at the return of
Shepherd and Hall.
	   Newcastle's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also quit.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Turning its back on U.S. military
contractors, Greece awarded a dlrs 570 million contract Tuesday for
Swedish-Brazilian surveillance aircraft.
	   The four-plane order marks the first major foreign military
contract for the Erieye radar system of Sweden's telecommunications
giant Telefon AB LM Ericsson. The equipment is fitted onto an
EMB-145 aircraft built by the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer.
	   The deal was a blow for U.S. contractors seeking another piece
of the nation's dlrs 24 billion arms modernization program aimed at
keeping pace with regional rival Turkey.
	   The United States traditionally has been the main military
supplier of both Greece and Turkey.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s C-130J and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s E-2C
Hawkeye 2000 were also considered for the radar plane contract. But
a prototype of the Ericsson system was rated best in a preliminary
evaluation by Greek military officials, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Greece's defense minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said Ericsson
``made the best proposal.''
	   He said the radar system ``can coordinate the movements of the
air force, navy and army and monitor all of Greece's airspace and
waters.''
	   The Erieye Doppler radar system, with a range of about 350
kilometers (210 miles), is presently used by the Swedish military
but not on the EMB-145 jet, said Henrik Bremer, a spokesman for
Ericsson Microwave Systems.
	   A system similar to the Greek order is being fitted by Brazil
for surveillance of the Amazon River region.
	   Greece expects the first aircraft to be delivered in early 2002.
	   The radar plane deal is the second big contract by Greek
military planners since the arms modernization program was
announced last year.
	   In October, Greece awarded dlrs 1.2 billion contract for
U.S.-made Patriot missiles.
	   The next large acquisition, expected as early as next month,
will be an estimated dlrs 3.5 billion for fighter jets.
	   The United States is pushing Lockheed Martin's F-16 and the
F-15E, made by McDonnell Douglas. Also in the running are France's
Mirage 2000, Russia's Su-27 and the Eurofighter, a joint project of
four European nations.

Banana dispute threatens to disrupt EU-US summit in Washington
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Only days before a trans-Atlantic Union
summit, the European Union on Tuesday chastised Washington for
threatening trade sanctions instead of calling on the World Trade
Organization to settle their banana dispute and said it would take
the issue to the WTO for them.
	   ``They are willing to wound, yet afraid to strike,'' said EU
Foreign Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan, assessing the U.S. refusal
to put the EU's banana import regime before the WTO.
	   Brittan called on the Clinton administration to ``get back a
sense of proportion'' in the long-simmering dispute that is now set
to dominate Friday's U.S-EU summit in Washington.
	   He appealed to the United States not to let the issue overshadow
trans-Atlantic relations that cover some 400 billion European
currency units (dlrs 340 billion) in trade a year.
	   The summit is also expected to inaugurate a new round of
bilateral trade liberalization talks known as the New Transatlantic
Partnership.
	   Washington is expected to publish in the coming days a list of
EU products that will be targeted by the sanctions and slapped with
100 percent tariffs upon entering the United States. The sanctions
could be worth up to dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   The E.U. claims that this unilateral action would be contrary to
WTO rules and set off a major trade dispute. ``It would not be
appropriate or dignified to do so,'' said Britain, claiming the
publication of such a list would be ``highly provocative in
character and destabilizing.''
	   Washington argues the new EU banana import regime is unfair to
South American distributors, most of which are owned by U.S.
companies. The WTO had already condemned an earlier EU banana
import system, but Brittan said the EU's new regime complies with
all the WTO concerns.
	   ``We have complied with the panel rulings. We have made 10
changes,'' he said.
	   The United States says the changes are cosmetic and does not
want to go through the same WTO settlement procedure, even after
the EU agreed to speed up the court procedure from 449 days to 170
days.
	   ``There is a court there sitting and waiting to be used,'' said
Brittan.
	   In a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky,
Brittan wrote, ``Since you have so far not found it opportune to
bring a complaint against our new regime in the WTO, we will
ourselves request a WTO panel'' to check the legality of the new EU
regime.
	   The United States has warned the 15-nation EU to change its
system by March 3, or face sanctions.
	   Brittan said 78 percent of bananas sold in the EU come from
Latin America already, ``so U.S. banana traders are not doing too
bad.''

<TEXT>
	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Former England captain David Platt has been
chosen to take over as coach of Italian League club Sampdoria of
Genoa, media reports said Tuesday.
	   Platt, who helped Sampdoria win an Italian Cup during his
playing days, will join the team next week, the ANSA news agency
and Corriere dello Sport newspaper reported.
	   ANSA said details of a contract will be worked out later this
week when Platt returns from Hong Kong, where he is with England's
Under-16 side.
	   At 32, he would be the youngest coach in Serie A.
	   Platt retired as a player over the summer, following a 14-year
career in which he played for Serie A sides Sampdoria, Bari and
Juventus, plus English clubs Crewe, Aston Villa and Arsenal. He
scored 209 goals in 500 matches.
	   Sampdoria (3-4-6) fired first-year coach Luciano Spalletti
following a 5-2 loss at Lazio of Rome on Sunday. The defeat dropped
the club into 14th place in the 18-team league, just one point out
of the relegation zone.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Experience counts. For sports power
China, 39-year-old shot putter Li Meisu overcame creaky knees to
win a gold medal at the Asian Games Tuesday, but the fledgling
baseball team was no match for a South Korean pitcher who struck
out eight in a row.
	   ``I feel that in some events athletes retire too early,'' said
Li, who last won Asian Games gold in 1982. She won an Olympic
bronze in 1988, but now competes with a limp and against her
doctors' advice.
	   She called the latest gold a present for the 6th birthday of her
son. Li won it with a throw of 18.96 meters, ahead of compatriot
Cheng Xiaoyan, who took silver with 18.55.
	   With six events yet to be decided in the evening, it was one of
six golds China won Tuesday, boosting its total for the games to
90. Its victories included a sweep of both volleyball titles, with
victories over South Korea in both the women's and men's finals.
	   South Korea was next with 46 golds, and was favored in baseball,
where pitcher Kim Byung-hyun struck out 12 batters _ including
eight in a row _ in six innings of relief as the Koreans beat China
9-2.
	   That put South Korea in the gold medal game against Japan, a 9-8
winner over Taiwan in the day's other semifinal. And it still has
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho rested and ready.
	   Japan had 39 golds after winning three in track and field, one
in synchronized swimming and one in its native sport of karate.
	   Yasunori Uchitomi, disappointed by gaining only bronze in his
hometown of Hiroshima in the 1994 Asian Games, won the 3,000-meter
steeplechase ahead of Hamid Sajdjadi-Hazaveh of Iran.
	   Men's 100-meter champion Koji Ito anchored Japan's 4 x 100-meter
relay team to victory, and Masaki Morinaga won the men's long jump.
	   Aside from the shot put gold, China had a victory in the women's
relay, anchored by 100 champion Li Xuemei.
	   South Korea gained golds Tuesday in archery and soft tennis.
Archer Kim Jo-sun finished first by defeating teammate Lee
Eun-kyung, the 1992 Olympic champion, in a three-arrow shootout.
	   The Koreans gained their third soft tennis gold with a victory
over a Taiwan pair in women's doubles, but Taiwan broke the
monopoly by winning the men's doubles.
	   In the South Asian sport of kabaddi, defending champion India
clinched another gold medal. Going into the final day Wednesday,
the Indians had a perfect 6-0 record, out of reach of closest
competitors Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
	   China and Kazakstan each won individual pursuit races in
cycling. Kazakstan's Vadim Kravchenko beat Japan's Noriyuki Iijima
in the men's 4-kilometer race, 4 minutes, 42.799 seconds to
4:45.215. China's Wang Qingzhi defeated teammate Zhao Haijuan in
the women's 3-kilometer race.
	   Kazakstan also had gold from pole vaulter Igor Potapovich, who
placed fourth at the 1996 Olympics
	   Kazakstan had 16 golds, and was tied with Taiwan.
	   Japan's Miya Tachibana won her second gold of these games when
she teamed with Miho Takeda for the synchronized swimming duet
title, ahead of South Korea's Yoo Na-mi and Jang Yoon-kyeong.
	   Japan's Atsuko Wakai took gold in the women's kata competition
of karate, in which competitors are rated on style. She outscored
Indonesia's Ompi Omita-Olga, 42.9 to 41.9.
	   China pulled ahead of South Korea in fencing golds, four to
three, by beating Japan 45-35 in the men's team foil final.

Carville prepares for battle in new territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the battle between former army buddies for
the hearts and minds of Israelis, Cpl. ``Cueball'' Carville hopes
to make all the difference.
	   James Carville is taking a break from the wars he wages on
behalf of President Clinton to help Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in his effort to wrest power from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   ``I wouldn't have come this far if I didn't think he wouldn't
win,'' Carville told reporters at a photo opportunity at the
Knesset, the Israeli parliament. ``I didn't take a flight this far
to lose.''
	   Elections are not due in Israel until 2000, but Netanyahu is
under political siege and might be forced to call early elections
on Monday, when he faces a no-confidence motion.
	   It would be the first time the two former soldiers went head to
head on the electoral field. Barak commanded Netanyahu in an elite
commando unit in the 1970s.
	   Netanyahu won elections in 1996 with the assistance of American
campaign consultant Arthur Finkelstein, and reportedly maintains
close contacts with the shadowy Republican adviser.
	   This summer, Barak chided the prime minister for allowing
foreigners to set Israeli policy. Netanyahu countered that Barak
also uses foreign advisers _ including Carville.
	   The colorful campaigner said his presence here is hardly the
point.
	   ``I don't think the people of Israel care about Arthur
Finkelstein or James Carville ... Barak can run a better government
than Netanyahu can,'' he said. ``In the end that's what really
matters.''
	   Carville was not planning any meeting with Clinton, who is in
the region on a mission to salvage the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process _ and who has had his own run-ins with Netanyahu.
	   This summer, Carville dubbed himself ``Cpl. Cueball'' _ a
reference to his shining pate _ and declared ``war'' on Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's efforts to impeach Clinton.

Asia says threatened World Cup boycott won't affect hosts

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian soccer officials on Tuesday put
on hold a threatened boycott of the 2002 World Cup and said that
even if it goes ahead, co-hosts Japan and South Korea will still be
allowed to play.
	   The Asian Football Confederation's executive committee, after an
emergency meeting, warned that the boycott would proceed unless
FIFA, the sport's world governing authority, expands the number of
slots allocated to Asia for the World Cup.
	   ``All of the members spoke up very much in favor of a boycott of
2002,'' AFC general secretary Peter Velappan told a news
conference. ``But we will honor the responsibility of hosting the
World Cup.''
	   The formula of a boycott exempting Japan and South Korea
balances the demands of Arab members to retaliate against FIFA
while taking into account the millions spent by the two East Asian
nations to jointly stage the cup finals.
	   Committee members said Asia was not ``treated fairly or taken
seriously'' by FIFA despite being home to 40 percent of the world's
population and comprising a large number of television viewers.
	   There was no immediate FIFA reaction. The Asian confederation
planned to inform the Switzerland-based authority of its decision
in an official letter.
	   The manager of Thailand's team, Thawatchai Sajakul, noted later,
however, that soccer is heavily commercialized and FIFA has a duty
not to bore spectators with weak teams competing in poor games.
	   ``We have to admit that in the recent World Cup, the performance
of the Asian soccer teams was very disappointing,'' Thawatchai
said.
	   Neither Iran, Saudi Arabia, Japan or South Korea made the second
round in France '98. Asia had three direct qualification places and
an extra chance Iran claimed by beating Oceania winner Australia.
	   The AFC wants its 3 1/2 chances back, but Velappan admitted they
would accept 2 1/2 because the co-host arrangement gave them two
automatic qualifiers. But they insist on having the half-spot.
	   The dispute underscores the changes in the tournament with the
first-ever dual-host attempt. The World Cup host nation has always
qualified automatically, but two reserved slots significantly
reduce the chances for other Asian nations to qualify.
	   ``Our decision is not irrational or unreasonable, our decision
is fair,'' Velappan said.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter contacted the Asian confederation
before the meeting and offered the body four places for the 2006
World Cup, without mentioning 2002.
	   ``Why should he dangle a carrot at us about 2006? We're trying
to focus on 2002,'' said Velappan, who is also FIFA's coordinator
for the 2002 cup.
	   The committee decided to send a six-member delegation to meet
FIFA President Sepp Blatter in February ahead of a high-level FIFA
meeting in March to persuade him to restore the lost spot.
	   If the FIFA meeting fails to change course and satisfy the
Asians, the AFC will call another meeting to implement the boycott,
which would pull 40 teams out of the World Cup qualifying rounds.
	   The AFC's move puts the ball in Blatter's end.
	   ``Blatter must do something one way or the other to find a way
of resolving the problem. Otherwise, he will push us to the wall,''
said Manical Fernando, an AFC vice president from Sri Lanka. ``But
they should know if they don't help us, we will boycott.''
	   Velappan said that Asian corporations hoping to sponsor the
event would not be asked to join the boycott, saying sports and
business don't mix.
	   In 1966, all of Asia and Africa except North Korea withdrew
because they were given only one berth to qualify for between the
two continents.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prominent Communist lawmaker accused Boris
Yeltsin and Jews in his office of waging ``genocide'' against the
Russian people, in remarks made during an impeachment hearing
Tuesday.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, who heads parliament's security affairs
committee, became the latest Communist legislator to blame the
country's problems on its small Jewish minority.
	   Ilyukhin and other Communists charged that liberal reforms
carried out by Yeltsin's government this decade amounted to a
genocide against Russians.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel that is considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   After the session, reporters asked Ilyukhin about his remarks,
and he repeated his charges.
	   ``Representatives of one ethnic group have been dominant in the
president's inner circle and the government during the past seven
years. I have already named this ethnic group,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   ``It appears to be the cause, or one of the factors that has
contributed to the genocide we have witnessed,'' he added. ``If
there had been more representatives of Russia's main ethnic groups,
they would have thought more about the consequences for the
country.''
	   Yeltsin has frequently reshuffled his advisers over the years.
The majority have been ethnic Russians, though Jews and other
minority groups have also been represented.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, sparked a major
controversy in October when he blamed Russia's problems on
``zhidy,'' or yids, a slur against Jews.
	   His comments outraged many officials, but the
Communist-dominated Duma refused to censure Makashov. The
government has been investigating the cases as ``political
extremism,'' but has not acted against Makashov or any other
mainstream politicians.
	   Jews suffered systematic discrimination in czarist Russia and
during the Soviet era. The Russian constitution bars discrimination
against any group, but many Russians express anti-Semitic
sentiments.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist, said
anti-Semitism was unacceptable in Russia.
	   ``It is altogether inadmissible to judge politicians by their
ethnic origin,'' Maslyukov's spokesman, Anton Surikov, quoted him
as saying.
	   Meanwhile, the impeachment panel planned to continue its
sessions next week. Several previous impeachment efforts have
collapsed, and the current one also has little chance of success.
	   Yeltsin has vowed to serve out his term until the year 2000
despite his repeated health problems.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China and North Korea won their
semifinal clashes Tuesday to set up the Asian Games women's soccer
final.
	   China defeated Japan 3-0 on first-half goals by Sun Qimin and
Jin Yan _ the tournament's top scorer, with nine _ and Liu Ailing's
clincher in the second half.
	   Pyol Hui Jin put North Korea ahead against Taiwan in the 11th
minute but was the only member of her squad to score. The goal was
her eighth of the tournament, putting her behind only Jin.
	   Huang Chun-lan equalized in the 19th minute. They were the last
goals of regulation and extra time. The penalty shootout went North
Korea's way, 6-5.
	   The final will be played Thursday.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Turning its back on U.S. military
contractors, Greece awarded a dlrs 570 million contract Tuesday for
a Swedish-Brazilian surveillance aircraft.
	   The four-plane order marks the first major foreign military
contract for the Erieye radar system of Sweden's telecommunications
giant Telefon AB LM Ericsson. The equipment is fitted onto an
EMB-145 aircraft built by the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer.
	   The deal was a blow for U.S. contractors seeking another piece
of Greece's dlrs 24 billion arms modernization program aimed at
keeping pace with regional rival Turkey.
	   The United States traditionally has been the main military
supplier of both Greece and Turkey.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s C-130J and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s E-2C
Hawkeye 2000 were also considered for the radar plane contract. But
a prototype of the Ericsson system was rated best in a preliminary
evaluation by Greek military officials, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Greece's defense minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said Ericsson
``made the best proposal.''
	   He said the radar system ``can coordinate the movements of the
air force, navy and army and monitor all of Greece's airspace and
waters.''
	   The Erieye Doppler radar system, with a range of about 350
kilometers (210 miles), is presently used by the Swedish military
but not on the EMB-145 jet, said Henrik Bremer, a spokesman for
Ericsson Microwave Systems.
	   A system similar to the Greek order is being fitted by Brazil
for surveillance of the Amazon River region.
	   Greece expects the first aircraft to be delivered in early 2002.
	   The radar plane deal is the second big contract by Greek
military planners since the arms modernization program was
announced last year.
	   In October, Greece awarded dlrs 1.2 billion contract for
U.S.-made Patriot missiles.
	   The next large acquisition, expected as early as next month,
will be an estimated dlrs 3.5 billion for fighter jets.
	   The United States is pushing Lockheed Martin's F-16 and the
F-15E, made by McDonnell Douglas. Also in the running are France's
Mirage 2000, Russia's Su-27 and the Eurofighter, a joint project of
four European nations.

Germany sees Russian stability as major challenge for EU
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Warning that instability in Russia is a
threat to Europe, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on
Tuesday urged his EU partners for a common strategy to bring
economic and social changes to that country.
	   ``Russia is not anymore the enemy, and this is a tremendous
success, a historical step forward,'' Fischer said. ``But
destabilization in Russia is a problem for our security ... for
Germany and all the other Europeans too.''
	   ``We must produce a responsible attitude ... a common strategy
to help Russia bring forward democratic reforms, economic reforms,
market reforms ... and to find a strategy for a peaceful process,''
Fischer told a news conference.
	   Fischer's stopover in Helsinki was part of a five-day tour of
European Union capitals to discuss EU issues before Germany takes
over its rotating presidency on Jan. 1.
	   Remembering the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe during the Soviet
era, Fischer said that helping to bring stability to Russia also
will be a major environmental issue for the 15-nation bloc during
Germany's six-month presidency.
	   ``The stabilization of Russia is one of the most important
things, not only in terms of foreign policy but also in terms of
environmental issues,'' Fischer said, but did not elaborate.
	   Fischer also warned that ``bloody nationalism,'' especially in
the Balkans, was a threat to European security.
	   ``This is one point that is producing destabilization,
humanitarian catastrophes, murder, mass rape,'' Fischer said. ``It
is thinking along the lines of the 19th century in a Europe of the
21st century.''
	   ``We must solve these problems in the style of the 21st century,
in the spirit of integration and of peace,'' he added.
	   Fischer said that Germany will continue to be a net contributer
to the EU, but that certain distortions have to be rectified.
	   ``We are happy that we are net contributors (to the EU) because
this reflects the strength of our economy ... but there are some
injustices, some imbalance mechanisms within our net
contribution,'' Fischer said.
	   ``We want to correct this imbalance part, not the overall
contribution,'' he added.

Father charged with murder of five year-old daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The father of a five-year-old girl who
went missing last month has been charged with murder after his
daughter was found strangled and buried in a warehouse outside
Brussels, the prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   Police found Fatima's body late Monday, wrapped in a bag and
buried in an abandoned warehouse in Asse, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
west of Brussels, Jos Colpin, a spokesman for the prosecutor's
office said.
	   Her father Ali admitted to the murder Monday after nine hours of
police questioning, Colpin said. He then led police to the place
where he had buried his daughter.
	   The little girl from Burkina Faso, whose parents separated in
November, lived with her mother in Brussels. She went missing on
Nov. 22, while staying with her father in Brussels during one of
her regular weekend visits to him.
	   The father claimed he had sent his daughter back to relatives in
Burkina Faso. Police detained him on Nov. 23 on suspicion of
kidnapping.

Sion chairman says Swiss bid unaffected by Olympic scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Sion has played according to the rules
and its bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics won't be affected by the
scandal surrounding the awards process, the organizing committee's
chairman said Tuesday.
	   Adolf Ogi, who is also Switzerland's defense minister, denied in
radio and television interviews a claim that he asked senior Swiss
Olympic official Marc Hodler to keep quiet allegations of
misconduct.
	   Hodler said Salt Lake City, which beat Sion for the 2002 Winter
Games in a landslide vote in 1995 balloting, had been
``blackmailed'' during its successful bid.
	   On Saturday, he alleged that four ``agents'' _ including one
member of the International Olympic Committee _ had been involved
in vote-buying over the past 10 years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia,
and Salt Lake.
	   The scandal has prompted the IOC to set up a top-level
investigation into alleged misconduct.
	   ``Ogi asked me to say nothing, so as not to endanger Sion's
candidacy,'' Hodler was quoted as saying in the Zurich weekly
SonntagsZeitung. ``He doesn't want Switzerland to be seen as
prosecutor.''
	   Hodler informed the Sion committee of the allegations last
Thursday, Ogi said. But he insisted no instructions or advice were
given to Hodler.
	   He called on the IOC to make a quick decision on whether future
Olympic venues should be made by its governing executive board or
by the full committee.
	   On Monday, Ogi invited the IOC to examine the accounts of both
the current Sion bid and its unsuccessful attempt for the 2002
Games, in the interests of ``full transparency and fair play.''

Sao Tome President shocked by disappearance of state funds

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Sao Tome President Miguel
Trovoada said Tuesday he was dismayed by revelations that dlrs 1
million in government funds have gone missing from an account at a
French bank in Paris.
	   Trovoada said he was ``shocked'' and ``troubled'' by the
disclosures and pledged a full investigation into the scandal that
has prompted a public outcry.
	   Central bank governor Carlos Quaresma last week confirmed a
report in daily paper Noticias that the money was transferred out
of the account without official authorization.
	   Quaresma has sent a team to the French capital to try to trace
the money. He declined to name the bank.
	   Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary hearing into
the affair, while the Supreme Court ordered an independent audit of
the central bank's accounts.
	   The impoverished twin-island nation of about 120,000 people has
only dlrs 15 million in reserves.
	   About 65 percent of the population lives in abject poverty and
45 percent is unemployed.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea, about 150
miles (240 kilometers) west of Gabon.

Chechnya declares state of emergency to fight crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament declared a one-month state
of emergency today to combat rampant crime in the breakaway
territory, where hundreds of people have been kidnapped since the
1994-96 war with Russia.
	   Four Western hostages were beheaded in Chechnya last week in a
gruesome example of the lawlessness that has plagued the region.
	   Chechnya's parliament declared the 30-day state of emergency at
a session today, deputy Rizvan Lorsanov told the Interfax news
agency in Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   ``The time for talking has passed and it is no longer possible
to tolerate the crime wave,'' Chechnya's Security Minister Aslambek
Arsayev said Monday.
	   However, parliament turned down a request by President Aslan
Maskhadov to mobilize army reservists as part of the anti-crime
effort. Lawmakers said Monday that reservists can only be mobilized
in the face of an external threat.
	   The reports did not say what new powers the government would
have under the state of emergency. Security forces have been
stepping up checks of vehicles on main roads in recent days, and
they were expected to continue.
	   With Chechnya's economy shattered, many young men who fought the
Russians have turned to crime, and armed gangs roam operate freely
throughout the territory.
	   ``We do not want to shed blood of the young and innocent
people,'' Arsayev said. ``But if they do not go home and defend
their leaders, they will be eliminated.''
	   The government has in the past been reluctant to confront and
disarm suspected criminal gangs. It's not clear whether the
security forces will take a more aggressive stance this time, and
thereby risk armed conflict with outlaw groups.
	   In the lawless environment, kidnappings have become one of the
most lucrative businesses in Chechnya. Hundreds of people, many of
them ethnic Russians and foreigners, have been seized for ransom.
	   Three Britons and a New Zealander, kidnapped in October while
installing a telephone network, were beheaded last week.
	   Maskhadov, Chechnya's president, was widely respected as a
military commander during the war but has been unable to impose his
authority since winning a landslide election almost two years ago.
	   His impoverished government barely functions, and many of the
young rebel fighters who served under him during the war have since
turned against him.

	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ More than 2,500 passengers
safely evacuated a cruise ship after it struck reefs off the
Caribbean island of St. Maarten and began taking on water, the U.S.
Coast Guard said.
	   Fishermen and boat owners helped ferry passengers off the
74,000-ton Monarch of the Seas, owned by Royal Caribbean
International.
	   ``It was quite a drama this morning, but no one was hurt and
everyone is safe,'' said hotel auditor Nicolaas Martina, who
watched the rescue from the Holland House Beach Hotel overlooking
Great Bay on the Dutch side of the island. The other side is the
French territory of St. Martin.
	   The Monarch of the Seas ran aground near the harbor pier before
dawn.
	   St. Maarten authorities reported that the ship had just left St.
Maarten when it struck reefs and began taking on water in forward
compartments, said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Alberto Torres.
	   The ship's captain decided to return to St. Maarten and beached
the vessel on a sandy bottom off Great Bay, Torres said in San
Juan, Puerto Rico. More than 2,500 people were evacuated, and there
were no reports of injuries.
	   Royal Caribbean spokesman Bob Kearney in Miami didn't
immediately return a telephone call for comment.
	   The 6-year-old ship can hold 2,354 passengers, according to
Royal Caribbean's Internet Web site.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew planned to survey the area
later Tuesday to determine whether there was any threat of
pollution from the ship.
	   Martina said government officials found hotels for the stranded
tourists and were trying to book flights for them to leave the
island, which is east of Puerto Rico. The Monarch picks up
passengers in San Juan and cruises the southern Caribbean.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U. S. Embassy is warning American
citizens to exercise caution when traveling between Lamu Island and
the Somali border in northeastern Kenya following an armed robbery
at a resort in the area, spokesman Chris Scharf said Tuesday.
	   Some of those who were robbed Nov. 19 said the dozen or so men
asked specifically for Americans to identify themselves, according
to Scharf. He said no Americans were staying at the Kiwayu Island
luxury resort, which he declined to identify.
	   It wasn't clear why the bandits were looking for Americans,
Scharf said.
	   Lamu Island, south of Kiwayu Island, is a traditional Swahili
town and popular resort.
	   Scharf said U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell would visit Lamu
Island Wednesday as part of her regular touring of the country.
	   ``We do not regard Lamu Island as a place where there is a
security threat,'' he said.
	   Scharf discounted local media reports linking the incident to
friends or relatives of Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of six people
indicted in the United States in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi.
	   The blast killed 213 people, including 12 Americans.
	   Some members of Odeh's wife's family come from Witu west of
Lamu. Odeh was reported to have spent time in the area before the
bombing.
	   The German Embassy has also warned its citizens about traveling
in the region because of the high incidence of armed banditry.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The militant leader of the main war
veterans group lost an appeal to be freed on bail while awaiting
trial on fraud charges, court officials said.
	   Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War
Veterans' Association, was ordered to remain in custody until Dec.
30 by the High Court in Harare on Monday.
	   Hunzvi led violent demonstrations last year that forced the
government to pay new pensions to veterans of the guerrilla war
that led to independence of the former Rhodesia in 1980.
	   He has pleaded innocent to charges that he defrauded a war
victims' pension fund of more than 400,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs
10,000).
	   As a medical doctor, he is accused of faking disability claims
for compensation from the fund.
	   The charges followed his protests against corruption in the fund
that benefited politicians and members of the military and police.
The protests forced president Robert Mugabe to freeze the fund.
	   ----
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Three of the nine political parties that
ran in recent local council elections have been registered to run
in next year's elections, including the presidential race.
	   The Peoples' Democratic Party and the All People's party both
achieved at
	   least five percent of the votes in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states to
be registered for next year's gubernatorial, state assembly and
presidential polling, Nigeria's Electoral Commission announced
Monday.
	   The Alliance for Democracy, which only scored five percent
support in 14 states, was added under a law allowing the Electoral
Commission to register the country's third most popular party in
the event that only two parties met the initial registration
requirement.
	   Nigeria's military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took
power when dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died earlier this year, has
pledged to hand over power to elected civilians in May after
presidential elections on Feb. 27.
	   The local council elections were used by Nigeria's Electoral
Commission to decide which parties had the national popularity to
advance to the next stage in the voting.
	   Gubernatorial and state assembly elections are scheduled for
Jan. 9.

	   BADPLASS, South Africa (AP) _ Police recovered the bodies of
another five victims of flash flooding in this town 250 kilometers
(155 miles) east of Johannesburg, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The recovery brought to eight the total number of bodies found
since a vehicle carrying 15 people was swept off a bridge over the
Loni River late Sunday, the South African Press Association
reported.
	   One woman managed to swim to safety.
	   The remaining six passengers are believed to have drowned, said
police Superintendent Hans Combrink.
	   In another part of the country, heavy rains on Monday forced the
evacuation of 500 people from their homes in Caledon, 100
kilometers (62 miles) east of Cape Town.
	   Dawie Adonis, a spokesman for the Caledon community, said the
homeless found refuge in a community hall and with family and
friends.
	   In Cape Town, thousands of commuters were stranded at stations
when lightning struck the signal and overhead power lines on
Monday.
	   Lightning also sparked a fire on Monday at the home of Earl
Spencer, brother to the late Princess Diana who lives in a plush
Cape Town residential neighborhood.

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ President Miguel Trovoada
said Tuesday he was dismayed by revelations that dlrs 1 million in
government funds have gone missing from an account at a French bank
in Paris.
	   Trovoada told reporters he was ``shocked'' and ``troubled'' by
the disclosures and pledged a full investigation into the scandal
that has prompted a public outcry.
	   Central bank governor Carlos Quaresma last week confirmed a
report in the daily paper Noticias that the money was transferred
out of the account without official authorization.
	   Quaresma has sent a team to the French capital to trace the
money. He declined to name the bank.
	   Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary hearing into
the affair,
	   while the Supreme Court ordered an independent audit of the
central bank's accounts.
	   The impoverished twin-island nation of about 120,000 people has
only dlrs
	   15 million in reserves, stifling public investment.
	   About 65 percent of the population live in abject poverty and 45
percent are unemployed.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea, about 150
miles (240 kilometers) west of Gabon.

Five Thai fighters advance to boxing finals

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Featherweight Somluck Kamsing,
Thailand's only Olympic boxing gold medalist, advanced to the Asian
Games finals Tuesday with a lopsided victory over Japan's Norihisa
Tomimoto.
	   His victory and one by flyweight Pramuansak Phosuwan put five
Thai fighters in the finals.
	   Two Uzbek fighters, two Indonesians, a Kazakstan boxer and a
South Korean also advanced.
	   Somluck initially took his time picking his shots to counter
Tomimoto's punches. By the end of the third round, he was in
control with superior footwork and hand speed. He won 16-2.
	   For the gold, he will meet Uzbekistan's Tulkanbav Turgunov who
went toe-to-toe with Filipino Eric Canoy for nearly the entire
five-round fight in a 15-7 victory.
	   Pramuansak bothered with South Korea's Choi Jin-woo with double
hooks and right straights in a 15-3 victory.
	   He next meets Indonesia's Hermensen Ballo, an 11-3 winner over
Pakistan's Haider-Ali Haider.
	   World No. 1-ranking light-welterweight Miham Mahamotkadir
Abdullaev of Uzbekistan outpunched Thailand's Prinya
Hrianthuanthong 15-2. The Thai used his reach to keep Abdullaev at
a distance in the early round, but the fight turned into a
crowd-pleasing heavy exchange of blows by the middle of the third
round.
	   Abdullaev will meet Indonesia's Wellem Papilaya, who beat
Mongolia's Densmaa Enkhsaikhan 58-34 with effective use of straight
blows to the head.
	   Kazakstan's Yermankhan Ibraimov defeated Thailand's Komkrit
Nanakon when the referee stopped the fight with 1:39 minute left in
the third round after Komkrit was knocked down.
	   Ibraimov will meet South Korea's Im Jung-bin who defeated
Mongolia's Batmunkh when the referee stopped the fight in the
middle of the fifth and final round.

Carville prepares for battle in new territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES throughout that Carville is an independent
consultant &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the battle between former army buddies for
the hearts and minds of Israelis, James Carville hopes to make all
the difference.
	   Carville _ who likes to call himself ``Cpl. Cueball''_ is taking
a break from the wars he wages on behalf of President Clinton to
help Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak in his effort to wrest
power from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``I wouldn't have come this far if I didn't think he wouldn't
win,'' the independent consultant told reporters at a photo
opportunity at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. ``I didn't take
a flight this far to lose.''
	   Elections are not due in Israel until 2000, but Netanyahu is
under political siege and might be forced to call early elections
on Monday, when he faces a no-confidence motion.
	   It would be the first time the two former soldiers went head to
head on the electoral field. Barak commanded Netanyahu in an elite
commando unit in the 1970s.
	   Netanyahu won elections in 1996 with the assistance of American
campaign consultant Arthur Finkelstein, and reportedly maintains
close contacts with the shadowy Republican adviser.
	   This summer, Barak chided the prime minister for allowing
foreigners to set Israeli policy. Netanyahu countered that Barak
also uses foreign advisers _ including Carville.
	   The colorful campaigner said his presence here is hardly the
point.
	   ``I don't think the people of Israel care about Arthur
Finkelstein or James Carville ... Barak can run a better government
than Netanyahu can,'' he said. ``In the end that's what really
matters.''
	   Carville was not planning any meeting with Clinton, who is in
the region on a mission to salvage the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process _ and who has had his own run-ins with Netanyahu.
	   This summer, Carville dubbed himself ``Cpl. Cueball'' _ a
reference to his shining pate _ and declared ``war'' on Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's efforts to impeach Clinton. He is not
employed by Clinton or any of his lawyers.

Italy's RAI signs agreement with French Canal Plus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's state broadcaster RAI on Tuesday signed a
memorandum of understanding with France's pay-television Canal Plus
for the creation of a digital TV platform, RAI officials said.
	   RAI's accord with Canal Plus seemed to confirm reports that the
Italian broadcaster would participate in a venture to create
Stream, a digital TV unit with partners Telecom Italia and Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.
	   According to Italian news reports, Telecom Italia and News Corp.
are close to an agreement which would see Telecom lower its stake
in Stream from 100 percent to somewhere between 15 to 20 percent.
	   This would allow Murdoch, and French broadcaster TF1, to join
the Stream venture, with their stakes totally no higher than 49
percent, the reports said.
	   The Italian government has repeatedly expressed concern over the
possibility that Murdoch, or another foreign company, could gain
control of an Italian TV group.

Turkish court sentences hijacker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ A court sentenced a hijacker Tuesday
to eight years and four months in prison for commandeering a
Turkish Airlines passenger plane earlier this year.
	   Mehmet Dag, 31, hijacked the domestic flight in February by
threatening to ignite a toy bear he claimed was loaded with
explosives. Dag, who had previously served time on theft and drug
charges, had demanded to be flown to the Iranian capital, Tehran.
	   Five hours into the ordeal, three of the 62 passengers
overpowered him during a refueling stop in southeastern Diyarbakir
city. No one was hurt and the toy contained no explosives.
	   The criminal court in Diyarbakir sentenced Dag on Tuesday.
	   Two other Turkish Airlines hijackings during the past year
forced police to increase security at Turkish airports.
	   In the latest one in October, police squads fatally shot the
hijacker, who had held 38 people hostage aboard a plane to protest
Turkey's Kurdish policy.
	   Turkey has been fighting autonomy-seeking Kurdish guerrillas in
the southeastern part of the country for 14 years.

Thailand's upstarts dream of final; Iran, China clash again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hao suspended for two matches, Houghton one &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Red cards will take their toll in the
Asian Games soccer semifinals Wednesday as China faces Iran in
their second grudge match in five days and host Thailand takes on a
Kuwaiti side that has forgotten how to score.
	   China will be at a major disadvantage against Iran after the
soccer disciplinary committee decided Tuesday to suspend coach
Bobby Houghton for one international match and striker Hao Haidong
for two after disputes with officials in the quarterfinal.
	   Thailand will also be hobbled by the absence of two players who
were sent off in the quarterfinals, but manager Thawatchai Sajakul
told a news conference that Thailand's triumph over South Korea was
a ``miracle'' that could be repeated.
	   ``The team is on a tour out of town to pray at the temples in
Ayutthaya,'' a historic capital, Thawatchai said. ``They're trying
to relax as much as they can.''
	   Thawatchai appealed for Thailand's rowdy fans _ who started
hurling bottles toward the pitch Monday when the Koreans equalized
in the final minutes of regulation time _ to be on their best
behavior.
	   Bayern Munich star Ali Daei is on the verge of seizing the top
spot in the competition's goal-scoring charts, with his second-half
hat trick Monday in Iran's 4-0 victory over Turkmenistan giving him
a total of eight.
	   Two Kuwaitis who also have amassed eight goals, Jasem al-Huwaidi
and Farj Laheeb, failed to score in their last two matches.
Suddenly on fire, the Thais could run over the Gulf side if the
once deadly strikers can't again find some energy and the goal.
	   East Asian power China, which brought a largely young squad to
the games, is still looking to avenge a pair of defeats against
Iran that kept the Chinese out of the World Cup in France. But in
last week's preliminary play, Daei led a 2-1 victory over China.
	   Houghton has said that most of his players hadn't been called up
until recently and have no inherent defeatist complex against Iran.
	   But he won't be part of Wednesday's game and neither will Hao,
who put away a goal Monday against Uzbekistan but was sent off
after disputing a yellow card. Houghton was kicked out for
challenging the ruling. Their absence could fatally weaken China.
	   The Chinese will rely on the scoring talents of Li Jinyu, who
put in the other two goals in the 3-0 shutout for a games total of
six, but are again likely to suffer against the bigger, bruising
Iranians in mid-field.
	   The Iranian side, packed with World Cup veterans, has clearly
emerged as the favorite for gold. After a sluggish first round,
Daei has found his stride and formed a deadly attack force with
Karim Bagheri.
	   If Iran was always a favorite, Thailand never was. But the Thais
are now staring at a spot in the finals. The fire and grit
displayed by the Thais _ beating the highly favored Koreans 2-1 in
extra time with just nine men _ could overcome Kuwait.
	   Thailand will miss its top scorer, Woorawoot Srimaka, and
defender Surachai Jirasirachote, who were both sent off Monday.
	   But the Kuwaitis looked so tired against Qatar _ allowing the
weaker side to take them to a penalty shootout _ that the Thais,
with a stadium full of supporters, are favored to beat them.
	   English coach Peter Withe has given the Thais confidence since
taking over last month. Last weekend, he scoured Bangkok markets to
find tapes of two songs he considers inspirational _ ``Eye of the
Tiger'' and ``We Are the Champions.''
	   Withe played the first to pump up his players at halftime
Monday. After they won, he mused whether the old Queen standby was
predicting a gold medal for his side.
	   ``Maybe.''

EU farm ministers give green light to EU-Canada accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union farm ministers gave the
go-ahead Tuesday to a veterinary agreement with Canada aimed at
making bilateral trade in live animals and animal products easier.
	   Under the agreement, both sides agree to establish ``a mechanism
for the recognition and equivalence of sanitary measures operating
in the two regions,'' a Commission statement said.
	   The agreement will enable the two sides to work towards
recognizing each other's hygiene standards for those live animals
and animal products not yet covered by a system of mutual
recognition of standards.
	   The thumbs-up given by the EU farm ministers paves the way for
the signing of the agreement in Canada on Thursday.
	   With reference to 1997 figures, the agreement will cover trade
between the EU and Canada totaling about 550 million European
currency units (dlrs 660 million).
	   The principle Canadian exports covered by the agreement are fish
and fishery products, milk products and fresh meat - mainly
horsemeat.
	   For the EU, the principal exports covered are dairy products,
fish and fishery products and fresh meat, mainly pork.

Statehood backers receive unexpected boost from White House
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 19 to CORRECT spelling to Serrano, sted Cerrano. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo SJU101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Supporters of statehood for Puerto
Rico got an unexpected boost from President Bill Clinton, who
suggested that their cause was not dead despite its defeat in a
public referendum.
	   That, together with a supportive statement from pro-statehood
Republican Rep. Dan Burton, bolstered Gov. Pedro Rossello's plans
to persevere with his crusade to make the Spanish-speaking
Caribbean island the 51st state.
	   Rossello argued at a news conference Monday that the statehood
movement had won in Sunday's nonbinding referendum, even though it
lost to a ``none of the above'' option backed by supporters of the
island's existing commonwealth status, 50 percent to 47 percent.
	   The independence option won only 2 percent _ underscoring that
while Puerto Ricans may be ambivalent about statehood, they have
little interest in ending a century of U.S. rule.
	   The pro-commonwealth party backed ``none of the above'' because
it disagreed with the definition of commonwealth listed on the
ballot. The definition stated that Puerto Rico is under the full
powers of the U.S. Congress and suggested that Congress could
revoke the islanders' U.S. citizenship.
	   Statehood, Rossello claimed, won a huge majority among people
who chose one of the actual definitions.
	   Backers of commonwealth status and the local media heaped scorn
on Rossello's argument.
	   But Clinton _ despite impeachment proceedings in Washington and
the rigors of a peacemaking trip to the Middle East _ found time to
issue a statement that noted that ``a majority of the vote was not
for any of the options.''
	   ``Among the rest, the overwhelming majority supported
statehood,'' Clinton said. ``I remain committed to implementing a
majority choice for Puerto Rico's future status.'' He pledged to
work with Congress and Puerto Ricans ``to clarify the choice.''
	   Rossello told a news conference that ``once the new Congress is
constituted, that will be the appropriate time to send the results
... saying to the Congress and the president, 'You respond to these
results.'''
	   He said that response might include another referendum.
	   Rossello's biggest rival, pro-commonwealth San Juan Mayor Sila
Calderon, said Monday that her Popular Democratic Party might agree
to another vote _ but only if a victory for commonwealth guaranteed
no further challenges to that status, which the United States
imposed as a temporary measure 46 years ago.
	   In the last referendum, in 1993, the commonwealth option beat
statehood by 49 percent to 46 percent.
	   The semi-autonomous arrangement devised in 1952 allows Puerto
Rico some trappings of an independent nation, like an Olympic team.
And although they pay no federal taxes, Puerto Ricans have U.S.
citizenship and received billions of dollars in federal aid.
	   Burton, a Republican from Indiana, warned Monday that given the
minuscule support _ less than 1 percent _ won by the commonwealth
definition on the ballot, ``and given the enormous economic burden
placed on the overtaxed American people, the Congress should, and
more than likely will, re-evaluate the federal subsidy of the
current status.''
	   Burton anticipated ``a long process'' that ultimately would
offer Puerto Ricans just two choices: independence or statehood.
	   That scenario, one many Puerto Ricans would prefer to avoid,
would likely produce a victory for statehood since Puerto Ricans
prize their U.S. citizenship.
	   ``We cherish our U.S. citizenship _ but we are Puerto Ricans,''
Calderon said Monday.
	   Puerto Rico-born Rep. Jose Serrano, a New York Democrat, also
said the commonwealth arrangement is ``colonial'' and that Puerto
Ricans should choose between statehood and independence.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World badminton champion Ye Zhaoying of
China suffered a shock defeat to Japan's Yonekura Kanako as three
of the top four seeds fell in the women's singles quarterfinals at
the Asian Games on Tuesday.
	   ``I do not know what happened to me,'' said title favorite Ye,
who won a gold in the teams event here. ``I just couldn't
concentrate.''
	   With Indonesian rival Susi Susanti out of the tournament Ye was
expected to have an easy run into the final.
	   She got off to an excellent start with a 11-0 win in the first
game but then became too defensive and made several vital mistakes.
Yonekura rallied back twice in the next two games to win 13-10 and
11-9 after being behind 8-10 and 5-9.
	   Gong Zhichao of China was the only seeded player surviving into
the semis. Gong, the No.2 seed, outclassed Ng Mee-Fen from Malaysia
11-7, 11-3.
	   No.3 seed Mia Audina of Indonesia and No.4 seed Kim Ji-Hyun of
South Korea both lost in straight games. Audina fell to Lee
Joo-Hyun of South Korea, while Eakmongkolpaisarn of Thailand beat
Kim to become the first Thai to make a Games semifinal.
	   China's mixed doubles champions Liu Yong and Ge Fei were also
dumped out of medal contention, losing 15-7, 15-6 to the world's
No.2 pair Gartabti Ttikus and Timur Minarti of Indonesia.
	   In men's singles, No.1 Sun Jun of China beat Ahn Jae-Chang of
South Korea 15-9, 17-14.
	   No. 2 seed Yong Hock Kin of Malaysia also advanced to the
semifinals with a 15-7, 15-4 win over India's Gopichand Pullela,
but said he needed to improve.
	   ``I am not in top condition. Maybe because I have been playing
in too many tournaments,'' Hock Kin said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Turning its back on U.S. military
contractors, Greece awarded a dlrs 570 million contract Tuesday for
Swedish-Brazilian surveillance aircraft.
	   The four-plane order marks the first major foreign military
contract for the Erieye radar system of Sweden's telecommunications
giant Telefon AB LM Ericsson. The equipment is fitted onto an
EMB-145 aircraft built by the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer.
	   The French firm, Thomson-CSF, will supply some of the
electronics.
	   The deal was a blow for U.S. contractors seeking another piece
of the nation's dlrs 24 billion arms modernization program aimed at
keeping pace with regional rival Turkey.
	   The United States traditionally has been the main military
supplier of both Greece and Turkey.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s C-130J and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s E-2C
Hawkeye 2000 were considered for the radar plane contract. But a
prototype of the Ericsson system was rated best in a preliminary
evaluation by Greek military officials, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Greece's defense minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said Ericsson
``made the best proposal.''
	   Reflecting the keen U.S. interest in securing the contract,
American Ambassador Nicholas Burns used a visit by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to make a last-minute pitch to Tzochatzopoulos
late Monday.
	   The Erieye Doppler radar system, with a range of about 350
kilometers (210 miles), is presently used by the Swedish military
but not on the EMB-145 jet, said Henrik Bremer, a spokesman for
Ericsson Microwave Systems.
	   A system similar to the Greek order is being fitted by Brazil
for surveillance of the Amazon River region.
	   Greece expects the first aircraft to be delivered in early 2002.
It will use a training model in the meantime.
	   The radar plane deal is the second big contract by Greek
military planners since the arms modernization program was
announced last year.
	   In October, Greece awarded dlrs 1.2 billion contract for
U.S.-made Patriot missiles.
	   The next large acquisition, expected as early as next month,
will be an estimated dlrs 3.5 billion for fighter jets.
	   The United States is pushing Lockheed Martin's F-16 and the
F-15E, made by Boeing Co. Also in the running are France's Mirage
2000, Russia's Su-27 and the Eurofighter, a joint project of four
European nations.
	   U.S. officials are also lobbying Greece for naval and army
contracts, including the M1-A2 Abrams battle tank.

Ukrainian parliament rejects Crimea's constitution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday rejected
the new constitution of autonomous Crimea after some lawmakers
argued that it contained separatist provisions.
	   The 450-seat Verkhovna Rada voted 210-89 to approve the
document, falling short of the required majority of 226 votes.
	   Lawmakers decided to debate the document again next week after
representatives from Crimea and the Rada examine the disputed
provisions.
	   Crimea, a resort region populated mostly by ethnic Russians,
adopted two previous constitutions, in 1992 and 1995, but they were
never approved by Ukraine's legislature. The latest constitution is
seen as the most likely to win approval.
	   During Tuesday's session, Crimea's parliament speaker, radical
Communist Leonid Grach, called on the Rada to approve the
constitution, adopted by the regional legislature on the Black Sea
peninsula last October.
	   ``We can make a historic breakthrough toward the creation of a
new, and _ most importantly _ a viable, democratic and legal
Ukraine,'' Grach said.
	   Crimea has been part of Ukraine since Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev gave it to the then-Soviet republic in 1954.
	   It became part of independent Ukraine after the Soviet collapse
in 1991, but many ethnic Russians want it returned to Moscow rule.
Ukraine's central government has accused Crimea's leaders for years
of pursing a separatist, pro-Russian agenda.
	   Grach noted that Crimea's two previous constitutions viewed
Crimea as an independent state, where as the new one clearly
describes the region as an autonomous republic within Ukraine, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Tensions over Crimea have calmed down since Grach, who has close
ties to Moscow, was elected last May and a pro-Ukrainian government
figure, Serhiy Kunitsyn, as appointed Crimean prime minister later
that month. In August, Crimea's often feuding political parties
signed a cooperation declaration.
	   On Tuesday, Grach argued that approval of Crimea's new
constitution would not threaten the nation's territorial integrity.
	   However, lawmakers from the pro-government Popular Democratic
Party criticized the document, with legislator Oleh Lytvak saying
it represented ``an attempt to give the autonomous republic state
features.''
	   Lytvak pointed out that the new constitution allows Crimea to
engage in economic activities abroad, permits it to appoint the
chiefs of the interior ministry and other security organs and gives
its parliament speaker the right to sign treaties and agreements.
	   Lawmakers from the opposition Hromada and Rukh parties and the
Green Party, meanwhile, were against the provisions stipulating
that taxes collected in Crimea would only be directed to the
republic's budget.
	   They also said the constitution fails to ensure the status of
the Ukrainian language and provide for the rights of Crimean
Tatars, the UNIAN news agency reported.
	   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin deported the large Crimean Tatar
populace to Central Asia in 1944 after accusing them of
collaborating with Nazi Germany.
	   About 250,000 have returned to Crimea since the late 1980s, and
make up about 10 percent of its population. But about 100,000 have
not been able to acquire Ukrainian citizenship, which has led to
protests.

Coal miners strike to mourn underground deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Coal mines in the northern Asturias region
were silent Tuesday as workers observed the first day of a 48-hour
stoppage called to mourn two workers killed in an underground
explosion, unions said.
	   The death of Joaquin Marquez Bulnes, 38, and Gustavo Garcia
Garcia at a mine run by the state-owned company Hunosa brought to
13 the number of miners killed on the job so far this year in
Asturias - Spain's mining heartland.
	   The blast some 350 meters (yards) below the surface, also
seriously hurt Jose Alberto Pello Sariego, who was in a critical
condition, and extensively burnt a fourth miner, Jose Fernandez
Alvarez, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   An inspection team later found large quantities of gas and noted
inadequate ventilation in the vicinity of the explosion, EFE said.
	   The stoppage followed a similar stoppage in October to mourn
four miners killed by coal landslides.
	   The area's miners ended a month-long strike in January after
Hunosa and the miners' unions agreed to ratify an earlier agreement
establishing a gradual workforce reduction plan.
	   The miners had complained that Hunosa was caving in to European
Union demands and speeding up the pace of already negotiated
layoffs in the money-losing industry.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German archaeologist said Tuesday he has
found what could be the earliest known writing by mankind _ records
of linen and oil deliveries made about 5,300 years ago during the
reign of a king named Scorpion in southern Egypt.
	   The discovery throws open for debate a widely held belief among
historians that the first people to write were the Sumerians of the
Mesopotamian civilization sometime before 3000 B.C., or 5,000 years
ago.
	   While the exact date of Sumerian writing remains in doubt, the
Egyptian discoveries are carbon dated with certainty to between
3300 B.C. and 3200 B.C., Gunter Dreyer, head of the German
Archaeological Institute, told reporters.
	   The writings _ in the form of line drawings of animals, plants
and mountains _ are the first evidence that hieroglyphics used by
later-day Pharaonic dynasties did not ``rise as Phoenix from the
ashes'' but developed gradually, Dreyer said.
	   ``Linguists now have a larger history (of writing) to regard,''
he said.
	   An American archaeologist called it an ``exciting'' find.
	   ``This would be one of the greatest discoveries in history of
writing and ancient Egyptian culture,'' Kent Weeks, professor of
Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, told The Associated
Press.
	   Describing Dreyer as a ``very meticulous scholar,'' Weeks said
the German archaeologist would not have disclosed his findings
without being ``absolutely certain.''
	   The bulk of Dreyer's discovery was from the tomb of a king
called Scorpion in a cemetery in the Suhag province, 500 kilometers
(300 miles) south of Cairo.
	   Kings in pre-Pharaonic times used to take names of animals and
many records have been found of chieftains named Mouse, Falcon,
Double Falcon and Elephant. The first Pharaonic dynasty began in
2920 B.C. with King Menes and the Great Pyramid was not built until
nearly 400 years later.
	   Since 1985, Dreyer and his team have unearthed about 300 pieces
of written material on clay tablets barely bigger than postage
stamps and clay jars and vases with ink impressions.
	   Two-thirds of them have been deciphered as documentary records
of linen and oil delivered to King Scorpion I in taxes, short
notes, numbers, lists of kings' names and names of institutions.
	   Apart from the academic question of who came first, the Egyptian
writings prove that the society then was far more developed than
previously thought, Dreyer said.
	   He said man's first writings was not a creative outpouring but
the result of economics: when chieftains expanded their areas of
control they needed to keep a record of taxes, which in those days
were in the form of commodities.
	   Fish, the word for delivery, appears on many tablets against the
names of settlements. For example, the city Ba-set was written with
a throne, known as Ba, and a stork, called Set.
	   Although the Egyptian writings are made up of symbols, they can
be called true writing because each symbol stands for a consonant
and makes up syllables _ Ju Gereh was the Mountain of Darkness, a
reference to its location in the west where the sun set.
	   ``In principle they were able to express themselves clearly,''
Dreyer said.

Dutch postal company announces takeover of France's Jet Services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch postal and logistics company
TNT Post Groep NV said Tuesday it has taken over French express
mail services company Financiere Jet Services S.A. for 672 million
guilders (dlrs 353.7 million).
	   TPG described the purchase as a crucial part of its strategy to
become Europe's market leader in postal, express and logistical
services.
	   ``This acquisition gives both companies a unique opportunity to
strengthen their position in France as well as in Europe,'' TPG
said in a press statement.
	   The Dutch company said the acquisition will start contributing
to group profits in the year 2000.
	   Lyon-based Jet Services had 1997 sales of 664 million guilders
(dlrs 349.5 million), 93 percent of which were generated in France.
The company's operating profit was 59 million guilders (dlrs 31
million), TPG said.
	   Jet Services will keep its name and its Lyon headquarters.

China pledges fair trials for democracy advocates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with dissidents detained to
prevent show of support, comment from Wuhan court; picks up 11th
graf pvs `Authorities refused ...'

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China promised Tuesday that subversion trials for
two leading organizers of a budding opposition party would be fair
and free from government interference.
	   Chinese courts will hold trials in two different cities for Wang
Youcai and Qin Yongmin on Thursday, part of a swift, sustained
crackdown against the China Democracy Party.
	   ``These people's activities violated the criminal law of
China,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said.
	   Despite the condemnation, Sun added that China's courts operated
according to law and without government meddling.
	   ``They will investigate the cases independently and make their
independent judgments. The government cannot interfere,'' Sun said
at a news briefing. ``The trial process will be conducted according
to law and a fair judgment will be made, eventually.''
	   To prevent a show of support for Wang outside the Hangzhou
courthouse, police detained seven China Democracy Party members in
the eastern city and warned dissidents in Beijing and northeastern
Jilin not to travel there, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Many of those targeted are among the nearly 30 party members and
supporters arrested or questioned over the past 16 days. Wang, Qin
and a third member arrested in the crackdown, Xu Wenli, are among
the most influential members of the dissident community. All tried
to set up party branches, challenging the Communist Party's
monopoly on political power.
	   Eleven China Democracy Party members and supporters urged the
government in two separate statements Tuesday to halt the trials,
hold talks and recognize the party's peaceful aims.
	   Nine supporters, including veteran dissident Ren Wanding, wrote
that suppressing dissent would not ensure social stability in the
long run.
	   High-profile trials in China almost always produce guilty
verdicts. Although China has moved tentatively to bring its legal
system closer to international norms, odds are overwhelmingly
against the accused in criminal cases.
	   Qin's family was only notified Monday that his trial for
inciting the subversion of state power _ one of the most serious
charges used against dissidents _ would be held in three days. One
lawyer who wanted to defend Wang has reportedly been detained
several times since the end of last week.
	   Foreign reporters have been barred from both trials. Wuhan's
Intermediate Court will select the audience for Qin's trial, said a
court official who refused to give his name.
	   Authorities refused Tuesday to tell Xu Wenli's wife whether he
will be put on trial.
	   He Xintong said neither police nor prosecutors in Beijing
claimed to have jurisdiction over Xu's case. Prosecutors told her
they were not investigating Xu, contradicting information given to
her by police last week. Police insist the prosecutors are.
	   ```Maybe the case is on the road on its way to the
prosecutors,''' she quoted one officer as telling her.
	   ``They are making a joke over a matter that concerns one
person's fate,'' said He.
	   Xu, who lives in Beijing, and Qin, from the central city of
Wuhan, were active in the Democracy Wall movement of the late
1970s, and Wang, from Hangzhou in east China, was a leader in the
1989 student democracy demonstrations.

Parliament speaker says Russia's budget on hold until next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament probably won't begin debating Russia's
1999 budget until next week despite economic and political pressure
to approve it as soon as possible, parliament's speaker said today.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government wants the budget
passed before January so the government can chart a course for
economic recovery.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget document probably wouldn't
start until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and would not be completed
quickly, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's team
has widespread support in the Communist-dominated Duma, raising
hopes that the budget can be approved without lengthy debate.
	   For the first time in years, Russia is ``living under the
conditions of political consensus,'' Seleznyov said.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate several tax bills accompanying the budget document.
	   Russia's economy suffered a major setback in August after the
government devalued the ruble and froze some debt payments.
Primakov has moved cautiously to develop a plan that would end the
crisis and reverse years of economic decline.
	   Passage of the budget could also help Russia attract loans from
international lenders, who have frozen disbursements since the
crisis hit.
	   Primakov has called for the state to play a larger role in the
economy, but both he and President Boris Yeltsin say the country
will not backtrack on political and economic reforms.
	   ``No economic hardship will make us turn around on the road to
democratic reform,'' Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying during a
meeting with foreign ambassadors at the Kremlin.

U.N. appeals for dlrs 376 million for North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations launched an appeal Tuesday for
dlrs 376 million to alleviate chronic food shortages and health
problems in North Korea.
	   The appeal is aimed at helping 5.5 million of the most
vulnerable people survive next year.
	   Three years of bad weather combined with decades of economic
mismanagement have brought the farming system in the closed
Communist nation to a state of collapse and left the population of
23 million largely dependent on foreign charity.
	   Two thirds of all children under seven are malnourished _ one of
the highest rates in the world, according to U.N. figures. Lack of
food has stunted the growth of millions more.
	   U.S. congressional aides said earlier this year that the food
shortages and famine-related illnesses had killed up to two million
North Koreans over the past three years.
	   About 90 percent of the 1999 appeal, which was drawn up with
private aid agencies, will be used for food purchases and projects.
The rest will be spent on the health sector.
	   It forms part of a wider U.N. appeal for dlrs 1.5 billion for
stricken areas throughout the world next year. This will be
officially launched Wednesday.

Finnish November inflation lowest in 20 months, at 0.9 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's annual inflation in November
fell to its lowest rate in 20 months _ to 0.9 percent _ making it
one of the lowest in the European Union, the government statistics
agency said Tuesday.
	   In October, annual inflation was 1.3 percent, and in November
1997, it was 1.9 percent, Statistics Finland said. The previous
time inflation fell below 1 percent was in March last year when it
was 0.6 percent.
	   Lower prices of electricity, light fuel oil, gasoline and coffee
curbed inflation in November, as well as a 0.3-percent drop in
consumer prices, the agency said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov will visit India
next week to further develop economic ties and possibly sign
military agreements, news reports said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had planned to visit India in November,
but canceled his trip after falling ill several times in recent
months. He is still expected to visit sometime next year, Deputy
Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said Tuesday.
	   Primakov will travel to India on Dec. 20-22, though details of
his itinerary were not released. He is expected to sign a number of
economic agreements, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We treat carefully the traditionally friendly relations with
India and are inclined to develop cooperation further with that
great Asian power,'' Yeltsin said Tuesday, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Primakov and his Indian counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, may
sign an agreement on military and technical cooperation through
2010, Interfax said. The two countries have an agreement now that
expires in 2000.
	   India is a leading buyer of Russian arms, and is building two
nuclear reactors purchased from Russia in a dlrs 2.6 billion
contract. Both sides say the reactors are for energy purposes and
cannot be used for military means.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Bahrain, Oman and Jordan

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The British-based clothing retailer Marks
&AMP; Spencer opened a store Tuesday in Bahrain, its third in the Gulf.
	   ``The idea was to expand our services to our Gulf customers,''
said Trevor Perren, the Gulf manager of the chain.
	   He said more stores would be opened in the Gulf next year.
	   Marks &AMP; Spencer opened it first Gulf store in Dubai, the United
Arab Emirates, in January. A second store opened recently in Abu
Dhabi.
	   The Bahraini store is in the island's largest shopping center,
the Seef Mall.
	   ____
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Oman's oil minister called Tuesday for a
another Gulf Cooperation Council meeting to tackle the issue of low
oil prices, the official Oman News Agency reported.
	   Mohammed bin Hamed al-Rumhi, whose country is not a member of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, did not propose
a date for such a meeting nor explain why it was necessary.
	   Last week a summit of Gulf Cooperation Council leaders decided
to extend by six months the production cuts they had agreed to in
June. The cuts will now last until the end of 1999.
	   He called for all oil producers to stick to their output quotas
to halt the current slide in prices, the agency said.
	   The GCC is a loose political and economic alliance grouping
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.
	   Earlier this year, Oman joined agreements between OPEC and
non-OPEC producers to remove more than 3.1 million barrels a day in
oil from international markets in an attempt to boost prices.
	   Oman's current production is 870,000 barrels a day, following a
cut of 50,000 barrels a day made earlier this year.
	   OPEC's basket of seven crude oils, which it uses to gauge the
market, is currently selling for between dlrs 9 and dlrs 10 a
barrel.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Four banks have agreed to give the
state-owned Bahrain Petroleum Co. a loan of dlrs 45 million to
upgrade its aging refinery, local newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The seven-year loan was signed Monday between Bapco, on the one
hand, and Bahraini Saudi Bank, Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait, Arab
Banking Corp. and Grindlays Bahrain Bank, the Gulf Daily News and
Bahrain Tribune reported.
	   The papers did not give the interest on the loan.
	   Bapco has already awarded the contract for the upgrading to
Japan's engineering and construction company, JGC Corp..
	   The project, which will be completed by mid-2000, will increase
the value of the refinery's products by about dlrs 17.5 million a
year. It is expected to bring a one-time saving of dlrs 14.2
million by reducing storage tank repair costs and inventory sales.
	   The upgrade is part of the government's plan to spend dlrs 800
million over four years on modernizing.
	   The refinery was built in 1936, four years after the discovery
of oil in Bahrain. It has an output capacity of 250,000 barrels per
day and is the island's only refinery.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)) _ Jordan cement exports dropped by 40
percent this year because Syria and Saudi Arabia have drastically
reduced their imports from the kingdom, an official said Tuesday.
	   Jordan Cement Factories Company General Manager Taleb Rifai said
the principal cause of the fall in exports was the fact that Syria
was no longer importing cement. It used to import 400,000 tons of
Jordanian cement a year.
	   Syria's domestic production now satisfied its local demand.
	   Rifai said the company would try to make up for its lost market
in Syria by exporting half million tones of cement and clinker to
the Palestinian territories next year.
	   Its exports to the territories in 1998 had been hindered by
Israeli restrictions, he said.

Russian missile chief supports START II ratification
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The chief of Russia's missile force today backed
ratification of the START II arms reduction treaty with the United
States, saying Russia's nuclear weapons will soon reach the end of
their service life anyway.
	   ``Just like human life, the lifetime of any piece of equipment
is limited,'' Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander-in-chief of
Russia's Strategic Missile Force, told reporters. ``We can only
have these weapons on combat duty for 25-27 years.''
	   Many of the weapons already have been in service for 21 years,
he said. By 2007, the treaty's deadline for dismantling the
weapons, most of Russia's heavy missiles will have to be
decommissioned anyway.
	   ``We aren't taking a single missile off combat duty before its
service life expires,'' Yakovlev said.
	   START II, signed in 1993, would cut Russian and U.S nuclear
arsenals in half to around 3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led
opposition in Russia's Parliament has blocked ratification,
claiming that dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's
security and be too expensive.
	   Yakovlev said the government had persuaded lawmakers to drop
their objections. ``All differences are now settled,'' he claimed.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, continues to
delay. Many lawmakers want to pass a bill on the future of the
nuclear weapons program in general before acting on START II.
	   Yakovlev also praised Russia's new single-warhead Topol-M
missile, which is intended to replace the aging missiles. The first
of the Topol-M's will be made combat-ready this month.
	   One of the missile's six recent launches was a failure, but
Yakovlev said, ``never before has a new missile shown such
accuracy.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The western peace coordinator for Bosnia
appealed Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption
to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself off massive
foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   In addition the West also wants to see Bosnia strengthen
institutions like its courts into truly functioning, multiethnic
bodies so people in the war-scarred country that saw the worst
fighting in Europe since World War II feel they have rights that
are protected.
	   However, the biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even
though production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council.
	   ``We have to change all that if the economy is ever to act as
the dynamo for growth able to create the jobs that are so
desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in western aid
Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. ``So we must, in 1999, forge
ahead with a radical program that installs the legal and regulatory
structure essential to a market economy,'' he said.
	   ``We must step up the fight against corruption, fraud and fiscal
evasion,'' he said.
	   The Council, established to make the Dayton peace accord work,
includes representation from some 40 countries.
	   The council will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps
aimed at furthering postwar reconstruction in Bosnia.
	   The 1995 peace accords promised a safe return home and
compensation for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who fled Bosnia or were internally displaced during the
1992-95 ethnic-based war between Muslims, Serbs and Croats
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, also attending the Madrid
meeting, stressed the importance of refugee returns for stabilizing
the country, and said responsibility for this lay squarely with the
country's fractious leaders.
	   Addressing them, he said: ``NATO together with the international
community will provide the secure environment, technical advice and
expertise needed to achieve this goal. All that is needed is the
political will on your part. If the goal is not achieved we will
know why -- an absence of political will.''
	   Both Westendorp and Solana called for more robust efforts among
these leaders to hunt indicted war crimes suspects like former
Serbian political leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   The Serb Republic's new hard-line president, Nikola Poplasen,
laughed when a reporter asked if he would surrender Karadzic. ``I
don't have him in my pocket,'' he said. ``I don't know where he
is.''
	   The meeting was being attended by foreign ministers or their
deputies. The United States was represented by Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
	   The council was also expected to discuss the town of Brcko _ a
key strategic location claimed by both the Muslim-Croat Federation
and the Serb Republic and the last territorial issue still
outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages waiting to find out if they will be able to
return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom are
refugees from Sarajevo.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China continued to flaunt its all-round
shooting power as it surged into the semifinals of the men's
basketball competition with a 106-55 defeat of Kazakstan at the
Asian Games on Tuesday.
	   The defending champion, aiming to match the Philippines' record
of four straight Games titles, had six players in double figures
including leader Sun Jun.
	   Sun shot 5-for-5 at 2-point range and hit both 3-point attempts
for 16 points in the Group A match.
	   The win gave China a 2-0 record in its quarterfinal pool,
ensuring a passage to the semis. Also advancing were 1994 silver
medalist South Korea, which won its Pool B game 106-51 against
United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines, an 86-60 winner over
Thailand.
	   South Korea also had a balanced offensive performance. It shot
60 percent from the field and out-rebounded the UAE 27-15 for a 2-0
record win in Group B.
	   Kang Dong-hee scored 19 points, including three 3-point shots,
for the Koreans.
	   The Philippines struggled to overcome the host team, which
played well to level at 36-36 at halftime. But the professional
Philippines outfit dominated the second half, starting it off with
a 19-5 run.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The national airline, Royal Jordanian, will
invite the private sector to buy 49 percent of its shares early
next year, the company chairman said on Tuesday.
	   Nader al-Thahabi told a news conference the airline's finances
were improving, saying that reduced expenditure has reduced the
deficit by almost 50 percent to dlrs 30 million.
	   The government has vowed to privatize the airline to rid itself
of accumulated debts estimated at 700 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 985.9 million).
	   On future plans, al-Thahabi said the airline will replace its
five TriStar aircraft with Airbus 310s in a bid to reduce operating
costs and standardize its fleet.
	   RJ has a fleet of 15 aircraft, including Tristars, Airbus and
Boeings.

Father in Belgium charged with murder of five year-old daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The father of a five-year-old girl who
went missing last month has been charged with murder after his
daughter was found strangled and buried in a warehouse outside
Brussels, the prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   The father, identified by prosecutors only as Ali, originally
told authorities he had sent the girl to his relatives in Burkina
Faso. But the suspect confessed Monday to slaying the child after
nine hours of police questioning, prosecutors' spokesman Jos Colpin
said.
	   The man then led police late Monday to the body in an abandoned
warehouse in Asse, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Brussels.
	   The girl's parents separated in November, and she lived with her
mother in Brussels. She went missing on Nov. 22, during one of her
regular weekend visits to her father. Police detained the man Nov.
23 on suspicion of kidnapping.

Poland ready to join NATO by March 1, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz said
Tuesday that Poland would meet the minimum NATO requirements for
membership by March 1.
	   His statement after a Cabinet meeting that discussed Poland's
plans to join the Western military alliance next year continued a
campaign by Polish officials to obtain membership as soon as
possible.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were expected to become
the first former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO, their one-time
enemy, at a NATO summit in Washington in April.
	   But Polish officials say they want formal membership before the
summit so they can take part as full members in debates on NATO
policy.
	   NATO officials say the earliest that any of three could join
would be March, due to procedures.
	   Onyszkiewicz acknowledged Poland still had work to do, but he
insisted that ``at the start of March, we will be ready to meet
tasks defined by NATO as minimal military requirements,'' the PAP
state news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kim Byung-hyun pitched six innings of
hitless relief and struck out 12 and Park Jae-hong hit two home
runs as South Korea beat China 9-2 Tuesday in the Asian Games
baseball semifinals.
	   In Wednesday's final, the Koreans will play Japan, which
overcame a six-run deficit and beat Taiwan 9-8. With two outs and a
3-and-2 count, Teimii Keenan capped a five-run sixth by doubling
home two runs.
	   South Korea didn't need Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho
against the relatively inexperienced Chinese. Kim Won-hyong gave up
two second-inning runs and three hits before Kim Byung-hyun came on
and didn't allow a man on base. He struck out the first eight
batters he faced.
	   The Koreans scored one run in the first and went ahead to stay,
3-2, on Park Jae-hong's first homer of the game in the third, after
Park Han-yi had doubled.
	   Lee Byung-kyu and Park Jae-hong both homered in the fourth,
putting Korea up 5-2.
	   Back-to-back home runs in the fifth by Back Jae-ho and Shim
Jae-hak increased Korea's margin to 7-2.
	   In the eighth, Korean leadoff batter Lee Byung-kyu reached first
on a passed ball third strike, moved to second and third on
consecutive ground-outs, and scored on a double by Kim Dong-joo.
Kang Hyuk doubled home Kim for the final 9-2.
	   Chinese pitcher Ye Mingqiang yielded seven runs on 10 hits _
including five home runs _ in 4 1/3 innings, taking the loss, and
Wang Zhanpeng gave up two runs on four hits over the last 3 2/3.
	   China had topped the Pool B competition with lopsided victories
against the Philippines and Thailand. Korea finished atop Pool A,
with Japan second.
	   Against Japan, Taiwan scored five runs in the first inning on
home runs by Chen Chih-yuan and Chen Chin-feng, an error, a double
by Tseng Chih-chen and a single by Yang Sun-hsuan.
	   Japan cut the deficit to 5-1 in the third when Tomohiro Iizuka
singled after Kenji Takahashi's two-out double.
	   But Taiwan went ahead 7-1 in the top of the fourth. Chen
Chih-yuan's second homer of the game followed Huang Chung-yi's
double.
	   Japan scored two runs in the bottom of the inning on singles by
Yoshihito uenaka and Mitsutaka Goto and a double by Yoshihiko
Kajiyama.
	   In the fifth, Japan answered Chen Chin-feng's second homer with
a run on a wild pitch, putting the score at 8-4.
	   Then, in the sixth, Japan had its five-run inning on a walk,
singles by Shinnosuke Abe, Goto, Koji Okumura and Takahashi, and
doubles by Iizuka and Keenan.
	   Three Taiwan pitchers yielded a total of 15 hits, while four
Japanese pitchers gave up 12 hits.
	   Tsao Chun-yang, who gave up Keenan's double, took the loss.
Naoyuki Tateishi, who pitched four innings in relief, was the
winner.

China puts dissidents on trial in biggest crackdown in three years

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two months after its highly publicized signing of
a key human rights treaty, China is putting two dissident leaders
on trial Thursday in its biggest political crackdown in more than
three years.
	   Veteran activist Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, a student leader
of 1989 pro-democracy protests, could be imprisoned for life if
convicted of subversion for challenging the Communist Party's grip
on power by trying to start an opposition party.
	   The campaign against the China Democracy Party highlights
Beijing's determination to crush political challengers even as it
opens up the economy and other facets of Chinese life.
	   ``The battle over changing China politically is a long-term one,
and we've had enough thaws over the decades to know that they are
always followed by frosts,'' said Gerald Segal of the International
Institute of Strategic Studies.
	   The crackdown follows a busy season of high-level diplomacy,
including a state visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, regarded by
China as mostly successful. With no more major events scheduled,
Chinese leaders have a freer hand to crush dissent without fear of
repercussions.
	   The Clinton administration and other Western governments already
have dropped links between human rights and trade, and largely
stopped criticizing China in the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
	   ``The U.S. and the West have given up all their material and
symbolic sanctions,'' said Andrew Nathan of Columbia University.
``All they have left is verbal intercessions.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing protested the detentions, but Nathan
said, ``there was nothing at the political level _ at the White
House level _ in the way of an expression of disapproval.''
	   Wang and Qin are the most prominent dissidents to stand trial
since Wang Dan, another former student leader in 1989, was
sentenced in 1995 to 11 years in prison on subversion charges. He
was released last April on the condition he go into exile _ a
tactic used by the Chinese government to rid itself of its most
vocal domestic critics.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi on Tuesday accused Qin and
Wang of committing crimes but promised Chinese courts would give
them a fair trial free from government interference.
	   Arrested with Qin on Nov. 30 was Xu Wenli, a veteran dissident
who advised China Democracy Party founders before deciding to set
up a branch in Beijing. He also is accused of endangering state
security, but prosecutors haven't said whether he will be put on
trial.
	   At least 12 other people associated with the party have been
detained in various Chinese cities. To prevent demonstrations
outside Wang's trial, police took seven party members in Hangzhou
into custody Tuesday and warned others as far away as northeastern
Jilin province not to travel to the eastern city, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   In Washington, two U.S. senators joined Chinese dissidents at a
protest Monday outside the Chinese Embassy, demanding the release
of the detainees.
	   ``These activists simply tried to exercise their freedom to form
and register a democratic political party,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, a Republican from Arkansas. ``But in the eyes of the
Chinese government, democracy is a crime.''
	   A statement released Tuesday in Beijing by a group of activists
said the formation of the China Democracy Party was in the
country's best interests, because it was intended to promote
peaceful reform.
	   Qin's activism stretches back to the Democracy Wall movement of
the late 1970s. That political opening, which followed the death of
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, ended with a crackdown and
prison terms for Qin, Xu and others when critics began pointing out
government faults.
	   The latest tightening is a disappointment to human rights groups
that welcomed China's signing of the International Covenant of
Civil and Political Rights on Oct. 6. The agreement backs the right
of self-determination, prohibits torture and provides for freedom
of movement, religion, expression and association.
	   ``It's just really a sign that they're determined to show that
they're not prepared to go as far as many people had hoped,'' said
Louise Vischer, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International in London.
	   The Chinese government says those detained are criminal
suspects, insisting that their detention doesn't contradict its
endorsement of the covenant or other human rights pacts.
	   ``This has nothing to do with human rights,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said last week.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities in the Russian capital on Tuesday
banned a neo-Nazi group from holding its congress in Moscow.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov presided over a meeting of city
officials who barred Russian National Unity from gathering 5,000 of
its followers next weekend. The city government also instructed
police to use force if the group disobeys.
	   ``Neither now, nor in the future shall we allow such meetings
here,'' said Luzhkov, one of Russia's leading politicians and a
likely presidential candidate.
	   Russian National Unity, led by Alexander Barkashov, is the most
vocal and active among numerous neo-Nazi groups that have
mushroomed in Russia since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Its members sport swastika-like symbols and black uniforms,
raise their hands in a Nazi-like salute, and assail liberal reforms
as a Western plot to destroy Russia.
	   The group is planning to seek official registration to run in
next year's parliamentary elections and 2000 presidential vote.
	   Neo-Nazis and other hard-line groups have become increasingly
active in recent months, amid an economic crisis that has
exacerbated broad public discontent over painful free-market
reforms and made an increasing number of Russians call for strong,
strict leadership.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and other officials have pledged to
crack down on neo-Nazis and other extremist groups but have taken
virtually no action so far.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a blow to China's Asian Games soccer
campaign, striker Hao Haidong was suspended Tuesday for two matches
and the coach was suspended for one.
	   Hao was suspended for spitting in a referee's face during a
quarterfinal match Monday against Turkmenistan, China's official
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Bobby Houghton, the Chinese team's English coach, was suspended
for using abusive language at referees and a soccer official, an
Asian Football Confederation official, Alex Soosey, was quoted by
Xinhua as saying.
	   Wang Junsheng, China's team manager, confirmed the suspensions
and said a decision would be taken later whether to protest.
	   Hao's suspension could be a mortal blow for China in its
semifinal clash against Iran on Wednesday. Hao scored once in
China's 3-0 quarterfinal victory over Turkmenistan before he was
red-carded. Houghton was ejected after he protested.
	   The suspensions were ordered by the Asian Games soccer
competition's disciplinary committee, Soosey was quoted as saying
by Xinhua.
	   Soosey, director of the AFC's referee and disciplinary
department, said their cases will be referred to the AFC for
further action next February, Xinhua added.

EU farm ministers delay ban on animal parts with BSE risk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union farm ministers decided
Tuesday to delay for one year a ban on the use of animal parts
deemed most at risk of harboring ``mad cow'' disease.
	   EU farm ministers decided to push back the Jan. 1 ban amid
concern it could disrupt billions of dollars a year of
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics trade, an EU farm official who spoke
on condition of anonymity said.
	   The EU was due to ban Jan. 1, 1999 the use of the head and
spinal cord of cattle, sheep and goats more than 12 months old and
the spleen of all sheep and goats.
	   Those parts are deemed to be most at risk of harboring mad cow
disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - in BSE-infected
cattle and related brain ailments in sheep and goats.
	   But several EU countries objected to the Jan. 1 ban, the
official said.
	   The United States also oppose the Jan. 1 ban. They have warned
the move would disrupt more than dlrs 4 billion a year of exports
of U.S. pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
	   BSE has been linked to a fatal brain ailment in humans -
Creutzfelt-Jakob disease - and can go undetected in cattle for
years. Pharmaceuticals and cosmetics can be made in part from the
BSE risk material.
	   The ban on animal parts was initially proposed by the EU
executive Commission in 1997. It has been repeatedly delayed.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Western peace coordinator for Bosnia
appealed on Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on
corruption to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself off
massive foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   The West also wants to see Bosnia strengthen institutions like
its courts to make them into functioning, multiethnic bodies so
people in the war-scarred country that saw the worst fighting in
Europe since World War II will feel that they have rights that are
protected.
	   The biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even though
production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp said, addressing the third
annual meeting of the Peace Implementation Council. ``We have to
change all that if the economy is ever to act as the dynamo for
growth able to create the jobs that are so desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in Western aid
that Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. ``So we must, in 1999,
forge ahead with a radical program that installs the legal and
regulatory structure essential to a market economy,'' he said. ``We
must step up the fight against corruption, fraud and fiscal
evasion.''
	   The Council, established to make the Dayton peace accord work,
includes representation from some 40 countries.
	   The council was to issue a declaration Wednesday setting out
steps to further reconstruction.
	   The 1995 peace accords promised a safe return home and
compensation for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who fled Bosnia or were internally displaced during the
1992-95 ethnic-based war between Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, also attending the Madrid
meeting, stressed the importance of refugee returns for stabilizing
the country, and said responsibility lay squarely with the
country's fractious leaders.
	   Addressing them, he said: ``NATO together with the international
community will provide the secure environment, technical advice and
expertise needed to achieve this goal. All that is needed is the
political will on your part. If the goal is not achieved we will
know why _ an absence of political will.''
	   Both Westendorp and Solana called for more robust efforts among
these leaders to hunt indicted war crimes suspects like former
Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   The Serb Republic's new hard-line president, Nikola Poplasen,
laughed when a reporter asked if he would surrender Karadzic. ``I
don't have him in my pocket,'' he said. ``I don't know where he
is.''
	   The meeting was attended by foreign ministers or their deputies.
The United States was represented by Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott.
	   The council was also expected to discuss the town of Brcko _ a
key strategic location claimed by both the Muslim-Croat Federation
and the Serb Republic and the last territorial issue still
outstanding from the Dayton accords.
	   Some 12,000 Muslims who lived in Brcko before the war now live
in neighboring villages, waiting to find out if they will be able
to return to the town that is now dominated by Serbs, many of whom
are refugees from Sarajevo.

Earl Spencer inspects ruins after lightning hits house
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Earl Charles Spencer on Tuesday
picked through the ruins of his burnt out mansion as teams of
workers struggled to clear away the mess left by a lightning bolt
that set the roof ablaze.
	   Spencer, brother of the late Princess Diana, declined to talk
directly to reporters gathered outside his home in the plush suburb
of Constantia in Cape
	   Town. But he could be seen inside the grounds talking on his
mobile phone and inspecting the debris.
	   A spokeswoman, Shelley-Anne Claircourt, told The Associated
Press by telephone from London that Spencer was ``sanguine'' about
the disaster that hit his house on Monday afternoon.
	   ``He intends to rebuild the house,'' she said ``Work will
commence in the
	   New Year and he will continue to keep a house in South Africa.''
	   Much of the upper storey of the spacious dwelling was destroyed
by the fire. Water damage from hoses and a torrential rainstorm had
also damaged the interior.
	   Claircourt said it was too early to estimate the cost of repairs
to the house, believed to be worth more than six million rand (dlrs
one million), and added the Earl was relieved no one was hurt.
	   Spencer and his four children were inside the house at the time
it was hit and had just 20 minutes to grab some precious
possessions before being forced to leave their home, Claircourt
said.
	   ``There was an electrical storm and a bolt of lightning hit the
house. He said you could feel it was a direct hit, you could see
the flames,'' she said.
	   Spencer is now staying with friends in Cape Town and his four
children are with their mother, the Earl's former wife, Victoria
Lockwood.
	   The Earl plans to take his children to Britain to spend
Christmas at Althorp, the Spencer family ancestral home in
Northamptonshire in central England.
	   Spencer moved to Cape Town four years ago after complaining that
media attention on his failing marriage and his then-wife's
problems with eating, drugs and alcohol drove him from Britain.
	   The couple were divorced in Cape Town last December amid
considerable publicity. She accused him of being a serial
adulterer.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying that obstacles must be overcome before
the men are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial. It ``means that they
will hand over the suspects sooner rather than later,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``It looks like they've made a clear decision, but we don't know
if this is the final line or what the time-scale is,'' he added.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.

 &UR; Besieged Angolan city reported calm, but rebels maintain pressure
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The central highland city of Kuito
reportedly was calm early Tuesday, though rebel forces maintained
their control over most of the surrounding area and access to the
city was said to be severely restricted.
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said IRC staff in
Kuito reported a lull in fighting between UNITA rebels and the
besieged government army.
	   ``The situation was calm this morning,'' IRC spokesman Paulo
Delorca said.
	   He said the government and aid agencies had enough supplies to
feed civilians in the city whose population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   ``For the moment, it is not an emergency (aid) situation,''
Delorca said.
	   However, he said access to Kuito by road and air was not safe
because UNITA forces hold areas to the north, east and west.
	   ``Some people are leaving by the south, but it's only a very few
families,'' according to Delorca.
	   UNITA's tightening grip on Kuito, which lies about 500 kms (300
miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, halted the government
evacuation of women and children to the capital that amounted to
three transport planes Monday.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact.
	   UNITA on Monday shot down an Antonov transport plane shortly
after it took off from Kuito, and also drove the army out of
Chinguar, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the city.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the United
Nations-brokered 1994 peace agreement, which was supposed to end a
two-decade civil war that broke out after the southwest African
nation's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Clinton declares Mideast peace 'back on track'

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace accord, but he
declared the Mideast peace process ``back on track.''
	   Clinton held out hope the pullback would take place soon. ``We
will have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine,''
he said after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success.
	   ``I think we are back on track again and we're going to see this
thing through,'' he told reporters at this border checkpoint. ``I
have achieved what I came here to achieve.''
	   In remarks to reporters later, Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, qualified Clinton's remark about the
peace process being on track. ``It's a bumpy track,'' he said with
a smile.
	   Clinton said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would return
to the region soon for further talks.
	   In their three-way meeting, the leaders discussed the work of
committees set up under the October accords negotiated at Wye
River, Maryland, to work out sticky issues such as weapons
confiscation and the size of police forces, Clinton said.
	   ``We now have to decide practical means to go forward,'' he
said.
	   Arafat left without speaking to reporters, but an adviser,
Marwan Kanafani, accused Netanyahu of ``doing away with all the
hopes'' that Palestinians and Israelis had in Clinton's visit.
	   ``He is intentionally crushing all efforts that Clinton exerted
and is stopping the implementation of an agreement he personally
signed,'' said Kanafani.''
	   Netanyahu, the only leader to hold a formal news conference,
described the meeting as ``an open exchange.''
	   The Israeli leader repeated his insistence that he would only
withdraw troops in the West Bank if the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations under the Wye River deal. He said they would have
to confiscate illegal weapons, stop inciting to violence against
Israel, publicly drop plans to declare a state unilaterally in May
and agree to Israel's criteria for the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``When they do this, we will do what we are required to do,''
Netanyahu said, adding that the faster the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations, the faster Israel would withdraw troops. This
phase of the withdrawal is supposed to begin Friday.
	   Netanyahu was asked at his news conference whether his tough
stance wasn't sacrificing Israel's relationship with the United
States for his own political considerations, such as appeasing
hard-liners in his governing coalition. ``We are not engaged in a
confrontation with the United States and President Clinton,'' he
replied. ``There is no toughening of (our) positions in the last
few days.''
	   ``It would be unfortunate if get too far behind schedule,''
Clinton said. He stressed that Netanyahu had reaffirmed Israel's
obligation to complete the agreed troop withdrawals, even as he
refused to go ahead now.
	   It was the first time that Netanyahu and Arafat had met since
signing the Wye accords in Washington.
	   The way for the three-way meeting was cleared with the
Palestinian vote Monday _registered with a show of hands and
applause _ that removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964
from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
	   Speaking to hundreds of Palestinians on Monday, Clinton did not
discourage statehood hopes. In fact, he said he sought ``legitimate
rights for Palestinians'' along with ``real security for Israel.''
	   Netanyahu said revocation of anti-Israel language in the charter
would ``lead to a real peace, a lasting peace, not a minute-long
peace.'' But at the same time, he said Arafat must renounce plans
to declare statehood and take steps to end the violence in the
region.
	   ``We are not susceptible to pressure. We will do what is
right,'' Netanyahu declared in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``We expect the Palestinians to keep all the provisions, and
no amount of pressure is going to change this.''
	   Albright lodged a familiar plea for both leaders to stop making
statements that appeared to prejudge the outcome of negotiations on
an overall settlement. She also suggested Palestinian complaints
that Israel was releasing common criminals but not political
prisoners should be taken up directly with Israel.
	   ``It clearly is a very sensitive point for the Palestinians,''
she said. ``It can be resolved by having honest and frank
discussions.''
	   After the Tuesday meeting, Clinton flew by helicopter to
Bethlehem to join first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, in a visit to the Church of the Nativity in
Manger Square. The first family, accompanied by Arafat and his
wife, Soha, emerged from the church to listen to traditional
Christmas carols and place ornaments on a tall Christmas tree in
the courtyard.
	   The Clintons, accompanied by Netanyahu and his wife, Sarah, also
toured Masada in Israel, where the remnants of a Jewish rebel force
in the first century took their own lives rather than surrender to
conquering Romans. There were no signs of any strain between the
president and prime minister. They laughed, smiled and conversed.
	   After the sightseeing trips, Clinton was flying back to
Washington to resume his impeachment fight.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kim Byung-hyun pitched six innings of
hitless relief and struck out 12 and Park Jae-hong hit two home
runs as South Korea beat China 9-2 Tuesday in the Asian Games
baseball semifinals.
	   In Wednesday's final, the Koreans will play Japan, which
overcame a six-run deficit and beat Taiwan 9-8. With two outs and a
3-and-2 count, Teimii Keenan capped a five-run sixth by doubling
home two runs.
	   South Korea didn't need Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho
against the relatively inexperienced Chinese. Kim Won-hyong gave up
two second-inning runs and three hits before Kim Byung-hyun came on
and didn't allow a man on base. He struck out the first eight
batters he faced.
	   The Koreans scored one run in the first and went ahead to stay,
3-2, on Park Jae-hong's first homer of the game in the third, after
Park Han-yi had doubled.
	   Lee Byung-kyu and Park Jae-hong both homered in the fourth,
putting Korea up 5-2.
	   Back-to-back home runs in the fifth by Back Jae-ho and Shim
Jae-hak increased Korea's margin to 7-2.
	   In the eighth, Korean leadoff batter Lee Byung-kyu reached first
on a passed ball third strike, moved to second and third on
consecutive ground-outs, and scored on a double by Kim Dong-joo.
Kang Hyuk doubled home Kim for the final 9-2.
	   Chinese pitcher Ye Mingqiang yielded seven runs on 10 hits _
including five home runs _ in 4 1/3 innings, taking the loss, and
Wang Zhanpeng gave up two runs on four hits over the last 3 2/3.
	   China had topped the Pool B competition with lopsided victories
against the Philippines and Thailand. Korea finished atop Pool A,
with Japan second.
	   Against Japan, Taiwan scored five runs in the first inning on
home runs by Chen Chih-yuan and Chen Chin-feng, an error, a double
by Tseng Chih-chen and a single by Yang Sun-hsuan.
	   Japan cut the deficit to 5-1 in the third when Tomohiro Iizuka
singled after Kenji Takahashi's two-out double.
	   But Taiwan went ahead 7-1 in the top of the fourth. Chen
Chih-yuan's second homer of the game followed Huang Chung-yi's
double.
	   Japan scored two runs in the bottom of the inning on singles by
Yoshihito uenaka and Mitsutaka Goto and a double by Yoshihiko
Kajiyama.
	   In the fifth, Japan answered Chen Chin-feng's second homer with
a run on a wild pitch, putting the score at 8-4.
	   Then, in the sixth, Japan had its five-run inning on a walk,
singles by Shinnosuke Abe, Goto, Koji Okumura and Takahashi, and
doubles by Iizuka and Keenan.
	   Three Taiwan pitchers yielded a total of 15 hits, while four
Japanese pitchers gave up 12 hits.
	   Tsao Chun-yang, who gave up Keenan's double, took the loss.
Naoyuki Tateishi, who pitched four innings in relief, was the
winner.

Jospin asks rioting youths to have faith in justice system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with protest in Toulouse, brother saying family will
file complaint, other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Tuesday appealed to
Toulouse youths, angered by the death of their friend by police
gunfire, to have faith in the country's justice system.
	   Jospin spoke after youths rampaged for a second night Monday in
a working-class neighborhood of Toulouse, in the southwest of
France, protesting the weekend killing of a 17-year-old named
Habib. His family name has not been released.
	   Jospin said the interim interior minister, Jean-Jack Queyranne,
has ``the impression that things did not happen as they should
have'' when the youth was shot by police trying to stop him from
stealing a BMW before dawn Sunday.
	   The officers contend the shooting was accidental.
	   ``The police have a very difficult job,'' Jospin said in a
television interview. ``They must make people respect the law,
which applies to everyone. But clearly they must use judgment.''
	   In a more peaceful protest Tuesday afternoon, more than 300
youths marched silently through Toulouse in memory of Habib.
	   Under a banner reading ``Where is justice? No more police
brutality,'' Habib's older brother led the march.
	   The family planned to file a complaint against police Tuesday
afternoon for involuntary homicide and non-assistance to a person
in danger.
	   Jospin said the angry Toulouse youths should take comfort from
the fact that two policemen involved in the shooting have been
detained for questioning, and the head of the police unit has been
suspended.
	   Le Monde newspaper reported Tuesday that an autopsy shows it was
a bullet from the unit head's gun that killed Habib.
	   The riots in Toulouse were the latest outbreak of violence
stemming from tension between French police and disaffected youths
from poor immigrant families.
	   On Sunday, at least 150 police faced off against up to 200
youths in a working-class district where unemployment has reached
35 percent. Angry youths threw stones and firebombs at security
forces and the clashes resumed late Monday.
	   Authorities were also searching for the youth's accomplice in
the attempted car theft.

Report: Deutsche Bank forms new unit for industrial holdings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ For tax purposes, Deutsche Bank plans
to form a separate unit for its industrial holdings, which are
worth more than 40 billion marks (dlrs 24 billion), according a
German magazine report released Tuesday.
	   The holdings include Deutsche Bank's 12 percent stake in
DaimlerChrysler, its 9.4 percent stake in Allianz insurance and its
10 percent stake in Muenchener Rueckversicherungs, also an
insurance company, according to the monthly ManagerMagazin.
	   The magazine said the new unit would allow Deutsche Bank
eventually to sell industrial stakes without paying taxes on the
extraordinary profit that would result from the sale.
	   A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the report
because he had not seen it.
	   Analysts noted that Deutsche Bank has been looking for years for
a tax-friendly way to sell its industrial holdings but said they
doubted the new unit alone could solve the problem.
	   Board members have made clear they want to reduce the bank's
hefty stakes in other German companies that are not of strategic
interest. The taxes Deutsche Bank would have to pay on the sale of
such items have been the biggest hindrance, analysts noted.
	   When Deutsche Bank announced plans to take over Bankers Trust
late last month, the market focused on whether it would dispose of
some industrial holdings to finance the deal and whether this could
be done in a tax-efficient manner.
	   The merger would create the world's largest financial
institution. With assets of more than dlrs 800 billion, the
combined bank would surpass UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the
No. 1 bank, and the recently formed Citigroup Inc.

Ukraine's president calls for referendum on amending constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma called
Tuesday for a nationwide referendum to amend the country's
constitution to prolong the president's powers to change economic
legislation.
	   Ukraine's 1996 constitution endowed the president with the
authority to issue decrees on subjects not covered by other
legislation, but only until July next year.
	   Kuchma said he ``saw no other way out'' but to conduct a
plebiscite on extending that right by another five years.
	   Kuchma used this right extensively last summer, issuing dozens
of decrees that changed tax and banking legislation or provided
support for private businesses.
	   However, he has often complained of insufficient powers to stop
the economy from declining, and blamed the government's chronic
failure to implement free-market reforms on parliament's
unwillingness to cooperate.
	   Speaking to representatives of regional newspapers in Kiev,
Kuchma said Tuesday that the situation could be changed if his
proposed referendum also approved a new bicameral legislature in
Ukraine.
	   Such a parliament, similar to Russia's, would have not only a
lower chamber of popularly elected representatives, as Ukraine does
now, but would also have an upper chamber of representatives from
the regions.
	   Kuchma said the presence of regional officials in parliament
would make it abide by ``economic'' rather than ``political''
interests.
	   Ukraine's constitution allows the president to call a
referendum, though it's unclear on whether he needs voters'
signatures to do so. Kuchma would also need to issue a formal
decree announcing the referendum before it could take place.

Netanyahu irked by Clinton remark on children of Arab prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berger, Albright comments, more background. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
sharply rebuked U.S. President Bill Clinton's emotional statements
about the plight of children of jailed Palestinians and slain
Israelis. He said Tuesday that Clinton drew an unfair parallel
``between the murderers and their victims.''
	   In an interview, the Israeli leader accused Clinton of a lack of
balnce in his comments, and the controversy quicklky mushroomed
into a debate in Israeli media with victims of terrorism venting
their anger.
	   ``There's a world of difference between the children of the
murderers who are in jail and the children of those who are
murdered,'' said Netanyahu. ``These murderers, some of them
murdered children.
	   ``The last thing we should do is make any parallelism between
the murderers and their victims,'' said Netanyahu, sitting in the
Cabinet room of the prime ministry.
	   Clinton national security adviser Sandy Berger said Tuesday that
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon raised Clinton's metaphor in
a friendly way during a meeting in Gaza, but he said Netanyahu did
not mention it.
	   Netanyahu told a news conference the issue had come up at his
meeting with Clinton and Yasser Arafat at Erez Crossing, a
checkpoint on the Gaza border. He cited it as one of his
``differences of opinion'' with Clinton.
	   ``We don't agree to the balance, the comparison,'' Netanyahu
told reporters. ``I don't know what the president meant by it, but
it came out as though there's a comparison between the suffering of
the children of the murderers and the children of those who were
murdered.''
	   On Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Clinton
was merely trying to show that both sets of children are feeling
pain, ``and the fact that there were tears by both groups of
children.''
	   ``In no way did he draw any parallel about the cause of the
pain,'' Albright said. ``The president has made very clear that
there is no room for terrorism or murder.''

Pope urges respect of human rights for peace in new millennium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Tuesday urged nations
to fully respect human rights, saying it would assure a ``culture
of peace'' in the new millennium.
	   ``The new millennium is close at hand, and its approach has
filled the hearts of many with hope for a more just and fraternal
world,'' the pope said in message issued for the Roman Catholic
church's World Day of Peace, which it marks Jan. 1.
	   ``This is an aspiration which can, and indeed must, become
reality.''
	   The pope recalled that 1998 marked the 50th anniversary of the
U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the most
comprehensive and widely recognized international standard for the
protection of human rights.
	   ``The culture of human rights cannot fail to be a culture of
peace,'' he said. ``But when human rights are ignored or scorned,
or when the pursuit of individual interests unjustly prevails over
the common good, then the seeds of instability, rebellion and
violence are inevitably sown.''
	   The message highlighted the right to life, including a reference
to the church's condemnation of abortion.
	   ``A genuine culture of life, just as it guarantees to the unborn
the right to come into the world, in the same way protects the
newly born, especially girls, from the crime of infanticide,'' the
pope said.
	   He said the recent developments in the field of genetic
engineering presented a ``profoundly disquieting challenge,'' that
needed to be accompanied by ``careful ethical reflection.''
	   The pope also urged states to permit citizens to freely choose
and practice their religion.

Detonations near Kosovo border send villagers away in fear
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned

<TEXT>
	   KUSNIN, Yugoslavia (AP) - Residents evacuated a Kosovo border
village Tuesday after detonations and shooting were heard from a
sealed-off area where Yugoslav border guards killed dozens of
ethnic Albanian rebels the previous day.
	   ``Nothing good is happening,'' said Mon Morina, 61, who was
waiting for a bus to take his family from the village, 6 kilometers
(4 miles) from the border to neighboring Albania.
	   Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles and at
least one helicopter into the remote area Tuesday and continued
barring anyone from entering.
	   ``The sound of shooting is frequent here, but today it is
heavy,'' Morina said, gesturing to the settlement of Ljubizda,
across the mountainside, as occasional detonations boomed in the
distance.
	   Much of Kusnin's population of 2,000 left Monday out of fear
violence would spread to their village, and other families were
leaving Tuesday.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said it appeared the
army was following up on Monday's pre-dawn border clash with a
group authorities said was trying to smuggle arms in from Albania.
He said denying the verifiers access violated the October agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and a formal
protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.

China wins volleyball double

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China won double gold in the Asian
Games volleyball competition Tuesday, beating arch-rivals South
Korea in both finals.
	   It was the fourth time China won both golds in the same Asian
Games, following dual victories in 1982, 1986 and 1990.
	   China's women's team avenged its loss to the Koreans in the
world championship last month and the 1994 Asian Games final. The
men's team also scored a four-set victory.
	   China's women's team coach Lang Ping said her team had to battle
hard to win its match 15-6, 13-15, 15-8, 15-13.
	   ``The South Korean team is great in controlling the rhythm,''
Lang said. ``But our players also made the best performance.''
	   ``We met our expectation,'' said Lang, who was famous member of
the Chinese team when it took five successive titles in World
Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games in the 1980s.
	   Chinese veteran player Lawen Lai said Korea had been a tough
opponent.
	   ``Korea in many ways has skill placing above the Chinese,
they're quicker and defensively they're better,'' Lawen said.	   
	   Both teams started with a defensive setup to counter the strong
crosscourt attack of their rivals.
	   In the third place playoff, Japan beat host Thailand for the
bronze medal.
	   The Chinese men's team won its final 15-7, 15-11, 10-15, 15-9.
	   China dominated with its strong defensive block and they often
brought three players into a blocking position.
	   Head coach Wang Jiawei, also a former star player, said the win
was the start of big things for his team.
	   ``We will march on, march on to the world,'' Wang said.
	   In the bronze medal match Taiwan defeated defending champion
Japan 3-2.

Sacking of senior Turkish narcotics agent sparks controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A senior narcotics official, sacked on
charges of ties to organized crime, fired back Tuesday accusing his
superiors of taking millions of dollars in bribes from drug barons
to have him removed.
	   The case is the latest of a series alleging ties between state
officials and mobsters.
	   Istanbul's former chief of narcotics, Ferruh Tankus, said senior
police officials fired him Monday after receiving dlrs 4 million in
kickbacks from drug gangs who he claimed were suffering from his
actions.
	   Istanbul Gov. Erol Cakir denied Tankus' accusations. He said the
police chief had been removed because there was an ongoing probe
into allegations that he had close ties to criminal gangs.
	   Several policemen have been sacked over allegations of similar
ties over the past two years since a scandal sparked by a car crash
revealed that state officials entertained close relations with
mobsters. A fugitive terrorist, a police chief and a deputy were
all riding in the same car.
	   The wave of scandals has led to the trial of two deputies,
including a former interior minister, and caused the collapse of
the government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz last month.
	   Turkey is a transit point for drugs moving from Afghanistan to
Europe and North America.

WW II concentration camp commander indicted for war crimes

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dinko Sakic, a commander of Croatia's
most notorious World War II concentration camp, was indicted
Tuesday for war crimes against civilians.
	   The indictment charged that Sakic, 76, ``by his acts, caused the
deaths of more than 2,000 people'' in Jasenovac during part of
1944, when he ran the camp, thereby committing crimes against
humanity and breaking international law, the state-run HINA news
agency reported.
	   Sakic is accused of ``maltreating, torturing and killing
detainees'' and of allowing his subordinates to do the same,
leading to more than 2,000 deaths between April and November 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed in
Jasenovac, as the World War II Croatian state was implementing
racist and Nazi laws, the indictment said.
	   District attorney Radovan Santek requested that Sakic stay in
custody until the trial. No date for the trial has yet been set. If
convicted, he faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
	   Sakic has been in prison in Zagreb since June, when he was
extradited from Argentina. He had previously lived there peacefully
since the end of the World War II, after the wartime Croatian Nazi
puppet state was crushed.
	   Sakic's arrest followed an interview he gave in April to an
Argentine television station, in which he admitted running
Jasenovac, but claimed that ``nothing happened there.''
	   The number of Jasenovac victims _ Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
antifascist Croats _ has never been ascertained. Serbs, the
majority of victims, claimed that 700,000 people were slaughtered
there. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman had put the number at
60,000, while the United States Justice Department said more than
120,000 people died there.
	   The indictment, drawn up after 46 Jasenovac survivors and
historians were heard, said that a total of 49,000 people were
killed during the four-year-long existence of the camp _ a figure
sure to be criticized by Serbs as being too low.
	   Croats have difficulties dealing with the fact that some of
their compatriots participated in the mass murders.
	   Croatia requested Sakic's extradition and based the indictment
on a four-month-long criminal investigation. The district attorney
said he also used files provided to him by the U.S. Government,
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and the Yugoslav justice department.
	   Sakic's wife, Nada, was also extradited from Argentina, in
November. She is suspected of committing crimes against civilians
in the female block of the Jasenovac camp but has not yet been
charged.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying that obstacles must be overcome before
the men are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial. It ``means that they
will hand over the suspects sooner rather than later,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``It looks like they've made a clear decision, but we don't know
if this is the final line or what the time scale is,'' he added.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.

Tokyoites vent anger, frustrations at annual screaming contest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cacophony reigned more supreme than usual in
central Tokyo Tuesday, as dozens of people screeched and bellowed
in a contest that had but a single rule: to be as loud as possible.
	   Pent-up frustrations at Japan's recession, the anguish of
breaking up, and hostility toward littering smokers all found
release as contestants screamed messages into a decibel gauge at
the 18th annual ``Big Voice'' competition.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was the target of many of
the vocal assaults.
	   ``Heeey Obuchi, you listening? ...Abolish that consumption tax,
got it?'' belted out contestant No. 5 _ 64-year-old Kinshiro Toyama
_ whose deep baritone suddenly cracked into a falsetto.
	   Another contestant, wearing a pink fuzzy sweater, appeared to
bid a bittersweet farewell to a partner.
	   ``Yodogawa-san! Sayonara! Sayonara! Sayonara......'' she
screeched tragically.
	   Contestants were so enthusiastic many may even have been
breaking the law. Tokyo has an ordinance limiting the sound level
at public gathering to 85 decibels. The leading contenders all
registered above 100.
	   Hundreds of spectators turned up to cheer the shouters in
Tokyo's bustling Shinjuku district. The event was sponsored by
breath-mint maker Halls.
	   Tuesday's champion, 24-year-old company worker Mamiko Kobayashi,
also scored points for diplomatic finesse. Her scream was addressed
to Taiwan's president: ``Cheer up, Lee Teng-Hui!'' she yodeled.
	   Kobayashi triumphed with a decibel count of 111.6. She was
awarded the top prize of 100,000 yen (dlrs 850).

	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ A 74,000-ton cruise ship struck
a Caribbean reef and started taking on water early Tuesday, forcing
the evacuation more than 2,500 tourists, the company said.
	   ``The fortunate thing is that no one was hurt,'' Royal Caribbean
International spokesman Rich Steck said from a hotel on the island.
	   Fishermen and boat owners helped ferry the 2,557 passengers off
the Monarch of the Seas. It took about four hours, Steck said.
	   ``It was quite a drama this morning,'' said hotel auditor
Nicolaas Martina, who watched the rescue from the Holland House
Beach Hotel overlooking Great Bay on the Dutch side of the island.
The other side is the French territory of St. Martin.
	   The Monarch of the Seas ran aground near the harbor pier before
dawn.
	   Steck said the ship, with 831 crew, was on its way from St.
Thomas to Martinique when a passenger developed a heart problem and
the captain diverted to St. Maarten to drop the patient off.
	   As the ship was leaving the island, it struck a reef and began
to take on water in the forward compartments. ``It wasn't sinking
or anything but we decided the best thing to do was to run the ship
aground on purpose, to get it on soft sand in the harbor,'' Steck
said.
	   Crew members were offloading passengers' luggage late Tuesday
morning and the company was arranging to fly the tourists home, he
added.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew planned to survey the area
later Tuesday to determine whether there was any threat of
pollution from the ship, Petty Officer Alberto Torres said in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, which is west of St. Maarten.
	   The 6-year-old Monarch picks up passengers in San Juan and
cruises the southern Caribbean.

Fired Ajax coach blames De Boer twins for his sacking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Morten Olsen launched a bitter
verbal attack Tuesday on Frank and Ronald de Boer, blaming them for
creating the bad team atmosphere which led to his sacking as Ajax
Amsterdam's coach.
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since he was fired
Saturday, the 49-year-old Dane said the dispute between the club
and Dutch internationals Frank and Ronald de Boer ``totally
destroyed the team's dynamic.''
	   The De Boers went on strike for the opening games of this season
in a contract dispute with the Amsterdam club. Both brothers wanted
to leave, but Ajax would not release them from their contracts. The
twins also publicly accused Olsen of running boring training
sessions.
	   ``When I read that sentence, I knew we wouldn't get through this
season without problems,'' Olsen said at a press conference at
Ajax's Arena stadium, Amsterdam evening daily Het Parool reported.
	   ``This is wrong, I realized. A trainer who won everything
domestically last season earns respect until the first match of the
next season.''
	   In the 1997-98 season, Olsen's first year in charge after taking
over from Louis van Gaal, Ajax won the domestic league and cup
double, earning a place in the lucrative Champions League.
	   But this season the storied club's performance has veered from
bad to worse, culminating in last week's humiliating 3-0 defeat by
FC Porto which meant Ajax finished bottom of Champions League Group
A and out of the competition it has won four times.
	   Reserve team coach Jan Wouters has already replaced Olsen. Ajax
played out a disappointing 0-0 draw with SC Heerenveen Sunday in
Wouters' first match in charge.
	   Belgian club Anderlecht reportedly is interested in signing
Olsen.
	   Olsen accused the De Boer twins of undermining his
responsibility and effectively curtailing his managerial career at
Ajax.
	   ``How can you claim to be in charge when two important players
call you a boring trainer, a boring tactician?,'' Olsen asked
himself. ``My next mistake was that I didn't send them packing.''

Holbrooke in Serbia amid new tensions in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with border area tense, sounds of artillery fire.

 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia on Tuesday to try to revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   Detonations heard near the border area with Albania _ site of
the most bloody clash Monday _ indicated fighting was continuing
into a second day.
	   Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way deter
the international community to carry out its obligations'' to work
for peace in the troubled province.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived in Kosovo, where he met
William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming Kosovo
Verification Mission and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Later Tuesday, Holbrooke was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to ``emphasize the need to move ahead
expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order is
still in place'' and that peace ``progress must be made because we
are concerned that the fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gun battle near the
border with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off area where Yugoslav border guards killed dozens of
ethnic Albanian rebels the previous day.
	   Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles and
at least one helicopter into the remote area Tuesday and continued
barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said it appeared the
army was following up on Monday's pre-dawn border clash with a
group authorities said was trying to smuggle arms in from Albania.
He said denying the verifiers access violated the October agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and a formal
protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   Holbrooke said ``yesterday was not a good day'' in Kosovo, but
added: ``We are determined to continue our effort ... We want to
tell all the people involved (in fighting) that they are playing
with dynamite.''
	   Walker, who leads the team aimed at ensuring the peace agreement
is respected, condemned Monday's violence ``in the strongest
terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.''
	   In Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified assailants opened fire
Monday night in a Serb-run bar, killing four Serbs and wounding
five others. Two of the wounded died later, Serbian sources said
Tuesday.
	   All the sources spoke on condition they not be named.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two masked
``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with
automatic weapons fire.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 peace agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's state broadcaster RAI on Tuesday signed a
memorandum of understanding with France's pay-television Canal Plus
for the creation of a digital TV platform, RAI officials said.
	   RAI's accord with Canal Plus seemed to confirm reports that the
Italian broadcaster would be a partner in the digital TV unit
Stream, along with Telecom Italia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
	   According to Italian news reports, Telecom Italia and News Corp.
are close to an agreement which would see Telecom lower its stake
in Stream from 100 percent to somewhere between 15 to 20 percent.
	   This would allow Murdoch, and French broadcaster TF1, to join
the Stream venture, with their stakes totaling no more than 49
percent, the reports said.
	   The Italian government has repeatedly expressed concern over the
possibility that Murdoch, or another foreign company, could gain
control of an Italian TV group.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
on Tuesday said they had dealt a major blow to government efforts
to recapture southeastern Congo when they killed 45 Zimbabwean
soldiers and two senior commanders. One gunnery sergeant was
reported captured.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda said Zimbabwe, the main ally of Congolese
President Laurent Kabila, lost operations commander Col. Kufa and
squadron commander Lt. Col. Herbert Funi Fudler when Congolese
government forces and their allies on Monday tried to retake
Kabalo, a rebel-held Congo River port, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
southeast of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   A Zimbabwean gunner identified as Sgt. Edison was taken
prisoner, the radio said.
	   Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said 45 Zimbabwean soldiers
were killed and two helicopter gunships and tanks were destroyed
during a five-hour government assault across the Nzofu Bridge,
which guards entrance to Kabalo, 14 kilometers (8 miles) from the
town.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
	   In Zimbabwe, military officials reported losing one helicopter
gunship and an unspecified number of troops in fighting for Kabalo,
a staging point for the rebel advance into mineral-rich Katanga
Province and the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi in neighboring
Eastern Kasai Province.
	   The rebel coalition of ethnic Congolese Tutsis, disaffected
soldiers and opposition politicians took up arms Aug. 2 against
Kabila, accusing him of misrule, corruption and ethnic
war-mongering.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and arms to
support Kabila. So far, their counteroffensive has slowed down but
not stopped the rebels, who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   International efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed over
Kabila's persistent refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels,
whom he accuses of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   On Tuesday, Rwandan officials said they will participate in
another round of talks on the Congo situation sponsored by the
Organization of African Unity Thursday and Friday in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, but said they expected no results.
	   Wamba said he will also attend the conference.
	   In an apparent lead-in to the Ouagadougou meeting, Congolese
Ambassador Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza told reporters in Nairobi, Kenya
Tuesday that the rebels were nothing more than a front for a
Rwandan Tutsi plan to take over central and eastern Africa.
	   ``The Tutsis believe that, like Hitler's dream in 1940, they can
dominate the Central and East Africa. They are encouraged by the
Americans,'' he said. ``The Congolese people are not stupid...
there is already an anti-American feeling in Congo.''
	   Tutsis are a minority in Rwanda but control the government and
the army since Tutsi rebels overthrew the majority Hutu government
in July 1994, putting an end to the government-orchestrated
slaughter of more than half a million Tutsis.
	   Wamba rejected the accusations as false, and instead called for
Wa-Ku Mwanza to be prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the
persecution in 1992 of natives of Kasai living in Katanga where he
served as a governor. Thousands were killed or expelled from their
homes in politically motived attacks.
	   ``The National Conference in 1992 identified him as a leader of
the massacres,'' Wamba said of the all-party conference that
restored political parties previously banned by former dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Meanwhile, Angolan troops who helped fend off Congolese rebel
attacks on Kinshasa in August were continuing to withdraw from the
Atlantic airbase at Kitona and from Mbuji-Mayi, said Rwandan
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The pullout of at least 1,000 Angolans was apparently in
response to attacks by UNITA rebels on the government-held towns of
Cuito and Huambo in the central Angolan highlands.
	   The redeployment of Angolan troops to the home front could
seriously undermine Kinshasa's efforts to keep up the pressure on
the Congolese rebels.

Greek picks Swedish-Brazil surveillance aircraft

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Turning its back on U.S. military
contractors, Greece awarded a dlrs 570 million contract Tuesday for
Swedish-Brazilian surveillance aircraft.
	   The four-plane order marks the first major foreign military
contract for the Erieye radar system of Sweden's telecommunications
giant Telefon AB LM Ericsson. The equipment is fitted onto an
EMB-145 aircraft built by the Brazilian manufacturer Embraer.
	   The French firm, Thomson-CSF, will supply some of the
electronics.
	   The deal was a blow for U.S. contractors seeking another piece
of the nation's dlrs 24 billion arms modernization program aimed at
keeping pace with regional rival Turkey.
	   The United States traditionally has been the main military
supplier of both Greece and Turkey.
	   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s C-130J and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s E-2C
Hawkeye 2000 were considered for the radar plane contract. But a
prototype of the Ericsson system was rated best in a preliminary
evaluation by Greek military officials, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Greece's defense minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said Ericsson
``made the best proposal.''
	   Reflecting the keen U.S. interest in securing the contract,
American Ambassador Nicholas Burns used a visit by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to make a last-minute pitch to Tzochatzopoulos
late Monday.
	   The Erieye Doppler radar system, with a range of about 350
kilometers (210 miles), is presently used by the Swedish military
but not on the EMB-145 jet, said Henrik Bremer, a spokesman for
Ericsson Microwave Systems.
	   A system similar to the Greek order is being fitted by Brazil
for surveillance of the Amazon River region.
	   Greece expects the first aircraft to be delivered in early 2002.
It will use a training model in the meantime.
	   The radar plane deal is the second big contract by Greek
military planners since the arms modernization program was
announced last year.
	   In October, Greece awarded dlrs 1.2 billion contract for
U.S.-made Patriot missiles.
	   The next large acquisition, expected as early as next month,
will be an estimated dlrs 3.5 billion for fighter jets.
	   The United States is pushing Lockheed Martin's F-16 and the
F-15E, made by Boeing Co. Also in the running are France's Mirage
2000, Russia's Su-27 and the Eurofighter, a joint project of four
European nations.
	   U.S. officials are also lobbying Greece for naval and army
contracts, including the M1-A2 Abrams battle tank.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Featherweight Somluck Kamsing,
Thailand's only Olympic boxing gold medalist, advanced to the Asian
Games finals Tuesday with a lopsided victory over Japan's Norihisa
Tomimoto.
	   His victory and one by flyweight Pramuansak Phosuwan put five
Thai fighters in the finals.
	   Uzbekistan has seven finalists after three won Tuesday, and
Kazakstan has four after two more victories.
	   Also advancing Tuesday were two Indonesians, two South Koreans
and an Iranian. They will join an Indian, a Chinese and a Pakistani
boxer in the finals.
	   Somluck initially took his time picking his shots to counter
Tomimoto's punches. By the end of the third round, he was in
control with superior footwork and hand speed. He won 16-2.
	   For the gold, he will meet Uzbekistan's Tulkanbav Turgunov who
went toe-to-toe with Filipino Eric Canoy for nearly the entire
five-round fight in a 15-7 victory.
	   Pramuansak bothered with South Korea's Choi Jin-woo with double
hooks and right straights in a 15-3 victory.
	   He next meets Indonesia's Hermensen Ballo, an 11-3 winner over
Pakistan's Haider-Ali Haider.
	   World No. 1-ranking light-welterweight Miham Mahamotkadir
Abdullaev of Uzbekistan outpunched Thailand's Prinya
Hrianthuanthong 15-2. The Thai used his reach to keep Abdullaev at
a distance in the early round, but the fight turned into a
crowd-pleasing heavy exchange of blows by the middle of the third
round.
	   Abdullaev will meet Indonesia's Wellem Papilaya, who beat
Mongolia's Densmaa Enkhsaikhan 58-34 with effective use of straight
blows to the head.
	   In light middleweight, Kazakstan's Yermankhan Ibraimov defeated
Thailand's Komkrit Nanakon when the referee stopped the fight with
1:39 minute left in the third round after Komkrit was knocked down.
	   Ibraimov will meet South Korea's Im Jung-bin who defeated
Mongolia's Batmunkh when the referee stopped the fight in the
middle of the fifth and final round.
	   Uzbekistan's light heavyweight Sergey Mihaylov defeated India's
Gurcharan Singh 13-5, advancing to a gold medal bout with South
Korean Lee Seung-bae, who defeated Pakistan's Shaukat-ali Shaukat
12-3.
	   In an all-out brawl in the super heavyweight division,
Kazakstan's M. Dildabekov defeated Uzbekistan's Lazizbek Zokirov
9-5.
	   His foe will be Iran's M. Samadi, who defeated Pakistan's S.
Shahid 15-8.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke arrived in Serbia on Tuesday to try to revive the stalled
Kosovo peace process, a day after the deadliest clashes in months
in the province claimed at least 37 lives.
	   Detonations heard near the border area with Albania _ site of
the most bloody clash Monday _ indicated fighting was continuing
into a second day.
	   Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way deter
the international community to carry out its obligations'' to work
for peace in the troubled province.
	   According to Serb sources in Kosovo, two of five people wounded
in a ``terrorist attack'' on a bar in western Kosovo city of Pec
late Monday died overnight. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The news came as the U.S. envoy arrived in Kosovo, where he met
William Walker, head of the OSCE's still-forming mission to verify
terms of the Kosovo peace process, and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Later Tuesday, Holbrooke was to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade to ``emphasize the need to move ahead
expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department
said Monday.
	   Holbrooke and Milosevic brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end
the fighting in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to work out an agreement on the future of the province,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order is
still in place'' and that peace ``progress must be made because we
are concerned that the fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, however, appear stalled, raising
fears that the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, the pro-government Serb Media
Center said Yugoslav troops killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists
and wounded a dozen others in a five-hour gun battle near the
border with Albania, which the guerrillas use as a sanctuary.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off area where Yugoslav border guards killed dozens of
ethnic Albanian rebels the previous day.
	   Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles and
at least one helicopter into the remote area Tuesday and continued
barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said it appeared the
army was following up on Monday's pre-dawn border clash with a
group authorities said was trying to smuggle arms in from Albania.
He said denying the verifiers access violated the October agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and that a formal
protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   Holbrooke said ``yesterday was not a good day'' in Kosovo, but
added: ``We are determined to continue our effort ... We want to
tell all the people involved (in fighting) that they are playing
with dynamite.''
	   Walker, who leads the team aimed at ensuring the peace agreement
is respected, condemned Monday's violence ``in the strongest
terms.''
	   The clash, he said, ``can only lead to a spiral of retribution
that will stand in the way of a reasonable political solution much
needed in this region.''
	   In a statement issued shortly before midnight from Belgrade and
distributed in Kosovo, he called on both sides to ``show restraint
and remain calm in this difficult time.''
	   In Pec, OSCE sources said unidentified assailants opened fire
Monday night in a Serb-run bar, killing four Serbs and wounding
five others. Two of the wounded died later, Serbian sources said
Tuesday.
	   All the sources spoke on condition they not be named.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said two masked
``terrorists,'' using the authorities' term for the Albanian
rebels, entered the bar about 8 p.m. and ``sprayed the bar'' with
automatic weapons fire.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 peace agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   After two months of failed shuttle diplomacy, chances of
mediating an end to the continuing violence in Kosovo seem
unlikely.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule, while the rebels say they won't
accept anything short of independence. Serbia, meanwhile, refuses
to consider anything more than partial autonomy for the
Albanian-majority province.

German Holocaust museum plan triggers wave of criticism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A German Jewish leader Tuesday rejected a
new government proposal to build a Holocaust museum in Berlin
instead of a long-debated national memorial for the Jews killed by
the Nazis.
	   ``This proposal sets back the debate for years and points it in
the wrong direction,'' said Michel Friedman, board member of the
Central Council of Jews in Germany.
	   The museum plan was unveiled Monday by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's culture minister. The government feels a monument isn't
educational enough and would indicate that Germans are treating the
Holocaust as history instead of keeping its memory alive.
	   Friedman insisted a memorial was the more powerful form of
remembrance. The government was proposing a ``variety store'' that
``ultimately lacks content,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   The plan calls for building a Holocaust museum, research center
and park on a plot in central Berlin that was set aside by the
previous government of Helmut Kohl for a giant sculpture.
	   A lawmaker from the Greens party, Schroeder's junior government
partner, also called the new plans unconvincing.
	   ``A well-conceived monument grabs people,'' Volker Beck said.
``The Vietnam Memorial in Washington is an example.''
	   Wolfgang Benz, head of an anti-Semitism research center at
Berlin Technical University, also questioned whether Germany needs
a Holocaust museum.
	   The money would be better spent preserving former concentration
camps that already help educate Germans about the Holocaust, he
said on German radio.
	   By reopening a decade-old debate, Schroeder showed how hard it
is for German politicians and intellectuals to agree on how to
commemorate the killing of 6 million Jews.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,700
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Kohl was the project's biggest backer. But Schroeder, a Social
Democrat who defeated Kohl in September elections, has expressed
doubts about the monument. Parliament is to decide how to proceed
next year.

Police arrest five, seize heroin

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Police detained five people and seized 31
kilograms (68 pounds) of heroin in recent days to break up an
international drug ring, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   It was the largest heroin haul by police in Poland this year.
	   The suspects included two people from Poland, two from Belarus
and one from Azerbaijan. All were charged with drug trafficking
along the so-called Balkan route from Afghanistan and Turkey via
Poland to Germany, national police spokesman Pawel Biedziak said.
	   Two of the suspects, who were not identified by name, were
charged with smuggling 29.5 kilograms (65 pounds) of heroin in
their luggage. The heroin was found on a Turkish tourist bus, said
police, who only would say the arrests occurred in ``the last few
days.''
	   Another suspect, carrying 1.5 kilograms (three pounds) of
heroin, was detained in Warsaw, while two Poles, charged with
organizing the ring that smuggled heroin, hashish and marijuana,
were apprehended in the southern city of Krakow, according to
police.
	   Since the toppling of communist rule in 1989 and the opening of
Poland's borders, the country has become a center of drug
production and a major transit route for illegal drugs sold in
western Europe.
	   Last year, police reported more than 4,300 drug trafficking
cases, compared to 400 in 1994.

Egyptian excavations reveal possible earliest human writing

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German archaeologist said Tuesday that he
has found what could be the earliest known human writing _ records
of linen and oil deliveries made about 5,300 years ago during the
reign of a king named Scorpion in southern Egypt.
	   The discovery throws open for debate a widely held belief among
historians that the first people to write were the Sumerians of the
Mesopotamian civilization sometime before 3000 B.C., or 5,000 years
ago.
	   While the exact date of the development of Sumerian writing
remains in doubt, the Egyptian discoveries are carbon dated with
certainty to between 3300 B.C. and 3200 B.C., said Gunter Dreyer,
head of the German Archaeological Institute.
	   The writings _ line drawings of animals, plants and mountains _
are the first evidence that hieroglyphics used later by Pharaonic
dynasties did not ``rise as Phoenix from the ashes'' but developed
gradually, Dreyer said. ``Linguists now have a larger history to
regard.''
	   An American archaeologist called it an ``exciting'' find.
	   ``This would be one of the greatest discoveries in history of
writing and ancient Egyptian culture,'' Kent Weeks, professor of
Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, told The Associated
Press.
	   Describing Dreyer as a ``very meticulous scholar,'' Weeks said
the archaeologist would not have disclosed his findings without
being ``absolutely certain.''
	   The bulk of Dreyer's discovery was from the tomb of a king
called Scorpion in a cemetery in the Suhag province, 500 kilometers
(300 miles) south of Cairo.
	   Kings in pre-Pharaonic times used to take names of animals and
many records have been found of chieftains named Mouse, Falcon,
Double Falcon and Elephant. The first Pharaonic dynasty began in
2920 B.C. with King Menes. The Great Pyramid was built nearly 400
years later.
	   Since 1985, Dreyer and his team have unearthed about 300 pieces
of written material on clay tablets barely bigger than postage
stamps and clay jars and vases bearing ink impressions.
	   Two-thirds of them have been deciphered as documentary records
of linen and oil delivered to King Scorpion I in taxes, as well as
short notes, numbers, lists of kings' names and names of
institutions.
	   Apart from the academic question of who came first, the Egyptian
writings indicate that the culture was far more developed than
previously thought, Dreyer said.
	   He said the first human writing was not a creative outpouring
but the result of economics: When chieftains expanded their areas
of control they needed to keep a record of taxes, which in those
days were paid in commodities.
	   Fish, the sign-word for delivery, appears on many tablets
against the names of settlements. For example, the city Ba-set was
written with the sign-word of a throne, known as Ba, and a stork,
called Set.
	   Although the writings are made up of symbols, they can be called
true writing because each symbol stands for a consonant and makes
up syllables _ Ju Gereh was the Mountain of Darkness, a reference
to its location in the west where the sun set.
	   ``In principle, they were able to express themselves clearly,''
Dreyer said.

Small but growing labor unrest hits Poland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Weary of never-ending economic reforms
that seem to always bring bad news, Polish workers have launched a
small but growing number of protests as Christmas approaches.
	   A sit-in by coal mine workers spread to 11 mines on Tuesday, and
protests over delayed or unpaid wages were continuing at two
defense industry companies. Another strike at a railway maintenance
factory also started this week.
	   While the number of workers involved is small _ fewer than 100
of the more than 200,000 coal miners are protesting _ union leaders
are trying to build a broader labor rebellion against government
policies.
	   Unions affiliated with the Solidarity movement that toppled
communist rule nine years ago organized the mine protest and
threatened a possible general strike. Another major labor group
with roots in the communist era, the All-Poland Trade Union
Alliance, called Monday for all unions to join together to force
the government to address labor concerns.
	   With the holiday season nearing, it was unclear if the protests
would amount to much more than attempted end-of-year intimidation
by labor groups. Christmas is among the holiest days in
predominantly Roman Catholic Poland, and no one expects miners to
spend it underground on strike.
	   Still, the protests show an increasing frustration among workers
over continued economic reforms that call for restructuring
bloated, inefficient sectors such as mining and defense as part of
Poland's drive to join the European Union early next century.
	   People who endured economic hardship under the shock therapy
reforms after communism appear fed up with continued bad news _
more state-owned companies being sold off and shut down _ without
realizing tangible improvements in their pocket books.
	   They also remember the communist era, when strikes were the lone
form of protest that managed to take root against repressive
security forces.
	   The government led by Solidarity's main political wing promises
talks on labor issues and says problems are blown out of
proportion, perhaps for political purposes.
	   ``There is no change without social unrest,'' deputy Finance
Minister Krzysztof Ners noted Tuesday. Asked about mine protests,
he said most miners accepted the need for restructuring and the
danger was in subverting the program before its completion, which
prolongs the short term pain.
	   Ners spoke at a news conference where the International Monetary
Fund endorsed Poland's proposed 1999 budget and tight spending
policies, both opposed by organized labor.
	   Unions complain their views are ignored when spending policy and
budget priorities get decided.
	   The main issue of the coal-mining strike is a proposed change in
the pension rules that would set retirement age limits at 65 for
men and 60 for women. Under current rules, miners working 25 years
are entitled to full pensions, and they say the dangerous working
conditions lower their life expectancy to less than the proposed
retirement age limits.
	   Miners also complain about restructuring plans that would cut
jobs by more than 40 percent _ from 245,000 now to 138,000 in three
years.

Small but growing labor unrest hits Poland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Weary of never-ending economic reforms
that seem to always bring bad news, Polish workers have launched a
small but growing number of protests as Christmas approaches.
	   A sit-in by coal mine workers spread to 11 mines on Tuesday, and
protests over delayed or unpaid wages were continuing at two
defense industry companies. Another strike at a railway maintenance
factory also started this week.
	   While the number of workers involved is small _ fewer than 100
of the more than 200,000 coal miners are protesting _ union leaders
are trying to build a broader labor rebellion against government
policies.
	   Unions affiliated with the Solidarity movement that toppled
communist rule nine years ago organized the mine protest and
threatened a possible general strike. Another major labor group
with roots in the communist era, the All-Poland Trade Union
Alliance, called Monday for all unions to join together to force
the government to address labor concerns.
	   With the holiday season nearing, it was unclear if the protests
would amount to much more than attempted end-of-year intimidation
by labor groups. Christmas is among the holiest days in
predominantly Roman Catholic Poland, and no one expects miners to
spend it underground on strike.
	   Still, the protests show an increasing frustration among workers
over continued economic reforms that call for restructuring
bloated, inefficient sectors such as mining and defense as part of
Poland's drive to join the European Union early next century.
	   People who endured economic hardship under the shock therapy
reforms after communism appear fed up with continued bad news _
more state-owned companies being sold off and shut down _ without
realizing tangible improvements in their pocket books.
	   They also remember the communist era, when strikes were the lone
form of protest that managed to take root against repressive
security forces.
	   The government led by Solidarity's main political wing promises
talks on labor issues and says problems are blown out of
proportion, perhaps for political purposes.
	   ``There is no change without social unrest,'' deputy Finance
Minister Krzysztof Ners noted Tuesday. Asked about mine protests,
he said most miners accepted the need for restructuring and the
danger was in subverting the program before its completion, which
prolongs the short term pain.
	   Ners spoke at a news conference where the International Monetary
Fund endorsed Poland's proposed 1999 budget and tight spending
policies, both opposed by organized labor.
	   Unions complain their views are ignored when spending policy and
budget priorities get decided.
	   The main issue of the coal-mining strike is a proposed change in
the pension rules that would set retirement age limits at 65 for
men and 60 for women. Under current rules, miners working 25 years
are entitled to full pensions, and they say the dangerous working
conditions lower their life expectancy to less than the proposed
retirement age limits.
	   Miners also complain about restructuring plans that would cut
jobs by more than 40 percent _ from 245,000 now to 138,000 in three
years.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korean riders Suh Jung-kyun and
Shin Chang-moo claimed the Asian Games individual dressage gold and
silver medals Tuesday.
	   Suh rode Any Call to 1,318 points, while Shin on Fiouricci came
in at 1,233.
	   Compatriot Choi Myung-jin riding Regal finished third at 1,217,
but because Asian Games rules forbid a country from sweeping all
the medals, officials said the bronze would go to Japan's Toshihide
Takechi on Vainqueur, who came in a point behind.
	   The results leave South Korea with two equestrian golds and a
silver, followed by Thailand and Japan with a gold, a silver and a
bronze each, then Malaysia with a silver and India with a bronze.

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
said Tuesday they had dealt a major blow to government efforts to
recapture southeastern Congo when they killed 45 Zimbabwean
soldiers and two of their senior commanders.
	   State-run Radio Rwanda said Zimbabwe, the main ally of Congolese
President Laurent Kabila, lost operations commander Col. Kufa and
squadron commander Lt. Col. Herbert Funi Fudler when Congolese
government forces and their allies tried to retake the rebel-held,
Congo River port of Kabalo.
	   A Zimbabwean gunner identified as Sgt. Edison was taken
prisoner, the radio said.
	   Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said 45 Zimbabwean soldiers
were killed and two helicopter gunships and tanks were destroyed
during a five-hour government assault across the Nzofu Bridge,
which guards entrance to Kabalo, 14 kilometers (eight miles) from
the town.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
	   In Zimbabwe, military officials reported losing one helicopter
gunship and an unspecified number of troops in fighting for Kabalo,
a staging point for the rebel advance into mineral-rich Katanga
Province and the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi in neighboring
Eastern Kasai Province.
	   The rebel coalition of ethnic Congolese Tutsis, disaffected
soldiers and opposition politicians took up arms Aug. 2 against
Kabila, accusing him of misrule, corruption and ethnic
war-mongering.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and arms to
support Kabila. So far, their counteroffensive has slowed down but
not stopped the rebels, who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   International efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed over
Kabila's persistent refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels,
whom he accuses of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   On Tuesday, Rwandan officials said they will participate in
another round of talks on the Congo situation sponsored by the
Organization of African Unity on Thursday and Friday in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, but said they expected no results.
	   Wamba said he will also attend the conference.
	   In an apparent lead-in to the Ouagadougou meeting, Congolese
Ambassador Kyungu Wa-Ku Mwanza told reporters in Nairobi, Kenya on
Tuesday that the rebels were nothing more than a front for a
Rwandan Tutsi plan to take over central and eastern Africa.
	   ``The Tutsis believe that, like Hitler's dream in 1940, they can
dominate Central and East Africa. They are encouraged by the
Americans,'' he said. ``The Congolese people are not stupid...
there is already an anti-American feeling in Congo.''
	   Tutsis are a minority in Rwanda but control the government and
the army since Tutsi rebels overthrew the majority Hutu government
in July 1994, putting an end to the government-orchestrated
slaughter of more than half a million Tutsis.
	   Wamba rejected the accusations as false, and instead called for
Wa-Ku Mwanza to be prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the
persecution in 1992 of natives of Kasai living in Katanga where he
served as a governor. Thousands were killed or expelled from their
homes in politically motived attacks.
	   ``The National Conference in 1992 identified him as a leader of
the massacres,'' Wamba said of the all-party conference that
restored political parties previously banned by former dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Meanwhile, Angolan troops who helped fend off Congolese rebel
attacks on Kinshasa in August were continuing to withdraw from the
Atlantic airbase at Kitona and from Mbuji-Mayi, said Rwandan
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The pullout of at least 1,000 Angolans was apparently in
response to attacks by UNITA rebels on the government-held towns of
Cuito and Huambo in the central Angolan highlands.
	   The redeployment of Angolan troops to the home front could
seriously undermine Kinshasa's efforts to keep up the pressure on
the Congolese rebels.

Eleven die in South African tornado
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ Eleven people were killed Tuesday
when a tornado swept through this town near the southeastern coast,
pushing down a shop wall that fell on the victims, a radio
reported.
	   ``I was in a car, when a cloud covered the town. I couldn't see
anything. There were large hail stones,'' Lawrence Nkosi told SABC
radio.
	   Umtata is located about 50 kilometers inland from the Indian
Ocean on the country's southeastern coast. The tornado happened
about 1445GMT, or 4:45 local time, the radio said.
	   Casualties were expected to rise, Nkosi said
	   Another tornado touched down Tuesday about 250 kilometers (155
miles) west of Umtata in Hogsback, where ten people went missing
but were later found. There were three injuries in Hogsback, the
radio said.
	   Heavy rain and storms have plagued South Africa since Sunday.
	   Searchers have recovered ten bodies and presume another four
were drowned Sunday after the vehicle they were riding in was swept
into a river off a bridge near Badplaas, 250 kilometers (155 miles)
east of Johannesburg.
	   In the Cape Town region, on the west coast, heavy rains on
Monday forced the evacuation of 500 people from their homes in
Caledon.
	   Lightning in Cape Town on Monday shut down the signal and
overhead power lines of commuter trains and set afire the thatched
roof at the home of Earl Charles Spencer, brother to the late
Princess Diana.

Ronaldo, Zidane, et al face Italy in exhibition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Imagine this lineup: Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane,
Gabriel Batistuta and George Weah together in attack.
	   It's going to happen. For one match, anyway.
	   That powerful group is set to line up for the ``World
All-Stars'' facing Italy's national team in an exhibition game
Wednesday night at the Olympic Stadium to mark the Italian soccer
federation's centennial.
	   Brazil's Ronaldo has won the last two FIFA Player of the Year
awards, Liberia's Weah won the 1995 version, and Zidane is the
favorite to claim this year's honor after carrying France to the
World Cup crown.
	   Batistuta, an Argentine, hasn't pocketed that award _ yet. All
he's done lately is register the only hat-trick at France '98 and
lead Serie A with 13 goals through 13 games for first-place
Fiorentina.
	   Ronaldo and Batistuta have shown before that they make a
spectacular strikeforce.
	   At an exhibition game at Marseilles, France, in conjunction with
the World Cup draw last December, the duo combined to account for
all of the World All-Star's goals in a 5-2 defeat of a European
selection.
	   In fact, that display prompted Ronaldo's club, Internazionale of
Milan, to try to pry Batistuta away from Fiorentina. But the
Argentine eventually agreed to a new deal, keeping him in Florence
into the new millennium.
	   Ronaldo, meanwhile, is starting to get over the knee tendinitis
that has troubled him all season. His goal with three minutes left
Sunday gave Inter a key 1-0 league victory at Udinese.
	   ``I'm happy to say I'm finding my form again,'' the Brazilian
said, ``and I feel less and less pain.''
	   Most members of the World team play for Italian clubs.
	   Actually, the starting 'keeper for the visitors is likely to be
Gianluca Pagliuca, who started for Italy at the last two World
Cups. The Inter veteran had a falling out with new Italy coach Dino
Zoff, though, and has lost his Azzurri roster spot.
	   Others on the World team jointly coached by Celtic boss Josef
Venglos and Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994
World Cup title, include Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata, Brazilians Cafu
and Dunga, and Spaniards Fernando Hierro and Julen Guerrero.
	   With starting forwards Christian Vieri and Alessandro Del Piero
out injured, Italy's attack will be led by youngsters Francesco
Totti of AS Roma and Filippo Inzaghi of Juventus.
	   The game could also see Alessandro Nesta's return to
international action. The defender broke his leg during Italy's
first-round game against Austria at the World Cup, and only got
back on the field two weeks ago in an Italian Cup match with his
club, Lazio of Rome.
	   Probable lineups:
	   Italy _ Angelo Peruzzi; Christian Panucci, Fabio Cannavaro,
Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini; Diego Fuser, Dino Baggio, Demetrio
Albertini, Eusebio Di Francesco; Filippo Inzaghi, Francesco Totti.
	   World _ Gianluca Pagliuca (Italy); Cafu (Brazil), Dunga
(Brazil), Fernando Hierro (Spain), Rigobert Song (Cameroon); Julen
Guerrero (Spain), Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan), Zinedine Zidane
(France); George Weah (Liberia), Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina),
Ronaldo (Brazil).

New dean causes dismay _ and discord _ at Westminster Abbey

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The stately calm of Westminster Abbey's ornate
transepts and silent crypts does well to conceal the tempest
blowing this year in the inner sanctum of Britain's greatest
church.
	   Anyone who has anything to do with the abbey _ from the choir
boys to Queen Elizabeth II _ has been swept up in the decidedly
unholy storm of '98, in whose eye stands the institution's firm new
boss, the Right Rev. Wesley Carr.
	   Since his appointment in early 1997, Carr has proved himself one
of the most radical deans in the 900-year history of the abbey,
where all but two British monarchs have been crowned since 1066 and
where Princess Diana was eulogized last year.
	   Carr's attempts at reorganization and modernization have been
controversial and often unpopular, but it was his firing of the
abbey's respected music director _ the same one honored by the
queen for his arrangement of music at Diana's funeral _ that
brought the swiftest and harshest reaction.
	   Because the abbey is designated a ``royal peculiar,'' falling
under the sole jurisdiction of the queen, it also put Her Majesty
in the awkward position of being thrust into an employment dispute.
	   The British press has delighted in the cloister controversy,
leading one congregation member to complain that ``all this
publicity makes our lovely abbey sound like some sort of a gulag.''
	   Critics call Carr, 57, an insensitive bully who lacks proper
understanding of the storied institution's traditions. Supporters
counter that he's simply efficient and demanding, with the abbey's
best interests at heart.
	   Along with a tourist-control campaign called ``Recovering the
Calm,'' Carr ended free access to the abbey by instituting a 5
pound (dlrs 8.30) admission fee. Then he fired all volunteer guides
75 and older for what he said were insurance reasons.
	   He tried to do away with the tradition of a decorated Christmas
tree, until learning that the tree is an annual gift from the
queen.
	   And he drew criticism this fall by authorizing the sale of the
abbey's wooden chairs in the United States, marketed as ``Diana
Funeral Chairs.''
	   But all those decisions heaped together weren't as problematic
for Carr as his dismissal of Martin Neary, the abbey's organist and
music director for a decade.
	   Widely respected in his field, Neary and his wife, Penelope, a
part-time music secretary, were fired in April because of a dispute
over business arrangements for the abbey choir.
	   Carr contended the Nearys had committed ``a breach of trust'' by
retaining surplus funds paid to a company they formed to handle the
proceeds from choir performances.
	   The Nearys contended they were merely adhering to a system set
up before Carr's arrival, and noted that they never attempted to
conceal the company's existence or the few hundred pounds (dollars)
in its reserve.
	   Since the abbey is a ``royal peculiar,'' Neary directed his
appeal to the queen, amid sharp criticism of Carr throughout
Britain, including from the couple's influential friends.
	   To the outrage of many, a judge appointed by the queen upheld
the firing on Dec. 9, ruling that the Nearys, while not dishonest,
had ``fatally undermined the relationship of trust and confidence''
that they had with the abbey.
	   Coupled with a call by the judge for tighter controls and more
aggressive financial management, the decision was seen as an
endorsement of Carr's firm hand.
	   Now the contretemps has sparked discussion of bringing the abbey
under traditional Church of England controls, which would spare the
queen involvement in any future controversy.
	   As for Carr, he has promised to smooth the roiled waters.
	   To be more precise, he used a phrase that annoyed many when
applied to limiting tourist access to the abbey: He would, he said,
``recover the calm.''

WW II concentration camp commander indicted for war crimes

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Dinko Sakic, a commander of Croatia's
most notorious World War II concentration camp, was indicted today
for alleged war crimes against civilians.
	   Sakic, 76, was charged with crimes against humanity in the
deaths of more than 2,000 people at the Jasenovac concentration
camp during the nine months he ran the camp in 1944, the state-run
HINA news agency reported.
	   Sakic is accused of ``maltreating, torturing and killing
detainees'' and of allowing his subordinates to do the same from
April to November 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed at
Jasenovac as the World War II Croatian state was implementing
racist and Nazi laws, the indictment said.
	   Sakic has been in prison in Zagreb since June, when he was
extradited from Argentina, where he had lived since the Croatian
Nazi puppet state was crushed at the end of World War II.
	   Sakic's arrest followed an interview he gave in April to an
Argentine television station, in which he admitted running
Jasenovac, but claimed ``nothing happened there.''
	   District attorney Radovan Santek requested that Sakic stay in
custody until the trial. No trial date has been set. If convicted,
he faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
	   The number of Jasenovac victims _ Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
antifascist Croats _ has never been ascertained. Serbs, the
majority of victims, claim that 700,000 people were slaughtered
there. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman had put the number at
60,000, while the United States Justice Department said more than
120,000 people died there.
	   The indictment, drawn up after 46 Jasenovac survivors and
historians gave evidence, says 49,000 people were killed during the
four years the camp was in existence _ a figure sure to be
criticized by Serbs as too low.
	   Croatia requested Sakic's extradition and based the indictment
on a four-month-long criminal investigation. The district attorney
said he also used files provided by the U.S. government,
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and the Yugoslav justice department.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World No.3 Wang Nan beat her
higher-ranked Chinese doubles partner Li Ju in the women's table
tennis singles final at the Asian Games Tuesday.
	   The 18-year-old Wang, who has won the World Cup twice at the
expense of No.2 ranked Li, won 21-14, 21-10, 21-10.
	   In the semifinals, Wang downed South Korean Ryu Ji-Hae and Li
beat 1996 Olympic silver medalist Chen Jing of Taiwan, both in four
sets. Ryu and Chen got a bronze each.
	   Li and Wang are still alive in the women's doubles, having
reached the final.
	   World and Olympic champions Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang easily
won the men's doubles following the 1-2 finish by Chinese at the
women's singles.
	   Kong and Liu, who have been nearly invincible since pairing up
in 1995, handed a 21-17, 21-13 defeat to South Korea's Lee
Chul-Seung and Oh Sang-Eun.
	   Liu's wickedly deceptive serves and Kong's follow-up attacks
were just too much for the South Koreans, who made the final by
beating Chiang Peng-Lung and Chang Yen-Shu from Taiwan. Chiang and
Chang finished joint third with their teammates Wu Wen-Chia and Kuo
Chih-Hsiang.

Koreans show China still has some catching up to do in baseball
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Experience counts. For sports power
China, 39-year-old shot putter Li Meisu overcame creaky knees to
win a gold medal at the Asian Games Tuesday, but the fledgling
baseball team was no match for a South Korean pitcher who struck
out eight in a row.
	   ``I feel that in some events athletes retire too early,'' said
Li, who last won Asian Games gold in 1982. She won an Olympic
bronze in 1988, but now competes with a limp and against her
doctors' advice.
	   She called the latest gold a present for the 6th birthday of her
son. Li won it with a throw of 18.96 meters, ahead of compatriot
Cheng Xiaoyan, who took silver with 18.55.
	   It was one of eight golds China won Tuesday, boosting its total
for the games to 92. Its victories included a sweep of both
volleyball titles, with victories over South Korea in both the
women's and men's finals.
	   South Korea was next with 47 golds, and was favored in baseball,
where pitcher Kim Byung-hyun struck out 12 batters _ including
eight in a row _ in six innings of relief as the Koreans beat China
9-2.
	   That put South Korea in the gold medal game against Japan, a 9-8
winner over Taiwan in the day's other semifinal. And it still has
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho rested and ready.
	   Japan had 41 golds after winning three in track and field, three
in its native sport of karate, and one in synchronized swimming.
	   Yasunori Uchitomi, disappointed by gaining only bronze in his
hometown of Hiroshima in the 1994 Asian Games, won the 3,000-meter
steeplechase ahead of Hamid Sajdjadi-Hazaveh of Iran.
	   Men's 100-meter champion Koji Ito anchored Japan's 4 x 100-meter
relay team to victory, and Masaki Morinaga won the men's long jump.
	   Aside from the shot put gold, China had a victory in the women's
relay, anchored by 100 champion Li Xuemei.
	   South Korea gained golds Tuesday in archery, soft tennis and
equestrian individual dressage. Archer Kim Jo-sun finished first by
defeating teammate Lee Eun-kyung, the 1992 Olympic champion, in a
three-arrow shootout.
	   The Koreans gained their third soft tennis gold with a victory
over a Taiwan pair in women's doubles, but Taiwan broke the
monopoly by winning the men's doubles.
	   Horse riders Suh Jung-kyun, Shin Chang-moo and Choi Myung-jin
swept the top three positions in dressage, but Japan's Toshihide
Takechi took bronze under games' rules limiting one nation to only
two medals in any event.
	   In the South Asian sport of kabaddi, defending champion India
clinched another gold medal. Going into the final day Wednesday,
the Indians had a perfect 6-0 record, out of reach of closest
competitors Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
	   China and Kazakstan each won individual pursuit races in
cycling. Kazakstan's Vadim Kravchenko beat Japan's Noriyuki Iijima
in the men's 4-kilometer race, 4 minutes, 42.799 seconds to
4:45.215. China's Wang Qingzhi defeated teammate Zhao Haijuan in
the women's 3-kilometer race.
	   Kazakstan also had gold from pole vaulter Igor Potapovich, who
placed fourth at the 1996 Olympics
	   Kazakstan had 16 golds, just behind the 17 for Taiwan, which
also won one in karate Tuesday.
	   Japan's Miya Tachibana won her second gold of these games when
she teamed with Miho Takeda for the synchronized swimming duet
title, ahead of South Korea's Yoo Na-mi and Jang Yoon-kyeong.
	   Japan's Atsuko Wakai took gold in the women's kata competition
of karate, in which competitors are rated on style. She outscored
Indonesia's Ompi Omita-Olga, 42.9 to 41.9.
	   China pulled ahead of South Korea in fencing golds, four to
three, by beating Japan 45-35 in the men's team foil final.
	   The Chinese also took two table tennis golds, with Wang Nan's
victory over compatriot Li Ju in women's singles, and Kong Linghui
and Liu Guoliang's men's doubles victory over South Koreans Lee
Chul-seung and Oh Sang-eun.

Japan captures three Asian Games karate golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan captured three Asian Games gold
medals in women's karate Tuesday, although Taiwan's Li Wan-yu
prevented a Japanese sweep by winning the 60-kilogram class.
	   Japan's golds came in the 53- and over 60-kilogram classes and
the kata category, where athletes display karate moves before a
panel of judges who mark their performance.
	   Atsuko Wakai beat out Indonesia's Omita-Olga Ompi for the kata
gold, scoring 42.9 points. Only 0.9 point separated the next three
athletes, with Ompi scoring 41.9 points for silver and Malaysia's
Lim Lee-Lee taking bronze with 41.5 points. Taiwan's Ke Fang-mei
just missed a medal with 41 points.
	   The 53-kilogram gold went to Japan's Eri Fujioka. Sandra Aryani
took Indonesia's second silver, with Vietnam's Ha Pham Hong and
Taiwan's Chiang Ching-chih sharing bronze.
	   Japan's Izumi Nabeki took the over 60-kilogram, with P.
Tamchuchaichana taking silver for Thailand. Kieu-Trang Ha-Thi took
another bronze for Vietnam, with Premila Supramaniam taking a
second bronze for Malaysia.
	   But Japan was without a medal in the 60-kilogram competition,
won by Taiwan's Li. Vietnam's Tham Pham Hong took silver, with
Thailand's Phetlada Ausabay and Indonesia's Nilawati Daud sharing
bronze.

Hundreds attend memorial service for Duchess of York 's mother
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York, accompanied by her former
husband Prince Andrew, joined hundreds of relatives and friends
Tuesday at a memorial service for her mother, Susan Barrantes, who
was killed in a car crash in Argentina in September.
	   The duchess's father, Maj. Ron Ferguson, whose two-year battle
with prostate cancer has just been made public, was one of about
500 people who filled St. Paul's Church in the Knightsbridge area
of London.
	   Mrs. Barrantes, divorced from Ferguson in 1974, had later
married Argentine polo player Hector Barrantes.
	   Following Barrantes' death from cancer in 1990, she had held on
to their ranch, struggling to make ends meet. Only after her death
did her daughters discover she had been coping with severe
financial difficulties and left heavy debts.
	   ``Outwardly, at any rate, she remained the eternal optimist,
always appearing to believe that she was about to stumble on the
rainbow's end,'' Lord Patrick Beresford, an old family friend, told
the congregation.
	   ``We were all so much the richer for her living, and are so much
the poorer for her passing,'' he said.
	   Andrew met his ex-wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, at the
church, kissed their daughters, Princesses Beatrice, 10, and
Eugenie, 8, and sat with them at the front.
	   The Duchess of Kent, wife of one of Queen Elizabeth II's
cousins, attended. But the most senior members of the royal family
_ the duchess's former in-laws the queen, Prince Philip and Prince
Charles _ did not.
	   Despite her daughter's divorce from Andrew in 1996, Mrs.
Barrantes had remained on good terms with the royal family. At the
time of her death, the queen said she was ``shocked and very
saddened.''
	   But the queen does not usually attend memorial services or
funerals, except in cases of someone very closely related.
	   Relations between the duchess and the senior royals have been
difficult for years, due in part to the highly public nature of her
break-up with Andrew and the millions of pounds in debts she
amassed.
	   The duchess says she has cleared her debts and does television
and promotional work to pay her taxes. But financial hardship is
the reason she gives for continuing to live in the former husband's
home _ over the reported objections of the queen and Philip.
	   The queen recently bought a 1.5 million pound (dlrs 2.55
million) house in the names of Beatrice and Eugenie. But the
duchess says she can't afford to live in it and is seeking a better
divorce settlement from the queen.

Sion chairman says Swiss bid unaffected by Olympic scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Sion has played according to the rules
and its bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics won't be affected by the
scandal surrounding the awards process, the organizing committee's
chairman said Tuesday.
	   Adolf Ogi, who is also Switzerland's defense minister, denied in
radio and television interviews a claim that he asked senior Swiss
Olympic official Marc Hodler to keep quiet allegations of
misconduct.
	   Hodler said Salt Lake City, which beat Sion for the 2002 Winter
Games in a landslide vote in 1995 balloting, was ``blackmailed''
during its successful bid.
	   On Saturday, he alleged that four ``agents'' _ including one
member of the International Olympic Committee _ had been involved
in election fraud over the past 10 years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia,
and Salt Lake.
	   The scandal has prompted the IOC to set up a top-level
investigation into alleged misconduct.
	   ``Ogi asked me to say nothing, so as not to endanger Sion's
candidacy,'' Hodler was quoted as saying in the Zurich weekly
SonntagsZeitung. ``He doesn't want Switzerland to be seen as
prosecutor.''
	   Hodler informed the Sion committee of the allegations last
Thursday, Ogi said. But he insisted no instructions or advice were
given to Hodler.
	   He called on the IOC to make a quick decision on whether future
Olympic venues should be made by its governing executive board or
by the full committee.
	   On Monday, Ogi invited the IOC to examine the accounts of both
the current Sion bid and its unsuccessful attempt for the 2002
Games, in the interests of ``full transparency and fair play.''

Saudi border guard killed by assailants in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi border guard was killed by
assailants from inside Iraq in a cross-border shooting, the
official Saudi Press Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Saiq Ibrahim Jahoosh, a guard on the northern border, was on
duty when he was shot by gunmen from a car on the Iraqi side of the
border, the agency said.
	   The agency did not say when the incident took place and gave no
other details.
	   It was the first report of violence on the Saudi-Iraqi border
since the 1991 Gulf War in which a U.S.-led coalition drove Iraqi
forces out of Kuwait.

Fired Ajax coach blames De Boer twins for dismissal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Morten Olsen launched a bitter
verbal attack on Frank and Ronald de Boer on Tuesday, blaming the
twins for creating the atmosphere which led to his dismissal as
Ajax's coach.
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since he was fired
Saturday, the 49-year-old Dane said the dispute between the club
and Dutch internationals Frank and Ronald de Boer ``totally
destroyed the team's dynamic.''
	   The De Boers started the season by refusing to play over a
contract dispute, both seeking a transfer but unable to get their
release them from the club. The twins also publicly accused Olsen
of running boring training sessions.
	   ``When I read that sentence, I knew we wouldn't get through this
season without problems,'' Olsen said at a press conference at
Ajax's Arena stadium, Amsterdam evening daily Het Parool reported.
	   ``This is wrong, I realized. A trainer who won everything
domestically last season earns respect until the first match of the
next season.''
	   Las season, Olsen's first after taking over from Louis van Gaal,
Ajax won the Dutch league-cup double, earning a place in the
lucrative European Champions League.
	   But this season the storied club's performance has veered from
bad to worse, culminating in last week's humiliating 3-0 defeat by
FC Porto which finished Ajax at the bottom of Champions League
Group A.
	   Reserve team coach Jan Wouters already has replaced Olsen. Ajax
played to a disappointing 0-0 draw with SC Heerenveen on Sunday in
Wouters' debut.
	   Belgian club Anderlecht reportedly is interested in signing
Olsen.
	   Olsen accused the De Boer twins of undermining his
responsibility and effectively curtailing his managerial career at
Ajax.
	   ``How can you claim to be in charge when two important players
call you a boring trainer, a boring tactician?,'' Olsen asked
rhetorically. ``My next mistake was that I didn't send them
packing.''

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Dry and stable high pressure from the middle through the upper
levels of the atmosphere will dominate the local region today and
Wednesday to maintain fair weather.
	   The weak low-level trough that moved through the area yesterday
has slowed its northwest movement overnight and was drifting slowly
northwest across the extreme eastern Dominican Republic.
	   This has caused wind across the local area to remain very light
overnight and will continue through the morning hours before mild
easterly winds build into the area this afternoon.
	   This will allow isolated showers across the coastal waters to
move across portions of the Virgin Islands and the eastern and
southern sections of Puerto Rico this morning.
	   A few afternoon showers are expected across interior and western
Puerto Rico.
	   Coastal seas are generally smooth this morning due to the light
wind flow of the past 15 hours.
	   Moderate north-northeast swells of around 3 feet will continue
to affect the local Atlantic waters through this afternoon before
slowly dying. Easterly winds building into the local area this
afternoon will gradually increase to around 15 knots by Wednesday,

EU farm ministers delay ban on animal parts with BSE risk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union farm ministers decided
Tuesday to delay for one year a ban on the use of animal parts
deemed most at risk of harboring ``mad cow'' disease.
	   EU farm ministers decided to push back the Jan. 1 ban amid
concern it could disrupt billions of dollars a year of
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics trade, said an EU farm official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The EU was due to ban the use of the head and spinal cord of
cattle, sheep and goats more than 12 months old and the spleen of
all sheep and goats.
	   Those parts are deemed to be most at risk of harboring mad cow
disease _ or bovine spongiform encephalopathy _ in BSE-infected
cattle and related brain ailments in sheep and goats.
	   But several EU countries objected to the Jan. 1 ban, the
official said.
	   The United States also opposes the ban. Americans have warned
the move would disrupt more than dlrs 4 billion a year of exports
of U.S. pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
	   BSE has been linked to a fatal brain ailment in humans,
Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and can go undetected in cattle for
years. Pharmaceuticals and cosmetics can be made in part from the
BSE risk material.
	   The ban on animal parts was initially proposed by the EU
executive commission in 1997. It has been repeatedly delayed.

Ronaldo, Zidane and Suker are short listed for FIFA title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ French World Cup hero Zinedine
Zidane, top scorer Davor Suker and two-time holder Ronaldo were
short listed Tuesday for FIFA's World Player of the Year soccer
award.
	   The winner _ selected by 129 national coaches _ will be
announced at a ceremony in the Spanish city of Barcelona on Feb. 1,
1999.
	   The nomination of Inter Milan star Ronaldo was despite his
disappointing performance in Brazil's 3-0 loss to France in the
World Cup final.
	   Zidane, by contrast, became a living French legend by scoring
two of the goals in the final after an impressive show throughout
the tournament.
	   Suker, who plays for Real Madrid, helped Croatia to its surprise
third slot in the finals with six goals _ one more than Italy's
Christian Vieri and Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Ronaldo won the player of the year title for the past two years.
Previous holders have been Liberia's George Weah, Brazil's Romario,
Italy's Roberto Baggio, Marco Van Basten for the Netherlands and
Germany's Lothar Matthaus.

Gloom returns as dejected England falls further behind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former England captain Ray Illingworth on Tuesday
slammed the team's latest miserable flop against Australia. England
failed for the sixth time in a row to win the Ashes with the series
barely half over.
	   The Australians won the second test for a 2-0 lead with two more
matches remaining. While there were rallying calls from team
leaders to try and tie the series, it was also accepted that
England was only saved from being 3-0 down by a thunderstorm at
Brisbane.
	   ``It was bloody awful _ I can't say any more than that. I am
glad I am out of it,'' said Illingworth, who came under fire when
he was manager of a regularly losing England team four years ago.
	   ``You can pull apart every department in the team. For me, what
has to be looked at is the money spent on the team. We have more
coaches, managers, physios and even more hangers on than ever but
the results are just as bad.
	   ``What depresses me most is not the fact that England lose in
Australia but that they are laying down and dying. We are getting
blown away.''
	   After the euphoria of beating South Africa, English cricket
returned to the old mood of dejection.
	   A 205-run loss in Adelaide was Australia's second win in a row
and, with England's batsmen failing to produce big scores to match
the Australian century-makers, there seems little sign of a
fightback.
	   ``It is unfortunate and we are very disappointed, particularly
after the series against South Africa last summer,'' said Lord
McLaurin, head of the English Cricket Board. ``But there will be no
call from us for any resignations.
	   ``It is just one of those things. It could be said we were
slightly unfortunate to lose the toss (in Adelaide), but we have to
face the fact that we have under-performed at national level for
quite a few years.
	   ``If you have something that has not been good for a while, you
have to take it apart and put it together again.''
	   The ECB voted two weeks ago to restructure the county
championship into two leagues of nine instead of one of 18 to try
and improve the standard of the domestic game with the aim of
making the test team stronger.
	   Critics say that England has fallen too far behind the top teams
and that it stood little chance of beating Australia, the world's
best, in the Ashes series.
	   But they weren't expected to capitulate so easily and so early.
	   ``We have not played to our capability since we have arrived,''
said chairman of selectors David Graveney.
	   ``In that respect we had to make sure we posted the right scores
in the first innings and caught as well as Australia. In those two
factors we have fallen down and it is very disappointing for me
personally and also the senior players in our team who have had
this experience on a number of occasions.''
	   ``But we will not fudge the truth and the truth is we should be
3-0 down now,'' Graveney said.
	   ``We will be making the point that a lot of people from England
are spending a lot of money to travel to the other side of the
world for the final two tests and we have a duty to them. So the
series is still alive for us.''
	   Dennis Amiss, a former standout England opener, said the current
team should have performed much better.
	   ``Australia are a very good side but we have got to be
disappointed because we have not played our full potential,'' he
said. ``If everyone had been at the top of their game then things
would have been a lot closer.
	   ``However, it does have to be remembered that the Aussies are on
a winning roundabout. Once you are on that it's hard to get off it
in the same as it's difficult to get off a losing one _ which is
what we are on.
	   ``They are a top side and full of confidence _ winning in
Pakistan was no mean feat _ whereas our boys, apart from the series
against South Africa, have not had that much success _ and that
breeds the confidence,'' Amiss said.
	   ``But there is always hope. It's time for the backs to the wall,
stiff upper lip type of thing.''

Croat defense lawyer fined for contempt of court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Croat defense lawyer has been
fined 10,000 guilders (dlrs 5,300) by the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal for disclosing the idenity of a protected witness, the
U.N. court announced Tuesday.
	   Attorney Anto Nobilo's punishment marked the first time the
court has fined a lawyer for contempt.
	   Nobilo, a defense lawyer for Bosnian Croat general Tihomir
Blaskic, revealed in September the identity and occupation of a
witness who had testified in a related trial, defying a court order
guaranteeing the witness' anonymity.
	   ``Decisions regarding the protection of witnesses are of primary
importance, not only for the protection of the lives of the
witnesses, but also for the functioning of the tribunal,'' the
three-judge panel which fined Nobilo wrote.
	   Many witnesses give evidence anonymously at the tribunal,
fearing reprisals at home if they are seen publicly testifying.
	   Nobilo argued that he did not know the witness was protected.
	   But the judges ruled that he was guilty of ``a deliberate
abstention from checking the circumstances under which a witness
has given evidence.''
	   Nobilo was ordered to pay 4,000 guilders (dlrs 2,100) within a
week. The rest of the fine was suspended for a year.
	   Nobilo is defending Blaskic against charges that he commanded
troops that went on a murderous rampage through a central Bosnian
valley in 1993. The witness involved in the contempt case had
testified against Zlatko Aleksovski, a Bosnian Croat accused of
mistreating prisoners in a jail set up to house prisoners captured
by Blaskic's troops.

WW II concentration camp commander indicted for war crimes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, ADDS background &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The commander of Croatia's most notorious
World War II concentration camp was indicted Tuesday for war crimes
six months after he was extradited from Argentina where he had
lived quietly for nearly a half century.
	   Dinko Sakic, 76, was charged with crimes against humanity in the
deaths of more than 2,000 people at the Jasenovac concentration
camp during the nine months he ran the camp in 1944, the state-run
HINA news agency reported.
	   Sakic is accused of ``maltreating, torturing and killing
detainees'' and of allowing his subordinates to do the same from
April to November 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed at
Jasenovac, known as the ``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' as the World
War II Croatian state was implementing racist and Nazi laws, the
indictment said.
	   Sakic has been in prison in Zagreb since June, when he was
extradited from Argentina, where he had lived since the Croatian
Nazi puppet state was crushed at the end of World War II.
	   Sakic's arrest followed an interview he gave in April to an
Argentine television station, in which he admitted running
Jasenovac, but claimed ``nothing happened there.''
	   District attorney Radovan Santek requested that Sakic stay in
custody until the trial. No trial date has been set. If convicted,
he faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
	   The number of Jasenovac victims _ Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
antifascist Croats _ has never been ascertained. Serbs, the
majority of victims, claim that 700,000 people were slaughtered
there. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman had put the number at
60,000, while the United States Justice Department said more than
120,000 people died there.
	   In an April 6 interview with a Buenos Aires television station,
Sakic, who had been living in Santa Teresita southeast of Buenos
Aires, denied any wrongdoing or that prisoners were killed under
his command.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,'' he
said. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   Sakic also said he has traveled openly, on a passport using his
real identity, to a number of countries, including the United
States.
	   He said he even met with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
during the president's 1994 visit to Buenos Aires.
	   President Carlos Menem called for Sakic's arrest a day after the
broadcast, even though was no standing extradition request.
	   Argentina's quick extradition, helped by Sakic's acquiescence,
contrasted with previous cases in the nation, which has a
reputation as a haven for Nazis hiding from their World War II
past.
	   The indictment, drawn up after 46 Jasenovac survivors and
historians gave evidence, says 49,000 people were killed during the
four years the camp was in existence _ a figure sure to be
criticized by Serbs as too low.
	   Croatia requested Sakic's extradition and based the indictment
on a four-month-long criminal investigation. The district attorney
said he also used files provided by the U.S. government,
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and the Yugoslav justice department.

Chechnya declares state of emergency to fight crime

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Breakaway Chechnya declared a one-month state of
emergency Tuesday to combat rampant crime and try to end the nearly
daily kidnappings in the southern Russian republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya since the end
of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display of
the lawlessness, four Western hostages were beheaded last week.
	   ``The time for talking has passed and it is no longer possible
to tolerate the crime wave,'' Chechnya's Security Minister Aslambek
Arsayev said Monday.
	   Chechnya's parliament declared the 30-day emergency at a session
Tuesday, lawmaker Rizvan Lorsanov told the Interfax news agency in
Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   On Monday, the parliament turned down a request by President
Aslan Maskhadov to mobilize army reservists as part of the
anti-crime effort. Lawmakers said reservists can only be mobilized
in the face of an external threat.
	   But Maskhadov proceeded with the mobilization anyway, said
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``No compromise is possible with criminal groups, and Maskhadov
advocates tough measures to destroy gangsters,'' Vachagayev said.
	   More than 1,500 reservists have arrived at mobilization centers,
Vachagayev said.
	   The reports did not say what new powers the government would
have under the state of emergency. The security forces have been
stepping up checks of vehicles on main roads in recent days, and
this was expected to continue.
	   However, the Chechen government has in the past been reluctant
to confront suspected criminal gangs. It's not clear whether the
security forces will take a more aggressive stance this time, and
thereby risk armed conflict with outlaw groups.
	   Authorities are also appealing to Chechen elders and Islamic
leaders to persuade young people to lay down weapons and leave
armed groups.
	   With Chechnya's economy shattered, many young men who fought
against the Russians have turned to crime, and armed gangs roam
operate freely throughout the mainly Muslim territory.
	   ``We do not want to shed blood of the young and innocent
people,'' Arsayev said. ``But if they do not go home and defend
their leaders, they will be eliminated.''
	   Kidnappings have become one of the most lucrative businesses in
Chechnya. Three Britons and a New Zealander, kidnapped in October
while installing a telephone network, where beheaded last week.
	   Maskhadov, Chechnya's president, was widely respected as a
military commander during the war but has been unable to impose
order since winning a landslide election almost two years ago.
	   His impoverished government barely functions, and many of the
young rebel fighters who served under him during the war have since
turned against him.
	   ``Maskhadov has neither money, nor strength, nor sufficient
influence in the society to disarm the illegal armed groups,'' said
Dzhabrail Gakayev, a historian and head of the Chechen Cultural
Center, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia's Alexander Lebed, a retired general who negotiated the
end to the war in 1996 and later served as Russia's security chief,
said Tuesday that the mobilization of reservists may grow into a
war between different factions in Chechnya, ITAR-Tass reported.

EU warns 11 member states over air pollution laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Tuesday warned 11 EU countries they have two months
to integrate EU laws on air pollution into national legislation or
else face court action.
	   Five countries - Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Britain,
are guilty on two counts. They are several months late in adopting
an EU law on air quality, and another law on polluting emissions
from internal combustion engines in stationary places such as
factories and gas stations.
	   Two countries, Sweden and Spain, are guilty of not integrating
the first of these two laws into national legislation. A further
four countries, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Austria, are guilty
of not adopting the second law, a Commission statement said.
	   The deadline for integrating the EU law on air quality into
national legislation was May 21, 1998. The deadline for adopting
the second law was June 30, 1998.
	   Under EU procedure, the EU Commission can take these countries
to the European Court of Justice if they do not comply with the EU
warning within two months.

South Africa, Lesotho meet over slain farmers, stock theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A South African diplomat met with
Lesotho's Mounted Police and other officials on Tuesday to discuss
the death of three South African farmers in a cross-border raid
involving stock theft.
	   Two farmers were injured in the incident.
	   Lesotho police spokesman Maj. Sekoateng Serabele confirmed that
the farmers were shot dead by members of the Lesotho Defense Force
in the mountainous border region of southern Lesotho.
	   But he disputed reports that 23 South African Farmers had
entered Lesotho on Saturday to recover stolen stock. He said the
men were caught driving away 64 sheep and goats that belonged to
Lesotho farmers.
	   The soldiers fired on the fleeing farmers, killing three, he
said.
	   South African police spokesman Cap. Bertie van Litsenborgh said
the farmers were trying to retrieve their own stock. He could not
confirm the three men had been killed by soldiers.
	   ``Fighting broke out and I can't confirm anything that links the
three and the injured two with the Lesotho army,'' said Van
Litsenborgh.
	   South Africa's High Commissioner to Lesotho, Japhet Ndlovu, met
Tuesday with Brig. J.R. Moiloa, acting commissioner of the Royal
Lesotho Mounted Police, and Supt. Andries Oosthuizen, who heads
South Africa's National Stock Theft Unit.
	   Van Litsenborgh said that several farmers were killed earlier
this year in similar incidents, and that stock raids have been
ongoing for decades.

EU takes Portugal, Belgium and Greece to court over GMOs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Tuesday it will
take Portugal, Belgium and Greece to court for failing to integrate
EU environmental norms on genetically-modified organisms into
national law.
	   The EU's executive Commission said the countries are over a year
late in adopting two EU laws on genetically-modified organisms.
	   These EU laws ``set out frameworks to ensure ... the
environmental safety of the use of GMOs in contained conditions and
the ... safety of releases of GMOs into the environment,'' a
Commission statement said.
	   The deadline for the 15 EU countries to integrate the EU rules
on GMOs into national legislation was July 31, 1997.

Communist accuses Yeltsin, Jews of genocide against Russians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with government reaction, additional
background on anti-Semitism in Russia. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In another burst of anti-Semitism from Russia's
Communists, a prominent lawmaker on Tuesday accused President Boris
Yeltsin and Jews in his office of waging ``genocide'' against the
Russian people.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, the head of parliament's security affairs
committee, claimed that liberal reforms carried out by Yeltsin's
government in the 1990s have decimated Russia.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   The Communist Party, the country's main opposition group, has
been seeking to attract a new generation of supporters and distance
itself from abuses committed during the Soviet era.
	   But in recent weeks, party elders have expressed support for
several measures that recall some of the darkest moments of their
rule.
	   Communist lawmakers last month enthusiastically supported a move
to bring back the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, former head of the
dreaded Soviet secret police. His likeness was toppled from in
front of KGB headquarters in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.
	   Also, Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of

re-introduction of hard labor camps, where millions perished under
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
	   With Russians weathering a tough economic crisis, the country's
rough-and-tumble politics have grown even more coarse, according to
some analysts.
	   ``No longer do (Communists) consider it necessary to convince
people that they have changed, that they are not responsible for
the crimes of previous communist regimes,'' political analyst

during the Soviet era. The Russian constitution bans
discrimination, but many Russians express anti-Semitic sentiments.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist, was
quoted by his spokesman as saying that anti-Semitism was
unacceptable in Russia.
	   Meanwhile, the impeachment panel planned to continue its
sessions next week. Several previous impeachment efforts have
collapsed, and the current one also has little chance of success.

Communist accuses Yeltsin, Jews of genocide against Russians

background on anti-Semitism in Russia. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In another burst of anti-Semitism from Russia's
Communists, a prominent lawmaker on Tuesday accused President Boris
Yeltsin and Jews in his office of waging ``genocide'' against the
Russian people.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, the head of parliament's security affairs
committee, claimed that liberal reforms carried out by Yeltsin's
government in the 1990s have decimated Russia.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   The Communist Party, the country's main opposition group, has
been seeking to attract a new generation of supporters and distance
itself from abuses committed during the Soviet era.
	   But in recent weeks, party elders have expressed support for
several measures that recall some of the darkest moments of their
rule.
	   Communist lawmakers last month enthusiastically supported a move
to bring back the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, former head of the
dreaded Soviet secret police. His likeness was toppled from in
front of KGB headquarters in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.
	   Also, Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
parliament's lower house, suggested crime could be curbed by the
re-introduction of hard labor camps, where millions perished under
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
	   With Russians weathering a tough economic crisis, the country's
rough-and-tumble politics have grown even more coarse, according to
some analysts.
	   ``No longer do (Communists) consider it necessary to convince
people that they have changed, that they are not responsible for
the crimes of previous communist regimes,'' political analyst

	   ``On the contrary, they ... shamelessly present themselves as

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Foreign Office said Tuesday that it no longer
is warning Britons not to travel to Chile because of the furor over
the continued detention of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.
	   Street violence has calmed, but Britons still should exercise
caution when visiting Chile and keep a low profile, since
anti-Britain sentiment continues to runs high, a Foreign Office
statement said.
	   Britons should avoid crowds, meetings and demonstrations, and
areas where the English-speaking community normally gathers,
according to the latest travel advice.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish extradition
warrant alleging murder and other crimes against humanity committed
by his secret police during his 1973-1990 rule.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three deputy ministers and several other senior
officials have been arrested in a crackdown on corruption in the
Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan.
	   Deputy ministers from the Finance Ministry, the Environment
Ministry and the Industry Ministry were charged with
misappropriating $30,000 each in government funds and taking
bribes, Interior Minister Omurbek Kutuyev was quoted as saying
Monday by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Department heads at the Agriculture Ministry and Finance
Ministry were also arrested in the weekend sweep.
	   Police in the former Soviet republic are also investigating the
heads of the ministries, Kutuyev said.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, meanwhile, signed a decree Monday
stepping up the fight against corruption and smuggling, his
spokesman said.

Thousands protest death of Burkina Faso journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Thousands of people took to the
streets of this dusty capital city Tuesday to protest the death of
a prominent journalist.
	   Crowds began forming early Tuesday morning at the home of Norbet
Zongo, owner of the weekly newspaper The Independent and one of the
most outspoken critics of President Blaise Compaore's regime.
	   Zongo's badly burned body was found Sunday inside the wreckage
of his burned car, along with the corpses of two of his cousins.
The body of his chauffeur was found a few meters (yards) away.
	   The crowds began with just a few hundred university students but
quickly swelled to thousands of chanting people accusing the
government of killing Zongo.
	   No cause of death has been announced for Zongo. His parents have
requested an autopsy but officials say that won't be possible
because the body was so badly burned.
	   At one point, the crowds stormed the offices of the ruling
Congress for Democracy and Progress party, breaking windows and
furniture, and also destroyed two buses owned by the party.
	   They were eventually dispersed by riot police firing tear gas
and a heavy police presence remained on the streets Thursday
afternoon. Plainclothed police could also be seen rounding up
students.
	   The death has not yet been reported on state television or
radio.
	   Zongo's funeral will be held Saturday in Ouagadougou.
	   Compaore seized power in a 1987 military mutiny. He was
re-elected president in November.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
insisted Tuesday that U.S. President Clinton's trip to Israel and
the Palestinian areas had achieved positive results.
	   Speaking to reporters after briefing Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan on the Clinton visit, Albright said the president's talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat had laid the ground for further cooperation on
economic and security matters and the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
	   ``There was also a decision to have final status talks initiated
officially and take place on a permanent basis so that they would
go on and we can move the (peace) process forward,'' Albright said.
	   The final status talks are to deal with the thorniest issues
between Israelis and Palestinians, such as the return of refugees
and the position of East Jerusalem, which Palestinians view as the
capital of their would-be state.
	   The secretary of state was at pains to highlight achievements of
the three-day visit hours after Clinton failed to persuade
Netanyahu to proceed with a futher military withdrawal from the
West Bank, as expected under the Wye peace accord signed in
October.
	   On Monday the Palestinian parliament voted ovewhelmingly to
cancel clauses in the Palestinian National Charter that called for
the destruction of Israel.
	   But after talks with Clinton early Tuesday, Netanyahu made clear
that Israel would not reciprocate by carrying out a troop
withdrawal. The prime minister said the Palestinians had other
conditions to fulfil.
	   Albright said: ``We came to the region to restore trust and get
the peace process back on track ... and there were a number of
things agreed upon.''
	   She stressed that Washington would be involved in the final
status talks to ``keep the faith and move the process forward.''
	   Standing next to her, Hassan said Jordan would take part in the
final status talks because of issues that directly affect it, such
as the fate of displaced Palestinians, who make up roughly two
thirds of Jordan's 3.8 million population.
	   Hassan is acting as regent while King Hussein is receiving
cancer treatment in the United States.
	   Albright also said she and Hassan had discussed dlrs 200 million
in increased aid to Jordan, which now receives dlrs 225 million a
year in U.S. aid.
	   She did not provide a date for the additional contribution, but
reiterated Washington's commitment to ``bring greater economic
opportunity to the people of Jordan and have Jordan meet its vital
security needs.''
	   To reward Jordan for its 1994 peace treaty with Israel, the
United States has supplied Jordan with 16 F-16 jet fighters during
the past two years.
	   Albright, who arrived in Amman early Tuesday, returned to Israel
in the evening to join the president's flight back home.

Serb PM accuses minister of discrimination against Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An ethnic Serb parliament member called
Tuesday for the resignation of Croatia's minister in charge of
refugees and postwar reconstruction, accusing him of discriminating
against the country's Serb minority.
	   In an open letter, Milan Djukic said the minister, Jure Radic,
``hates'' Serbs and has been preventing their return'' to homes
they fled during the country's civil conflict. There was no comment
from Radic.
	   Djukic also said President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party ``lacks
political will'' to solve the issue of Serb refugees in a just way,
which would then also be acceptable to Western governments. That
``creates an irreparable damage for Croatia and its citizens,''
Djukic said.
	   Croatian Serbs made 12 percent of the country's 4.7 million
people before the 1991 war, which erupted when they rebelled
following Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia.
	   In 1995, when Croatia recaptured areas that Serbs seized during
the six-month war, about 200,000 of them fled the country.
	   Croatia has long hesitated to accept them back, but it
eventually bowed to international pressure and pledged to allow
their return.
	   Subsequently, some 50,000 have returned, but the Western
officials have recently warned that some obstacles and
discrimination still existed.
	   Tudjman said on Monday that although Croatia allowed Serbs'
return, they would likely make only three to five percent of the
population in the future, not enought to pose a new threat to
Croatian state.

African summit to discuss conflicts on the continent

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African envoys will recommend
sending a regional intervention force to the island of Anjouan in
the troubled Comoros archipelago when African leaders meet later
this week to discuss continental conflicts, an OAU official said
Tuesday.
	   The 16-nation Organization of African Unity central organ on
conflict prevention and resolution is to meet Thursday and Friday
in Ouagadougou, capital of the West African nation of Burkina Faso.
	   An official at the Addis Ababa headquarters of the 53-nation
OAU, speaking on condition of anonymity, said civil conflicts in
the Comoros and the Democratic Republic of Congo and between
Ethiopia and Eritrea will top the agenda.
	   Renewed fighting Angola and Sierra Leone will also be addressed.
	   During a stopover Tuesday in Nairobi, Kenya on his way to the
summit, Comoros interim President Tadjidine ben Said Massounde said
he was confident the OAU would send a peacekeeping force to Anjouan
to save lives.
	   ``I am certainly sure the OAU will take action to save lives in
Anjouan,'' he said.
	   The OAU official said a delegation sent last week to look into
clashes that erupted Dec. 6 on Anjouan was to submit its report to
the summit calling for the immediate dispatch of African
peacekeeping troops to the Indian Ocean island that broke away from
the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros last year.
	   There were reports that at least 40 people were killed in the
fighting between supporters of Anjouan's self-declared president,
Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim, and his former prime minister, Chamassi
Said Omar.
	   The summit is expected to call for a peaceful resolution of the
four-month rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has
drawn in troops from six African countries.
	   Rwanda and Uganda are backing rebels who have captured most
major towns in eastern Congo, while Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and
Chad have sent troops and equipment to bolster President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Kabila refuses to meet with the rebels, who he claims are
puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, indicating little likelihood that an
effective cease-fire will be signed in Ouagadougou.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea have been locked in a border dispute since
May, when heavy fighting over disputed border regions left hundreds
dead. Although there has been no fighting reported since June, both
sides continue to mass troops along their common 1,000-kilometer
(620-mile) border.
	   Discussions of that conflict are expected to center on an
11-point OAU proposal accepted by Ethiopia; Eritrea rejects the
provision calling for the withdrawl of Eritrean troops from
disputed territory.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that U.S. special envoy Anthony
Lake, who has been shuttling between Addis Ababa and Asmara to
broker a settlement, would attend the summit.

 &UR; U.N. advises against turning back on Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Western nations should avoid treating Russia as an
economic basket case and help it get back on its feet, according to
a U.N. survey released Wednesday.
	   ``There's a general tendency to despair of Russia and walk away
from it at the moment, but that doesn't seem to us very sensible or
politically very wise,'' said Paul Rayment, head of economic
analysis at the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe.
	   Uncertainty in Russia posed the greatest potential risk to
improving economies in East Europe, the commission said in its
178-page Economic Survey of Europe.
	   East European exports to Russia are expected to drop by 20 to 25
percent for 1998 on last year, Rayment said.
	   Slow growth rates in Western Europe _ with estimates being cut
to 2 1/4 percent from 3 percent _ will also hit eastern Europe hard
next year, he said.
	   Russia's economic collapse is ``by no means a unique event,''
the survey cautioned, pointing to smaller downturns in Ukraine and
Moldova.
	   Russia itself should present a ``carefully sequenced program''
to create the basic structures of a market economy and convince the
G-7 group of industrialized nations to provide help, the survey
added.
	   A dlrs 22.6 billion loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund has been frozen since Russia defaulted
on some of its debts and devalued the ruble in August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Warning Kosovo's factions that they
are playing with ``dynamite,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke sought
Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
worst violation of an informal cease-fired left 37 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke later arrived in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic, where he would ``emphasize the need to move
ahead expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   Yugoslav soldiers killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off border area. Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent
armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the remote region
and continued barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying the
verifiers access violated an October agreement reached between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, and a formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
submachine-gun fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings
on the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Tuesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent a message of
condolences to the families of killed Serbs, saying, ``we will not
hesitate to prevent anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of
our citizens.''
	   Alluding to the violence, Holbrooke said, ``yesterday was not a
good day'' in Kosovo, but added: ``We are determined to continue
our effort.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved (in fighting) that
they are playing with dynamite,'' he warned.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The rebels
say they won't accept anything short of independence. Serbia,
meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.
	   He said ethnic Albanians are ``dissatisfied'' by the mediation
of Holbrooke and U.S. envoy for Kosovo Christopher Hill because
``they are mostly passive observers.''
	   ``The latest bloodshed in Kosovo is the best sign of the effects
of their work,'' Demaci told reporters.

More than 23,000 teachers strike for back wages in Siberia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with 12,000 more teachers striking in
northwestern Russia, others blocking railroad. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least 23,000 teachers in eastern Siberia and
northwestern Russia went on an indefinite strike Tuesday to demand
months of back wages, news reports said.
	   About 100 of the striking teachers and parents of schoolchildren
blocked a railroad Tuesday in the northwestern region of Vologda,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Around Vologda, about 12,000 teachers at a total of 443 schools
and day care centers went on strike, union officials said.
	   In the Siberian region of Buryatia, 11,500 teachers walked out
and classes were suspended at 245, or about a third, of the
region's schools because of the strike, the ITAR-Tass news agency
cited local officials as saying.
	   The Buryatia teachers are owed 289 million rubles (dlrs 14
million) in back pay, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The government has accumulated millions of rubles (dollars) in
wage debts to state employees since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Some workers have taken desperate measures, including hunger
strikes and suicide, to protest their condition.

Students call for dismissal of Iran's top hard-line officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 1,000 university students,
protesting a wave of mysterious murders of dissidents, called
Tuesday for the dismissal of Iran's chief judge and the heads of
the intelligence and security services.
	   Earlier, some 3,000 writers, poets and artists attended the
funeral of one of the five slain dissident, Mohammad Mokhtari,
whose body was found on the outskirts of Tehran last week. He had
apparently been strangled. Two dissidents remain missing.
	   A resolution read at the end of a rally at Tehran's Amir Kabir
University called for the dismissal of the head of the judiciary,
chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, intelligence chief Dorri Najafabadi
and the head of the security forces, Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian.
	   The students blamed the hard-line officials for indirectly
encouraging violent incidents by not condemning or trying to stop
them.
	   ``Why don't you tell people who are committing these acts?''
student leader Alireza Siyasi told the crowed.
	   He said the judiciary and security forces had failed to
apprehend vigilantes _ allied with hard-liners _ for breaking up
pro-democracy demonstrations and attacking newspapers and
dissidents who call for more freedom.
	   ``Our peaceful demonstrations have been attacked and our friends
beaten, but no security institution ever identified any
aggressor,'' Siyasi said. ``The people want answers!''
	   Authorities said Monday that several suspects had been arrested
in connection with the killings over the past month.
	   Judicial spokesman Nasiri Savadkuhi said authorities are
``striving to arrest all the perpetrators of the recent mysterious
killings,'' Iranian television reported. It gave no details.
	   The Judiciary on Tuesday blamed the murders on foreign agents.

Megret supporters set party congress for Jan. 24
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Supporters of Bruno Megret, leading a rebellion
against National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, have announced a
date for the urgent party congress Le Pen bitterly opposes.
	   The congress to determine the party's future will be held Jan.
24, probably in Marignane in southern France, one of the towns that
has a National Front mayor.
	   The announcement was made by Franck Timmermans, one of the
Megret supporters who has been suspended from the party by Le Pen.
	   Megret's camp says it already has the necessary signatures of 20
percent of National Front members to hold the congress.
	   Le Pen, 70, the longtime leader of the extreme-right party, is
fighting to retain control of it. His feud with Megret burst into
the open just over a week ago, and has escalated daily.
	   Megret's supporters have moved out of party headquarters in
Saint-Cloud, and on Monday were refused entry when they tried to
attend a meeting there of the party's political bureau.

Poll: Two-thirds of the Danes wants the prime minister to quit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Two out of three Danes want Prime
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen to step down, according to a poll
published Tuesday.
	   The poll's results apparently reflect widespread displeasure
that Nyrup Rasmussen has failed to honor campaign promises about
protecting the state-sponsored early retirement benefit program.
	   There was no immediate likelihood that the strikingly low
support would prompt Nyrup Rasmussen to call early elections, but
the results indicate the weakness of his government's position just
nine months after narrowly staying in power in national elections.
	   During the campaign, Nyrup Rasmussen promised to leave untouched
the early retirement system, under which workers can receive a
partial pension if they retire at 60, seven years ahead of the age
for getting full benefits.
	   But in November, Nyrup Rasmussen's Social Democrats made a deal
with the opposition and came forward with a plan to make workers
pay 3,000 kroner (dlrs 470) a year if they want to take part in the
early retirement scheme.
	   The agreement immediately sparked harsh criticism, and trade
unions which traditionally are the backbone support of the Social
Democratic Party, have faced calls from own ranks to withdraw
financial support to the party.
	   According to the poll published in the newspaper B.T. newspaper,
61 percent of 548 people interviewed want Nyrup Rasmussen to
resign. According to the telephone survey made Monday by the
ACNielsen AIM polling institute, 33 percent believed he should stay
in office while the remainders were undecided. No margin of error
was given.

Yugoslavia blames Albania for border clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia on Tuesday blamed Albania
for the latest border clashes in Kosovo, accusing it ``systematic
violations'' of Yugoslavia's territory.
	   In a protest note carried by local media, the Yugoslav
government called its neighbor ``sanctuary for terrorists and the
base for their training and arming.''
	   The protest letter handed to Albanian diplomats in Belgrade
claimed that 216 border incidents involving arms smuggling into
Kosovo have been recorded since an Oct. 12 agreement that ended
large-scale fighting in the province.
	   It said the gravest incident occurred Monday, when border guards
killed 31 rebels. The letter said several hundred rebels tried to
enter Yugoslavia and shot at the guards, who fired back.
	   The government said the incidents were aimed at ``causing unrest
and jeopardizing efforts at peaceful political solution for
Kosovo.''
	   ``Since these activities occur from the territory of republic of
Albania, the Albanian government carries full responsibility for
them,'' it said.

German bank employees may strike during weekend of euro debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bank employees seeking a wage increase
said Tuesday they are thinking of pushing their cause with a strike
starting Jan. 1 _ the day Europe's common currency, the euro, makes
its debut.
	   The euro officially comes into existence at midnight Dec. 31,
and German banks need employees to work through the weekend to
prepare for the first day of euro trading on money markets Jan. 4.
	   Wage negotiations for the 470,000 employees in Germany's banking
sector stalled Monday in their first round. Round two is scheduled
for Jan. 28, but labor unions could still call strikes.
	   ``That would be a disaster for German banks and would also be a
competitive disadvantage with other banks'' in the 11 countries
adopting the euro, said Dennis Phillips, a spokesman for
Commerzbank.
	   He noted that Commerzbank has spent roughly 150 million marks
(dlrs 90 million) over the past five years to get ready for the
euro launch.
	   ``I'd warn against taking any hard stance that wouldn't lead to
a compromise,'' Phillips said of talks between banks and unions.
``I'm voicing my hope they'll find a compromise.''
	   Uwe Foullong, a spokesman for the HBV trade, banking and
insurance employees union, said a strike decision can be expected
within the next few days.
	   Foullong also signaled the possibility that union-linked
employee councils at individual banks could protest by refusing to
approve overtime work for the euro conversion weekend.
	   HBV is demanding a 6.5 percent pay raise for banking employees,
while the DAG white collar workers' union is asking for 6 percent.
	   Only around 10 percent of bank employees in Germany are
organized in unions, but most of them will be involved when banks
convert all their mark-denominated securities, payment and
settlement systems into the euro between Dec. 31 and Jan. 4.

Police detain student activists in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A student activist in an
anti-government movement in Serbia was detained Tuesday by police,
an opposition party said in a statement.
	   No explanation was given for the detention of Srdja Popovic, a
spokesman for opposition Democratic Party and member of student-run
``Otpor'' (Resistance) group. Popovic's lawyer also could not say
why he was arrested.
	   According to witnesses, Popovic was stopped by police in
downtown Belgrade, dragged out of his car, searched and taken away
in a police vehicle, the Democratic Party statement said. The party
called the move an ``illegal abduction.''
	   Three fellow students who witnessed Popovic's arrest told
independent Fonet news agency that they also were detained for half
an hour and harassed by police.
	   The three said they were detained with no explanation and
released after half an hour when their lawyers arrived to the
police station. They said the police slapped them on the face
during interrogation.
	   Last month, four students from ``Otpor'' were arrested and
sentenced to ten days in prison for spraying clenched fist, symbol
of their movement, on a Belgrade wall.
	   The autocratic Serbian government, loyal to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, has put pressure on opposition parties and
anti-government groups in Serbia fearing unrest.
	   Large street protests in 1996, led by students and opposition,
shook Milosevic's rule, and forced the autocratic leader to hand
over power in Serbia's biggest cities to the opposition.
	   In October, the Serbian parliament, dominated by Milosevic's
supporters, passed a law imposing government control over the
university and giving it the right to name the deans. ``Otpor'' has
organized protests against the law which led to strikes at some
faculties in Belgrade. Many professors who refused to obey the law
have been suspended.

Judge issues arrest warrants for Massera and late Agosti
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with confirmation of arrest warrant for
Agosti. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A judge who requested the arrest of former
Argentine military leader Jorge Videla has issued arrest warrants
for two more members of the former ruling junta, although one of
them died in 1997.
	   Geneva state prosecutor Bernard Bertossa confirmed Tuesday that
Judge Christine Junod has issued the warrants against former navy
chief Emilio Massera and former air force chief Orlando Agosti, who
died of cancer in October last year.
	   Junod is investigating the case of Alexis Jaccard, a
Swiss-Chilean student who disappeared in the Argentine capital,
Buenos Aires, in 1977.
	   As in the case of former army chief Videla, the Massera warrant
was issued in case he leaves Argentina in future.
	   Bertossa said he didn't know why a warrant was issued against
Agosti. Junod couldn't be reached for comment.
	   The Jaccard case already has led to Switzerland formally
requesting the extradition from Britain of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet.
	   Bertossa has said there is no prospect of an extradition request
in Videla's case as he, like Massera, has been detained in
Argentina.
	   Videla, Massera and Agosti were the original members of the
junta that ousted Isabel Peron in a 1976 coup.
	   Massera was arrested in Buenos Aires last month and Videla, a
former army lieutenant general, was detained earlier this year,
both on charges of child kidnapping and falsifying documents.
	   A civilian court sentenced Massera and Videla to life in prison
in 1985 for human rights violations, but they were pardoned in 1990
by President Carlos Menem. The child kidnapping charges are not
covered by the pardon.
	   Agosti was convicted in eight cases of torture and sentenced to
three years and nine months in jail. He had completed his sentence
by the time of the pardon.
	   An Argentine government report says more than 9,000 people
disappeared between 1976-83 when the military cracked down on
leftists and political dissidents. Rights groups put the figure
closer to 30,000.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power there in 1973. He fled to Argentina and
on to Switzerland after being released from prison the following
year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Following a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by Jaccard's
widow, Switzerland requested Pinochet's arrest with a view to
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   Switzerland has launched an inquiry into the role of its embassy
in Argentina in Jaccard's disappearance.

Libyan parliament ends its session with a government reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Libya-Lockerbie

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya announced a Cabinet reshuffle Tuesday,
dissolving one ministry and dividing another.
	   The changes were announced by Al-Zanati Mohamed al-Zanati, the
secretary general of the General People's Congress, as the
parliament is called, at the end of an eight-day session of the
forum.
	   Al-Zanati said the Ministry of Unity, which dealt with Libya's
relations with Arab states, had been dissolved.
	   Its functions would be taken over by the Ministry of Foreign
Liaison, he said. This means that Libya's ambassadors to Arab
states would report in future to Foreign Minister Omar
al-Muntasser.
	   The outgoing minister of unity, Jumaa al-Fazzani, had been made
minister of culture, al-Zanati said. The move entailed hiving off
the cultural department from the Ministry of Information, Culture
and Popular Mobilization.
	   The dissolution of the Unity Ministry was seen as expressing
Libya's resentment over the fact that Arab states had refused to
follow African states in deciding to ignore the U.N. ban on flights
to and from Libya.
	   The Organization of African Unity voted in June to violate the
ban, which was imposed in 1992 in a bid to force Libya to hand over
two men wanted for the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
	   But in meeting later this year the Arab League rejected Libya's
call for its member states to ignore the ban.
	   Announcing several changes of portfolio, al-Zanati said that
Justice Minister Mohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy would also become
Minister of Public Security and that the outgoing minister, Mohamed
Mahmoud Hejazi, had been appointed Minister of Youth and Sports.
	   Maatoub Mohammed Maatoub was appointed Minister of Education and
Scientific Research, replacing Mahdi Muftah Imbiresh.
	   Hteiwis Hteiwis was made Minister of Health and Ali Youssef
Jumaa became Minister of Agriculture, replacing Ali ben Ramadan.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi usually decides Cabinet
reshuffles.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A senior narcotics official, dismissed
on charges of ties to organized crime, fired back Tuesday accusing
his superiors of taking millions of dollars in bribes from drug
barons to have him removed.
	   The case is the latest of a series alleging ties between state
officials and mobsters.
	   Istanbul's former chief of narcotics, Ferruh Tankus, said senior
police officials fired him Monday after receiving dlrs 4 million in
kickbacks from drug gangs who he claimed were suffering from his
actions.

launched into Tankus' accusations.

Pinochet lawyers ask Britain's highest court to set aside judgment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 6-10 with lawyer for Spanish
government &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Declaring that public confidence in the courts is
at stake, lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet argued Tuesday that a
judge's close links with Amnesty International risked bias.
	   ``We submit that confidence in the judiciary must be earned and
not assumed,'' said Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for Pinochet, who is
asking Britain's highest court to set aside its own ruling that
denied the former Chilean dictator immunity from arrest as a former
head of state.
	   The return of Pinochet's British lawyers to the House of Lords
marks the next step in a long legal battle by the 83-year-old
general to avoid extradition to Spain on charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Ms. Montgomery said Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, who voted
against immunity for Pinochet in the Lords' 3-2 decision on Nov.
25, had a longstanding, intense relationship with Amnesty
International, a human rights group that played a key role in the
campaign to have Pinochet arrested.
	   The relationship ``gave rise at the very least to a real danger
of bias,'' Ms. Montgomery told a tribunal of five new judges.
	   Amnesty has said Hoffmann _ the unpaid director of its
fundraising arm _ played no part in its Pinochet campaign. The
group maintains that the general's lawyers could have found out
about the link before the first hearing.
	   The judge himself, a native-born South African and opponent of
apartheid, has not commented publicly.
	   Alun Jones, a lawyer for the Spanish government, countered that
Pinochet's lawyers had brought the case only after failing to
persuade Home Secretary Jack Straw that Hoffmann was biased.
	   Straw, a British Cabinet member, gave the go-ahead Dec. 9 for
Spain to start extradition proceedings in court, and said he did
not accept that Hoffmann was biased.
	   ``This petition is an abuse of the process of your lordships'
House,'' said Jones.
	   Ms. Montgomery said Hoffmann appeared as a lawyer on Amnesty's
behalf when the human rights group was seeking charitable status in
1982. After that application was refused on the grounds the group
is a political body, it set up Amnesty International Charity Ltd,
which raises funds.
	   Hoffmann has been a director of the charity since 1990, and is
now its chairman. His wife, Gillian, has been a secretary at
Amnesty's London press office since 1977.
	   Ms. Montgomery said both Hoffmanns' activities reveal ``a
longstanding, deep-rooted family connection which continues with
Amnesty to this present day.''
	   The fact that Hoffmann receives no pay is either irrelevant or
reveals a degree of commitment, she said.
	   The Lords hearing, scheduled to last two days, apparently marks
the first time since 1823 that the court has been asked to sit in
judgment of itself. The previous challenge, involving a land
ownership case, failed, according to one news report.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a hospital while recuperating
from back surgery. He is now under police guard at a rented mansion
at Wentworth, an exclusive residential estate 20 miles (30 kms)
west of London.
	   As well as the attempt in the Lords, Pinochet's lawyers also
plan to challenge a British Cabinet member's decision to allow
Spain to try to extradite him.
	   The London firm of attorneys Kingsley Napley said Monday it
would ask England's High Court to challenge Straw's approval of the
Spanish extradition request.

Morocco announces plan to fight unemployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ Morocco has announced a new plan to
fight 16 percent unemployment, one of the key challenges facing the
new Socialist government.
	   Labor Minister Khalid Alioua said Monday the government aims to
spend more than dlrs 80 million on the problem and to create
225,000 new jobs a year, compared to the current 183,000.
	   Alioua spoke after a three-day national meeting dedicated to the
sensitive issue.
	   In Morocco each year, thousands of university graduates cannot
find a job. They have responded with demonstrations and sit-ins in
front of parliament. In October, six students were injured when
police forcibly dispersed one such demonstration in Rabat, the
capital.
	   The three-day meeting, which ended Monday, was the first time
that employers, unions, government agencies and non-governmental
organizations had joined together to try to find a new strategy to
fight unemployment.
	   King Hassan II, who sees joblessness as the country's biggest
problem after the conflict over the Western Sahara, has given his
full backing to the initiative.
	   The World Bank has made a dlrs 250 million contribution to a
fund for social development in Morocco. That comes in addition to a
dlrs 200 million grant from the African Bank for Development.
	   Unemployment is a huge challenge for the new Socialist
government of Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi, which is also
working to open up the country's political system.
	   ``Our challenge is twofold,'' Alioua said. ``On top of a
political transition, we have to manage an economic transition.''

	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace accord, but he
declared the Mideast peace process ``back on track.''
	   Clinton held out hope the pullback would take place soon. ``We
will have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine,''
he said after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success.
	   ``I think we are back on track again and we're going to see this
thing through,'' he told reporters at this border checkpoint. ``I
have achieved what I came here to achieve.''
	   In remarks to reporters later, Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, qualified Clinton's remark about the
peace process being on track. ``It's a bumpy track,'' he said with
a smile.
	   Clinton said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would return
to the region soon for further talks.
	   Before he left Israel for Washington, Clinton met with Ehud
Barak, leader of Israel's opposition Labor Party who is challenging
Netanyahu's leadership.

International verifiers move into abandoned Kosovo town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four international peace monitors
moved into a damaged house Tuesday in this abandoned but strategic
town in Kosovo, in a move aimed at persuading refugees to return
home.
	   The 3,000 ethnic Albanian residents of Malisevo, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina, fled in July when Serbian forces
overran the Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold.
	   While much of the town is badly damaged or destroyed, many say
they would like to return but are afraid to because of the large
contingent of heavily armed Serb police. Nighttime shootings are
frequent.
	   The Serbs say withdrawing from Malisevo would give the KLA a
strong base in the central Drenica region that spawned the rebel
movement.
	   The verifiers moving into Malisevo include two Americans from
the U.S. Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission _ a group that
ultimately will be folded into the Kosovo Verification Mission
overseeing peace in the shattered Serbian province. Two Britons
were expected to join them on the first night, plus a translator,
after a day of cleanup and restoration work.
	   ``Hopefully this will give people enough confidence to come back
home,'' Dayna Brown, humanitarian affairs liaison for U.S. KDOM,
said of the verifiers' move into the house on Malisevo's main
street.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The prime minister was quoted Tuesday as
saying Turkey and Italy are discussing the possibility of sending
Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan to Albania for trial to
resolve their dispute over his extradition. But Italy and Albania
denied the report.
	   Ocalan, who was detained in Rome on Nov. 12, is wanted in his
home country of Turkey for trial on terrorism charges. But Italy
refuses to return him to Turkey, where he faces a possible death
sentence.
	   ``We are looking into Albania,'' the Hurriyet newspaper quoted
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz as saying. ``The Italians are favorable
to the idea. We won't object to that country.''
	   But Italy's premier, Massimo D'Alema, said in a news release in
Rome that Italy ``had not even considered'' the ``made up
hypothesis'' of expelling Ocalan to another country.
	   In Tirana, Albanian Information Minister Mussa Ulqini also
denied there had been any discussions of Ocalan coming to Albania.
	   Sending Ocalan to Albania would allow Italy to relieve its
diplomatic crisis with Ankara and end an unofficial boycott on
Italian goods by Turks. Turkey also could keep Ocalan under close
surveillance in Albania, a country it regards a close ally.
	   ``If he is sent to Albania he will be under observation. His
every move will be under control,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Ocalan is expected to be free to leave Italy unless Germany acts
on an arrest warrant it had issued for the rebel leader's capture.
	   Yilmaz said the sides had discussed, but had not agreed on,
Pakistan, North Korea or Libya as other possible third countries.
	   ``We suggested Pakistan, but they didn't accept. They wanted
North Korea but we didn't think it was suitable. The Americans
didn't approve of Libya,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.
	   On Monday the U.S. State Department reiterated its belief that
Ocalan needed to be brought to justice ``for the terrorist crimes
of which he is accused, in a manner consistent with international
standards.''
	   ``Italy cannot give refuge to (Ocalan) any longer. It cannot
withstand world pressure. It will certainly send him to a third
country,'' Yilmaz added.
	   Meanwhile, 21 Kurdish rebels and two Turkish soldiers were
killed in renewed fighting in southeast Turkey, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   Newspapers also reported that the PKK has sent 26 militants to
various Turkish cities to carry out suicide bomb attacks.
	   The identities and pictures of the suspected militants, most of
them women in their 20s, have been posted in all police
headquarters, the daily Zaman reported Tuesday quoting police
sources.
	   An 18-year-old woman killed herself and injured nine others in a
suicide bombing earlier this month. Authorities believe it was a
PKK action.

	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela narrowly
escaped injury in a tornado on Tuesday, a presidential spokeswoman
said.
	   Eleven people were killed in the tornado that hit this town near
the southeastern coast and caused a wall to collapse on victims
waiting at a bus stop.
	   Mandela, 80, was inside a pharmacy when the storm hit the shop
on main street, spokeswoman Priscilla Naidoo told the South African
Press Association.
	   He was told to lie on the ground by his guards, who covered him
with their bodies while the tornado raged, Naidoo said.
	   The doors and windows of the pharmacy were shattered by the
force of the storm, and part of the roof caved in.
	   ``The president and his bodyguards escaped unharmed and they
went home afterwards,'' Naidoo said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist-dominated parliament won't
begin discussing the draft 1999 budget until next week and won't
rush to approve it, even though the government wants it urgently,
lawmakers said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government is hoping the
budget is passed before January so it can begin acting on its plan
to pull the country out of its worst economic crisis of the
post-Soviet era.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget draft probably wouldn't start
until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and would not finish quickly.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's
Cabinet has widespread support in the Communist-dominated lower
house, the State Duma, raising hopes that the budget may be
approved without lengthy debate.
	   Seleznyov said the Duma already supports much of the draft
budget, because for the first time in several years, Russia is
``living under the conditions of political consensus.''
	   Still, the Communist Party's No. 2 man, Valentin Kuptsov, said
Tuesday that parliament will take its time reviewing the budget,
despite the government's urging to hurry.
	   ``Neither the party nor the voters would appreciate it if we
skip studying the government's proposals in depth,'' Kuptsov was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Alexander Shokhin, head of the centrist Our Home is Russia
faction, has warned that the Communists were likely to demand
political concessions and even the right to censor Russia's
television in exchange for approving the budget.
	   In recent weeks, hard-liners have been adamantly demanding the
introduction of censorship on television, which they say is too
anti-Communist.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the dollar. But independent
economists have warned that the ruble rate was unrealistic, and
inflation would be much higher.
	   On Tuesday, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko conceded
the ruble may lose more value than the government had predicted.
	   The ruble already fell to 21.75 to the dollar in interbank
trading Tuesday, down from 21.35 during the previous session
Friday.
	   The new budget relies on foreign loans that may not materialize,
and on restructuring nearly half of Russia's mammoth foreign debt _
something that creditors have not yet agreed to do.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Foreign loans have been frozen since the government devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The passage of
the budget could help Russia attract new cash from international
lenders.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying that obstacles must be overcome before
the men are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial. It ``means that they
will hand over the suspects sooner rather than later,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``It looks like they've made a clear decision, but we don't know
if this is the final line or what the time-scale is,'' he added.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, the ambassador of
Slovenia, which is a member of the Security Council, said Libyan
Parliament's decision was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' said Danilo Turk. He
said the ball was still in Libya's court.
	   ``I don't think that there are any obstacles left on the side of
the United Nations. The Security Council has adopted the decision.
What is needed is the transfer of the two suspects,'' Turk said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal for
trial of the suspects in the Netherlands.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy warned Kosovo's
factions on Tuesday that they were playing with ``dynamite'' as he
sought to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
worst violation yet of a cease-fire left 37 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Richard Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in
any way deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke later went to Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic, in which he intended to ``emphasize the need
to move ahead expeditiously'' on a peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   Yugoslav soldiers killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gunbattle near the border with
Albania on Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off border area. Residents said the Yugoslav army sent
armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the remote region
and continued to bar entry.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying the
verifiers access violated an October agreement reached between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, and a formal protest would be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's dominant republic of Serbia. The
deal averted NATO airstrikes and bought time for diplomats to try
to work out an agreement on the future of the province, where
majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   The violence began when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
separatists in February, leaving hundreds dead and an estimated
300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The rebels
say they won't accept anything short of independence. Serbia,
meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.
	   He said ethnic Albanians are ``dissatisfied'' by the mediation
of Holbrooke and U.S. envoy Christopher Hill because ``they are
mostly passive observers.
	   ``The latest bloodshed in Kosovo is the best sign of the effects
of their work,'' Demaci said.
	   The recent violence includes the death of at least six Serbs,
including five teenagers, slain late Monday in the town of Pec when
unidentified assailants opened fire with machine guns in a bar.
Three other Serbs were wounded. Serb media blamed the killings on
the ethnic Albanians.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec on Tuesday to protest
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces, which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent a message of condolence
to the families of slain Serbs, saying, ``We will not hesitate to
prevent anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of our
citizens.''
	   Alluding to the violence, Holbrooke said, ``Yesterday was not a
good day'' in Kosovo, but added: ``We are determined to continue
our effort.
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved that they are playing
with dynamite,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''

Human rights group denounces torture and overcrowding in Brazilian
</HEADLINE>
prisons &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian prison guards and police
routinely beat and torture inmates, especially in police lockups
used as makeshift cells for Brazil's sorely overcrowded prison
system, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in a report Tuesday.
	   ``Prisoners credibly described ... being stripped naked and
subjected to beatings, electrical shocks and near drownings,'' the
organization said.
	   ``Official violence is common,'' Joanne Mariner, the group's
associate counsel said in a statement. ``Authorities routinely use
extreme violence including beatings with sticks or metal bars.''
	   With Brazilian prisons generally filled to twice their capacity,
convicts often serve their sentences in police precinct cells meant
only for suspects awaiting trial, the group said in its 150-page
report ``Behind Bars in Brazil.''
	   These jails typically are extremely unsanitary, with as many as
200 inmates crammed into spaces built for 40. Diseases such as AIDS
and tuberculosis are endemic, and ``severely ill and even dying
prisoners remain crowded with other inmates,'' the report said.
	   The group, which interviewed inmates throughout the country from
September 1997 to March of this year, recommended a crackdown on
the impunity of police and prison guards, and an end to the
practice of using jails as makeshift prisons. It also suggested
increasing the use of alternatives to prison for lesser offenders,
and separating seriously dangerous offenders from other inmates.
	   Brazil's Justice Ministry said it had not yet received the
report, and that therefore it could not comment.
	   Human Rights Watch acknowledged that the government is trying to
expand its prisons.
	   But the prison plans ``won't resolve the chronic ills of the
prison system, such as the appalling problem of custodial
violence,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the group's executive
director of the Americas Division. ``Current prison construction
will almost certainly fail to alleviate overcrowding, given the
continuous growth of the inmate population.''
	   Nationwide, an estimated 170,000 prisoners are crammed into a
system designed to accommodate less than half that number. Inmates
often sleep on floors or are forced to share the same mattress by
sleeping in shifts.
	   Prison officials concede that overcrowding is the principal
reason for violent inmate insurrections that have become almost a
daily occurrence. The majority who revolt demand nothing more than
to be transferred from a police jail to a penitentiary.
	   Last year, there were 195 riots in jails reported in Sao Paulo
state alone.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso recently signed a bill
authorizing alternative sentences for certain offenders.
	   The legislation permits judges to sentence nonviolent criminals
facing no more than four years in prison to house arrest or drug
treatment. Judges also can order the convicts to pay an indemnity
to their victim or sign over their assets to a national
penitentiary fund.
	   The Justice Ministry estimates that 30,000 inmates _ nearly 20
percent of the prison population _ would be eligible for an
alternative sentence under the new law.

Students call for dismissal of Iran's top hard-line officials
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 1,000 university students,
protesting a wave of mysterious murders of dissidents, called
Tuesday for the dismissal of Iran's chief judge and the heads of
the intelligence and security services.
	   Earlier, some 3,000 writers, poets and artists attended the
funeral of one of the five slain dissidents, Mohammad Mokhtari,
whose body was found on the outskirts of Tehran last week. He had
apparently been strangled. Two dissidents remain missing.
	   A resolution read at the end of a rally at Tehran's Amir Kabir
University called for the dismissal of the head of the judiciary,
chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, intelligence chief Dorri Najafabadi
and the head of the security forces, Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian.
	   The students blamed the hard-line officials for indirectly
encouraging violent incidents by not condemning or trying to stop
them.
	   ``Why don't you tell people who are committing these acts?''
student leader Alireza Siyasi told the crowed.
	   He said the judiciary and security forces had failed to
apprehend vigilantes _ allied with hard-liners _ for breaking up
pro-democracy demonstrations and attacking newspapers and
dissidents who call for more freedom.
	   ``Our peaceful demonstrations have been attacked and our friends
beaten, but no security institution ever identified any
aggressor,'' Siyasi said. ``The people want answers!''
	   Authorities said Monday that several suspects had been arrested
in connection with the killings over the past month.
	   Judicial spokesman Nasiri Savadkuhi said authorities are
``striving to arrest all the perpetrators of the recent mysterious
killings,'' Iranian television reported. It gave no details.
	   The Judiciary on Tuesday blamed the murders on foreign agents.

Besieged Angolan city reported calm, but rebels maintain pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Angola-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan city of Kuito was reportedly
calm Tuesday, though rebel forces maintained their control over
most of the surrounding area and access to the city was said to be
severely restricted.
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said IRC staff in
Kuito reported a lull in fighting between UNITA rebels and the
besieged government army.
	   ``The situation was calm this morning,'' IRC spokesman Paulo
Delorca said.
	   He said the government and aid agencies had enough supplies to
feed civilians in the city whose population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   ``For the moment, it is not an emergency (aid) situation,''
Delorca said.
	   However, he said access to Kuito by road and air was not safe
because UNITA forces hold areas to the north, east and west.
	   UNITA's tightening grip on Kuito, which lies about 500 kms (300
miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda, halted the government
evacuation of women and children to the capital after only three
transport planes took off Monday.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting restarted Dec. 4, ending a four-year peace pact.
	   UNITA shot down a transport plane shortly after it took off from
Kuito on Monday, and drove the army out of Chinguar, a town 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of the city.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement, which was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

	   In the tornado, trees were uprooted and roofs swept off houses,
said police spokesman Mzukisi Fatyela. The roof of a local hospital
and blood blank also collapsed, according to SABC-TV film.
	   ``Big trees and traffic lights have been blown over. We have
managed to get police to many areas but the trees are blocking
traffic flow,'' Fatyela said.
	   SAPA and SABC radio said 11 people were killed in the storm.
	   ``I was in a car, when a cloud covered the town. I couldn't see
anything. There were large hail stones,'' Lawrence Nkosi, an
eyewitness, told SABC radio.
	   Umtata is located about 50 kilometers inland from the Indian
Ocean on the country's southeastern coast. The tornado happened in
mid afternoon, between 3 and 4:45 p.m. local time (1300GMT to
1445GMT).
	   Mandela is on holiday at his home town, Qunu, near Umtata.
	   ``He always visits the pharmacy when he is at home,'' Naidoo was
quoted by SAPA as saying.
	   Naidoo could not be reached for comment.
	   Another tornado touched down Tuesday about 250 kilometers (155
miles) west of Umtata in Hogsback, where ten people went missing
but were later found. There were three injuries in Hogsback, the
radio said.
	   Heavy rain and storms have plagued South Africa since Sunday.
	   Searchers have recovered ten bodies and presume another four
were drowned Sunday after the vehicle they were riding in was swept
into a river off a bridge near Badplaas, 250 kilometers (155 miles)
east of Johannesburg.
	   In the Cape Town region, on the west coast, heavy rains on
Monday forced the evacuation of 500 people from their homes in
Caledon.
	   Lightning in Cape Town on Monday shut down the signal and
overhead power lines of commuter trains and set afire the thatched
roof at the home of Earl Charles Spencer, brother to the late
Princess Diana.

Army accuses prosecutors of concealing information on 1989
</HEADLINE>
revolution

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government on Tuesday accused
prosecutors of deliberately ignoring evidence and witnesses who had
information on the 1989 anti-communist revolt where some 1,000
people died.
	   Almost one decade after the bloody revolt where former Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled and executed, events
surrounding the uprising remain murky.
	   The unprecedented allegations against prosecutors came after the
general prosecutor, Mircea Criste, recently said several former
high-ranking army officers would be put on trial for murder during
the revolt. Other active duty officers may also be prosecuted,
Criste said Tuesday.
	   The army was ordered by Ceausescu to shoot unarmed
demonstrators.
	   ``We protest against the way the files from the revolution are
being examined, not the right to examine these events,'' said the
defense ministry in a statement.
	   Under the former government of ex-communists, investigations
into the 1989 revolt were stalled for political reasons. Defense
Minister Victor Stanculescu and Interior Minister Mihai Chitac are
among those being charged with first-degree murder, national news
agency Rompres reported.
	   Reformists came to power two years ago, promising to make public
what occurred during the anti-communist uprising. It is still not
known who ordered unarmed protesters to be shot after Ceausescu's
death.

	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ More than 2,550 tourists safely
evacuated a Caribbean cruise ship Tuesday after the vessel struck a
reef, began taking on water and was purposely beached in a bay off
St. Maarten.
	   Fishermen and boat owners pitched in for four hours to help
ferry all the passengers off the 74,000-ton Monarch of the Seas,
which is owned by Royal Caribbean International.
	   ``The fortunate thing is that no one was hurt,'' Royal Caribbean
spokesman Rich Steck said from a hotel on the Dutch half of the
island.
	   ``It was quite a drama this morning, but no one was hurt and
everyone is safe,'' said Nicolaas Martina, who witnessed the rescue
from the Holland House Beach Hotel overlooking Great Bay in
southern St. Maarten. The northern side is the French territory of
St. Martin.
	   The 6-year-old ship struck the reef sometime before 2 a.m. (1
a.m. EST), said Joe Peterson, secretary of the local Sea Rescue
Foundation.
	   Steck said the ship, which carried 2,557 passengers and 831
crew, was on its way from St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands to
the French island of Martinique when a tourist developed a heart
problem and the captain diverted to St. Maarten to drop the patient
off.
	   As the ship was leaving the island, it struck a reef and began
to take on water in three of its 18 watertight compartments. ``It
wasn't sinking or anything but we decided the best thing to do was
to run the ship aground on purpose, to get it on soft sand in the
harbor,'' Steck said.
	   Officials put up the stranded tourists in hotels and community
centers in both Dutch and French St. Maarten and were booking
flights for them to leave the island, which is 150 miles (240
kilometers) east of Puerto Rico.
	   ``Most of them are OK. Some of them are in shock. They're crying
because they lost their belongings,'' said Sayra Martina,
reservations manager at the Pelican Resort and Casino, where 40
passengers were staying.
	   ``There was a lot of discomfort, because they had been waiting
at the pier since 3 a.m.,'' the Rev. Rene Realuyo, parish priest
for St. Martin of Tours Church, said of the passengers. ``There
were some complaints, but they were treated very well by the crew
members.''
	   The Monarch picks up passengers in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and
cruises the Caribbean during the current high season.
	   Divers were inspecting the ship, which was damaged on both sides
of the hull, Harbor Master Sunny Hoo said in remarks broadcast by
GVBC Radio. The vessel's draft is 25 feet (7 meters), while the
shallowest part of the reef sits 10 feet (3 meters) underwater, Hoo
said.
	   Crew members deployed a boom around the ship to contain any oil
spill, but no leaks were reported, Hoo said.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew planned to survey the area to
determine whether there was any threat of pollution from the ship,
Petty Officer Alberto Torres said in a telephone interview from San
Juan, Puerto Rico.
	   Finance Commissioner Lenny Priest congratulated St. Maarten
residents for responding rapidly to the pre-dawn emergency. ``If
these people weren't transported before business started in St.
Maarten we would have encountered a chaotic situation in
Philipsburg,'' he said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit's efforts
to form a minority government appeared deadlocked Tuesday after he
failed to gain agreement from a key center-left party.
	   Ecevit rejected an offer from center-left leader Deniz Baykal to
form a minority coalition government together.
	   Baykal, who leads the Republican People's Party, refused to
endorse a minority government which would consist of only Ecevit's
Democratic Left Party.
	   Ecevit was designated to form a new government two weeks ago
after the coalition led by Premier Mesut Yilmaz collapsed following
corruption and mafia scandals.
	   The support of Baykal's 55 seats in parliament is crucial to
Ecevit.
	   Ecevit has the backing of Yilmaz's center-right party Motherland
party, but lacks a majority.
	   Baykal said a center-left alliance would help heal long-standing
divisions in Turkey's social democratic movement.
	   But Ecevit described Baykal's proposal as ``unrealistic,''
claiming that such an alliance would only polarize politics and
risk reviving the bitter confrontations between leftist and
rightist groups in the 1970s.
	   Baykal said if Ecevit failed to put together a coalition, he
would insist that a politician with a lower profile and not a party
leader try to form a government.
	   Ecevit said the two would meet again Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Strikes and labor protests brought
transportation chaos and a bureaucratic standstill Tuesday in a
nationwide display of anger against austerity measures by the Greek
government.
	   The 24-hour general strike _ joined by a range of unions from
physicians to bus drivers _ was called to oppose efforts to
streamline the economy and qualify for participation in the
European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   Labor groups are fighting government plans to privatize state
holdings and freeze wages to lower inflation. They also fear losing
job security and other benefits as Greece tries to conform with the
strict EU guidelines.
	   Parliament opens debate on the budget Thursday, possibly
launching another round of labor unrest. Premier Costas Simitis has
vowed to stick to his austerity program.
	   Public transport workers held work stoppages during the morning
rush hour, causing widespread gridlock in Athens. Only trolley
cars, which operate mainly in the city center, continued working.
	   High school students and teachers joined the demonstrations,
protesting government education reforms. They are already occupying
1,500 schools around the country. They are refusing to hold classes
until the government backs off on the changes.
	   During the demonstrations, youths threw stones and a gas bomb at
one of Athens' main post offices, causing minor damage. There were
no injuries.
	   Public hospitals were accepting only emergency cases.
	   Banks, post and tax offices and other state services remained
shut throughout the day.

Ukrainian president orders probe into alumina plant scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's national Security Service will
investigate events surrounding a major alumina plant whose top
executives are suspected of corruption, President Leonid Kuchma
said Tuesday.
	   Kuchma told regional newspaper editors that he has ordered the
Security Service (SBU) to conduct such a probe into the
state-controlled Mykolaiv Alumina Plant.
	   The SBU branch in the southern Mykolaiv region announced last
week that it had launched criminal cases against senior executives
of the plant on suspicion of smuggling and concealing hard currency
earnings.
	   Last week, plant director Vitaliy Meshyn said the corruption
probe was largely triggered by his resistance to attempts to
privatize the plant, and asked Kuchma and parliament for
protection.
	   Meshyn said Monday that he and seven of his deputies were under
investigation, the Interfax news agency reported. Meshyn said he
hoped to meet with Kuchma during the president's planned visit to
the region and ``personally explain the situation.''
	   Meshyn blamed unspecified companies of seeking to ``receive full
control over the plant and use it as an instrument of controlling
the aluminum industry of Russia and Tajikistan.''
	   Kuchma said Tuesday the regional SBU branch would not launch
criminal cases against plant executives ``for the sake of a
political show'' alone.
	   The profitable Mykolaiv company, which has 6,500 workers, is
capable of annually producing 1 million tons (1.1 million short
tons) of alumina, or aluminum oxide, most of which it exports to
Russia and Tajikistan. Alumina, found in bauxite and clay, is used
for aluminum production.
	   Several tenders announced by the government for the purchase of
up to 30 percent of the plant's shares have been canceled amid
sharp opposition by its executives.
	   Many in the leftist-leaning parliament have backed the plant,
fearing a foreign takeover of what is seen as an exports asset for
the former Soviet republic.
	   Plant workers warned Tuesday that their partners abroad already
have started to look for alternative sources of alumina, while some
have stopped payments. Energy, gas and transport companies are
demanding that the plant immediately cover its debts, Interfax
reported.

German bank employees may protest during weekend of euro debut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES throughout that employees contemplating protest
action &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Bank employees seeking a wage increase
said Tuesday they are thinking of pushing their cause with a
protest starting Jan. 1 _ the day Europe's common currency, the
euro, makes its debut.
	   The euro officially comes into existence at midnight Dec. 31,
and German banks need employees to work through the weekend to
prepare for the first day of euro trading on money markets Jan. 4.
	   Union-linked employee councils at individual banks are
considering a protest in which they would refuse to approve
overtime work for the euro conversion weekend.
	   ``That would be a disaster for German banks and would also be a
competitive disadvantage with other banks'' in the 11 countries
adopting the euro, said Dennis Phillips, a spokesman for
Commerzbank.
	   He noted that Commerzbank has spent roughly 150 million marks
(dlrs 90 million) over the past five years to get ready for the
euro launch.
	   ``I'd warn against taking any hard stance that wouldn't lead to
a compromise,'' Phillips said of talks between banks and unions.
``I'm voicing my hope they'll find a compromise.''
	   Wage negotiations for the 470,000 employees in Germany's banking
sector stalled Monday in their first round. Round two is scheduled
for Jan. 28.
	   Uwe Foullong, a spokesman for the HBV trade, banking and
insurance employees union, said a decision on the protests can be
expected within the next few days.
	   HBV is demanding a 6.5 percent pay raise for banking employees,
while the DAG white collar workers' union is asking for 6 percent.
	   Only around 10 percent of bank employees in Germany are
organized in unions, but most of them will be involved when banks
convert all their mark-denominated securities, payment and
settlement systems into the euro between Dec. 31 and Jan. 4.

German drive to compensate Nazi victims bogs down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A German government drive to get industry,
banks and insurance firms to compensate slave laborers and other
Nazi victims has stalled because the companies can't agree on a
common approach.
	   Huge compensation lawsuits in the United States and fears of
more to come have led some of Germany's most powerful companies to
seek a way out. After September elections, the new left-leaning
government took up the cause by offering to help them set up a
restitution fund.
	   But a mid-December target once envisaged for unveiling the fund
passed Tuesday with no agreement in sight. Negotiations now seem
likely to drag into next year.
	   ``The talks are more complicated than expected,'' government
spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   A central dispute is whether the fund can link compensation for
two largely separate groups: slave laborers the Nazis rounded up to
work mainly for German industry during World War II, and Holocaust
survivors who are claiming pilfered assets from German insurers and
banks.
	   Daimler-Chrysler, Germany's biggest industrial group, has
demanded that banks be kept out of the fund because claims against
them are likely to be higher than for German industry, according to
a recent German newspaper report.
	   Sources familiar with the talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed Tuesday that the fund's range of participants
is still being debated. Daimler-Chrysler declined comment.
	   Pressure on German businesses to reach a broad deal on
compensation has grown sharply since last summer, when two Swiss
banks paid dlrs 1.25 billion to settle Holocaust claims.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, has
met with industry leaders three times to discuss details of the
fund, including how much will be paid and how compensation would be
distributed. No date has been announced for the next round of
talks.
	   Participants in the talks include the bosses of the cream of
corporate Germany: the Allianz insurance company, Dresdner and
Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF.
	   The German government has paid more than 100 billion marks (dlrs
60 billion) in compensation to victims of the Nazis, mainly to
Jews.
	   But it has rejected paying back wages for slave laborers,
arguing the companies involved were responsible. And many victims
in eastern Europe who were cut off during the Cold War have gotten
little or no restitution for health damage and imprisonment.
	   More than 7 million people were forced to work in Nazi Germany,
and experts believe at least 500,000 are still alive.
	   Most German firms have argued the slave workers were forced on
them by the Nazis and so the current government, as legal successor
to the Nazi regime, should be responsible.
	   But Schroeder appears to have ruled out a major government rule
in the proposed fund.

Army accuses prosecutors of concealing information on 1989
</HEADLINE>
revolution
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to CORRECT that the two ministers facing charges are
former ministers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government on Tuesday accused
prosecutors of deliberately ignoring evidence and witnesses who had
information on the 1989 anti-communist revolt where some 1,000
people died.
	   Almost one decade after the bloody revolt where former Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled and executed, events
surrounding the uprising remain murky.
	   The unprecedented allegations against prosecutors came after the
general prosecutor, Mircea Criste, recently said several former
high-ranking army officers would be put on trial for murder during
the revolt. Other active duty officers may also be prosecuted,
Criste said Tuesday.
	   The army was ordered by Ceausescu to shoot unarmed
demonstrators.
	   ``We protest against the way the files from the revolution are
being examined, not the right to examine these events,'' said the
defense ministry in a statement.
	   Under the former government of ex-communists, investigations
into the 1989 revolt were stalled for political reasons. Former
Defense Minister Victor Stanculescu and former Interior Minister
Mihai Chitac are among those being charged with first-degree
murder, national news agency Rompres reported.
	   Reformists came to power two years ago, promising to make public
what occurred during the anti-communist uprising. It is still not
known who ordered unarmed protesters to be shot after Ceausescu's
death.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from his
latest illness, held a welcoming ceremony Tuesday for new
ambassadors to Russia, his press center said.
	   Yeltsin traveled from his country residence to the Kremlin and
greeted new ambassadors from China, India, Qatar, Luxembourg, and
10 other countries.
	   Yeltsin separately mentioned Russia's wishes to expand ties with
China, India, and other nations in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
He addressed European issues by saying that security on the
continent is threatened by the conflict in the separatist Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, and called for a political settlement.
	   ``In the Middle East and the area of the Persian Gulf, we firmly
support ensuring security of all Gulf states and turning this area
into a zone of peace and stability,'' Yeltsin said, according to
the speech carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He also called for a ``multi-polar world'' _ Russia's favorite
euphemism for counterbalancing what it sees as growing U.S.
influence in the world.
	   Yeltsin also met the head of Russia's Federal Security Service,
Vladimir Putin, to discuss last month's killing of prominent
lawmaker Galina Starovoitova, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin told Interfax.
	   Starovoitova, a liberal parliament deputy, was found slain in
the entrance to her St. Petersburg apartment on Nov. 20, and
Yeltsin said he would take personal control over the investigation.
	   After Tuesday's meetings, Yeltsin returned to his Gorky-9
country home just west of Moscow, Yakushkin said, according to
Interfax.
	   Though still recuperating, Yeltsin was released from the
hospital last week after receiving treatment for pneumonia for more
than two weeks. He had stayed at another country residence most of
the time since then, making occasional trips into the Kremlin.
	   Despite his repeated ailments, Yeltsin insists he will serve out
his term, which runs until the year 2000. He has looked relatively
healthy and animated in public appearances since his release from
the hospital.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial

victims, U.N. Security Council member. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying obstacles must be overcome before the men
are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial. It ``means that they
will hand over the suspects sooner rather than later,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``It looks like they've made a clear decision, but we don't know
if this is the final line or what the time scale is,'' he added.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with
Gadhafi to discuss a possible handover of the suspects. No
agreement was reached but Annan said Libya was expected to reach a
decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, the ambassador of
Slovenia, which is a member of the Security Council, said the
Libyan Parliament's decision was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' said Danilo Turk. He
said the ball was still in Libya's court.
	   ``I don't think that there are any obstacles left on the side of
the United Nations. The Security Council has adopted the decision.
What is needed is the transfer of the two suspects,'' Turk said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal for
trial of the suspects in the Netherlands.

Economy, lagging support put pinch on J-League
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ Three years after it was launched, the
J-League prospered with average crowds of 18,000; it had grown from
12 to 16 teams and appeared to be the model of success.
	   Optimism flourished.
	   When Yokohama city officials received approval to host the 2002
World Cup final just south of Tokyo, price was not a concern.
	   It built a 60 billion yen (dlrs 500 million), 70,000-seat
stadium, as magnificent as it was audacious _ replete with moat,
high-tech camera mounts and computerized water pipes under the
playing field.
	   Yet even in a year when the Japanese national team made a better
than expected debut at the World Cup, neither the stadium, the
national team nor the 2002 finals is the main topic of
conversation.
	   Instead, most are wondering about the survival of the J-League.
	   Several signs are ominous:
	   _ Six seasons after its 1993 debut, every one of the 18 clubs in
the J-League is operating at a loss, many abandoned by sponsors and
fans hard hit by this country's worst recession since World War II.
	   _ Earlier this month, the Yokohama Flugels were on the verge of
financial collapse and was forced to merge with a cross-town rival.
	   _ The Yomiuri newspaper, which also owns the Tokyo Giants
baseball team, recently decided to sell its stake in two-time
J-League champion Verdy Kawasaki after the club posted a loss of
2.6 billion yen (dlrs 22 million) last year.
	   The worst may be ahead.
	   Yomiuri President Tsuneo Watanabe said that unless the league
awakens to the importance of profits and marketing, more failures
like the Flugels are ``inevitable.''
	   ``The J-League's existence itself is in jeopardy,'' he said.
	   The troubles are surfacing just months after Japanese soccer
appeared to have finally arrived on the international stage with
its World Cup debut in France.
	   Soccer fever was ablaze. TV ratings for Japan's matches against
Argentina and Croatia reached 60 percent in the Tokyo area _ the
highest in three decades for a sports event.
	   World Cup exposure helped midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata transfer
to Perugia _ only the second Japanese ever to sign with an Italian
Serie A club.
	   But more importantly, the better-than-expected debut eased
concerns over Japan's arrangement to play cohost for the 2002 World
Cup with South Korea.
	   Along with the obvious logistical problems _ particularly in
security and ticket distribution _ the choice of cohosts carries a
very heavy political significance.
	   Japan ruled Korea as a colony for most of the first half of the
century, and relations between the two neighbors have never been
even lukewarm.
	   With South Korea already having qualified four times for the
World Cup finals before 1998, the J-League was a major factor in
helping Japan convincing some that it was a soccer equal to their
neighbors across the Sea of Japan.
	   Now, some wonder if it can last until the quadrennial event gets
here.
	   The Flugels' woes began earlier this year, when ailing
construction company Sato Kogyo withdrew its stake in the team,
leaving All Nippon Airways the sole owner.
	   Struggling under the team's yearly deficit of about 1.3 billion
yen (dlrs 11 million), the cash-strapped airline signed a merger
agreement on Dec. 2 with the Marinos.
	   League officials have defended the Flugels' merger as
financially sound, and say the league is gradually developing
soccer as a community sport.
	   Still, the Yomiuri Giants attract an average crowd of 55,000 to
the Tokyo Dome, while the Flugels draws 15,000 _ and that's above
average for the league.
	   ``More time should have been taken to develop the true
groundwork for the J-League,'' Flugels defender Koji Maeda said.
``Instead, it was treated as a fad for quick money.''
	   There is hope, however.
	   Cutting salaries is one possible, though partial, fix.
	   The league now has no salary cap, except for a 10 million yen
(dlrs 84,000) limit for rookies starting next season. A handful of
players reportedly receive more than 100 million yen (dlrs 840,000)
a season.
	   The league also is contracting, from 18 to 16 teams next season.
	   Officials say the J-League's economic troubles will have no
direct impact on the World Cup.
	   Eight stadiums are being built in Japan, in addition to those
completed in Yokohama and Osaka, and the money already has been
appropriated by local and national governments.
	   Soccer supporters are hoping the boost from the Cup won't come
too late.
	   At their final home game last month, Flugels players arrived on
the field covering the corporate owner's logo on their uniform
sleeves with their hands. The crowd was in tears.
	   ``The J-League must learn from its mistakes,'' said Flugels and
Japanese national team midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi. ``The victims
were the fans and the players.''

Italian justice minister reportedly in Kurdish case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prosecutors are looking into whether Italy's justice
minister abused his power when he recommended that Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan be released from prison, Italian news
reports said Tuesday.
	   Two Rome prosecutors opened the investigation after a lawyer
representing the Turkish government filed a complaint Monday.
Turkey said the minister, Oliviero Diliberto, had acted
``inappropriately'' and for reasons ``not connected to his
country's interests.''
	   Ocalan, who leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was
arrested and jailed after he arrived at the Rome airport on a
flight from Moscow Nov. 12. A Rome court freed the rebel a week
later but ordered him not to leave Rome.
	   Prior to the decision, Diliberto sent the court a letter
recommending Ocalan be given mild treatment.
	   According to Turkey's complaint, Diliberto illegally influenced
the court's decision.
	   Diliberto said he would await results of the investigation with
``total calm.''
	   Turkey has demanded Ocalan's extradition but Italy has refused,
citing a law that prohibit it from extraditing suspects to
countries where they face the death sentence, as is the case with
Ocalan in Turkey.
	   Ocalan could be free to leave Italy within a week unless Germany
acts on an arrest warrant it had issued for the rebel leader's
capture, which expires Dec. 22.

Greece: nothing has changed following Holbrooke visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke's trip to
Greece did nothing to defuse the crisis caused by Cyprus' planned
deployment of Russian missiles, the government said Tuesday.
	   ``Nothing has developed which constitutes a change in the facts
that until now comprise the situation, either in relations between
Greece and Turkey or Cyprus,'' said government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas.
	   Holbrooke met with Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos
and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos on Monday. The American
envoy did not make any comments during his one-day visit, but
looked irritated after his first meeting.
	   His talks with Pangalos were held at a private dinner meeting in
the house of the U.S. ambassador. Pangalos, who would prefer to
have U.S. proposals in writing, also did not comment after the
dinner.
	   The U.S. strongly opposed the deployment of Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles on the island, preferring their storage in
Greece or deployment on the island of Crete.
	   Greek Cypriots insist the weapons will be deployed as scheduled
later this month.
	   Turkey has said it will use force to stop them, which would
probably lead to a war with Greece. Athens has a defense accord
with Cyprus and has nearly fought two wars with NATO ally Turkey in
the past 11 years over territorial disputes over the Aegean Sea.
	   The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided between
Greek-and Turkish-Cypriot governments since 1974, when Turkish
troops invaded its northern third after an abortive Athens-backed
coup by supporters of union with Greece. Turkey maintains 35,000
troops in a northern breakaway state recognized only by Ankara.

Ronaldo, Zidane, Suker make short list for FIFA honor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane of
France, leading scorer Davor Suker of Croatia and two-time holder
Ronaldo were announced as the three finalists Tuesday for FIFA's
Player of the Year award.
	   The winner _ selected by 129 national coaches _ will be
announced at a ceremony in the Spanish city of Barcelona on Feb. 1,
1999.
	   The nomination of Inter Milan forward Ronaldo came despite his
disappointing performance in Brazil's 3-0 loss to France in the
World Cup final.
	   Zidane, by contrast, became a living French legend by scoring
two of the goals in the final after an impressive performance
throughout the tournament.
	   Suker, who plays for Real Madrid, helped Croatia to its surprise
third-place finish in the finals with six goals _ one more than
Italy's Christian Vieri and Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta.
	   Ronaldo won the honor the past two years. Previous holders have
been Liberia's George Weah, Brazil's Romario, Italy's Roberto
Baggio, Marco Van Basten of the Netherlands and Germany's Lothar
Matthaus.

Mandela escapes injury in tornado that kills 13, injures 150

 &UR; EDS: COMBINES previous takes, RECASTS and EDITS to CONFORM; UPDATES
with comment from spokeswoman; UPDATES with 13 killed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday
narrowly escaped injury in a tornado that killed 13 people on
Tuesday, a presidential spokeswoman said.
	   The tornado left 150 people injured and uprooted trees in this
town near the southeastern coast. Most of the victims were waiting
at a bus stop where a wall collapsed on them, police said.
	   Mandela, 80, whose home in Qunu is about 20 kilometers (12
miles) outside Umtata, was shopping at his favorite pharmacy on the
main street when the storm hit the shop, spokeswoman Priscilla
Naidoo said.
	   ``The impact was so great that the windows shattered and the
roof caved down,'' Naidoo said in a telephone interview.
	   Mandela was told to lie on the ground by his guards, who covered
him with their bodies while the tornado raged, Naidoo said.
	   ``The president and his bodyguards escaped unharmed and they
went home afterwards,'' she said.
	   Mandela is on holiday at his home.
	   ``When he's on holiday he likes to pop over to the store to buy
some odds and ends,'' Naidoo said.
	   The tornado tore off roof tops of houses and of a local hospital
and blood bank, according to SABC-TV film.
	   ``Big trees and traffic lights have been blown over. We have
managed to get police to many areas but the trees are blocking
traffic flow,'' police spokesman Mzukisi Fatyela said.
	   An eyewitness said electricity was cut to the town.
	   ``I was in a car, when a cloud covered the town. I couldn't see
anything. There were large hail stones,'' Lawrence Nkosi, the
eyewitness, told SABC radio.
	   Umtata is located about 50 kilometers inland from the Indian
Ocean on the
	   country's southeastern coast. The tornado happened in mid
afternoon, between 3 and 4:45 p.m. local time (1300GMT to 1445GMT).
	   Another tornado touched down Tuesday about 250 kilometers (155
miles) west of Umtata in Hogsback, where ten people went missing
but were later found. There were three injuries in Hogsback, the
radio said.
	   Heavy rain and storms have plagued South Africa since Sunday.
	   Searchers have recovered ten bodies and presume another four
were drowned
	   Sunday after the vehicle they were riding in was swept into a
river off a bridge near Badplaas, 250 kilometers (155 miles) east
of Johannesburg.
	   In the Cape Town region, on the west coast, heavy rains on
Monday forced the evacuation of 500 people from their homes in
Caledon.
	   Lightning in Cape Town on Monday shut down the signal and
overhead power lines of commuter trains and set afire the thatched
roof at the home of Earl Charles Spencer, brother to the late
Princess Diana.

Father of American player claims racial bias on pro tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The father of three professional tennis players
claims racial discrimination on the pro tennis tour has kept one of
his sons from playing in the U.S. Open.
	   The system ``is racist. It is out of balance. It should be
ended,'' said William Washington.
	   Washington said his 23-year-old son Mashiska did not receive a
wild card into the main draw at this year's U.S. Open or to the
qualifying tournament even though he had a better ranking than six
players who did.
	   Another of Washington's sons, MaliVai, reached to the Wimbledon
final in 1996.
	   William and Mashiska Washington made their complaints Tuesday at
the office of their attorney, Ellis Rubin.
	   Rubin, who said he is considering legal action, wants to set up
meetings with officials from both men's ATP Tour and women's WTA
Tour, the U.S. Tennis Association and U.S. Open.
	   USTA representatives said that was OK with them.
	   ``We are willing to have an open discussion with Mr. Washington
on this matter and look forward to answering any questions he may
have,'' said USTA executive director Rick Ferman.
	   The USTA, however, denied awarding wild-card passes unfairly.
	   ``The USTA has always awarded U.S. Open wild cards to deserving
players without regard to race or ethnic origin,'' said USTA
president Harry Marmion.
	   The focus of Washington's argument involves wild cards _ berths
given to players for entry into tournaments. Wild cards are given
at the discretion of tournament directors.
	   They often are awarded to low-ranked, promising players needing
a career boost.
	   The organizations that run pro tennis and tournament directors
of events such as the U.S. Open don't give out the wild-card berths
easily, especially when it comes to minorities, said Washington,
who lives in Delray Beach, Florida.
	   Mashiska, ranked 402nd on the ATP Tour computer, did not make it
to the U.S. Open this year, but he had received wild cards to the
U.S. Open qualifying tournament each of the past four years and
advanced past the first round just once.
	   Mashiska also has received more than 30 wild cards into
tournaments in his career. His 1998 record is 6-8 in the challenger
events. He is 0-4 in his career in ATP Tour main draw matches.
	   ``Our first priority is to developing players and the second is
to players who have made a significant contribution to the game,''
said U.S. Open tournament director Jay Snyder. ``I would think that
Mashiska's game has kind of leveled off.''
	   Wild cards, especially into an event's main draw, are considered
as valuable as gold to struggling players. At the 1998 U.S. Open,
for instance, a main draw wild card was worth at least dlrs 12,000
_ the prize money earned by a first-round loser.
	   ``I have never received a main draw wild card at the tour level
in any country, particularly the U.S,'' Mashiska said.

Besieged Angolan city reported calm, but rebels maintain pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with report of few explosions,
warehouse under guard, food already distributed for December,
planes used to deliver food aid to other cities. &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SANYO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan city of Kuito was reportedly
calm Tuesday, though rebel forces maintained their control over
most of the surrounding area and access to the city was said to be
severely restricted.
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said IRC staff in
Kuito reported a lull in fighting between UNITA rebels and the
besieged government army.
	   ``The situation was calm this morning,'' IRC spokesman Paulo
Delorca said.
	   Portuguese state radio RDP-Africa reported that just a few
explosions were heard throughout the day in the countryside near
Kuito.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Delorca said the government and aid agencies had enough supplies
to feed civilians in the city, whose population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   ``For the moment, it is not an emergency (aid) situation,''
Delorca said.
	   A World Food Program spokeswoman said the organization had 1,000
metric tons of food aid in Kuito. The warehouse was under guard
because other food stores had been looted, spokeswoman Maria Flynn
said.
	   Normal food rations for December were distributed before the
fighting broke out, Flynn said.
	   Both the WFP and IRC said access to Kuito by road and air was
not safe because UNITA forces hold areas to the north, east and
west.
	   UNITA's tightening grip on Kuito, which lies about 500 kms (300
miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda, halted the government
evacuation of women and children to the capital after three
transport planes took off Monday.
	   UNITA shot down an Antonov transport plane shortly after it took
off from Kuito on Monday, and drove the army out of Chinguar, a
town 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the city.
	   The WFP said it was using planes to deliver food to Huambo,
another major city 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of Kuito, and to
Luena in eastern Angola, 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Luanda.
Flynn said the group used planes when it was unsafe to travel by
road.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement, which was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Some 300,000 immigrants have applied for Italy's amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ More than 300,000 immigrants have applied over the
past five weeks for 38,000 work permits promised by the Italian
government under a limited amnesty which expired Tuesday.
	   The Interior Ministry, however, has said that all those who meet
the requirements of the law will be allowed to stay, and will be
eligible for next year's quota.
	   ``It's just a matter of waiting a few months longer,'' Minister
Rosa Russo Jervolino was quoted as saying by the AGI news agency.
	   Since the amnesty was announced and given wide publicity on
Italian television, there has been an apparent upswing in the
number of would-be immigrants arriving on small boats from Albania
and other nearby ports.
	   Police stations have been overwhelmed with immigrants seeking to
prove they have a job and have been in the country since before
last March, as the amnesty required.

U.S. congressmen pay visit to Palestinian Legislative Council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A visit by U.S. congressmen to the
Palestinian Legislative Council in the West Bank on Tuesday was
seen by Palestinian lawmakers as another sign of the budding
friendship between the United States and the Palestinians.
	   The delegation of 13 congressmen, who accompanied U.S. President
Bill Clinton on his three-day trip to Israel and Palestinian-held
territories, said they discussed the Wye River peace accord with
their Palestinian counterparts and the future of promised aid
packages.
	   ``The President has proposed a substantial financial aid package
to the Palestinians and to Israel over 3 years but our ability to
get this funding will depend upon how well the requirements of the
Wye accord are worked out, so it is our hope they proceed
smoothly,'' said Republican Sen. Arlen Spector of Pennsylvania.
	   ``We expect to have problems and bumps but the real test will
come in the way the problems are worked out,'' Spector said.
	   Clinton was unable during his trip to get Israel to continue
implementing the accord he helped broker in October. Israel
suspended the deal because it says the Palestinians are not
fulfilling key obligations in the accord.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Ziad Abu Amr said members of the U.S.
delegation were very receptive to Palestinian grievances as well.
	   ``It was a good meeting that went beyond courtesy. There were
frank discussions on critical issues such as Jewish settlements and
the release of prisoners. I hope it will trigger a more meaningful
relationship between the council and the congress,'' he said.
	   After the hour-long round-table talks, council speaker Ahmed
Qureia told the congressmen, ``We would like to see more visits
like this one today so that you can see us and listen to us, which
is more useful than listening about us.''
	   Clinton's visit to Gaza and the West Bank city of Bethlehem were
the first by a sitting U.S. president to Palestinian-controlled
areas. For Palestinians, it marked a turn-around in their relations
with the United States, a traditional ally of Israel.

French lawmakers' report points finger at U.N., United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A committee of French lawmakers on Tuesday
presented their conclusions on the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, calling
for French government reform but mainly faulting the United Nations
and United States for letting the bloodbath take place.
	   The 9-month study, launched amid accusations that Paris played a
role in causing the human disaster, said France was ``not at all
implicated in the unleashing of the violence.''
	   After rockets downed the plane of Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana while landing at Kigali airport on April 6, 1994, the
United Nations was ``incapable of stopping the rise of violence and
to put an end to the massacres,'' the report says.
	   It said U.N. ``passiveness'' was ``mainly due to the refusal of
the United States to envisage, after the debacle in Somalia, any
immediate increase in personnel and capability of the U.N. force.''
	   In October 1993, 18 American Rangers were killed in Somalia in
an attack on the stronghold of warlord Mohammed Mohammed Farah
Aidid, leading to a U.S. withdrawal.
	   Under pressure from the Republican-led Congress, Clinton set
stringent conditions on future U.N. peacekeeping operations.
	   Paul Quiles, the Socialist deputy and former defense minister
who led the Rwanda study, denounced the ``obstruction'' by the
United States in Rwanda, and said it was on ``instructions from
President Clinton.'' He did not elaborate.
	   An estimated 500,000 minority ethnic Tutsis and Hutu opposition
members were killed in the genocide, led by members of the Hutu
regime, from April to June.
	   France's Operation Turquoise, from June to August 1994, was
aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid, but was also accused of
protecting the Hutus.
	   Quiles said France was the victim of its own dual policies of
supporting its former colonies in Africa and pressing them toward
democracy.
	   While avoiding discussion of specifics, he said a lack of
legislative control and coordination between French ministries led
to the conflicting policies.
	   ``French support of the Rwandan military was so great and of
such duration that it couldn't assume a position as mediator,'' he
said.
	   At the same time, he said, France was unable to obtain a U.N.
mandate to carry out Operation Turquoise mission, which it began on
its own before other nations joined in.
	   Asked about the delivery of arms after the genocide began,
Quiles said details were in the full report, to be released on the
Internet Wednesday.
	   Quiles came under fire from angry French conservatives in the
parliament, who voted against the report.
	   ``France has nothing to turn red about,'' said Deputy Rene
Galy-de-Jean of the Rally for the Republic, the party of President
Jacques Chirac.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Warning Kosovo's factions that they
are playing with ``dynamite,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke sought
Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
worst violation of an informal cease-fired left 37 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke later arrived in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic, where he would ``emphasize the need to move
ahead expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   A Yugoslav government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the meeting between Holbrooke and Milosevic began
early Tuesday evening.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair defends pro-European policy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under fire for his handling of relations with the
European Union, Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his policies
Tuesday, saying that Britain needs strong relations with both
Europe and the United States.
	   ``We are stronger with the U.S. because of our strength in
Europe, and we are stronger in Europe precisely because of the
strong relationship we have with the U.S.,'' Blair said at a speech
during a luncheon marking the 150th anniversary of The Associated
Press.
	   Conservative newspapers in Britain have criticized Blair for
taking a generally positive line toward the EU and hinting that his
Labor Party government may, in a few years, adopt the European
single currency, the euro, which starts Jan. 1.
	   The opposition Conservative Party accuses him of a willingness
to give away British sovereignty.
	   Although Blair labeled Britain's close economic, political and
military relationship with the United States as vital, he said his
country also needs a leading role ``to take the European social
model and revitalize it, transform it, renew it.''
	   ``We live in a global economy, and an interdependent world.
Nations must maximize their influence wherever they can,'' he said.
	   Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe has always been
difficult. The issue of European integration helped bring down
Margaret Thatcher in 1990 and undermined the credibility of her
successor, John Major, also a Conservative.
	   Although Britain joined the forerunner of the EU in the
mid-1970s, opinion over the benefits of membership has always been
mixed.
	   When Labor won national elections in May 1997, Blair said
Britain would become a major force in Europe. But recently,
government officials have expressed fears of becoming sidelined
from its decision-making process.

Chief weapons inspector finishing report on Iraqi cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler put the finishing touches Tuesday on a report to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether Iraq has cooperated fully
with weapons experts during the past month.
	   Butler has already reported that Iraq's compliance has been far
from perfect: Baghdad denied the inspectors access to two sites,
refused to hand over several key documents, and imposed
unacceptable conditions during several inspections.
	   Nonetheless, most inspections passed off without incident and
Baghdad-based monitoring teams went into the field Tuesday. The
last three visiting teams, who carried out surprise inspections
over the past week, left Monday.
	   The U.N. Security Council says a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad desperately wants
_ will only go ahead if Butler reports that Iraq has resumed full
cooperation with inspectors.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq promised Nov.
14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow unfettered
access to sites and documents. Washington and London have said
military strikes remain an option to compel Baghdad to cooperate
with the inspectors.
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting tough economic sanctions imposed after Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the United States insists
that there is no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs
to do to fully disarm.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution at the end of the Gulf war in
1991, sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's
economy, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission which
Butler heads and the International Atomic Energy Agency certify
that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed.
	   Annan noted at a news conference Monday that there are
differences between the United Nations and the United States over
Iraq.
	   The U.N. Security Council has made it clear that once Butler
declares that Iraq has been disarmed, sanctions will be lifted, he
said.
	   ``American policy goes beyond that, but I am guided only by the
United Nations policy,'' Annan said.
	   He gave no specifics, but President Bill Clinton recently called
for the overthrow of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``The fact that there may be a conflict in the council because
one or two members may disagree does not mean that the council
should not move ahead and do what it has promised to do in its own
resolutions,'' Annan said.
	   While the secretary-general indicated that Baghdad's cooperation
had fallen short of his expectations, he indicated that he expects
the comprehensive review to go ahead even though the final decision
is up to the Security Council.
	   ``I am not sure that the comprehensive review is something that
Iraq deserves or does not deserve,'' he said. ``I think the council
itself would want to know, after eight years of sanctions, where it
stands, what has been achieved, what needs to be done, and within
what reasonable time frame it can be done.''

Kenya's president arrives in Iran for talks on trade and peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi arrived
here Tuesday for talks on trade and conflicts in Africa.
	   Speaking to reporters at the start of his three-day visit, Moi
said he would discuss with Iranian officials the goal of
``restoring peace in Africa,'' the official Iranian news agency
said.
	   Kenya has been involved in the negotiations to end the civil
wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami met Moi at the presidential
palace in Tehran shortly after his arrival, the Islamic Republic
News Agency said.
	   The Kenyan ambassador to Tehran, Al-Haj Mohammed Soba, has said
that Kenya is studying the possibility of using Iran as a transit
route for the export of its goods to the former Soviet republics.
	   Soba said Kenya was seeking to arright the trade imbalance,
which is overwhelmingly in favor of Iran, which exports oil,
paraffin wax and textile materials to the East African nation.

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ With his team sliding down the Premier
League and already out of European competition, Liverpool manager
Gerard Houllier has invited Dynamo Kiev defender Olexandre Holovko
and Cameroon World Cup player Rigobert Song to train with the club
and is also after Polish center-back Tomasz Lapinksi.
	   Houllier plans to field both Holovko and Song in a practice
match against Tranmere on Wednesday and will decide which player he
will try to sign.
	   Both will need a work permit, and Liverpool only have one
available. English clubs are allowed only three, and Liverpool
already have Czech international forward Patrik Berger and American
goalkeeper Brad Friedel on permits.
	   If Houllier decides to go for neither, he may make a bid for
Lapinski, a 29-year-old defender who had played 24 times for
Poland.
	   Reports also suggest that Liverpool is also interested in
signing Bayern Munich's experienced German international defender
Thomas Helmer, who would not need a work permit because he comes
from a European Community country.

Asia says threatened World Cup boycott won't affect hosts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with FIFA saying no official communication received
from AFC. &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian soccer officials on Tuesday put
on hold a threatened boycott of the 2002 World Cup and said that
even if it goes ahead, co-hosts Japan and South Korea still will be
exempted.
	   The Asian Football Confederation's executive committee, after an
emergency meeting, warned that the boycott would proceed unless
FIFA expands the number of slots allocated to Asia for the World
Cup.
	   ``All of the members spoke up very much in favor of a boycott of
2002,'' AFC general secretary Peter Velappan told a news
conference. ``But we will honor the responsibility of hosting the
World Cup.''
	   The formula of a boycott exempting Japan and South Korea
balances the demands of Arab members to retaliate against FIFA
while taking into account the millions spent by the two Asian
nations to jointly stage the cup finals.
	   Committee members said Asia was not ``treated fairly or taken
seriously'' by FIFA despite being home to 40 percent of the world's
population and comprising a large number of television viewers.
	   Asia was allocated four berths for 2002, including the two
reserved for Japan and South Korea as hosts. At last week's
announcement, FIFA portrayed it as an increase from the three
guaranteed plus the chance for a fourth, which Iran eventually
earned by beating Australia in a two-leg playoff.
	   But the AFC sees the allocation as only a pair, a reduction of
one guaranteed plus the chance for a second.
	   In 1994, however, CONCACAF's allocation of two berths was not
increased despite the United States serving as host.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper's said Tuesday that the AFC has not
offically notified the world body of any problem.
	   ``We have no official communication from them,'' Cooper said in
Zurich, Switzerland.
	   He declined to speculate on the possibility of reopening issue
``as we've not received any request for such a thing to happen.''
	   That apparently is coming. The Asian confederation planned to
inform the Switzerland-based authority of its decision in an
official letter.
	   Thailand national team manager Thawatchai Sajakul, sounded a
contradictory tone to the AFC, noting that soccer is heavily
commercialized and FIFA has a duty not to bore spectators with weak
teams competing in poor games.
	   ``We have to admit that in the recent World Cup, the performance
of the Asian soccer teams was very disappointing,'' Thawatchai
said.
	   Neither Iran, Saudi Arabia, Japan or South Korea advanced past
the first round in France '98.
	   Velappan said the AFC wants the same 3 1-2 berths it had in
1998, not withstanding those reserved for the hosts.
	   He said it would accept 2 1-2, which means the AFC is demanding
to play the Oceania winner again for the odd berth, which under
last week's announcement will be decided by a two-leg playoff
between the Oceania winner and the fifth-placed South American
team.
	   The dispute underscores the changes in the tournament with the
first-ever dual-host attempt. The World Cup host nation has always
qualified automatically, but two reserved slots significantly
reduce the chances for other Asian nations to qualify.
	   ``Our decision is not irrational or unreasonable, our decision
is fair,'' Velappan said.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter contacted the Asian confederation
before the meeting and offered the body four places for the 2006
World Cup, without mentioning 2002.
	   ``Why should he dangle a carrot at us about 2006? We're trying
to focus on 2002,'' said Velappan, who is also FIFA's coordinator
for the 2002 cup.
	   The committee decided to send a six-member delegation to meet
FIFA President Sepp Blatter in February ahead of a high-level FIFA
meeting in March to persuade him to restore the lost spot.
	   If the FIFA meeting fails to change course and satisfy the
Asians, the AFC will call another meeting to implement the boycott,
which would pull 40 teams out of the World Cup qualifying rounds.
	   ``Blatter must do something one way or the other to find a way
of resolving the problem. Otherwise, he will push us to the wall,''
said Manical Fernando, an AFC vice president from Sri Lanka. ``But
they should know if they don't help us, we will boycott.''
	   Velappan said that Asian corporations hoping to sponsor the
event would not be asked to join the boycott, saying sports and
business don't mix.
	   It would not be the first time Asian nations have boycotted the
World Cup.
	   In 1966, all of Africa and Asia except North Korea withdrew
because they were given only one berth to vie for between the two
continents.

	   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in Washington state
newspapers:
	   Dec. 9
	   The Bellingham Herald on needed ferry changes
	   The Washington Transportation Commission and ferry system
officials should be commended for revising the rulebook for
emergency boardings.
	   The new procedures, which went into effect Dec. 5, will be of
great help to people with medical problems and other situations
that warrant putting them on the first available sailing.
	   In the past, rigid rules prevented workers on the state's 28
ferries from using common sense and discretion to evaluate unusual
requests and situations.
	   In one well-publicized case last summer, a dying San Juan Island
woman was forced to wait more than two hours at the loading dock in
Anacortes to catch a ferry.
	   Kathleen Lee-Geist, who died two days later of a brain tumor,
was refused priority loading even though her doctor had written a
note asking that she be allowed on the ferry immediately. The
reason: The request hadn't been received 24 hours in advance and
her situation was not considered an emergency.
	   Thankfully, the new rules are much more clear and flexible.
	   A motorist with a doctor's note declaring that an extended wait
would cause ``detrimental health risk'' to an occupant of the
vehicle will be allowed to board the next available ferry. Workers
also will have the authority to put such folks aboard even if they
don't have a note.
	   Ferry and transportation officials have taken a lot of heat from
us and others for a series of costly blunders over the past several
years. As such, it's refreshing to have the opportunity to praise
them for something positive. Kudos for responding to a problem with
a sensible solution.
	   Dec. 11
	   The Seattle Times on the AIDS rules
	   The pro-active state health board is right to push for a new
policy of identifying people who have HIV.
	   The board now needs to exercise patience in making sure that its
plan helps to reduce the spread of the virus that causes AIDS.
	   That must be the real goal in any discussion of how to fight
HIV. It is especially important to focus on the public health
threat at a time when the board's action has provoked strong
opposition from AIDS activist groups.
	   For two decades, privacy issues and AIDS' deadly nature combined
to make public health authorities treat the virus more gingerly
than other communicable diseases. Conditions are changing, however.
AIDS is no longer limited to specific groups. And medical advances
have meant that more people live longer with the HIV virus before
developing AIDS.
	   With the changes, health authorities are properly re-evaluating
their handling of AIDS cases. Requiring doctors to report all HIV
cases will give health authorities a much better picture of who is
at risk. Education efforts can then be more specifically targeted.
The board recognized those needs earlier this fall when it voted to
draft a rule that would require doctors to report the names of all
people with HIV infections.
	   Bitter opposition has been expressed by many AIDS activists.
They insist that tracking cases through an identification code
would accomplish the same thing while providing an extra measure of
privacy.
	   There are problems with the activists' position. Any
identification code is more costly and complicated than the use of
names, and may provide less reliable information. A recent
federally supported study has suggested that, contrary to
activists' contentions, people at risk of HIV don't actually avoid
testing over a fear of identification.
	   Other studies, however, have come to different conclusions. That
ought to lend a degree of caution to the state health board's
debates.
	   Fortunately, it appears likely that the board will take several
months before deciding the issue. That will give activists every
opportunity to refine their arguments for an identification system
without names.
	   There is a great deal of sense in the board's call for treating
HIV infections more like other health threats. But the board has to
remain open to the concerns of critics for a simple reason: Their
ideas may also help formulate intelligent, effective health policy.

	   The Herald (Everett) on Russia's brain drain
	   To the deepening fears of U.S. security officials, the formula
for creating a germ-warfare capability is astonishingly simple:
find an impoverished expert in bioweapons and offer money.
	   That is the strategy being used in the former Soviet Union,
where Iranian recruiters are approaching unemployed scientists. As
disclosed recently in The New York Times, U.S. officials are trying
to defeat these efforts with funding for less-lethal employment.
	   Iran, as well as Iraq, North Korea, Syria and China, is trying
to recruit experts in bioweapons that can cause widespread human
suffering or deaths, but whose costs and manufacturing facilities
are more difficult to monitor than nuclear-weapons research.
	   Startling advances in genetic research have created the
possibility of human-engineered diseases that are resistant to
vaccines. Iran's recruiters in Russia have shown interest in the
theory, as yet unproven, that bioweapons could target specific
races or nationalities.
	   American intelligence officials now know that the former Soviet
Union built a vast arsenal of bioweapons at several research
centers, employing 70,000 scientists and technicians. Many of those
scientists have turned to peaceful pursuits, such as developing
disease-resistant plants and medicines, but others are jobless or
working at research centers decimated by Russia's economic crisis.
	   Russia's State Research Center for Applied Microbiology, which
perfected a lethal bacteria, has lost 54 percent of its staff.
Where have they gone? American officials know some germ experts
went to Iran. U.S. officials know Russia has improved Iran's
missile and nuclear capabilities, but don't know much about
progress in its known bioweapons program.
	   To counter the recruiting by Iran and other nations, the U.S.
has quietly funded scientist-to-scientist exchanges, joint research
projects and programs to convert military labs to civilian uses.
Funding of $10 million is expected to double next year, but that's
only a partial measure to slow Russia's brain drain.
	   It's probably impossible to stop the spread of this knowledge,
which is why the threat of bioterrorism will be a significant issue
for Clinton's successor.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Thousands of people took to the
streets of this dusty capital city Tuesday to protest the death of
a prominent journalist.
	   Crowds began forming early Tuesday morning at the home of Norbet
Zongo, owner of the weekly newspaper The Independent and one of the
most outspoken critics of President Blaise Compaore's regime.
	   Zongo's badly burned body was found Sunday inside the wreckage
of his burned car, along with the corpses of two of his cousins.
The body of his chauffeur was found a few meters (yards) away.
	   The crowds began with just a few hundred university students but
quickly swelled to thousands of chanting people accusing the
government of killing Zongo.
	   It has not explained how Zongo died. His parents have requested
an autopsy but officials say that won't be possible because the
body was so badly burned.
	   At one point, the crowds stormed the offices of the ruling
Congress for Democracy and Progress party, breaking windows and
furniture, and also destroyed two buses owned by the party.
	   They were eventually dispersed by riot police firing tear gas
and a heavy police presence remained on the streets Thursday
afternoon. Plainclothed police could also be seen rounding up
students.

UN envoy calls for restraint in East Timor after upsurge in
</HEADLINE>
violence
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with arrival of U.N. envoy

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A U.N. special envoy arrived in
Indonesia Tuesday worried that a new upsurge in violence in East
Timor could upset a new peace process for the troubled territory.
	   Jamsheed Marker called on Indonesian military and East Timorese
rebel forces to show restraint in the former Portuguese colony,
which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later.
	   Clashes between pro-independence guerrillas and Indonesian
troops have increased in recent weeks despite revitalized
U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and Portugal.
	   Protests by pro-independence activists have also risen in size
and frequency.
	   ``There has been increasing tension which I think is very
unfortunate and I would certainly try to talk with all sides to
urge them to exercise maximum restraint,'' Marker said at Jakarta
Airport at the start of a five-day visit.
	   Marker said that leaders of different factions on the
half-island territory of 800,000 people remained anxious to reach a
negotiated settlement.
	   ``There is no doubt about that. It would be unfortunate if
certain elements disturb this process,'' he said.
	   Marker said it was unclear how many people had been killed in
recent clashes and he would try to obtain more information when he
visits East Timor within the next few days.
	   Hours before his arrival in Jakarta, hundreds of
pro-independence protesters staged a noisy but peaceful
demonstration outside the parliament building in East Timor's
capital, Dili. They demanded a referendum on its future _ something
that Indonesia has rejected.
	   Meanwhile East Timor's spiritual leader and 1996 Nobel Peace
laureate Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo called on rebel groups
as well the Indonesian military to respect human rights.
	   ``It should be kept in mind that (violations) have also been
committed by local youths as well as by the armed Falintil''
guerrilla movement, Indonesia's official Antara news agency quoted
Belo as saying.
	   Marker said he hoped to meet Belo along with Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie, and other Indonesian officials as well as
imprisoned rebel commander Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year
sentence in a Jakarta prison for leading a small band of rebel
fighters.
	   East Timor has endured guerrilla warfare and human rights abuses
since Indonesia's annexation in 1976.
	   Long-running talks at the United Nations between Indonesia and
Portugal were given a new lease onlife earlier this year when
Indonesia offered to grant a measure of autonomy to East Timor in
exchange for an end to hostilities and international recognition of
its sovereignty there.
	   The change in Indonesia's policy toward East Timor followed the
resignation of longtime autocratic President Suharto after riots
and protests across the country in May.
	   Marker said a main focus of his visit would be to discuss the
autonomy proposal put forward by Suharto's successor, Habibie. Last
week Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said he hoped the talks
with Portugal could be concluded by next March.
	   Tuesday's protest coincided with the departure of 600 troops
from Dili. Military officials said the group would be replaced as
part of a routine rotation.
	   Earlier this year Indonesia said it had reduced troop numbers
there but pro-indepenence activists claim that has not happened.
	   The Indonesian military said 15,000 security personnel were
stationed on the island. However, critics say the number is more
than 20,000.

South Korea gives Russian Far East medicine aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ South Korean officials gave dlrs 12,000 worth of
medicine Tuesday to a region in Russia's Far East devastated by
forest fires and an energy crisis, a news report said.
	   South Korea's consul general in Vladivostok called the donation
a gesture of friendship and sympathy, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. It did not say what kinds of medicines were provided.
	   Forest fires swept across the Russian Far East for months after
an unusually dry summer, causing heavy economic losses and an
increase in respiratory illnesses, doctors say.
	   Also, Russia's economic crisis has sharply reduced medicine
supplies, since most of Russia's medicine is imported and imports
have become prohibitively expensive since the ruble was devalued in
August.
	   Vladivostok, a city of 800,000 near the North Korean border,
suffers from periodic cuts of water, heat and electricity, and
emergency medical help and trash removal are sometimes put on hold
because of a dispute between the mayor and governor.

Kidd signs Newcastle winger, bids to hire McClair as No. 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Blackburn manager Brian Kidd made his
first signing on Tuesday, paying 2.35 million pounds (dlrs 3.9
million) for Newcastle's Northern Ireland international winger
Keith Gillespie.
	   Kidd, who took over from fired Roy Hodgson two weeks ago and is
hoping to appoint Brian McClair as his No. 2, persuaded 23-year-old
Gillespie to sign a 4 1/2 year contract.
	   Like McClair, Gillespie had links with Kidd at Manchester
United. He was transfered by United to Newcastle three seasons ago
as part of the deal that took Andy Cole to Old Trafford.
	   McClair left United after 11 seasons last year to move to
Scottish Premier League team Motherwell.

Chief weapons inspector finishing report on Iraqi cooperation

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler put the finishing touches Tuesday on a report to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether Iraq has cooperated fully
with weapons experts during the past month.
	   Butler has already reported that Iraq's compliance has been far
from perfect: Baghdad denied the inspectors access to two sites,
refused to hand over several key documents, and imposed
unacceptable conditions during several inspections.
	   Nonetheless, most inspections passed off without incident and
Baghdad-based monitoring teams went into the field Tuesday. The
last three visiting teams, who carried out surprise inspections
over the past week, left Monday.
	   The U.N. Security Council says a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad desperately wants
_ will only go ahead if Butler reports that Iraq has resumed full
cooperation with inspectors.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq promised Nov.
14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow unfettered
access to sites and documents. Washington and London have said
military strikes remain an option to compel Baghdad to cooperate
with the inspectors.
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting tough economic sanctions imposed after Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the United States insists
that there is no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs
to do to fully disarm.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution at the end of the Gulf war in
1991, sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's
economy, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission which
Butler heads and the International Atomic Energy Agency certify
that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed.
	   The IAEA submitted its report on Iraqi compliance to Annan on
Monday, U. N. officials said Tuesday.

Communist accuses Yeltsin, Jews of genocide against Russians

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the latest burst of anti-Semitism in Russia, a
prominent Communist lawmaker on Tuesday accused President Boris
Yeltsin and Jews in his office of waging ``genocide'' against the
Russian people.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, the head of parliament's security affairs
committee, claimed that liberal reforms carried out by Yeltsin's
government in the 1990s have decimated Russia.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   The Russian president has frequently reshuffled his Cabinet and
his advisers over the years. Most have been ethnic Russians, though
Jews and other minority groups have also been represented.
	   The Communist Party, the country's main opposition group, has
been seeking to attract a new generation of supporters and distance
itself from abuses committed during the Soviet era.
	   But in recent weeks, party elders have expressed support for
several measures that recall some of the darkest moments of their
rule.
	   Communist lawmakers last month enthusiastically supported a move
to bring back the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, former head of the
dreaded Soviet secret police. His likeness was toppled from in
front of KGB headquarters in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.
	   Also, Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
parliament's lower house, suggested that crime could be curbed by
the re-introduction of hard labor camps, where millions perished
under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
	   With Russians weathering a tough economic crisis, the country's
rough-and-tumble politics have grown even more coarse.
	   Ilyukhin, the man leading the efforts to impeach Yeltsin,
repeated his anti-Jewish remarks when meeting with journalists
after Tuesday's impeachment session.
	   ``Representatives of one ethnic group have been dominant in the
president's inner circle and the government during the past seven
years. I have already named this ethnic group,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   ``It appears to be the cause, or one of the factors that has
contributed to the genocide we have witnessed,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin has frequently reshuffled his Cabinet and his advisers
over the years. Most have been ethnic Russians, though Jews and
other minority groups have also been represented.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, caused an outcry in
October when he blamed Russia's problems on Jews and used an ethnic
slur.
	   His comments outraged many, but the Communist-dominated Duma
refused to censure him. The government has been investigating cases
of ``political extremism,'' but has not acted against Makashov.
	   Jews suffered systematic discrimination in czarist Russia and
during the Soviet era. The constitution bans discrimination, but
many Russians still express anti-Semitic sentiments.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair defends pro-European policy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under fire for his handling of relations with the
European Union, Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his policies
Tuesday, saying that Britain needs strong relations with both
Europe and the United States.
	   ``We are stronger with the U.S. because of our strength in
Europe, and we are stronger in Europe precisely because of the
strong relationship we have with the U.S.,'' Blair said at a speech
during a luncheon marking the 150th anniversary of The Associated
Press.
	   Conservative newspapers in Britain have criticized Blair for
taking a generally positive line toward the EU and hinting that his
Labor Party government may, in a few years, adopt the European
single currency, the euro, which starts Jan. 1.
	   The opposition Conservative Party accuses him of a willingness
to give away British sovereignty.
	   Although Blair labeled Britain's close economic, political and
military relationship with the United States as vital, he said his
country also needs a leading role ``to take the European social
model and revitalize it, transform it, renew it.''
	   ``We live in a global economy, and an interdependent world.
Nations must maximize their influence wherever they can,'' he said.
	   Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe has always been
difficult. The issue of European integration helped bring down
Margaret Thatcher in 1990 and undermined the credibility of her
successor, John Major, also a Conservative.
	   Although Britain joined the forerunner of the EU in the
mid-1970s, opinion over the benefits of membership has always been
mixed.
	   When Labor won national elections in May 1997, Blair said
Britain would become a major force in Europe. But recently,
government officials have expressed fears of becoming sidelined
from its decision-making process.

Banana dispute settlement stays blocked at WTO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-US-Bananas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts to agree on a way forward in the banana
trade dispute between the European Union and the United States
stalled again Tuesday at the World Trade Organization.
	   A meeting of the WTO's dispute settlement body, kept open last
month in case of agreement, was again suspended with both sides
disagreeing on terms of reference for a settlement.
	   Washington argues the new EU banana import regime unfairly
favors imports from former European colonies. The EU insists it has
complied with a WTO ruling against an earlier import system.
	   The EU said last month it will support an accelerated WTO
dispute settlement procedure for the row if the United States lifts
a threat to impose 100 percent duties on a range of EU imports.
	   The body was reconvened Tuesday with the EU asking that a panel
be set up to establish that the changes to its regime ``must be
presumed to conform to WTO rules unless their conformity has been
duly challenged under the appropriate (WTO) procedures.''
	   The United States and four other countries involved in the
dispute said in a statement the EU had made it clear it ``is not
seeking a panel to review the consistency of its banana measures''
as it had implied it would.
	   U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said there was no basis for the
EU request. The panel should cover all aspects of the EU banana
regime, she added.
	   Washington is expected to publish in the coming days a list of
EU products that will be targeted by the sanctions and slapped with
100 percent tariffs upon entering the United States. The sanctions
could be worth up to dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   The EU claims that such action would be contrary to WTO rules
and set off a major trade dispute.

Parliament vetoes more government power over troop movements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Parliament on Tuesday vetoed giving the
government more authority over troop deployments abroad because of
a side issue pitting the ruling coalition against the opposition.
	   Although 204 legislators voted to lift the need for Parliament's
approval of sending troops abroad or permitting foreign troops into
Hungary or over its airspace, it fell short of the needed
two-thirds majority in the 386-seat house.
	   Just months from becoming a full-fledged member of NATO, the
government sought the constitutional amendment in part to meet NATO
commitments more easily.
	   Except for the xenophobic Hungarian Truth and Life Party, with
only 13 seats in Parliament, all parties support NATO membership.
	   However, the two main opposition parties, the Socialists and the
liberal Free Democrats, are at odds with the coalition over the
opposition candidates for a parliamentary committee to investigate
alleged corruption. That wrangle apparently prompted the two
parties to vote against increasing government powers and curtailing
Parliament's.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying that obstacles must be overcome before
the men are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial. It ``means that they
will hand over the suspects sooner rather than later,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``It looks like they've made a clear decision, but we don't know
if this is the final line or what the time-scale is,'' he added.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the U.N.
chief had not received any official word on the decision from
Libya, but believes the approval represented a ``positive
development.''
	   But the spokesman, Manoel de Almeida E Silva, would not comment
on what the United Nations believed were the remaining obstacles.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met with Gadhafi to discuss a possible
handover of the suspects. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya was expected to reach a decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, the ambassador of
Slovenia, which is a member of the Security Council, said Libyan
Parliament's decision was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' said Danilo Turk. He
said the ball was still in Libya's court.
	   ``I don't think that there are any obstacles left on the side of
the United Nations. The Security Council has adopted the decision.
What is needed is the transfer of the two suspects,'' Turk said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal for
trial of the suspects in the Netherlands.
	   Ordinary Libyans appeared relieved on hearing the news but said
Libya should receive guarantees before the suspects are handed
over.
	   ``We agreed to a trial in a neutral country but with all
guarantees for their rights. This is the view of the Libyan
people,'' said Fadlallah Saad el-Barazi, a shop owner.
	   ``We hope other countries will accept this. We ask God for
success in this regard,'' said Ali Mohammed Abu Shusha, a barber.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Thousands of people took to the
streets of this dusty capital city Tuesday to protest the death of
a prominent journalist.
	   Crowds began forming early Tuesday morning at the home of Norbet
Zongo, owner of the weekly newspaper The Independent and one of the
most outspoken critics of President Blaise Compaore's regime.
	   Zongo's badly burned body was found Sunday inside the wreckage
of his burned car, along with the corpses of two of his cousins.
The body of his chauffeur was found a few meters (yards) away.
	   The crowds began with just a few hundred university students but
quickly swelled to thousands of chanting people accusing the
government of killing Zongo.
	   It has not explained how Zongo died. His parents have requested
an autopsy but officials say that won't be possible because the
body was so badly burned.
	   At one point, the crowds stormed the offices of the ruling
Congress for Democracy and Progress party, breaking windows and
furniture, and also destroyed two buses owned by the party.
	   They were eventually dispersed by riot police firing tear gas
and a heavy police presence remained on the streets Tuesday
afternoon. Plainclothed police could also be seen rounding up
students.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The acting mayor of Russia's Far Eastern port of
Vladivostok charged Tuesday that his predecessor's allies were
physically blocking him from entering his new office.
	   Yuri Kopylov, who was appointed Monday, said he couldn't get
into the mayoral administration building because supporters of
former Mayor Viktor Cherepkov have ``taken up a defensive
position'' there, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Vladivostok has long been gripped by a political feud between
Cherepkov and regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko. The series of
scandals and petty squabbling have left the city in shambles.
	   The city of 800,000 people, located 6,400 kilometers (4,000
miles) east of Moscow, suffers from periodic cuts of water, heat
and electricity. City services like public transport, emergency
medical help and trash removal are sometimes put on hold when
neither mayor nor governor pays the bills.
	   Cherepkov's mayoral term ran out in July, and a court barred him
from seeking re-election. But voters rejected all candidates to
protest the decision, and the election was declared void. Cherepkov
remained in office.
	   He was ousted last Friday by a decree by President Boris
Yeltsin, who ordered Nazdratenko to appoint a replacement.
	   Nazdratenko selected Kopylov _ a former deputy of Cherepkov who
was fired last year and later joined Nazdratenko's camp.
	   The feud goes back to 1994, when Nazdratenko kicked Cherepkov
from office on corruption charges. Cherepkov fought back and camped
out in his office, and Yeltsin reinstated him as mayor in 1996
after the courts found him innocent of corruption.

Westendorp calls for sweeping reforms in Bosnia as peace review

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The western peace coordinator for Bosnia
appealed Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption
to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself from massive
foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   Even as delegates discussed how to rebuild Bosnia and create a
lasting peace, more fighting was reported in the restive Kosovo
province. Thirty-one ethnic Albanians were killed by Yugoslav army
troops in the province Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel of Austria, the current
president of the 15-member European Union, said in Madrid that
these clashes show that ``the situation is worsening.''
	   He called on Kosovo's secessionist ethnic Albanians to start
negotiations with the Serbian government on the future of the
impoverished southern province.
	   Meanwhile Westendorp, who has sweeping powers over Bosnia's
authorities under the Dayton peace agreement, said the West also
wants to see Bosnia strengthen institutions like its courts into
truly functioning, multiethnic bodies so people in the war-scarred
country feel their rights are protected.
	   The biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even though
production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council.
	   ``We have to change all that if the economy is ever to act as
the dynamo for growth able to create the jobs that are so
desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in western aid
Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. He urged stepping up the fight
against corruption, fraud and fiscal evasion.
	   The Council includes representation from some 40 countries. It
will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps aimed at
furthering postwar reconstruction in Bosnia.
	   The 1995 peace accords promised a safe return home and
compensation for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who fled Bosnia or were internally displaced during the
1992-95 ethnic-based war between Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   Both Westendorp and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, also
attending the meeting, called for more robust efforts among these
leaders to hunt indicted war crimes suspects like former Serbian
political leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   The Serb Republic's new hard-line president, Nikola Poplasen,
laughed when a reporter asked if he would surrender Karadzic. ``I
don't have him in my pocket,'' he said. ``I don't know where he
is.''

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying that obstacles must be overcome before
the men are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial. It ``means that they
will hand over the suspects sooner rather than later,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``It looks like they've made a clear decision, but we don't know
if this is the final line or what the time-scale is,'' he added.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the U.N.
chief had not received any official word on the decision from
Libya, but believes the approval represented a ``positive
development.''
	   But the spokesman, Manoel de Almeida E Silva, would not comment
on what the United Nations believed were the remaining obstacles.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met with Gadhafi to discuss a possible
handover of the suspects. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya was expected to reach a decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, the ambassador of
Slovenia, which is a member of the Security Council, said Libyan
Parliament's decision was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' said Danilo Turk. He
said the ball was still in Libya's court.
	   ``I don't think that there are any obstacles left on the side of
the United Nations. The Security Council has adopted the decision.
What is needed is the transfer of the two suspects,'' Turk said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal for
trial of the suspects in the Netherlands.
	   Ordinary Libyans appeared relieved on hearing the news but said
Libya should receive guarantees before the suspects are handed
over.
	   ``We agreed to a trial in a neutral country but with all
guarantees for their rights. This is the view of the Libyan
people,'' said Fadlallah Saad el-Barazi, a shop owner.
	   ``We hope other countries will accept this. We ask God for
success in this regard,'' said Ali Mohammed Abu Shusha, a barber.

Mandela narrowly escapes injury in killer tornado,

<TEXT>
	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela narrowly
escaped injury Tuesday from a tornado that killed 13 people in this
southeastern town, a presidential spokeswoman said.
	   The tornado injured 150 people, uprooted trees and swept roofs
off houses. Most of the victims were waiting at a bus stop where a
wall collapsed on them, police said.
	   Mandela, 80, whose home town of Qunu is about 20 kilometers (12
miles) outside Umtata, was shopping at his favorite pharmacy when
the storm hit the shop, spokeswoman Priscilla Naidoo said in a
telephone interview.
	   The shop was located in the hardest hit town center, where all
the trees on the main street were uprooted and the buildings
destroyed, according to police Director Chris Louw.
	   A magazine journalist who had taken film to be developed at the
pharmacy described the scene as the tornado hit the store.
	   ``I was standing close to the president to shake his hand,''
said Ponko Masiba, who writes for Bona, a national magazine. ``We
just heard a rattle and the ceiling started vibrating.''
	   In the next moment, Bona saw the president's security guards
dive onto him and press him to the floor, according to the South
African Press Association.
	   The doors and windows of the pharmacy were shattered by the
force of the storm, and part of the roof caved in, but the
president suffered no injuries.
	   ``The president and his bodyguards escaped unharmed and they
went home afterwards,'' Naidoo said.
	   Mandela was on holiday at his home town.
	   ``When he's on holiday he likes to pop over to the store to buy
some odds and ends,'' Naidoo said.
	   The tornado did serious damage to the Umtata General Hospital
and its intensive care unit.
	   A witness said the electricity had been cut in Umtata, which is
about 30 miles from the Indian Ocean.
	   ``I was in a car when a cloud covered the town. I couldn't see
anything. There were large hail stones,'' Lawrence Nkosi told SABC
radio.
	   Umtata is located about 50 kilometers inland from the Indian
Ocean. The tornado happened in mid-afternoon.
	   Another tornado touched down Tuesday about 250 kilometers (155
miles) west of Umtata in Hogsback. There were three injuries there,
the radio said.
	   Heavy rain and storms have plagued South Africa since Sunday.
	   Searchers have recovered 10 bodies and presume another four
people were drowned Sunday after the vehicle they were riding in
was swept into a river off a bridge near Badplaas, east of
Johannesburg.
	   In Cape Town, lightning on Monday set afire the home of Earl
Spencer, brother to the late Princess Diana.

Judges to investigate former Cabinet minister for embezzlement
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A panel of three judges is to investigate
corruption allegations against a former Oil Minister, the
ex-Cabinet minister himself announced Tuesday.
	   Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, who is also a member of the
ruling family, told a news conference Tuesday that Kuwait's
prosecutor general has referred his case to a judicial panel, a
step that could lead to a retrial.
	   ``As Ali al-Khalifa, I am glad I will put this behind me, but as
a Kuwaiti citizen, I am worried and sad that the government has
responded to the mob,'' he said, referring to public pressure for
his retrial.
	   Sheik Ali was charged in 1994 with helping former officials of
the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tankers Co., or KOTC, to pocket scores
of millions of dinars (dollars) in the 1980s.
	   Last year the case against him was dropped on a technicality
after years of maneuvering in various courts.
	   He has always maintained his innocence. His lawyers have argued
that under a l995 law for prosecuting ministers, Sheik Ali should
have been investigated by a panel of judges and not by public
prosecutors.
	   A criminal court sentenced in absentia three former KOTC
officials, Hassan Qabazard, Abdul-Fattah al-Bader and Nassim
Mohsen, to up to 40 years in prison for embezzlement in 1996. It
also ordered them to jointly repay dlrs 63 million dlrs (19.02
million dinars) and an identical sum in fines. The officials had
left Kuwait.
	   An appeals court quashed the convictions on a technicality in
March 1997, but the prosecutor general re-opened the case this
year.
	   Members of parliament have been campaigning for a retrial for
Sheik Ali. Several legislators have threatened to grill the current
Oil Minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah, if he does not take steps to see
that Sheik Ali stands trial again.
	   It was not possible to confirm late Tuesday that Sheik Ali's
case had been referred to a judicial panel, which would have the
job of deciding whether a retrial was necessary.
	   Sheik Ali said Tuesday that he had ``extreme confidence in
Kuwait's court system,'' and challenged ``anyone who had evidence
(against him) to offer it to the investigating panel.''

<TEXT>
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ A Caribbean cruise ship with
2,557 tourists struck a reef, began taking on water and was
purposely beached in a St. Maarten bay on Tuesday. Everyone aboard
was safely evacuated.
	   It took four hours in the pre-dawn darkness for rescuers,
including fishermen, to ferry nervous passengers off the 74,000-ton
Monarch of the Seas, which is owned by Royal Caribbean
International.
	   No one was hurt, said Royal Caribbean spokesman Rich Steck.
Passengers were put up in hotels and community centers throughout
the island 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Puerto Rico while
Royal Caribbean arranged charter flights to get them home.
	   ``Most of them are OK. Some of them are in shock. They're crying
because they lost their belongings,'' said Sayra Martina,
reservations manager at the Pelican Resort and Casino, where 40
passengers were staying.
	   Alarm bells rang after the cruise liner, also carrying 831 crew,
struck the reef about 2 a.m. (1800 GMT).
	   ``The impact was very strong; we all felt it. Everyone went
outside to see what had happened,'' said tourist Carlos Gonzalez of
Culebra, Puerto Rico. Passengers and crew had conducted an
emergency drill the day before, he said.
	   ``It was quite a drama this morning, but no one was hurt and
everyone is safe,'' said Nicolaas Martina, who witnessed the rescue
from the Holland House Beach Hotel overlooking Great Bay in
southern St. Maarten. The northern side is the French territory of
St. Martin.
	   The Monarch of the Seas was on its way from St. Thomas in the
U.S. Virgin Islands to the French island of Martinique when a
tourist developed a heart problem and the captain diverted to St.
Maarten to drop the patient off.
	   As the ship was leaving, it struck the reef and began taking on
water in three of its 18 watertight compartments. The crew decided
to purposely run the ship aground on soft sand in the harbor, Steck
said.
	   The Monarch's hull was damaged on both sides, said harbor master
Sunny Hoo. The vessel's draft is 25 feet (7 meters), while the
shallowest part of the reef sits 10 feet (3 meters) underwater, Hoo
said.
	   Crew members deployed a boom around the ship to contain any oil
spill. No leaks were reported.
	   Passengers were being flown home free of charge, said Royal
Caribbean spokeswoman Gloria Jacaruso.
	   The Monarch of the Seas had left San Juan, Puerto Rico, on
Sunday. Its itinerary included Martinique, Barbados, Antigua and
St. Maarten _ scheduled for Friday _ before it was diverted.

Kidd signs Newcastle winger, bids to hire McClair as No. 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Blackburn manager Brian Kidd made his
first signing on Tuesday, paying 2.35 million pounds (dlrs 3.9
million) for Newcastle's Northern Ireland international winger
Keith Gillespie.
	   Kidd, who took over from fired Roy Hodgson two weeks ago and is
hoping to appoint Brian McClair as his No. 2, persuaded 23-year-old
Gillespie to sign a 4 1/2 year contract.
	   Like McClair, Gillespie had links with Kidd at Manchester
United. He was transfered by United to Newcastle three seasons ago
as part of the deal that took Andy Cole to Old Trafford.
	   McClair left United after 11 seasons last year to move to
Scottish Premier League team Motherwell.

WWII concentration camp commander indicted for war crimes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The commander of Croatia's most notorious
World War II concentration camp was indicted for war crimes
Tuesday, six months after he was extradited from Argentina, where
he had lived quietly for nearly half a century.
	   Dinko Sakic, 76, was charged with crimes against humanity in the
deaths of more than 2,000 people at the Jasenovac concentration
camp during the nine months he ran the camp in 1944, the state-run
HINA news agency reported.
	   Sakic is accused of ``maltreating, torturing and killing
detainees'' and of allowing his subordinates to do the same from
April to November 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed at
Jasenovac, known as the ``Auschwitz of the Balkans,'' as the World
War II Croatian state was implementing racist and Nazi laws, the
indictment said.
	   Sakic has been in prison in Zagreb since June, when he was
extradited from Argentina, where he had lived since the Croatian
Nazi puppet state was crushed at the end of World War II.
	   Sakic's arrest followed an interview he gave in April to an
Argentine television station, in which he admitted running
Jasenovac, but claimed ``nothing happened there.''
	   District attorney Radovan Santek requested that Sakic stay in
custody until the trial. No trial date has been set. If convicted,
he faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
	   The number of Jasenovac victims _ Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
antifascist Croats _ has never been determined. Serbs, the majority
of victims, claim that 700,000 people were slaughtered there.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman had put the number at 60,000,
while the United States Justice Department said more than 120,000
people died there.
	   In an April 6 interview with a Buenos Aires television station,
Sakic, who had been living in Santa Teresita southeast of Buenos
Aires, denied any wrongdoing or that prisoners were killed under
his command.
	   ``We never put a hand on any of the prisoners in the camp,'' he
said. ``The people died of natural death. There was a typhus
epidemic, for example, but there were no cremation ovens that
killed anybody.''
	   Sakic also said he has traveled openly, on a passport using his
real identity, to a number of countries, including the United
States. He said he even met Tudjman during the Croatian president's
1994 visit to Buenos Aires.
	   President Carlos Menem called for Sakic's arrest a day after the
broadcast, even though there was no standing extradition request.
	   Argentina's quick extradition of Sakic contrasted with its
handling of previous cases, which gave Argentina a reputation as a
haven for Nazis hiding from their World War II past.
	   The indictment, drawn up after 46 Jasenovac survivors and
historians gave evidence, says 49,000 people were killed during the
four years the camp was operating _ a figure sure to be criticized
by Serbs as too low.
	   Croatia requested Sakic's extradition and based the indictment
on a four-month-long criminal investigation. The district attorney
said he also used files provided by the U.S. government,
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and the Yugoslav justice department.

Top FA official quits over loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Graham Kelly quit as chief executive of the
English Football Association on Tuesday in the latest potential
bribery scandal to hit the sports world.
	   The stunning move arises out of a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5.34
million) loan promised to the Welsh FA in what newspaper reports
have interpreted as an attempted bribe to help FA chairman Keith
Wiseman gain a high-ranking FIFA position.
	   According to spokesman David Davies, FA members accepted Kelly's
resignation and also passed a vote of no confidence in Wiseman but
he had refused to quit.
	   The FA scandal comes at a time when bribery allegations are rife
in Olympic circles. International Olympic Committee executive board
member Marc Hodler has alleged the practice of buying and selling
of votes in the election of host cities.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Western peace coordinator for Bosnia
appealed Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption
to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself from massive
foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   Even as delegates discussed how to rebuild Bosnia and create a
lasting peace, more fighting was reported in the restive Kosovo
province of neighboring Yugoslavia. Thirty-one ethnic Albanians
were killed by Yugoslav army troops in the province Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel of Austria, the current
president of the 15-member European Union, said in Madrid that
these clashes show that ``the situation is worsening.''
	   He called on Kosovo's secessionist ethnic Albanians to start
negotiations with the Serbian government on the future of the
impoverished southern province.
	   Meanwhile Westendorp, who has sweeping powers over Bosnia's
authorities under the Dayton peace agreement, said the West also
wants to see Bosnia strengthen institutions like its courts into
truly functioning, multiethnic bodies so people in the war-scarred
country feel their rights are protected.
	   The biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even though
production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council.
	   ``We have to change all that if the economy is ever to act as
the dynamo for growth able to create the jobs that are so
desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in western aid
Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. He urged stepping up the fight
against corruption, fraud and fiscal evasion.
	   The Council includes representation from some 40 countries. It
will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps aimed at
furthering postwar reconstruction in Bosnia.
	   The 1995 peace accords promised a safe return home and
compensation for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who fled Bosnia or were internally displaced during the
1992-95 ethnic-based war between Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   Both Westendorp and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, also
attending the meeting, called for more robust efforts among these
leaders to hunt indicted war crimes suspects like former Serbian
political leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   The Serb Republic's new hard-line president, Nikola Poplasen,
laughed when a reporter asked if he would surrender Karadzic. ``I
don't have him in my pocket,'' he said. ``I don't know where he
is.''

appealed Tuesday for economic reform and a crackdown on corruption
to help the struggling Balkan nation wean itself from massive
foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the Bosnian war in December 1995, High Representative Carlos
Westendorp also said 1999 would see a major push by the
international community to help thousands of refugees and displaced
persons return to their homes in Bosnia.
	   Even as delegates discussed how to rebuild Bosnia and create a
lasting peace, more fighting was reported in the restive Kosovo
province of neighboring Yugoslavia. Thirty-one ethnic Albanians
were killed by Yugoslav army troops in the province Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel of Austria, the current
president of the 15-member European Union, said in Madrid that
these clashes show that ``the situation is worsening.''
	   He called on Kosovo's secessionist ethnic Albanians to start
negotiations with the Serbian government on the future of the
impoverished southern province.
	   Meanwhile Westendorp, who has sweeping powers over Bosnia's
authorities under the Dayton peace agreement, said the West also
wants to see Bosnia strengthen institutions like its courts into
truly functioning, multiethnic bodies so people in the war-scarred
country feel their rights are protected.
	   The biggest hurdle to stability is the economy, even though
production is up somewhat and unemployment is down, said
Westendorp, a former Spanish foreign minister.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council.
	   ``We have to change all that if the economy is ever to act as
the dynamo for growth able to create the jobs that are so
desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp stressed that the billions of dollars in western aid
Bosnia depends on will soon dry up. He urged stepping up the fight
against corruption, fraud and fiscal evasion.
	   The Council includes representation from some 40 countries. It
will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps aimed at
furthering postwar reconstruction in Bosnia.
	   The 1995 peace accords promised a safe return home and
compensation for property lost to the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who fled Bosnia or were internally displaced during the
1992-95 ethnic-based war between Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   The Dayton agreement divided the country into the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serb Republic, and deployed a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
	   Both Westendorp and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, also
attending the meeting, called for more robust efforts among these
leaders to hunt indicted war crimes suspects like former Serbian
political leader Radovan Karadzic.
	   The Serb Republic's new hard-line president, Nikola Poplasen,
laughed when a reporter asked if he would surrender Karadzic. ``I
don't have him in my pocket,'' he said. ``I don't know where he
is.''

 &UR; Policeman faces manslaughter charge over youth killing

manslaughter charge &QL;

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A policeman who shot and killed a
17-year-old he was trying to arrest for stealing a car, sparking
rioting in this southern city, appeared before a judge Tuesday to
face possible manslaughter charges.
	   The police brigadier, Henri Bois, was expected to be placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged for
the crime, said Prosecutor Michel Breard.
	   An autopsy found that Habib, whose last name hasn't been
released, was killed early Sunday by a bullet that entered the left
side of his neck and punctured a lung, causing him to bleed to
death, Breard said.
	   The other police officer arrested after the slaying was freed
Tuesday afternoon, the prosecutor said.
	   Police contend the shooting, which occurred during a scuffle
while police were trying to make the arrest, was accidental.
	   Meanwhile, some 300 people from the poor neighborhood where
Habib lived marched silently through Toulouse Tuesday in his
memory, after two nights of rioting.
	   Under a banner reading ``Where is justice? No more police
brutality,'' Habib's older brother led the march.
	   Authorities were searching for Habib's accomplice, who was
quoted in the Liberation newspaper as denying the two were trying
to steal a car.
	   The family, meanwhile, was filing a complaint against police for
manslaughter and non-assistance to a person in danger.
	   In Paris, Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin appealed to
Toulouse youths to have faith in the country's justice system. He
spoke after youths rampaged for a second night Monday in a poor
Toulouse neighborhood.
	   Jospin said the interim interior minister, Jean-Jack Queyranne,
has ``the impression that things did not happen as they should
have.''
	   ``The police have a very difficult job,'' Jospin said in a
television interview. ``They must make people respect the law,
which applies to everyone. But clearly they must use judgment.''
	   The riots in Toulouse were the latest outbreak of violence
stemming from tension between French police and disaffected youths
from poor immigrant families.
	   On Sunday, at least 150 police faced off against up to 200
youths in a working-class district where unemployment has reached
35 percent. Angry youths threw stones and firebombs at security
forces and the clashes resumed late Monday.

Yugoslav deputy premier: Belarus' president is Slav `warrior hero'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Danilo
Vuksanovic on Tuesday called Belarus' authoritarian and eccentric
President Alexander Lukashenko a ``warrior hero of the Slavic
people.''
	   Lukashenko promised to give military help to the Yugoslav
government when NATO threatened airstrikes to end crackdowns on
ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
	   An open admirer of the Soviet Union, Lukashenko has charged that
Yugoslavia would be the next victim of NATO and western
democracies, which would then proceed to attack former Soviet
republics.
	   ``I see you as a warrior hero of the Slavic people,'' Vuksanovic
told Lukashenko during a meeting in Minsk, the Belarusian capital,
on Tuesday.
	   ``The reasons are simple: You had enough courage and honor to
tell the truth when we needed the truth.''
	   Vuksanovic was heading a delegation that arrived in Minsk last
week to take part in events celebrating Yugoslav culture.

Palmeiras seeks revenge against Cruzeiro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Palmeiras has a chance to settle a
grudge with Cruzeiro when the teams meet Wednesday in the first-leg
game of the Copa Mercosur finals.
	   Palmeiras has been itching for another chances at Cruzeiro for
several weeks ever since their dramatic Brazilian national
championship quarterfinal series, when a goal with two minutes left
in the deciding game gave Cruzeiro a 3-2 victory and eliminated
Palmeiras.
	   ``Cruzeiro has become a traditional rival,'' Palmeiras' all-star
fullback Junior Baiano said in a published interview.
	   Wednesday's game will be the first for Palmeiras since its
elimination, and some fear the layoff could hurt the team.
	   ``They're at 100 kph, while our team is at 65,'' said trainer
Paulo Paixao.
	   Still, with Palmeiras' stellar lineup, laden with current and
former members of the Brazilian national team, and a tradition of
rising for the big game, Cruzeiro's advantage will be slim.
	   Palmeiras routed opponents en route to the final of the Copa
Mercosur. The team has the best record in the tournament with nine
victories and a draw, and midfielder Alex leads all scorers with
six goals.
	   Besides, the layoff has given players a chance to rest and
recover from a grueling schedule, which could give them an edge
over weary Cruzeiro.
	   Cruzeiro opened the national championship final against
Corinthians on Sunday and plays the second leg this Sunday.
	   After 76 games so far this year _ 40 since July _ players are
dragging.
	   ``They're at the limit of their strength,'' Cruzeiro coach Levir
Culpi said. ``This wear and tear destabilizes the group, and
players start to miss passes.''
	   Sunday's game was a physical and emotional ordeal. On a heavy,
rain-soaked home pitch, Cruzeiro led 2-0 only to allow two goals
and settle for a 2-2 draw.
	   ``This gets players down. I know for myself,'' Palmeiras striker
Paulo Nunes said.
	   Culpi said he would decide Wednesday whether to rest key
starters against Palmeiras, especially veterans Muller, Valdo and
Wilson Gottardo. all past 30.
	   For Palmeiras, forward Oseas has a sprained ankle and was listed
as doubtful.

Ancient tablets show Egyptians may have invented writing

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German archaeologist said Tuesday he has
found what could be the earliest known writing by humankind _
records of linen and oil deliveries made about 5,300 years ago
during the reign of a king named Scorpion in southern Egypt.
	   The discovery throws open for debate a widely held belief among
historians that the first people to write were the Sumerians of the
Mesopotamian civilization sometime before 3000 B.C., or 5,000 years
ago.
	   While the exact date of Sumerian writing remains in doubt, the
Egyptian discoveries are carbon dated with certainty to between
3300 B.C. and 3200 B.C., Gunter Dreyer, head of the German
Archaeological Institute, told reporters.
	   The writings _ in the form of line drawings of animals, plants
and mountains _ are the first evidence that hieroglyphics used by
later-day Pharaonic dynasties did not ``rise as Phoenix from the
ashes'' but developed gradually, Dreyer said.
	   ``Linguists now have a larger history (of writing) to regard,''
he said.
	   An American archaeologist called it an ``exciting'' find.
	   ``This would be one of the greatest discoveries in history of
writing and ancient Egyptian culture,'' Kent Weeks, professor of
Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, told The Associated
Press.
	   But John Baines, a professor of Egyptology at Oxford University,
was more cautious.
	   ``Undoubtedly (Dreyer's) findings are very important, but I have
an open mind on this and would like to see'' more evidence on the
comparative ages of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian samples, Baines
said in a telephone interview.
	   At this point, ``I would say it is likely that writing was
invented in both places,'' he said.
	   The bulk of Dreyer's discovery was from the tomb of King
Scorpion I in a cemetery in the Sohag province, 500 kilometers (300
miles) south of Cairo.
	   Kings in pre-Pharaonic times used to take names of animals and
many records have been found of chieftains named Mouse, Falcon,
Double Falcon and Elephant. The first Pharaonic dynasty began in
2920 B.C. with King Menes and the Great Pyramid was not built until
nearly 400 years later.
	   Since 1985, Dreyer and his team have unearthed about 300 pieces
of written material on clay tablets barely bigger than postage
stamps and clay jars and vases with ink impressions.
	   Two-thirds of them have been deciphered as documentary records
of linen and oil delivered to King Scorpion I in taxes, short
notes, numbers, lists of kings' names and names of institutions.
	   Apart from the academic question of who came first, the Egyptian
writings prove that the society then was far more developed than
previously thought, Dreyer said.
	   He said the first human writing was not a creative outpouring
but the result of economics: when chieftains expanded their areas
of control they needed to keep a record of taxes, which in those
days were in the form of commodities.
	   Although the Egyptian writings are made up of symbols, they can
be called true writing because each symbol stands for a consonant
and makes up syllables.
	   For example, the city named Ba-set was written by drawing
together a throne, known as Ba, and a stork, Set.
	   ``In principle they were able to express themselves clearly,''
Dreyer said.

Spanish daily says Puerto Rican ambivalence reflects U.S. racism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Puerto Rican rejection of U.S. statehood is
the flipside of mainland racism, a leading Spanish daily said
Tuesday.
	   El Pais said in an editorial that this week's referendum on the
island's future showed that Puerto Ricans are aware that the U.S.
Congress and most mainlanders are opposed to ``the integration of a
state into the Union that is mostly black and mulatto and has
Spanish as an official language.''
	   According to Spain's biggest general news daily, ``Puerto Ricans
don't know what they want, but they do know what they don't want.''
	   Puerto Ricans on Sunday rejected both statehood and independence
in a poll in which just over 50 percent voted for a ``none of the
above'' option.

Pinochet lawyers say Amnesty-linked judge was biased
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with new quotes; background &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers argued Tuesday that a judge who denied
Gen. Augusto Pinochet immunity from arrest was _ or certainly
appeared _ biased because of strong ties with Amnesty
International, a prime mover in a 25-year campaign to put the
former Chilean dictator on trial.
	   South African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann is the head of
Amnesty's fundraising arm and his wife, Gillian, has spent her
working life with the human rights organization.
	   ``This is way beyond simply being a member of an organization,''
Clare Montgomery, one of Pinochet's lawyers, told a five-judge
tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   ``These links, we suggest, are so great and so many that any
reasonable person looking at this would say, `We have a reasonable
apprehension that there may be bias','' she added.
	   The return to the Lords marked a new move in the 83-year-old
general's battle to avoid extradition to Spain to face on charges
of murder, torture and other heinous abuses of human rights during
his 1973-90 rule.
	   The latest legal step is virtually unprecedented: A new
five-judge tribunal is being asked to overturn the Lords' own Nov.
25 judgment against Pinochet, or at least to nullify Hoffmann's
vote in the 3-2 ruling.
	   The hearing _ hinging on the maxim that justice must not only be
done but be seen to be done _ is expected to last through
Wednesday.
	   Hoffmann, an opponent of apartheid, settled in Britain with his
wife, also a South African, in the 1960s. Amnesty says the
Hoffmanns played no part in its campaign against Pinochet.
	   Spain's lawyer, Alun Jones, contended that Pinochet's lawyers
had turned to the Lords only because Home Secretary Jack Straw
rejected their claims that Hoffmann was biased. Straw, a Cabinet
member, gave the go-ahead Dec. 9 for Spain to start extradition
proceedings.
	   ``This petition is an abuse of the process of your lordships'
House,'' Jones said.
	   Pinochet's lawyers maintain that if they can get Hoffmann's
ruling quashed, Pinochet then should be freed, since three High
Court judges had ruled earlier that he does have immunity from
prosecution.
	   Hoffmann, the only judge who did not give reasons for his
Pinochet ruling, has made no public comment since the case.
	   If the new tactic fails, Pinochet's lawyers will challenge Straw
in the High Court, the one below the Lords.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 while in recovering from back
surgery in London, remains under police guard at a rented mansion
at Wentworth, 20 miles (35 kms) west of London.
	   Aides say he now knows he may be there for a year while
challenges and counterchallenges rumble through Britain's courts.
	   An official Chilean report says Pinochet's secret police killed
some 3,000 political opponents after he overthrew an elected
Marxist. Chile, however, wants him back, partly because he is a
senator-for-life in the new democratic government built on
compromise.
	   Earlier, the Foreign Office withdraw a warning to Britons not to
travel to Chile because of the furor over Pinochet's detention, but
said they should still be careful.

Part of Kruger Park returned to South Africans evicted under
</HEADLINE>
apartheid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A judge formalized on Tuesday
an agreement made earlier this year to return 27,000 hectares
(67,000 acres) of Kruger National Park to people kicked out during
apartheid.
	   The land was restored to the Maluleke community, a group that
was evicted by the apartheid government in 1969 in order to create
the park.
	   ``It's dreams that come true today, especially for our elderly
people,'' said Livingstone Maluleke, who was 12 when his family was
removed from the land.
	   Starting in 1966, the apartheid government forced nonwhites to
move into designated areas that were often barren and unproductive,
culminating a policy begun earlier in the century that assigned 8
percent of the land to nonwhites, then about 67 percent of the
population.
	   When white rule ended after 1994 all-race elections, the
government drafted laws to give the land back. More than 26,000
claims involving individuals and communities representing hundreds
of thousands of people have applied to get their land back.
	   Progress has been painfully slow because of legal complexities
and lost or destroyed records.
	   In September, the government kicked off an effort to restore
45,000 people of mixed race to their homes in a Cape Town
neighborhood called District Six.
	   The 10,000 residents of the Maluleke community plan to remain in
their current homes and develop lodges and eco-tourism on their
park land. The agreement calls for joint management by the
community and the South African National Parks Board for the first
25 years.

Capital's zoo gets Russian leopards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; dg5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) _ Zoo Boise has two new and rare Amur leopards
on display.
	   The big cats are named for the Amur River region of Russia near
the Chinese border, although Zoo Boise's are California natives.
Only 30 of the animals remain in the wild, and 260 in captivity.
	   ``Zoo Boise is fortunate to receive these beautiful animals,
since there are so few of them left in the world,'' said Steve
Burns, Friends of Zoo Boise director. The leopards are brother and
sister: a 6-year-old male and a 3-year old female.
	   The 100-plus-pound cats were born in a breeding facility and
came to Boise as part of a national conservation program run by the
American Zoologic and Aquarium Association.
	   Poachers kill them for their skins and their body parts, used
for medicine in Asia. Logging and mining are destroying their

Top FA official quits over loan

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Graham Kelly quit as chief executive of the
English Football Association on Tuesday in the latest potential
bribery scandal to hit the sports world.
	   The stunning move arises out of a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5.34
million) loan promised to the Welsh FA in what newspaper reports
have interpreted as an attempted bribe to help FA chairman Keith
Wiseman gain a high-ranking FIFA position.
	   According to spokesman David Davies, FA members accepted Kelly's
resignation and also passed a vote of no confidence in Wiseman
although he had refused to quit.
	   The FA scandal comes at a time when bribery allegations are rife
in Olympic circles. International Olympic Committee executive board
member Marc Hodler has alleged the practice of buying and selling
of votes in the election of host cities.
	   Tuesday's announcement came from Davies after a meeting of the
FA executive committee at its headquarters at Lancaster Gate in
west London.
	   ``The FA's executive committee met today to discuss the
positions of our chairman and chief executive,'' Davies said.
	   ``This followed contacts over recent months with the Football
Association of Wales and the actions in that connection of Keith
Wiseman and Graham Kelly.
	   ``The executive committee has this afternoon accepted the
resignation of Graham Kelly. They have thanked him for his 10 years
of dedicated work at Lancaster Gate and wished him well for the
future.
	   ``They have also passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the
chairman Keith Wiseman,'' Davies said. ``He was informed of this
personally by the vice-chairman, Geoff Thompson. He has declined to
resign.
	   ``The executive will seek endorsement for their action at a
special FA council meeting in early January. This vote of no
confidence, I stress, was taken unanimously by an executive
committee that represents all sections of the game.
	   ``It was taken with sadness and only after considerable
examination of all the circumstances, it was not taken lightly.
	   ``Contrary to some unfair speculation it wasn't part of any
personal campaign against any individual.'' Davies said. ``Such an
outcome has been painful for all those involved in taking the
decision.''
	   Davies then read out a statement from Wiseman.
	   ``The issue is one for the full Football Association Council,''
he said.
	   ``I do not intend to make any comment at all until I have shared
the full circumstances of this matter with them all _ save that the
version of events carried hitherto in the national press is a gross
distortion of the truth.''
	   Davies said the executive committee decided that he would take
over Kelly's position for the time being and that Thompson would
take Wiseman's position, pending the FA Council meeting.
	   ``It is the wish of the executive committee that the
vice-chairman Geoff Thompson should lead the FA in the immediate
future,'' Davies said.
	   ``They have also asked me to become executive director in
overall charge of everyday running of the FA for the time being. I
do so in the confidence that I have the backing of the staff.''

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Some 1,600 U.S. soldiers headed into
northern and western Nicaragua on Tuesday to begin rebuilding
roads, highways and bridges destroyed by Hurricane Mitch.
	   The troops are part of the 5,600-member task force sent by the
U.S. government to help Central American nations.
	   The storm, which struck in late October and early November,
killed more than 9,000 people and caused an estimated dlrs 6
billion in damage, much of it along thousands of miles (kilometers)
of roads and bridges.
	   The U.S. troops departed from El Realejo, a colonial-era port 90
miles (145 kms) northwest of Managua, for work in the provinces of
Esteli, Nueva Segovia, Matagalpa and Jimotega.
	   Medical personnel among the troops will build a health station
in Wiwili, near the Honduran border.
	   Some 900 Nicaraguan soldiers are being sent along to protect the
U.S. troops in regions which saw heavy fighting during Nicaragua's
1980s civil war.

More than 23,000 teachers strike for back wages in Siberia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least 23,000 teachers in eastern Siberia and
northwestern Russia went on an indefinite strike Tuesday to demand
months of back wages, and some blocked a railroad.
	   About 100 of the striking teachers and parents of schoolchildren
picketed on snow-covered railroad tracks in the northwestern region
of Vologda, prompting local authorities to send riot troops to the
area, the NTV television station reported. No violence was
reported.
	   Around Vologda, about 12,000 teachers at a total of 443 schools
and day care centers went on strike, union officials said.
	   Vologda authorities said the government had given them no money
to pay the back wages the teachers are demanding.
	   In the Siberian region of Buryatia, 11,500 teachers walked out
and classes were suspended at 245, or about a third, of the
region's schools because of the strike, the ITAR-Tass news agency
cited local officials as saying.
	   The Buryatia teachers are owed 289 million rubles (dlrs 14
million) in back pay, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The government has accumulated millions of rubles (dollars) in
wage debts to state employees since the fall of the Soviet Union.
Some workers have taken desperate measures, including hunger
strikes and suicide, to protest their condition.

After Clinton visit, talk of early elections is getting louder

ANALYSIS-Israel-Election Countdown &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talk of early elections is getting louder in
Israel in the wake of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, which
brought into sharp relief Benjamin Netanyahu's dilemma _ he can
either try to maintain his coalition or implement peace accords
with the Palestinians.
	   But he cannot do both.
	   For now, Netanyahu seems to have opted for political survival.
	   On Tuesday, he refused to withdraw troops in the West Bank on
schedule, despite a personal appeal from Clinton in a two-hour
meeting. Clinton showed his displeasure by walking away from the
talks without holding a joint news conference with his host.
	   Netanyahu's defiance _ handing the U.S. president a diplomatic
defeat with the whole world watching _ satisfied some coalition
hawks, who said they now believe the prime minister is serious
about scrapping the Wye River peace agreement.
	   Other hard-liners said they would keep trying to topple
Netanyahu, arguing that his showdown with Clinton was a ploy and
that he would eventually cave in to U.S. pressure.
	   The moment of truth comes Monday, when parliament votes either
on a no-confidence motion or on a bill to hold early elections.
	   Netanyahu himself had instigated the no-confidence motion Dec. 7
as part of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the vote on
the early elections bill by two weeks.
	   It is expected that Netanyahu will ask the legislator who
presented the no-confidence motion at his behest to withdraw it
before Monday.
	   This would leave on the table a bill to call spring elections,
more than 18 months ahead of schedule. The bill's sponsors from the
opposition Labor Party need at least 61 votes in the 120-seat
parliament to get it passed.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, Labor's caucus chairman, smelled victory on
Tuesday.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt, who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor.
	   Goldschmidt's boss, Labor leader Ehud Barak, talked strategy
Tuesday with James Carville, an independent American political
consultant who led Clinton to a come-from-behind victory in 1992.
	   Barak has failed to take a decisive lead over Netanyahu in the
polls despite the prime minister's frequent entanglements in
political scandals. Still, Carville was confident. ``I didn't take
a flight this far to lose,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be unshaken.
	   ``We will go to the people if necessary,'' he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``I don't fear elections.''
	   It does look like Netanyahu has some escape routes.
	   The early elections bill is only up for a first reading Monday,
and two more are required, giving Netanyahu plenty of time to try
and get the legislation buried in the Law Committee.
	   The panel is headed by Hanan Porat, a leader of the Jewish
settlement movement, who might be swayed by promises that no more
West Bank land will be handed to the Palestinians.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's office published a list of six demands _
two more than Monday _ that the Palestinians will have to meet
before Israel carries out a troop pullback.
	   However, killing the elections bill will not solve Netanyahu's
problems. He needs to get a 1999 budget bill passed this month,
making him vulnerable to political blackmail.
	   But Netanyahu hinted that he may yet have a few surprises in
store.
	   ``I've always liked to confound and disappoint those who write
my political obituary,'' he told the AP. ``I've been doing that for
so many years now that I begin to yawn.''

Chile's largest airline suspends flights to Falklands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's largest airline said Tuesday it
is suspending its flights to the Falkland islands effective next
March 31, as requested by the government to protest the continued
detention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   In a brief communique, LanChile said it would like to suspend
the flights earlier, but that it must honor a contract with a
development agency on the island.
	   After the contract's March expiration, LanChile ``will suspend
all its operations'' to the South Atlantic archipelago.
	   The operations include a weekly flight from the Chilean city of
Punta Arenas, at the southern tip of South America, to Mount
Pleasant, the islands airport, and frequent charter flights.
	   The government last Friday announced a series of reprisals
against Britain over the Pinochet case, including a request for all
private airlines to suspend their flights. LanChile is privately
owned.
	   DAP, a small regional airline based in Punta Arenas, has said it
will continue to fly to Mount Pleasant. It conducts only charter
flights.
	   Pinochet has remained in police custody in London since Oct. 16.
He is fighting extradition to Spain where he faces charges for
genocide and torture for human rights abuses during his 1973-90
dictatorship.

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Returning home to an
impeachment vote, President Bill Clinton ended his Mideast journey
on a disappointing note Tuesday as Israel refused to resume the
West Bank troop withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace
accord.
	   Nonetheless, Clinton declared his three-day trip a success and
expressed hope the troop pullbacks would commence soon. ``I do
think we are back on track again,'' the president said.
	   ``It's a bumpy track, but it's on track,'' observed his national
security adviser, Sandy Berger.
	   Clinton said the work would continue. ``We'll just keep at it,''
he said, and announced that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will return to the Mideast in several weeks. Albright made a quick
trip to Jordan on Tuesday to report on Clinton's talks.
	   After a day of sightseeing, the president and his family climbed
aboard Air Force One and headed home, due back at the White House
just 34 hours before the full House opens debate on four articles
of impeachment that could lead to his removal from office.
	   White House aides held Wednesday's schedule open for Clinton to
meet or talk by phone with any lawmakers seeking last-minute
answers or assurances. The Senate will decide Clinton's fate if the
House approves any of the impeachment charges.
	   Despite the grave threat to his presidency, Clinton did not seem
particularly troubled Tuesday. With his arm around his wife, he and
his family sang Christmas carols in Bethlehem's Manger Square at
the Church of the Nativity. He and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton prayed at the church, which is built over the grotto where
tradition says Jesus was born, and they all hung ornaments on a
Christmas tree outside.
	   Later, the Clintons rode a cable car to the mountaintop
stronghold of Masada, where 960 Jewish men, women and children died
in a mass suicide 2000 years ago rather than be conquered by Roman
troops. It was a sunny day, and the Clintons gazed across the Dead
Sea at Jordan.
	   Clinton's day began at Erez Crossing, the border outpost where
he struggled to salvage the Wye accord in what he said was ``a very
frank meeting'' with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who accuse each other of
violating the Oct. 23 agreement.
	   In the meeting, the three leaders discussed the work of
committees set up under the Wye accords to resolve sticky issues
such as weapons confiscation and safe passage at border crossings.
	   ``We now have to decide practical means to go forward,'' Clinton
said.
	   ``The atmosphere was an open exchange,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat left the meeting without speaking to reporters, but an
adviser, Marwan Kanafani, harshly criticized Netanyahu.
	   ``He is intentionally crushing all efforts that Clinton exerted
and is stopping the implementation of an agreement he personally
signed,'' Kanafani said. ``What Netanyahu constantly repeats in his
statements further reinforces the doubts of the Palestinian people
about his intentions to carry out the peace agreements.''
	   The scenario is complicated by Netanyahu's battle for political
survival. He is trying to hold together a shaky government
coalition of hardliners who are angry that he signed the Wye
agreement and doves who are unhappy that he has suspended filling
its terms.
	   Netanyahu, at a news conference, said he would withdraw troops
from the West Bank only if Palestinians agreed to his demands _
some of which the United States says go beyond the terms of the Wye
deal.
	   The prime minister said troops would withdraw if the
Palestinians confiscate illegal weapons, stop inciting violence
against Israel, publicly drop plans to unilaterally declare a state
next May and agree to Israel's criteria for the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``When they do this, we will do what we are required to do,''
Netanyahu said, adding that the faster the Palestinians fulfilled
their obligations, the faster Israel would withdraw troops. This
phase of the withdrawal was supposed to begin Friday.
	   ``It would be unfortunate if it gets too far behind schedule,''
Clinton said. ``I hope that we can keep pretty much to the schedule
that's there.''
	   He stressed that Netanyahu had reaffirmed Israel's obligation to
complete the troop withdrawals, even as he refused to go ahead now,
and sought to calm Netanyahu's complaints over Arafat's statements
about declaring statehood.
	   ``Neither side should try to stop the other from saying what
their vision of the future is. That would be a terrible mistake,''
Clinton said. He added, however, that neither side should imply it
will not negotiate matters that it already has agreed to negotiate,
such as Palestinian sovereignty.
	   Clinton left behind a tempest over his remarks about the pain
felt by the children of jailed Palestinians and slain Israelis.
Netanyahu said Clinton drew an unfair parallel ``between the
murderers and their victims.'' The controversy mushed into a debate
in Israeli media.

German zoo hopes court will allow it to accept baby elephants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ The Dresden Zoo went to court Tuesday to
challenge Environment Minister Juergen Trittin's order forbidding
the import of four baby elephants taken from the wild in Africa and
abused.
	   Zoo director Hubert Luecker said the complaint was filed with an
administrative court in Cologne.
	   The elephants, which were to be sent this month to the Dresden
and Erfurt zoos in eastern Germany, were part of a group of 30
young elephants captured in August from herds in Botswana and taken
to a South African farm.
	   A South African judge ruled early this month that the animals
had been abused and deprived of water at the farm. He granted
temporary custody to the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
	   But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants
to Germany and three to Switzerland, Trittin last week said Germany
would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its
zoos.
	   Others argue the elephants may face a worse fate if they don't
come to Germany.
	   Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in
parliament Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals
from being put to sleep in South Africa.
	   In addition, the cultural minister of Saxony, of which Dresden
is the capital, asked the state's 740,000 school children to write
letters of protest urging Tritten to allow the elephants into
Germany.

Top FA official quits over loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Graham Kelly quit as chief executive of the
English Football Association on Tuesday in the latest potential
bribery scandal to hit the sports world.
	   The stunning move arises out of a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5.34
million) loan promised to the Welsh FA in what newspaper reports
have interpreted as an attempted bribe to help FA chairman Keith
Wiseman gain a high-ranking FIFA position.
	   According to spokesman David Davies, FA members accepted Kelly's
resignation and also passed a vote of no confidence in Wiseman
although he had refused to quit.
	   The FA scandal comes at a time when bribery allegations are rife
in Olympic circles. International Olympic Committee executive board
member Marc Hodler has alleged the practice of buying and selling
of votes in the election of host cities.
	   Last month, the Mail on Sunday carried a report saying that
Wiseman had unilaterally pledged a loan to the Welsh FA and failed
to provide satisfactory explanations to the executive committee.
	   According to the paper, the move came shortly after he had
received the Welsh FA's backing to help his nomination as a FIFA
vice-president.
	   Tuesday's announcement came from Davies after a meeting of the
FA executive committee at its headquarters at Lancaster Gate in
west London.
	   ``The FA's executive committee met today to discuss the
positions of our chairman and chief executive,'' Davies said.
	   ``This followed contacts over recent months with the Football
Association of Wales and the actions in that connection of Keith
Wiseman and Graham Kelly.
	   ``The executive committee has this afternoon accepted the
resignation of Graham Kelly. They have thanked him for his 10 years
of dedicated work at Lancaster Gate and wished him well for the
future.
	   ``They have also passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the
chairman Keith Wiseman,'' Davies said. ``He was informed of this
personally by the vice-chairman, Geoff Thompson. He has declined to
resign.
	   ``The executive will seek endorsement for their action at a
special FA council meeting in early January. This vote of no
confidence, I stress, was taken unanimously by an executive
committee that represents all sections of the game.
	   ``It was taken with sadness and only after considerable
examination of all the circumstances, it was not taken lightly.
	   ``Contrary to some unfair speculation it wasn't part of any
personal campaign against any individual.'' Davies said. ``Such an
outcome has been painful for all those involved in taking the
decision.''
	   Davies then read out a statement from Wiseman.
	   ``The issue is one for the full Football Association Council,''
he said.
	   ``I do not intend to make any comment at all until I have shared
the full circumstances of this matter with them all _ save that the
version of events carried hitherto in the national press is a gross
distortion of the truth.''
	   At the time of the Mail on Sunday story, Wiseman said he always
acted ``in the interests of the FA.''
	   ``There is nothing wrong or unusual in helping smaller
footballing nations _ be they close neighbors or those further
afield _ in financial and other ways with their development plans
and youth programs,'' he said.
	   Davies said the executive committee decided that he would take
over Kelly's position for the time being and that Thompson would
take Wiseman's position, pending the FA Council meeting.
	   ``It is the wish of the executive committee that the
vice-chairman Geoff Thompson should lead the FA in the immediate
future,'' Davies said.
	   ``They have also asked me to become executive director in
overall charge of everyday running of the FA for the time being. I
do so in the confidence that I have the backing of the staff.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A German archaeologist said Tuesday that he
has found what could be the earliest known human writing _ records
of linen and oil deliveries made about 5,300 years ago during the
reign of a king named Scorpion in southern Egypt.
	   The discovery throws open for debate a widely held belief among
historians that the first people to write were the Sumerians of the
Mesopotamian civilization sometime before 3000 B.C., or 5,000 years
ago.
	   While the exact date of the development of Sumerian writing
remains in doubt, the Egyptian discoveries are carbon dated with
certainty to between 3300 B.C. and 3200 B.C., said Gunter Dreyer,
head of the German Archaeological Institute.
	   The writings _ line drawings of animals, plants and mountains _
are the first evidence that hieroglyphics used later by Pharaonic
dynasties did not ``rise as Phoenix from the ashes'' but developed
gradually, Dreyer said. ``Linguists now have a larger history to
regard.''
	   An American archaeologist called it an ``exciting'' find.
	   ``This would be one of the greatest discoveries in history of
writing and ancient Egyptian culture,'' Kent Weeks, professor of
Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, told The Associated
Press.
	   Describing Dreyer as a ``very meticulous scholar,'' Weeks said
the archaeologist would not have disclosed his findings without
being ``absolutely certain.''
	   John Baines, a professor of Egyptology at Oxford University, was
more cautious.
	   ``Undoubtedly (Dreyer's) findings are very important, but I have
an open mind on this and would like to see'' more evidence on the
comparative ages of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian samples, Baines
said in a telephone interview.
	   At this point, ``I would say it is likely that writing was
invented in both places,'' he said.

Documentation over Nazi slave labor found in Austrian factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A commission looking into Nazi slave
labor in an Austrian factory has found more than 30,000 files
containing information about foreign workers forced to work in the
plant during World War II, the head of the investigating team said
Tuesday.
	   Commission chairman Oliver Rathkolb told the Austria Press
Agency that the files, including names and other information about
the workers, were found recently in a concrete tower used as an
antiaircraft gun platform during the war on VOEST-Alpine property.
	   The VOEST-Alpine steel and metal conglomerate in Linz, about 150
kilometers (90 miles) west of Vienna was renamed after Herman
Goering, Hitler's lieutenant, after Nazi Germany absorbed Austria
in 1938 and was a major arms producer for Hitler's war machinery.
	   Millions of Poles, Russians and others considered inferior by
the Nazis were forced to work there and in plants elsewhere
throughout Hitler's Reich.
	   Germany has paid more than dlrs 60 billion in reparations to
Nazi victims, but has refused to honor wage claims by slave
laborers, who were technically working for private companies.
	   Lawyers and historians in the United States and elsewhere are
compiling evidence of slave labor in Germany and Austria for
possible use in class action suits on behalf of survivors. VOEST
and several other Austrian companies have set up independent
commissions to look into their companies' wartime histories.
	   VOEST, along with Steyr-Daimler-Puch and Lenzinger
Zellstoffwerke are the three Austrian companies believed to have
used the most slave labor during the war. They are negotiating with
New York lawyers who claim to represent former victims, but no
details of any settlement have been published
	   Separately an Austrian government commission is examining
options for compensating victims of Nazi looting and unjust
post-World War II restitution laws, in the face of threatened
lawsuits. Money, art and other valuables were looted by the Nazis
as well as the immediate postwar government.

Seeking to pressure IRA, Protestant gang promises to start
</HEADLINE>
disarming &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group promised Tuesday to start
disarming by Christmas, a gambit designed to pressure its Irish
Republican Army enemies into doing the same.
	   The outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force _ which opposed April's
peace accord but called a cease-fire in May _ promised to hand over
or destroy guns under the supervision of a commission led by
Canada's former army chief, Gen. John de Chastelain.
	   ``The ruling army council of the LVF have assured the
commission, through me tonight, that there will be indeed a
decommissioning event before Christmas,'' the group's intermediary,
paroled murderer and preacher Kenny McClinton, said after meeting
de Chastelain.
	   McClinton declined to speculate on the precise number of weapons
the group would present. But he noted that the Loyalist Volunteers
would expect the better-armed IRA to match the gesture by disposing
of at least 10 times as many weapons.
	   The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party dismissed the Loyalist
Volunteers' plan as a stunt that wouldn't affect IRA policy. Last
week, the IRA emphasized it would not get rid of even a single
bullet to show its 17-month-old truce was sincere.
	   The peace accord calls for the IRA and illegal pro-British
groups on the Protestant side to complete disarming by mid-2000,
but does not specify a start date.
	   The Loyalist Volunteers were formed in 1996 with the aim of
derailing the truce observed since 1994 by Northern Ireland's
established pro-British groups. They killed more than a dozen
Catholic civilians at critical junctures in negotiations, but
failed to smother the momentum toward compromise.
	   British and Irish police believe the Loyalist Volunteers have
access to fewer than 100 guns. The IRA, by contrast, has tons of
hidden weaponry, including Semtex commercial explosive, thousands
of detonators and hundreds of Kalashnikov assault rifles.
	   Tuesday's announcement came just hours after the Loyalist
Volunteers' commander, Mark ``Swinger'' Fulton, was refused bail in
Belfast High Court.
	   Fulton was arrested earlier this month after allegedly firing
four shots into the air, then holding the pistol to the head of
another man in his hometown of Portland.
	   His lawyers argued Tuesday that Fulton hadn't fired the gun, and
had been given a formal permit by de Chastelain to carry the weapon
since it had been designated to form part of a larger arms
handover.
	   The presiding judge said that while that might be true, it
didn't matter.

Iranian opposition group denies being behind recent killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt, (AP) _ An Iranian opposition group denied Tuesday
that it's behind a wave of mysterious murders in Tehran.
	   The group, the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq Organization, blamed
Iran's judiciary and Intelligence Ministry for the deaths of five
government critics in the past month. Two other dissidents remain
missing.
	   Iran's judiciary, controlled by hard-liners, blamed unnamed
foreigners for the killings and a group of legislators have pointed
the finger at the Mujahedeen.
	   But the Mujahedeen, in a statement faxed to The Associated Press
in Cairo, Egypt, said the accusations were an excuse by the regime
to carry out military strikes against their bases in Iraq.
	   ``By churning out such lies and attributing these heinous
murders to the Mujahedeen,'' Iran's Intelligence Ministry and the
judiciary ``seek to conceal the true identity of the perpetrators
and masterminds of these crimes who are none other than the leaders
and agents of the regime,'' the statement said.
	   Iranian moderates say the killings are aimed at tarnishing the
image of President Mohammad Khatami, who is locked in a power
struggle with conservative clergymen opposed to his political and
social reforms.

Vatican assails Dutch move to let gays adopt children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican mewspaper sounded an alarm
Tuesday over calls for legalization of gay marriages, assailing in
particular a Dutch plan to let homosexuals adopt children.
	   The commentary in L'Osservatore Romano noted the debates in
Western Europe and North America, saying ``the battle taking place
knows no truce.''
	   Gay marriage is legal in Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and
Iceland while France is debating a bill that would grant gay
couples a series of legal rights but stopping short of recognizing
the marriage.
	   The Dutch government plan, which would restrict adoptions to
Dutch children, is expected to go before parliament early next year
in a drive to have it become law by Jan. 1, 2000.
	   ``Homosexuals are naturally incapable of assuring the paternal
and maternal image with which a child has need to grow up healthy
and balanced,'' wrote the Rev. Gino Concetti, a theologian, in the
Vatican's daily newspaper.
	   In modern society, he said, ``there's already an army of
children who are sufferring because of the disintegration of the
family. With adoption by homosexuals, that army will be destined to
grow.''

Seeking to pressure IRA, Protestant gang promises to start
</HEADLINE>
disarming &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group promised Tuesday to start
disarming by Christmas, a gambit designed to pressure its Irish
Republican Army enemies into doing the same.
	   The outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force _ which opposed April's
peace accord but called a cease-fire in May _ promised to hand over
or destroy guns under the supervision of a commission led by
Canada's former army chief, Gen. John de Chastelain.
	   ``The ruling army council of the LVF have assured the
commission, through me tonight, that there will be indeed a
decommissioning event before Christmas,'' the group's intermediary,
paroled murderer and preacher Kenny McClinton, said after meeting
de Chastelain.
	   McClinton declined to speculate on the precise number of weapons
the group would present. But he noted that the Loyalist Volunteers
would expect the better-armed IRA to match the gesture by disposing
of at least 10 times as many weapons.
	   The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party dismissed the Loyalist
Volunteers' plan as a stunt that wouldn't affect IRA policy. Last
week, the IRA emphasized it would not get rid of even a single
bullet to show its 17-month-old truce was sincere.
	   The peace accord calls for the IRA and illegal pro-British
groups on the Protestant side to complete disarming by mid-2000,
but does not specify a start date.
	   The Loyalist Volunteers were formed in 1996 with the aim of
derailing the truce observed since 1994 by Northern Ireland's
established pro-British groups. They killed more than a dozen
Catholic civilians at critical junctures in negotiations, but
failed to smother the momentum toward compromise.
	   British and Irish police believe the Loyalist Volunteers have
access to fewer than 100 guns. The IRA, by contrast, has tons of
hidden weaponry, including Semtex commercial explosive, thousands
of detonators and hundreds of Kalashnikov assault rifles.
	   Tuesday's announcement came just hours after the Loyalist
Volunteers' commander, Mark ``Swinger'' Fulton, was refused bail in
Belfast High Court.
	   Fulton was arrested earlier this month after allegedly firing
four shots into the air, then holding the pistol to the head of
another man in his hometown of Portadown.

After Clinton visit, talk of early elections is getting louder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 22nd graf with report that finance minister
resigned &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Talk of early elections is getting louder in
Israel in the wake of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, which
brought into sharp relief Benjamin Netanyahu's dilemma _ he can
either try to maintain his coalition or implement peace accords
with the Palestinians.
	   But he cannot do both.
	   For now, Netanyahu seems to have opted for political survival.
	   On Tuesday, he refused to withdraw troops in the West Bank on
schedule, despite a personal appeal from Clinton in a two-hour
meeting. Clinton showed his displeasure by walking away from the
talks without holding a joint news conference with his host.
	   Netanyahu's defiance _ handing the U.S. president a diplomatic
defeat with the whole world watching _ satisfied some coalition
hawks, who said they now believe the prime minister is serious
about scrapping the Wye River peace agreement.
	   Other hard-liners said they would keep trying to topple
Netanyahu, arguing that his showdown with Clinton was a ploy and
that he would eventually cave in to U.S. pressure.
	   The moment of truth comes Monday, when parliament votes either
on a no-confidence motion or on a bill to hold early elections.
	   Netanyahu himself had instigated the no-confidence motion Dec. 7
as part of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the vote on
the early elections bill by two weeks.
	   It is expected that Netanyahu will ask the legislator who
presented the no-confidence motion at his behest to withdraw it
before Monday.
	   This would leave on the table a bill to call spring elections,
more than 18 months ahead of schedule. The bill's sponsors from the
opposition Labor Party need at least 61 votes in the 120-seat
parliament to get it passed.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, Labor's caucus chairman, smelled victory on
Tuesday.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt, who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor.
	   Goldschmidt's boss, Labor leader Ehud Barak, talked strategy
Tuesday with James Carville, an independent American political
consultant who led Clinton to a come-from-behind victory in 1992.
	   Barak has failed to take a decisive lead over Netanyahu in the
polls despite the prime minister's frequent entanglements in
political scandals. Still, Carville was confident. ``I didn't take
a flight this far to lose,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be unshaken.
	   ``We will go to the people if necessary,'' he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``I don't fear elections.''
	   It does look like Netanyahu has some escape routes.
	   The early elections bill is only up for a first reading Monday,
and two more are required, giving Netanyahu plenty of time to try
and get the legislation buried in the Law Committee.
	   The panel is headed by Hanan Porat, a leader of the Jewish
settlement movement, who might be swayed by promises that no more
West Bank land will be handed to the Palestinians.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's office published a list of six demands _
two more than Monday _ that the Palestinians will have to meet
before Israel carries out a troop pullback.
	   However, killing the elections bill will not solve Netanyahu's
problems. He needs to get a 1999 budget bill passed this month,
making him vulnerable to political blackmail.
	   Adding to his woes, Israel television reported Tuesday that his
finance minister, Yaacov Neeman, resigned over attempts to replace
him with a leader of a small party in a bid to gain support in the
Knesset. Neeman could not be reached for comment.
	   But Netanyahu hinted that he may yet have a few surprises in
store.
	   ``I've always liked to confound and disappoint those who write
my political obituary,'' he told the AP. ``I've been doing that for
so many years now that I begin to yawn.''

 &UR; U.S. envoy warns Kosovo's warring factions
 &UR; AP Photo
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke comments; trims.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Warning Kosovo's factions that they
are playing with ``dynamite,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke sought
Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
newest violation of an informal cease-fire left 37 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke later arrived in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic, where he would ``emphasize the need to move
ahead expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   Holbrooke sought to dispel pessimism about Kosovo's future
before going into the meeting with Milosevic, saying, ``progress,
very little but progress'' had been made in trying to find a
negotiated solution to the Serb-ethnic Albanian conflict.
	   ``The important thing to me is that both sides are engaged'' in
indirect negotiations through U.S. envoys, Holbrooke told
reporters.
	   Yugoslav soldiers killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off border area. Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent
armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the remote region
and continued barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying the
verifiers access violated an October agreement reached between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, and a formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
submachine-gun fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings
on the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Tuesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent a message of
condolences to the families of killed Serbs, saying, ``we will not
hesitate to prevent anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of
our citizens.''
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable.''
	   Alluding to the violence in earlier comments while still in
Pristina, Holbrooke said, ``yesterday was not a good day'' in
Kosovo, but added: ``We are determined to continue our effort.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved (in fighting) that
they are playing with dynamite,'' he warned.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The rebels
say they won't accept anything short of independence. Serbia,
meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.

Top FA official quits over loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Welsh FA reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Graham Kelly quit as chief executive of the
English Football Association on Tuesday in the latest potential
bribery scandal to hit the sports world.
	   The stunning move arises out of a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5.34
million) loan promised to the Welsh FA in what newspaper reports
have interpreted as an attempted bribe to help FA chairman Keith
Wiseman gain a high-ranking FIFA position.
	   According to spokesman David Davies, FA members accepted Kelly's
resignation and also passed a vote of no confidence in Wiseman
although he had refused to quit.
	   The FA scandal comes at a time when bribery allegations are rife
in Olympic circles. International Olympic Committee executive board
member Marc Hodler has alleged the practice of buying and selling
of votes in the election of host cities.
	   Last month, the Mail on Sunday carried a report saying that
Wiseman had unilaterally pledged a loan to the Welsh FA and failed
to provide satisfactory explanations to the executive committee.
	   According to the paper, the move came shortly after he had
received the Welsh FA's backing to help his nomination as a FIFA
vice-president.
	   Tuesday's announcement came from Davies after a meeting of the
FA executive committee at its headquarters at Lancaster Gate in
west London.
	   ``The FA's executive committee met today to discuss the
positions of our chairman and chief executive,'' Davies said.
	   ``This followed contacts over recent months with the Football
Association of Wales and the actions in that connection of Keith
Wiseman and Graham Kelly.
	   ``The executive committee has this afternoon accepted the
resignation of Graham Kelly. They have thanked him for his 10 years
of dedicated work at Lancaster Gate and wished him well for the
future.
	   ``They have also passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the
chairman Keith Wiseman,'' Davies said. ``He was informed of this
personally by the vice-chairman, Geoff Thompson. He has declined to
resign.
	   ``The executive will seek endorsement for their action at a
special FA council meeting in early January. This vote of no
confidence, I stress, was taken unanimously by an executive
committee that represents all sections of the game.
	   ``It was taken with sadness and only after considerable
examination of all the circumstances, it was not taken lightly.
	   ``Contrary to some unfair speculation it wasn't part of any
personal campaign against any individual.'' Davies said. ``Such an
outcome has been painful for all those involved in taking the
decision.''
	   Davies then read out a statement from Wiseman.
	   ``The issue is one for the full Football Association Council,''
he said.
	   ``I do not intend to make any comment at all until I have shared
the full circumstances of this matter with them all _ save that the
version of events carried hitherto in the national press is a gross
distortion of the truth.''
	   At the time of the Mail on Sunday story, Wiseman said he always
acted ``in the interests of the FA.''
	   ``There is nothing wrong or unusual in helping smaller
footballing nations _ be they close neighbors or those further
afield _ in financial and other ways with their development plans
and youth programs,'' he said.
	   Welsh FA president John Hughes said there was ``nothing
sinister'' in the English FA's offer of financial help.
	   ``All that money was to go to charity, the Welsh football trust,
to help promote and develop our youth and women's football in
Wales,'' he said. ``There was nothing sinister in it and it
certainly had nothing to do with the senior side.
	   ``What has happened has upset me and I am quite shocked at the
news of Graham's resignation because he is a great friend. The FA
have lost a good man.''
	   Davies said the executive committee decided that he would take
over Kelly's position for the time being and that Thompson would
take Wiseman's position, pending the FA Council meeting.
	   ``It is the wish of the executive committee that the
vice-chairman Geoff Thompson should lead the FA in the immediate
future,'' Davies said.
	   ``They have also asked me to become executive director in
overall charge of everyday running of the FA for the time being. I
do so in the confidence that I have the backing of the staff.''

Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
newest violation of an informal cease-fire left 37 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke later arrived in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic, where he would ``emphasize the need to move
ahead expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   Holbrooke sought to dispel pessimism about Kosovo's future
before going into the meeting with Milosevic, saying, ``progress,
very little but progress'' had been made in trying to find a
negotiated solution to the Serb-ethnic Albanian conflict.
	   ``The important thing to me is that both sides are engaged'' in
indirect negotiations through U.S. envoys, Holbrooke told
reporters.
	   Yugoslav soldiers killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off border area. Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent
armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the remote region
and continued barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying the
verifiers access violated an October agreement reached between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, and a formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
submachine-gun fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings
on the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Tuesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent a message of
condolences to the families of killed Serbs, saying, ``we will not
hesitate to prevent anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of
our citizens.''
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable.''
	   Alluding to the violence in earlier comments while still in
Pristina, Holbrooke said, ``yesterday was not a good day'' in
Kosovo, but added: ``We are determined to continue our effort.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved (in fighting) that
they are playing with dynamite,'' he warned.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The rebels
say they won't accept anything short of independence. Serbia,
meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.

Israel finance minister resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's finance minister has resigned, Israel
TV reported Tuesday, furthering Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
political woes.
	   Yaacov Neeman resigned over Netanyahu's recent offer of the
finance ministry to the leader of a small party, in an effort to
broaden support for his shaky colaition, Israel television
reported.
	   The bid failed, but Neeman was angry that he was not even
consulted about the bid to replace him, the TV said.
	   Neeman has been out of the country this week on a ski vacation
and his spokesman, Motti Shers, refused to comment on the news
reports.
	   The TV said that Netanyahu had accepted the resignation, but
Netanyahu's office would only say that Netanyahu was aware Neeman
was considering resigning, and would the two would discuss the
issue when Neeman returned Thursday.
	   Netanyahu is scrambling to survive a no confidence motion
planned for Monday.
	   The crisis in the peace talks has left him especially
vulnerable: hard-liners on his right are unhappy with the
commitments he has already made to the Palestinians; doves on his
left are unhappy that he has frozen the peace process.
	   The paralysis helped contribute to tension between Netanyahu and
U.S. President Bill Clinton during the president's tour of the
region this week _ an effort to salvage the peace.
	   It has become clear in the past few weeks that Neeman was angry
and frustrated that coalition maneuvering has blocked parliamentary
deliberations of the draft budget. By law, a budget is to be passed
by Dec. 31.
	   He will be the second finance minister to quit during
Netanyahu's 2 1/2-year tenure. His predecessor, Dan Meridor,
resigned in June 1997 after one year.
	   Neeman took over a month later.
	   Neeman, one of Israel's leading tax lawyers, is a political
independent committed to lowering Israel's budget deficit. He
maintains harmonious relations with Bank of Israel Governor Jacob
Frenkel, a champion of fiscal and monetary restraint in Israel's
current economic climate.
	   The reports of Neeman's resignation come as Israel's economy is
falling deeper and deeper into a slowdown that began in the second
quarter of 1996.
	   He is beholden to no political party _ but does not contribute a
political base to Netanyahu's wobbly coalition, either.
	   While the resignation damages Netanyahu's credibility, it also
frees Netanyahu to use the finance ministry as a card to attract
support before Monday's no-confidence vote.

Pollution forces Iran to shut schools, limit traffic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with crisis committee set up to deal with pollution,
other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran shut more schools in Tehran and ordered
traffic restrictions Tuesday due to air pollution that is so bad
that residents of the capital have begun to wear face masks.
	   Air pollution levels Tuesday were more than six times higher
than acceptable levels set by the World Health Organization,
state-run Tehran radio reported.
	   It said environmental groups have formed a crisis committee to
deal with the unusual high levels of air pollution in the capital.
	   It said the number of patients suffering from heart and
asthmatic problems at one city hospital doubled over the past two
days.
	   The radio urged people with heart problems and the elderly to
stay indoors until the pollution clears.
	   The government closed elementary schools Monday and extended the
closures to high schools on Tuesday, Tehran radio reported.
	   The decision to close the schools was based on a recommendation
by the Environmental Protection Organization.
	   Drugstores reported brisk sales of face masks, which many
residents of the capital of 10 million wore due to the thick haze
of smog enveloping the city.
	   The radio said that starting Wednesday cars would be allowed on
the roads only on alternate days, depending on whether their
license plates began with odd or even numbers. It did not say how
long the plan would remain in force.
	   The pollution and smog were worsened due to stagnant weather,
lack of rain and the city's fleet of old cars which emit noxious
exhaust fumes. Most of the cars are more than 20 years old.
	   There are more than 1.5 million cars and 350,000 motor-cycles in
Tehran, according to the crisis committee.
	   Iran's Vice-President Masoumeh Ebtekar, who heads the
Environmental Protection Organization, said private cars account
for 75 percent of Tehran's pollution.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair defends pro-European policy

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under fire for his handling of relations with the
European Union, Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his policies
Tuesday, saying that Britain needs strong relations with both
Europe and the United States.
	   ``We are stronger with the U.S. because of our strength in
Europe, and we are stronger in Europe precisely because of the
strong relationship we have with the U.S.,'' Blair said at a speech
during a luncheon marking the 150th anniversary of The Associated
Press.
	   Conservative newspapers in Britain have criticized Blair for
taking a generally positive line toward the EU and hinting that his
Labor Party government may, in a few years, adopt the European
single currency, the euro, which starts Jan. 1.
	   The opposition Conservative Party accuses him of a willingness
to give away British sovereignty.
	   Although Blair labeled Britain's close economic, political and
military relationship with the United States as vital, he said his
country also needs a leading role ``to take the European social
model and revitalize it, transform it, renew it.''
	   ``We live in a global economy, and an interdependent world.
Nations must maximize their influence wherever they can,'' he said.
	   Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe has always been
difficult. The issue of European integration helped bring down
Margaret Thatcher in 1990 and undermined the credibility of her
successor, John Major, also a Conservative.
	   Although Britain joined the forerunner of the EU in the
mid-1970s, opinion over the benefits of membership has always been
mixed.
	   When Labor won national elections in May 1997, Blair said
Britain would become a major force in Europe. But recently,
government officials have expressed fears of becoming sidelined
from its decision-making process.
	   Blair was introduced at the luncheon, attended by top
representatives of the British media, by AP Board Chairman Donald
E. Newhouse, publisher and president of the Newark, New Jersey,
Star-Ledger.
	   Newhouse and Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and chief
executive officer, presented the prime minister with an album
containing AP photos taken throughout his political career and a
copy of the 1998 book ``Flash! The Associated Press Covers the
World,'' a collection of the news agency's most famous photos.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia beat Canada 3-1 and Sweden edged Finland
3-2 on the first day of the Baltika Cup hockey tournament in Moscow
on Tuesday.
	   After two goals by Magnus Wernblom after one by Per Eklund,
Sweden had a 3-0 lead until the last five minutes of its game, when
Finland's Juha Ikonen scored from close range and then Kai Nurminen
scored off a pass.
	   The Russians and Canadians played a rough game with many
penalties. The second period was quiet until Canadian Jeremy
Adduono surprised Russian goalie Maxim Sokolov with a shot after a
pass from Chris Szyski. Andrei Kruchinin in the 16th minute and
Yevgeny Petrochinin in 47th minute netted for the Russians and
Ravil Gusmanov finished off the game with an empty net goal in the
last minute.
	   The tournament, which also features last year's champions the
Czech Republic, features each country's best players outside the
National Hockey League. It is the third of four legs of the Euro
Hockey Tour.
	   The five teams are playing round robin format all week until
Sunday's final. Russia has won 23 of the 30 tournaments.
	   More than 6,000 people attended the second game, at Moscow's
Luzhniki stadium, against 1,000 at the first.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti stressed the
importance of combating economic crimes while visiting Russia on
Tuesday, a news report said.
	   A prominent Russian businessman and alleged mafia boss was
acquitted last week in a Swiss court of charges he belonged to a
criminal organization, and a former Ukrainian prime minister has
been charged in Switzerland with money laundering.
	   After arriving Tuesday in St. Petersburg, Russia's
second-largest city, Cotti said combating economic crimes is an
important element of every legal state, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Cotti met with the local governor to discuss economic
cooperation and inspected a historic building that will house a
Swiss consulate.
	   Cotti also visited a memorial commemorating 800,000 Red Army
soldiers and civilians who died during the Nazi siege of the city
during the World War II.
	   He will arrive in Moscow on Wednesday for meetings with
President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other
top officials.
	   Wealthy Russian businessman Sergei Mikhailov was jailed in
Switzerland for two years before his trial this fall. He was
cleared of charges that he belonged to a criminal group but was
found guilty of violating strict Swiss property laws restricting
foreign ownership by buying a villa near Geneva.

U.S. envoy warns Kosovo factions about playing with 'dynamite'

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Kosovo's warring factions Tuesday, a day after two shootouts left
37 people dead, that they are playing with ``dynamite.''
	   Holbrooke said on arrival in Pristina, the capital of the
Albanian-majority Serbian province, that the latest bloodshed
``will not in any way deter the international community'' from
working for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke brokered an Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's dominant republic of Serbia
where ethnic Albanians make up more than 90 percent of the 2
million residents.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province where ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   He later traveled to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for talks
with President Slobodan Milosevic. The State Department said the
U.S. envoy would ``emphasize the need to move ahead expeditiously''
on a Kosovo peace plan.
	   Holbrooke returned to the region a day after Yugoslav soldiers
killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists in a five-hour gunbattle near
the border with Albania. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary
and conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the area,
which has been sealed off by Yugoslav forces. Area residents said
the army sent armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the
region and were barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying
monitors access violated the two-month-old agreement, and that a
formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who had hiked to the site on Monday said they saw the
bodies, all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred
yards of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels.
	   Later Monday, at least six Serbs, including five teen-agers,
were killed in the western Kosovo town of Pec when assailants
opened fire in a bar.
	   All Serb schools in Pec remained closed Tuesday to protest the
killings, which were blamed on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Kosovo Serbs demanded action against ``the terrorists'' and
urged a return of Serb security forces that had to partially
withdraw from the province following the U.S.-sponsored agreement,
the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent his condolences to the
families of Serb victims, saying, ``we will not hesitate to prevent
anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of our citizens.''
	   Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them ``outrageous
and unacceptable.''
	   Alluding to Monday's shootings, Holbrooke said ``yesterday was
not a good day'' in Kosovo but that ``we are determined to continue
our effort.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved that they are playing
with dynamite,'' he warned.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears that the fighting could worsen.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the
October agreement. That pact had sought to end the violence after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February
that killed hundreds and left an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The
rebels, however, say they won't accept anything short of
independence.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than
partial autonomy for Kosovo.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.
	   He said ethnic Albanians are ``dissatisfied'' by the mediation
of Holbrooke and fellow U.S. envoy Christopher Hill because ``they
are mostly passive observers.''
	   ``The latest bloodshed in Kosovo is the best sign of the effects
of their work,'' Demaci told reporters.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying that obstacles must be overcome before
the men are handed over.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial, but the U.S. State
Department and diplomats at the U.N. headquarters in New York were
less impressed.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The
handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's demand for
guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be jailed in
Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said he
was skeptical about Libya's intentions, based on press reports of
Parliament's statement.
	   ``I believe it referred to the resolution of obstacles, and if
that is true, then that's not a good harbinger,'' Foley said.
	   ``We believe that the time for rhetoric is over; the question is
whether the suspects are transferred to the Netherlands in quick
order or not,'' he added.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Danilo Turk, the ambassador of Slovenia, which is a member of
the U.N. Security Council, said the Libyan parliament's decision
was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' he said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal to try
the suspects in the Netherlands before a panel of Scottish judges.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the approval a
``positive development'' but asked the Libyan ambassador to explain
what obstacles his parliament was referring to, said U.N. spokesman
Manoel de Almeida E Silva.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met with Gadhafi to discuss a possible
handover of the suspects. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya was expected to reach a decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   Ordinary Libyans appeared relieved on hearing the news but said
Libya should receive guarantees before the suspects are handed
over.
	   ``We agreed to a trial in a neutral country but with all
guarantees for their rights. This is the view of the Libyan
people,'' said Fadlallah Saad el-Barazi, a shop owner.
	   ``We hope other countries will accept this. We ask God for
success in this regard,'' said Ali Mohammed Abu Shusha, a barber.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Graham Kelly quit as chief executive of the
English Football Association on Tuesday in the latest potential
bribery scandal to hit the sports world.
	   The stunning move arises out of a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5.34
million) loan promised to the Welsh FA. Newspaper reports have
interpreted it as an attempted bribe by FA chairman Keith Wiseman
to help him gain a high-ranking FIFA position.
	   According to spokesman David Davies, FA members accepted Kelly's
resignation and also passed a vote of no confidence in Wiseman
although he had refused to quit. Davies did not say whether Kelly
had any connection with the loan.

Astronauts aim for rare nighttime landing despite cloudy skies

landing opportunity at 12:30 a.m. EST Wednesday. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts aimed for a
rare nighttime landing Tuesday following their triumphant space
station-building mission.
	   Rain and clouds, however, threatened to keep them up an extra
day.
	   The Kennedy Space Center was socked in throughout the afternoon.
NASA expected clouds and rain to move out but the big question was
whether that would happen in time for the scheduled nighttime
landing.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
touchdowns. It would be only the 10th time in 17{ years of space
shuttle flight that astronauts have returned in darkness.
	   Commander Robert Cabana said he and his crew were ready to come
home after nearly 12 days aloft.
	   ``Everything is shipshape up here and we can't wait to get back
and see our families and have a great Christmas,'' he said. ``It's
been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space
station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Warning Kosovo's factions that they
are playing with ``dynamite,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke sought
Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
newest violation of an informal cease-fire left 37 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke later arrived in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav
President Milosevic, where he would ``emphasize the need to move
ahead expeditiously'' on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   Holbrooke sought to dispel pessimism about Kosovo's future
before going into the meeting with Milosevic, saying, ``progress,
very little but progress'' had been made in trying to find a
negotiated solution to the Serb-ethnic Albanian conflict.
	   ``The important thing to me is that both sides are engaged'' in
indirect negotiations through U.S. envoys, Holbrooke told
reporters.
	   Yugoslav soldiers killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the sealed-off
border area. Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles
and at least one helicopter into the remote region and continued
barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying the
verifiers access violated an October agreement reached between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, and a formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
submachine-gun fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings
on the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.

	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

Canada to compensate secondary AIDS victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Health authorities Monday announced compensation
payments of dlrs 240,000 (dlrs 156,000 U.S.) to each of about 240
Canadians who were infected with the HIV virus through a partner or
parent who became infected through a blood transfusion.
	   Health Minister Allan Rock and Mildred Dover, health minister of
Prince Edward Island, made the announcement on behalf of Canada's
federal, provincial and territorial governments.
	   The compensation expands a program created in March to provide
financial assistance to people infected with AIDS or hepatitis C
through the national blood system.
	   Those who were infected with AIDS by transfusion have already
been receiving compensation. They will be sent application forms
for the new benefit for spouses or children.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Magnus Wernblom scored twice and Per Eklund
another to spot Sweden to a 3-0 lead, enabling it to hold off
traditional rival Finland 3-2 on Tuesday in their Baltika Cup
opener.
	   Juha Ikonen scored from close range and then Kai Nurminen scored
off a pass in the final five minutes to rally Finland.
	   In another game, Russia beat Canada 3-1, outlasting the North
Americans in a penalty-filled match.
	   Andrei Kruchinin gave Russia the lead with four minutes
remaining in the period, but Jeremy Adduono drew Canada even with
three minutes to go in the second.
	   Yevgeny Petrochinin scored the game-winner midway through the
final period and Ravil Gusmanov added and empty net goal to finish
the scoring.
	   The tournament, which also features last year's champions the
Czech Republic, is the third of four legs of the Euro Hockey Tour
and features each country's best players outside the North American
National Hockey League.
	   The five teams are playing round robin format all week until
Sunday's final. Russia has won 23 of the 30 tournaments.
	   More than 6,000 people attended the second game, at Moscow's
Luzhniki stadium, against 1,000 at the first.

Military chiefs discussing expanding cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's defense minister said after
meeting with Turkey's air force chief Tuesday that the two
countries discussed further expanding their military cooperation.
	   Arab countries including Syria which has border disputes with
both Israel and Turkey have said the alliance is meant to undermine
stability in the region.
	   In a press statement, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
said relations with Turkey which includes joint military maneuvers
were not aimed at any third party.
	   He said in a meeting with Turkish Air Force Commander Gen. Ilhan
Kilic, he said Israel was ``prepared to both expand its cooperation
and assist it in various ways.''
	   The statement said Kilic was pleased upgrading work being done
by Israeli Aircraft industries on Turkish air force planes.
	   The statement quoted Kilic as saying Turkey also felt there was
``room to expand and deepen relations in various projects.''
	   The cooperation agreements, signed in 1996, include military
maneuvers and defense production accords. Israeli jets are also
able to train in Turkish air space.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the latest burst of anti-Semitism in Russia, a
prominent Communist lawmaker on Tuesday accused President Boris
Yeltsin and Jews in his office of waging ``genocide'' against the
Russian people.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, the head of parliament's security affairs
committee, claimed that liberal reforms carried out by Yeltsin's
government in the 1990s have decimated Russia.
	   ``The large-scale genocide wouldn't have been possible if
Yeltsin's inner circle had consisted of the main ethnic groups, and
not exclusively of one group, the Jews,'' Ilyukhin told a
parliamentary panel considering impeachment charges against
Yeltsin.
	   The Russian president has frequently reshuffled his Cabinet and
his advisers over the years. Most have been ethnic Russians, though
Jews and other minority groups have also been represented.
	   The Communist Party, the country's main opposition group, has
been seeking to attract a new generation of supporters and distance
itself from abuses committed during the Soviet era.
	   But in recent weeks, party elders have expressed support for
several measures that recall some of the darkest moments of their
rule.
	   Communist lawmakers last month enthusiastically supported a move
to bring back the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, former head of the
dreaded Soviet secret police. His likeness was toppled from in
front of KGB headquarters in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed.
	   Also, Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
parliament's lower house, suggested that crime could be curbed by
the re-introduction of hard labor camps, where millions perished
under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
	   With Russians weathering a tough economic crisis, the country's
rough-and-tumble politics have grown even more coarse.
	   Ilyukhin, the man leading the efforts to impeach Yeltsin,
repeated his anti-Jewish remarks when meeting with journalists
after Tuesday's impeachment session.
	   ``Representatives of one ethnic group have been dominant in the
president's inner circle and the government during the past seven
years. I have already named this ethnic group,'' Ilyukhin said.
	   ``It appears to be the cause, or one of the factors that has
contributed to the genocide we have witnessed,'' he added.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, caused an outcry in
October when he blamed Russia's problems on Jews and used an ethnic
slur.
	   His comments outraged many, but the Communist-dominated Duma
refused to censure him. The government has been investigating cases
of ``political extremism,'' but has not acted against Makashov.
	   Jews suffered systematic discrimination in czarist Russia and
during the Soviet era. The constitution bans discrimination, but
many Russians still express anti-Semitic sentiments.

Azerbaijan newspapers fined again for libeling president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ An Azerbaijani court fined two
independent newspapers Tuesday for reporting an opposition leader's
claims that President Geidar Aliev helped form a Kurdish rebel
party.
	   The court also ordered criminal proceedings against editors of
the Yeni Musavat and Azadlyg newspapers for ``insulting the dignity
and honor of the president.'' The editors would face up to two
years in prison if convicted.
	   The rulings in a Baku city court were the latest in a string of
libel suits in the former Soviet republic.
	   Azadlyg, which means ``freedom,'' was fined 200 million manat
(dlrs 50,000) and Yeni Musavat was fined 180 million manat (dlrs
45,000) for publishing a statement by former president Abulfaz
Elchibey. Elchibey said Aliev, while a member of the Soviet
Politburo, was involved in forming the Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK.
	   The party has led Kurdish rebels fighting Turkish troops since
1984 in a war that has killed at least 37,000 people.
	   On Monday, Azadlyg was fined 500 million manat (dlrs 125,000)
for reporting that Aliev's relatives bought expensive foreign real
estate in Britain.
	   The fines are staggering in a country where average salaries are
about dlrs 43 a month.
	   Azerbaijani journalists have been holding hunger strikes
recently to protest the lawsuits. Aliev has been criticized by
international human rights groups for cracking down on the press.

Police detain student activists in Belgrade

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with student released.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A student activist in an
anti-government movement in Serbia was detained Tuesday by police,
an opposition party said in a statement.
	   No explanation was given for the detention of Srdja Popovic, a
spokesman for opposition Democratic Party and member of student-run
``Otpor'' (Resistance) group. Popovic's lawyer also could not say
why he was arrested. He was released late Tuesday, again without
explanation.
	   According to witnesses, Popovic was stopped by police in
downtown Belgrade, dragged out of his car, searched and taken away
in a police vehicle, the Democratic Party statement said. The party
called the move an ``illegal abduction.''
	   Three fellow students who witnessed Popovic's arrest told
independent Fonet news agency that they also were detained for half
an hour and harassed by police.
	   The three said they were detained with no explanation and
released after half an hour when their lawyers arrived to the
police station. They said the police slapped them in the face
during interrogation.
	   Last month, four students from ``Otpor'' were arrested and
sentenced to 10 days in prison for spraying clenched fist, symbol
of their movement, on a Belgrade wall.
	   Fearing unrest, the autocratic Serbian government, loyal to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, has put pressure on
opposition parties and anti-government groups in Serbia.
	   Large street protests in 1996, led by students and opposition,
shook Milosevic's rule, and forced the autocratic leader to hand
over power in Serbia's biggest cities to the opposition. But
Milosevic has regained near undisputed authority since then.
	   In October, the Serbian parliament, dominated by Milosevic's
supporters, passed a law imposing government control over the
university and giving it the right to name the deans. ``Otpor'' has
organized protests against the law which led to strikes at some
faculties in Belgrade. Many professors who refused to obey the law
have been suspended.

Venezuela expects oil prices to remain low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan oil prices that hit a
12-year low last week probably will remain low for the next several
years, the energy and mines minister said Tuesday.
	   Erwin Arrieta told reporters he expects the price of Venezuelan
oil to average dlrs 10 to dlrs 10.50 per barrel during the next
three to five years. Last week, it hit dlrs 7.66 a barrel _ barely
half the average price in 1997.
	   Arrieta said prices probably will stay low partly because
worldwide oil inventories have grown to 8 billion barrels,
according to estimates by state oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela.
	   Venezuela is the number one foreign supplier of oil to the
United States.
	   Arrieta and oil ministers from Mexico and Saudi Arabia are to
meet Thursday in Madrid to discuss the worldwide slide in prices.
	   Venezuela promised earlier this year to slash production by
525,000 barrels a day, but Arrieta said recently that the country
won't cut more than 440,000 barrels a day during the life of the
cutback accords. The agreements last until June 30, 1999.
	   On Monday, Luis Giusti, head of Petroleos de Venezuela, said
Venezuela will consider making new cuts, though that could be
difficult since it would add to unemployment in an already battered
economy.
	   President-elect Hugo Chavez, who takes office Feb. 2, has said
his administration will enforce the reduction agreement.
	   The last meeting between Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia,
held on Oct. 2 in Cancun, Mexico, yielded only a commitment by
Mexico to extend its promised oil reduction until June 30, 1999.
	   In two previous meetings, however, the group initiated and then
expanded the current accords among major oil exporters to reduce
production.

Libyan parliament backs plan for Lockerbie trial

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying the men cannot be freed unless problems
are solved.
	   Western diplomats in Libya said the parliament's statement
appeared to be a major step toward a trial, but the U.S. State
Department and diplomats at the U.N. headquarters in New York were
less impressed.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed
``satisfaction with the agreement of the Libyan, British and
American sides on trying the two suspects in the Lockerbie incident
in a third country.''
	   But a statement, read on state-run television during a televised
meeting of the parliament, made no mention of whether Libya would
hand over the two suspects. The parliament ended its eight-day
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
	   The congress also asked ``these sides to work on removing any
obstacle preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon as
possible.'' It did not say what the obstacles were.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   The handover of the men has been held up because of Libya's
demand for guarantees that the two men, if convicted, would be
jailed in Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said he
was skeptical about Libya's intentions, based on press reports of
Parliament's statement.
	   ``I believe it referred to the resolution of obstacles, and if
that is true, then that's not a good harbinger,'' Foley said.
	   ``We believe that the time for rhetoric is over; the question is
whether the suspects are transferred to the Netherlands in quick
order or not,'' he added.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Danilo Turk, the ambassador of Slovenia, which is a member of
the U.N. Security Council, said the Libyan parliament's decision
was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' he said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal to try
the suspects in the Netherlands before a panel of Scottish judges.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the approval a
``positive development'' but asked the Libyan ambassador to explain
what obstacles his parliament was referring to, said U.N. spokesman
Manoel de Almeida E Silva.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met with Gadhafi to discuss a possible
handover of the suspects. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya was expected to reach a decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   Ordinary Libyans appeared relieved on hearing the news but said
Libya should receive guarantees before the suspects are handed
over.
	   ``We agreed to a trial in a neutral country but with all
guarantees for their rights. This is the view of the Libyan
people,'' said Fadlallah Saad el-Barazi, a shop owner.
	   ``We hope other countries will accept this. We ask God for
success in this regard,'' said Ali Mohammed Abu Shusha, a barber.

	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988

outstanding hitches are solved.

jailed in Libya.
	   Libyan media had earlier suggested that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi did not have the authority to hand over the suspects and
indicated that any such decision should be approved by the People's
Congress.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said he
was skeptical about Libya's intentions, based on press reports of
Parliament's statement.
	   ``I believe it referred to the resolution of obstacles, and if
that is true, then that's not a good harbinger,'' Foley said.
	   ``We believe that the time for rhetoric is over; the question is
whether the suspects are transferred to the Netherlands in quick
order or not,'' he added.
	   Britain said the Libyan statements were encouraging.
	   ``We have seen the very limited reports based on Libyan
television and, if true, then it is very encouraging,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Danilo Turk, the ambassador of Slovenia, which is a member of
the U.N. Security Council, said the Libyan parliament's decision
was ``welcome but incomplete.''
	   ``It doesn't go all the way. It doesn't explain when the handing
over of the two suspects would take place,'' he said.
	   Turk was president of the Security Council in August when it
adopted the resolution endorsing the U.S.-British proposal to try
the suspects in the Netherlands before a panel of Scottish judges.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the approval a
``positive development'' but asked the Libyan ambassador to explain
what obstacles his parliament was referring to, said U.N. spokesman
Manoel de Almeida E Silva.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects _
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ serve any
prison terms in Britain.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met with Gadhafi to discuss a possible
handover of the suspects. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya was expected to reach a decision soon.
	   The Pam Am blast over Lockerbie, Scotland killed 270 people.
	   Jim Swire, father of one of the bombing victims, said on
Britain's satellite television network Sky News that he was
``heartened'' by the Libyan decision but that the families prefer
that if convicted, the two Libyan suspects serve their jail terms
in Britain.
	   ``I can say unequivocally that I don't believe the members of
our group will accept incarceration in Libya as the appropriate
punishment for these two,'' Swire said.
	   Ordinary Libyans appeared relieved on hearing the news but said
Libya should receive guarantees before the suspects are handed
over.
	   ``We agreed to a trial in a neutral country but with all
guarantees for their rights. This is the view of the Libyan
people,'' said Fadlallah Saad el-Barazi, a shop owner.
	   ``We hope other countries will accept this. We ask God for
success in this regard,'' said Ali Mohammed Abu Shusha, a barber.

U.S. envoy warns Kosovo factions about playing with 'dynamite'

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Kosovo's warring factions Tuesday, a day after two shootouts left
37 people dead, that they were playing with ``dynamite.''
	   Holbrooke said on arrival in Pristina, the capital of the
Albanian-majority Serbian province, that the latest bloodshed
``will not in any way deter the international community'' from
working for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke brokered an Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's dominant republic of Serbia
where ethnic Albanians make up more than 90 percent of the 2
million residents.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province where ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   He later traveled to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for talks
with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Before going into the meeting with Milosevic, Holbrooke said
that ``progress, very little, but progress'' had been made in
trying to find a negotiated solution to the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``The important thing to me is that both sides are engaged'' in
indirect negotiations through U.S. envoys, Holbrooke told
reporters.
	   Holbrooke returned to the region a day after Yugoslav soldiers
killed 31 ethnic Albanian separatists in a five-hour gunbattle near
the border with Albania. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary
and conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the area,
which has been sealed off by Yugoslav forces. Area residents said
the army sent armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the
region and were barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying
monitors access violated the two-month-old agreement, and that a
formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who had hiked to the site on Monday said they saw
bodies, all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred
yards of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels.
	   Later Monday, at least six Serbs, including five teen-agers,
were killed in the western Kosovo town of Pec when assailants
opened fire in a bar.
	   All Serb schools in Pec remained closed Tuesday to protest the
killings, which were blamed on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Kosovo Serbs demanded action against ``the terrorists'' and
urged a return of Serb security forces that had to partially
withdraw from the province following the U.S.-sponsored agreement,
the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent his condolences to the
families of Serb victims, saying, ``we will not hesitate to prevent
anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of our citizens.''
	   Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them ``outrageous
and unacceptable.''
	   Alluding to Monday's shootings, Holbrooke said ``yesterday was
not a good day'' in Kosovo but that ``we are determined to continue
our effort.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved that they are playing
with dynamite,'' he warned.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears that the fighting could worsen.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the
October agreement. That pact had sought to end the violence after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February
that killed hundreds and left an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The
rebels, however, say they won't accept anything short of
independence.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than
partial autonomy for Kosovo.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.
	   He said ethnic Albanians are ``dissatisfied'' by the mediation
of Holbrooke and fellow U.S. envoy Christopher Hill because ``they
are mostly passive observers.''
	   ``The latest bloodshed in Kosovo is the best sign of the effects
of their work,'' Demaci told reporters.

Russia's budget on hold until next week, parliament says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ignoring government pressure, lawmakers in
Russia's Communist-dominated parliament said Tuesday they will not
even begin to discuss the proposed 1999 budget until next week _
and they won't rush to approve it.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government wants the budget
passed before January so it can begin acting on its plan to pull
Russia out of its worst economic crisis of the post-Soviet era.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget draft probably won't start
until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and will not finish quickly.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's
Cabinet has widespread support in the Communist-dominated lower
house, the State Duma, raising hopes the budget may be approved
without lengthy debate.
	   Seleznyov said the Duma already supports much of the draft
budget, because for the first time in several years, Russia is
``living under the conditions of political consensus.''
	   Still, the Communist Party's No. 2 man, Valentin Kuptsov, said
Tuesday that parliament will take its time.
	   ``Neither the party nor the voters would appreciate it if we
skip studying the government's proposals in depth,'' Kuptsov was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Alexander Shokhin, head of the centrist Our Home is Russia
faction, has warned the Communists were likely to demand political
concessions and even the right to censor Russia's television, which
they consider too anti-Communist, in exchange for approving the
budget.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the dollar. But independent
economists have warned both rates are unrealistic.
	   On Tuesday, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko conceded
that the ruble may lose more value than the government had
predicted. It fell to 21.75 to the dollar in inter-bank trading
Tuesday, down from 21.35 on Friday.
	   In addition, the new budget relies on foreign loans that may not
materialize, and on restructuring nearly half of Russia's mammoth
foreign debt _ something creditors have not yet agreed to do.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Foreign loans have been frozen since the government devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The passage of
the budget could help Russia attract new cash from international
lenders.

Documentation over Nazi slave labor found in Austrian factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A commission looking into Nazi slave
labor in an Austrian factory has found more than 30,000 files
containing information about foreign workers forced to work in the
plant during World War II, the head of the investigating team said
Tuesday.
	   Commission chairman Oliver Rathkolb told the Austria Press
Agency that the files, including names and other information about
the workers, were found recently in a concrete tower used as an
antiaircraft gun platform during the war on VOEST-Alpine property.
	   The VOEST-Alpine steel and metal conglomerate in Linz, about 150
kilometers (90 miles) west of Vienna was renamed after Herman
Goering, Hitler's lieutenant, after Nazi Germany absorbed Austria
in 1938. The factory was a major arms producer for Hitler's war
machinery.
	   Millions of Poles, Russians and other people considered inferior
by the Nazis were forced to work there and in plants elsewhere
throughout Hitler's Reich.
	   Germany has paid more than dlrs 60 billion in reparations to
Nazi victims, but has refused to honor wage claims by slave
laborers, who were technically working for private companies.
	   Lawyers and historians in the United States and elsewhere are
compiling evidence of slave labor in Germany and Austria for
possible use in class action suits on behalf of survivors. VOEST
and several other Austrian companies have set up independent
commissions to look into their companies' wartime histories.
	   VOEST, along with Steyr-Daimler-Puch and Lenzinger
Zellstoffwerke are the three Austrian companies believed to have
used the most slave labor during the war. They are negotiating with
New York lawyers who claim to represent victims, but no details of
any settlement have been published
	   Separately an Austrian government commission is examining
options for compensating victims of Nazi looting and unjust
post-World War II restitution laws, in the face of threatened
lawsuits. Money, art and other valuables were looted by the Nazis
as well as the immediate postwar government.

Report rules out food poisoning in schools, blames hysteria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Laboratory tests have ruled out that food
poisoning was behind a spate of illnesses that affected 1,535
Egyptian students in October, a newspaper reported.
	   The students in six Egyptian provinces suffered from mass
hysteria and hallucination, said Al-Gomhuria daily in its early
Wednesday edition.
	   It was not immediately clear how all the students from different
parts of the country suffered from the same symptoms during the
same period of time.
	   The students, in primary, middle and secondary schools, were
hospitalized after eating government-distributed food, including
halva, cheese, bread and biscuits at their schools.
	   None of them suffered serious injury.
	   ``All three laboratory tests proved that there was no poison in
the food,'' Al-Gomhuria said. ``Doctors suggest the symptoms were
merely psychological,'' it added.
	   ``A state of psychological hallucination was behind the
poisoning phenomena and it was a kind of mass hysteria that howed
in the form of vomiting, contraction and pain,'' the paper said,
quoting the report by Dr. Ahmed Okasha, a psychiatrist.
	   Three of the students who pretended to have been poisoned
admitted that that they wanted to avoid taking exams, newspapers
reported at the time.

Iranian opposition group denies being behind recent killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt, (AP) _ An Iranian opposition group denied Tuesday
that it's behind a wave of mysterious murders in Tehran.
	   The group, the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq Organization, blamed
Iran's judiciary and Intelligence Ministry for the deaths of five
government critics in the past month. Two other dissidents remain
missing.
	   Iran's judiciary, controlled by hard-liners, blamed unnamed
foreigners for the killings and a group of legislators have pointed
the finger at the Mujahedeen.
	   But the Mujahedeen, in a statement faxed to The Associated Press
in Cairo, Egypt, said the accusations were an excuse by the regime
to carry out military strikes against their bases in Iraq.
	   ``By churning out such lies and attributing these heinous
murders to the Mujahedeen,'' Iran's Intelligence Ministry and the
judiciary ``seek to conceal the true identity of the perpetrators
and masterminds of these crimes who are none other than the leaders
and agents of the regime,'' the statement said.
	   Iranian moderates say the killings are aimed at tarnishing the
image of President Mohammad Khatami, who is locked in a power
struggle with conservative clergymen opposed to his political and
social reforms.

Palestinian prisoners end hunger strike in Israeli jails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jails ended a three-week hunger strike on Tuesday after
President Bill Clinton acknowledged them and their situation in a
speech during his visit to Gaza.
	   The strike of so-called security prisoners, those jailed for
political or militant activity against the Jewish state, began when
Israel refused to include them in a mass release agreed to as part
of the latest U.S.-brokered Mideast peace accord.
	   Most Palestinians have had a family member jailed during three
decades of Israeli occupation, making the issue especially
sensitive in Palestinian society. The issue has sparked riots in
Palestinian areas and friction with the Israelis.
	   Israel has said it would not release any prisoners who plotted
or executed attacks.
	   Fayez Abu Shamaleh, director of the Palestinian Prisoner's
Association, said Clinton made it clear in his speech Monday to the
Palestinian parliament-in-exile that he would try and help solve
the prisoner issue. ``President Clinton is not a magician ... but
at the same time he told us that he was determined to solve the
issue of the prisoners.''
	   In announcing that the hunger strike in several Israeli jails
was off, Shamaleh said ``we are going to continue our struggle
through political channels and negotiations in order to have all
the pal prisoners free and with their families. We are very
committed to the Wye Memorandum and Israel should implement this
side of the accord,'' he said.

Pentagon warns U.S. troops to take cautions in Gulf region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Pentagon has ``very credible and
disturbing information'' of a potential attack against Americans in
the Persian Gulf region and has asked U.S. troops to take
precautions, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   U.S. embassies in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and
Bahrain issued a statement Sunday saying there was ``a strong
possibility that terrorist elements are planning an attack against
U.S. targets in the Gulf, possibly in the next 30 days.''
	   The statement urged U.S. citizens to be alert to ``any
suspicious activity and take precautionary steps to reduce the
profile and vulnerability of any U.S. facilities.''
	   Asked about the statement, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon
declined to define the basis for the warning.
	   But he said American military personnel have been advised to
stay on their bases, to avoid traveling in large groups and to be
on alert for potential trouble.
	   ``We gather intelligence from a variety of sources by a variety
of means. And we believe that putting all that together, we have
very credible and disturbing information that a threat is imminent
in the region,'' Bacon said.
	   Five American servicemen and two Indian citizens were killed in
a November 1995 attack on a military center in Riyadh. A truck
bombing in the eastern city of Dhahran in June 1996 killed 19 U.S.
airmen.
	   The U.S. missions in Saudi Arabia closed for four days in
October to review security after receiving information that the
embassy in Riyadh was under threat of a terrorist attack.
	   That warning followed the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in

Moderate quake shakes central Turkish city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new moderate quake in Kayseri &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAYSERI, Turkey (AP) _ A moderate quake shook this central
Turkish city Tuesday, a day after two people were slightly injured
and dozens of homes collapsed from tremors, an official said.
	   No casualties or damage have been reported, a police official
said.
	   The quake, which hit at 2015 GMT had a preliminary magnitude of
4.3 according to Istanbul's Kandilli seismology institute.
	   Two moderate quakes of magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 followed by
twelve minor aftershocks struck the nearby town of Bunyan Monday
creating a panic.
	   Two people were injured overnight when they were hit by debris
from walls that caved in during the aftershocks. Cracks also
appeared on the walls of more than a houses, Anatolia said.
	   A magnitude-4 quake can cause moderate damage in populated
areas.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit on the Anatolian fault.
	   In June, a southern town was leveled by a 6.3-magnitude quake,
killing 144 people.
	   Kayseri is some 200 kilometers (120 miles) southest of the
capital Ankara.

Policeman faces manslaughter charge over youth killing

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with youths rioting &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Youths angered by the police killing of
a 17-year-old rioted for a third night Tuesday, burning cars and
throwing rocks after a day of quiet mourning.
	   Police were out in force, using tear gas to disperse groups of
youths, and charging several times. About a dozen cars were
torched.
	   There were no immediate reports of any injuries.
	   Earlier, the policeman who shot and killed the teen during an
arrest on Sunday appeared before a judge to face possible
manslaughter charges.
	   The police brigadier, Henri Bois, was expected to be placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged for
the crime, said Prosecutor Michel Breard.
	   An autopsy found that 17-year-old Habib, whose last name hasn't
been released, was killed by a bullet that entered the left side of
his neck and punctured a lung, causing him to bleed to death.
	   The other police officer arrested after the slaying was freed
Tuesday afternoon, the prosecutor said.
	   Police contend the shooting, which occurred during a scuffle
while police were trying to make the arrest, was accidental. Police
say Habib was trying to steal a BMW.
	   Some 300 people from the poor neighborhood where Habib lived
marched silently through Toulouse Tuesday in his memory.
	   Under a banner reading ``Where is justice? No more police
brutality,'' Habib's older brother led the march.
	   Authorities were searching for Habib's accomplice, who was
quoted in the Liberation newspaper as denying the two were trying
to steal a car.
	   The family, meanwhile, was filing a complaint against police for
manslaughter and non-assistance to a person in danger.
	   In Paris, Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin appealed to
Toulouse youths to have faith in the country's justice system. He
spoke after youths rampaged for a second night Monday in a poor
Toulouse neighborhood.
	   Jospin said the interim interior minister, Jean-Jack Queyranne,
has ``the impression that things did not happen as they should
have.''
	   ``The police have a very difficult job,'' Jospin said in a
television interview. ``They must make people respect the law,
which applies to everyone. But clearly they must use judgment.''
	   The riots in Toulouse were the latest outbreak of violence
stemming from tension between French police and disaffected youths
from poor immigrant families.

Brazil gets first installment of IMF aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund released
the first installment of a dlrs 41.5 billion economic aid package
Tuesday, the Brazilian Central Bank said.
	   The IMF deposited the dlrs 4.79 billion first tranche in a
special account at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
	   The aid package has been described by government officials as
``preventive in nature,'' and the funds will be available for
Brazil to draw on as deemed necessary, the Central Bank said.
	   Brazil's foreign reserves are currently around dlrs 40 billion,
significantly lower than the dlrs 70 billion before financial
problems in Asia and Russia created a run on emerging markets.
	   The aid package, led by the IMF and announced on Nov. 13, is
aimed at restoring investor confidence in Brazil and shoring up the
country's ailing economy.
	   The Central Bank said dlrs 4.15 billion more will be available
from the Bank of International Settlements Thursday.
	   This loan was coordinated by the BIS with the central banks of
19 countries.
	   Also Thursday, a separate dlrs 390 million will be made
available to Brazil from the Bank of Japan, the Central Bank said.

U.S. envoy warns Kosovo factions about playing with 'dynamite'

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Kosovo's warring factions that they were ``playing with dynamite''
Tuesday _ a day after two shootouts left 37 people dead.
	   Arriving in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, Holbrooke said the
latest bloodshed ``will not in any way deter the international
community'' from working for peace in the region.
	   Holbrooke brokered an Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians make up more than 90 percent of its 2
million residents, and most favor independence from Serbia.
	   The October deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought
time for diplomats to try to work out a political settlement for
Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke said NATO still has its airstrike orders in place and
repeated that progress toward a peaceful settlement ``must be made
because we are concerned that the fighting may flare up.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved that they are playing
with dynamite,'' he said.
	   He later traveled to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for talks
with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Before meeting Milosevic, Holbrooke said that ``progress, very
little, but progress'' had been made in trying to find a negotiated
solution.
	   ``The important thing to me is that both sides are engaged'' in
indirect negotiations through U.S. envoys, Holbrooke told
reporters.
	   On Monday, Yugoslav soldiers killed 31 ethnic Albanian
separatists in a five-hour gunbattle near the border with Albania.
The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the area,
which has been sealed off by Yugoslav forces. Residents said the
army sent in armored vehicles and at least one helicopter and were
barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace monitor, who declined to be named, said the blockage
violated the two-month-old peace agreement.
	   Monitors who had hiked to the site Monday said they saw bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred yards
of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo Liberation Army
rebels.
	   Later Monday, at least six Serbs, including five teen-agers,
were killed in the western Kosovo town of Pec when assailants
opened fire in a bar.
	   All Serb schools in Pec remained closed Tuesday to protest the
killings, which were blamed on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley assailed
the killings of both the ethnic Albanians and the Serb teenagers.
	   ``We condemn in the strongest possible terms this wanton murder
of innocent civilians,'' he said. ``Actions like this can only lead
to a spiral of retribution that will make reaching a settlement for
the region all the more difficult.''
	   Kosovo Serbs demanded action against ``the terrorists'' and
urged a return of Serb security forces that partially withdrew from
the province following the U.S.-sponsored agreement, the state
Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent his condolences to the
families of Serb victims, saying, ``we will not hesitate to prevent
anyone from jeopardizing the peace and security of our citizens.''
	   Holbrooke also condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears that the fighting could worsen.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the
October agreement. That pact had sought to end the violence after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February
that killed hundreds and left an estimated 300,000 ethnic Albanians
homeless.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence
and Serbia refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo.
	   Spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.
	   He said ethnic Albanians are ``dissatisfied'' by the mediation
of Holbrooke and fellow U.S. envoy Christopher Hill because ``they
are mostly passive observers.''
	   ``The latest bloodshed in Kosovo is the best sign of the effects
of their work,'' Demaci told reporters.

Recuperating Yeltsin meets new ambassadors in Kremlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from his latest
illness, held a welcoming ceremony Tuesday for new ambassadors to
Russia, his press center said.
	   The Russian president traveled from his country residence to the
Kremlin and greeted new ambassadors from China, India, Qatar,
Luxembourg, and 10 other countries.
	   Yeltsin mentioned Russia's wishes to expand ties with China,
India, and other nations. He also said European security was being
threatened by the conflict in the separatist Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, and called for a political settlement there.
	   In a speech carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency, Yeltsin called
for a ``multi-polar world'' _ Russia's favorite euphemism for
counterbalancing what it sees as growing U.S. influence in the
world.
	   Yeltsin also met the head of Russia's Federal Security Service,
Vladimir Putin, to discuss last month's killing of prominent
lawmaker Galina Starovoitova, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin told the Interfax news agency.
	   Starovoitova, a liberal parliament deputy, was found slain in
front of her St. Petersburg apartment on Nov. 20, and Yeltsin has
said he would take personal control over the investigation.
	   Yeltsin later returned to his country home just west of Moscow,
Yakushkin said.
	   Despite his repeated ailments, Yeltsin insists he will serve out
his term, which runs until 2000. He has looked relatively healthy
and animated in public appearances since his release from the
hospital last week.

Police arrest suspect in murder of Real Sociedad supporter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested a man suspected
of fatally stabbing a soccer fan before the Atletico de Madrid-Real
Sociedad match in Madrid a week ago.
	   The victim, 28-year-old Aitor Zabaleta, was knifed in the chest
outside Madrid's Vicente Calderon stadium before a UEFA Cup match.
He died after surgery.
	   Police chief Juan Cotino said that the suspect _ who was not
immediately identified _ belongs to Bastion, a neo-fascist splinter
group of Atletico de Madrid's fan club, the Atletico Front.
	   Five Atletico fans, also members of the Bastion group, were
arrested Monday and last Friday. Two of them are jailed and other
two remain in custody pending further investigation. The other was
released.
	   News of the stabbing death filled the first pages of Spanish
national and sports papers. The government, league officials and
soccer players from other teams called for stricter controls and
punishments for violent soccer fans.
	   On Sunday, Aitor's murder led to the decision by all of Spain's
first-division soccer teams to hold a moment of silence in his
memory before the 14th round games. Real Sociedad's players wore
jerseys with the victim's name on the back.

French lawmakers' report points finger at U.N., United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from U.N. in New York in para 7.
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A committee of French lawmakers on Tuesday
presented their conclusions on the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, calling
for French government reform but mainly faulting the United Nations
and United States for letting the bloodbath take place.
	   The 9-month study, launched amid accusations that Paris played a
role in causing the human disaster, said France was ``not at all
implicated in the unleashing of the violence.''
	   After rockets downed the plane of Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana while landing at Kigali airport on April 6, 1994, the
United Nations was ``incapable of stopping the rise of violence and
to put an end to the massacres,'' the report says.
	   It said U.N. ``passiveness'' was ``mainly due to the refusal of
the United States to envisage, after the debacle in Somalia, any
immediate increase in personnel and capability of the U.N. force.''
	   In October 1993, 18 American Rangers were killed in Somalia in
an attack on the stronghold of warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid,
leading to a U.S. withdrawal.
	   Under pressure from the Republican-led Congress, Clinton set
stringent conditions on future U.N. peacekeeping operations.
	   In New York, a U.N. official said the organization would make no
comment on whether France was guilty, ``but on their assessment of
why the U.N. was unable to respond to the genocide, we agree
fully,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Paul Quiles, the Socialist deputy and former defense minister
who led the Rwanda study, denounced the ``obstruction'' by the
United States in Rwanda, and said it was on ``instructions from
President Clinton.'' He did not elaborate.
	   An estimated 500,000 minority ethnic Tutsis and Hutu opposition
members were killed in the genocide, led by members of the Hutu
regime, from April to June.
	   France's Operation Turquoise, from June to August 1994, was
aimed at facilitating humanitarian aid, but was also accused of
protecting the Hutus.
	   Quiles said France was the victim of its own dual policies of
supporting its former colonies in Africa and pressing them toward
democracy.
	   While avoiding discussion of specifics, he said a lack of
legislative control and coordination between French ministries led
to the conflicting policies.
	   ``French support of the Rwandan military was so great and of
such duration that it couldn't assume a position as mediator,'' he
said.
	   At the same time, he said, France was unable to obtain a U.N.
mandate to carry out Operation Turquoise mission, which it began on
its own before other nations joined in.
	   Asked about the delivery of arms after the genocide began,
Quiles said details were in the full report, to be released on the
Internet Wednesday.
	   Quiles came under fire from angry French conservatives in the
parliament, who voted against the report.
	   ``France has nothing to turn red about,'' said Deputy Rene
Galy-de-Jean of the Rally for the Republic, the party of President
Jacques Chirac.

SAfrican Ramoni defends IBO title against Britain's Alldis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ IBO junior world featherweight
champion Simon Ramoni, a South African, defended his title with a
second round decision over British boxer Michael Alldis on Tuesday
at Durban's Village Green.
	   Referee John Coyle, also British, saved Alldis from a severe
pounding by stopping the fight after two rounds of the scheduled
12-rounder.
	   Ramoni made South African boxing history, becoming the first
South African to win an IBO title and then defend it on home soil.
He improved his record to 13 wins and four draws while Alldis
dropped to 15-5.
	   Alldis replaced Irishman Vince Finney, who was given notice not
to fight after a brain scan.
	   Both fighters started at a slow pace, sizing each other up, but
the South African indicated his intentions by finishing the round
with a two-punch combination to the head of the Englishman.
	   Ramoni continued in the second, unloading another two blows --
one a resounding right hook -- to the jaw that sent his opponent
down for a mandatory count of eight. Alldis got up, but was
pummeled with a flurry of blows.
	   Ramoni sent him down for the second time that round, showing his
power with a crashing uppercut for the first knockdown and a
stunning right cross for the deciding blow.
	   Coyle awarded the win to Ramoni just two minutes and 59 seconds
into the second round.

Father of tennis player claims racial bias on tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The father of three professional tennis players
claims the pro tennis tour is ``racist'' and kept one of his sons
out of the U.S. Open.
	   William Washington, who is black, contends that his son
Mashiska, 23, did not receive a wild card into the main draw at
this year's U.S. Open or to the qualifying tournament despite
having a better ranking than six players who did.
	   Washington and his son made the allegations Tuesday at the
office of their attorney Ellis Rubin.
	   The system ``is racist. It is out of balance. It should be
ended,'' Washington said.
	   Rubin, who is considering legal action, wants to set up meetings
with officials from both men's and women's tours and the USTA and
U.S. Open.
	   So far, USTA representatives seem willing to meet.
	   ``We are willing to have an open discussion with Mr. Washington
on this matter and look forward to answering any questions he may
have,'' said USTA executive director Rick Ferman.
	   The USTA, however, denies unfairly awarding wild cards, or
passes given to players for entry into tournaments.
	   ``The USTA has always awarded U.S. Open wild cards to deserving
players without regard to race or ethnic origin,'' said USTA
president Harry Marmion.
	   The focus of Washington's argument involves the wild cards,
which are given at the discretion of tournament directors. They
often are awarded to low-ranked, promising players needing a career
boost.
	   The organizations that run tennis, and tournament directors of
events such as the U.S. Open don't give out the passes fairly,
especially when it comes to minorities, said Washington.
	   Mashiska, No. 402 in the world, did not make it to the U.S. Open
this year. He had received wild cards to the U.S. Open qualifying
tournament each of the past four years and advanced past the first
round just once.
	   Mashiska, whose brother MaliVai and sister Mashona play on the
tour, also has received more than 30 wild cards into tournaments in
his career. His 1998 record is 6-8 in the challengers, minor-league
tournaments. He is 0-4 career in ATP Tour main draw matches.
	   ``Our first priority is to developing players and the second is
to players who have made a significant contribution to the game,''
said U.S. Open tournament director Jay Snyder. ``I would think that
Mashiska's game has kind of leveled off.''
	   Wild cards, especially into an event's main draw, are considered
as valuable as gold to struggling players. At the 1998 U.S. Open,
for instance, a main draw wild card was worth at least dlrs 12,000
_ the prize money earned by a first-round loser.
	   ``I have never received a main draw wild card at the tour level
in any country, particularly the U.S,'' Mashiska Washington said.

Chechnya declares state of emergency to fight crime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya declared a one-month state of emergency
Tuesday to combat rampant crime and try to end the nearly daily
kidnappings in the breakaway Russian republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been taken hostage in Chechnya since the
end of a 1994-96 war with Russia. In an unusually gruesome display
of lawlessness, four Western captives were beheaded last week.
	   ``The time for talking has passed and it is no longer possible
to tolerate the crime wave,'' Chechen Security Minister Aslambek
Arsayev said Monday.
	   Chechnya's parliament declared the 30-day emergency on Tuesday,
lawmaker Rizvan Lorsanov told the Interfax news agency in Grozny,
Chechnya's capital.
	   On Monday, the parliament turned down a request by President
Aslan Maskhadov to mobilize army reservists as part of the
anti-crime effort. Lawmakers said reservists could only be
mobilized in the face of an external threat.
	   But Maskhadov proceeded with the mobilization anyway, said
presidential spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``No compromise is possible with criminal groups, and Maskhadov
advocates tough measures to destroy gangsters,'' Vachagayev said.
	   More than 1,500 reservists have arrived at mobilization centers,
he said.
	   The reports did not say what new powers the government would
have under the state of emergency. The security forces have been
stepping up checks of vehicles on main roads in recent days.
	   However, the Chechen government has been reluctant to confront
suspected criminal gangs in the past. It's not clear whether the
security forces will take a more aggressive stance this time and
risk armed conflict with outlaw groups.
	   Authorities are also appealing to Chechen elders and Islamic
leaders to persuade young people to lay down their weapons and
leave armed groups.
	   With Chechnya's economy shattered, many young men who fought
against the Russians have turned to crime, and armed gangs roam
operate freely throughout the mainly Muslim territory.
	   Kidnappings have become more and more frequent. The hostages
beheaded last week were three Britons and a New Zealander kidnapped
in October while installing a telephone network.
	   Maskhadov, widely respected as a military commander during the
war, has been unable to impose order since winning a landslide
election almost two years ago.
	   His impoverished government barely functions and many of the
rebel fighters who served under him during the war have turned
against him.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts aimed for a
rare nighttime landing Tuesday following their triumphant space
station-building mission.
	   Thick clouds, however, threatened to keep them up an extra day.
	   The Kennedy Space Center was socked in throughout the afternoon.
By sunset, the sky had begun to clear although clouds and rain were
still a concern.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
touchdowns. It would be only the 10th time in 17{ years of space
shuttle flight that astronauts have returned in darkness.
	   Commander Robert Cabana said he and his crew were ready to come
home after nearly 12 days aloft.
	   ``Everything is shipshape up here and we can't wait to get back
and see our families and have a great Christmas,'' he said. ``It's
been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space
station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.

Duvalier still in France, police sources say; lawsuit prepared
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ousted Hatian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier has
been spotted recently in both Paris and Cannes, police sources said
Tuesday, challenging the official French line that the government
has lost track of him and he may have left the country.
	   Circulating under different pseudonyms, the former dictator
regularly changes dwellings, staying with friends, the sources said
on condition of anonymity.
	   Named president for life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since February
1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile.
	   But the French Interior Ministry said recently it had lost track
of him and that he ``probably'' had left the country.
	   Encouraged by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean military
ruler Augusto Pinochet, Haitian-born photographer Gerald Bloncourt
has founded a committee in Paris to bring Duvalier to trial for
crimes against humanity.
	   On Tuesday, he said he had gathered ``the necessary elements''
for a lawsuit and would announce legal action at a news conference
on Friday.
	   The Haitian government has encouraged Haitians to file lawsuits
in Haiti against the former dictator, but until now no one has
filed a criminal suit. However, if the French victims file suit,
Duvalier could be tried in France.
	   Duvalier spoke out in a radio interview Monday, saying his
conscience was clear and denying he was a fugitive.
	   ``I am not afraid,'' Duvalier told a New York city reporter for
the private Radio Galaxie in Haiti, speaking by telephone. ``My
conscience is clear.''
	   ``I have not been convicted,'' he said. ``No suit has been filed
against me,'' he said.
	   Duvalier's father, Francois, known as ``Papa Doc,'' ruled Haiti
with an iron hand since 1957 with the help of the Tontons Macoutes,
his private militia. Tens of thousands of people were massacred and
tortured to death during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty.

 &UR; Nobel winner's story challenged &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: INCORPORATES US-Guatemala-Laureate Questioned
 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Key details in the autobiography of Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu might be false, but that
should not discredit the cause of Indian rights that she espouses,
her human rights foundation and the Nobel committee said Tuesday.
	   Even the U.S. anthropologist whose new book debunks much of Ms.
Menchu's version of her life in Guatemala said her story could be
defended as justifiable.
	   ``I'm not attacking the laureate herself, but a story that did
serve a useful purpose at one time,'' David Stoll said by
telephone.
	   In his book ``Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor
Guatemalans,'' released by Westview Press this month, Stoll asserts
that Menchu's autobiography inaccurately says she had no formal
education, watched a younger brother starve to death, and witnessed
the execution-by-burning of another brother.
	   In fact, according to relatives and others who knew Ms. Menchu
early in her life, the younger brother who Ms. Menchu said starved
to death never existed.
	   Ms. Menchu, who claimed she never went to school, attended two
private boarding schools on scholarships. A land dispute central to
her autobiography was a family quarrel, not a fight against rich
landowners of European descent.
	   But Stoll, speaking from Middlebury College in Vermont, said
``there's more at issue here than another celebrity embroidering
her story.''
	   ``The way that you can justify her story if you want to is that
it was a crisis situation and she wouldn't have gotten the
attention that she did had she told her own story, or if she said
`These are things I've heard have happened to other people,''' he
said.
	   Ms. Menchu became an internationally acclaimed spokeswoman for
the rights of indigenous people, based largely on her best-selling
account of her life which detailed atrocities during Guatemala's
36-year civil war. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.
	   Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,
said his group was fully aware of the criticisms of Ms. Menchu's
autobiography and that they would have no effect on the peace
prize.
	   ``This has come up before,'' Sejersted said in Oslo, Norway.
``We have noted that some new information has come out. But we did
a very thorough investigation before the prize and none of this
undermines _ from our side _ her efforts.''
	   ``There is nothing that changes the fundamental basis of our
decision,'' he said.
	   Even if the committee wished to revoke a prize, there is no
provision in the Nobel rules for doing so.
	   Alfonso Alem, executive director of the Rigoberta Menchu
Foundation in Mexico City, said he understood her autobiography
should be seen in two ways: ``one in a literal manner, one in a
symbolic manner _ and this absolutely has not been affected.''
	   ``The tragedy of the Indian people is real,'' he said. Stoll's
assertions ``should not affect the legitimacy of the demands of the
Indian people.''
	   Ms. Menchu was not available for comment. Alem said she was
attending a judicial hearing in Coban, Guatemala.
	   Stoll's book is based on archival research and nearly a decade
of interviews with more than 120 people.
	   ``She attracted lots of attention by turning her own life into a
Victor Hugo novel,'' Stoll said. ``That's how her story can be
defended. I'm saying that's fine.''
	   But now that Guatemala has begun searching for the truth behind
the war, which ended in 1996, ``it's also time to reexamine the
story,'' he said.
	   ``If you really want to understand how the violence happened,
you have to look at her story again, even if it did serve a
defensible purpose at the time it was told.''

Big month looms for boxing's big guys
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Grant, who could emerge as a star in a
sport that is in short supply of stars, will cap a big month for
heavyweights when he fight Jan. 30 at Atlantic City, New Jersey.
	   ``I lot of people think boxing is going down,'' said Grant
(28-0, 20 knockouts), who will fight Ahmad Abdin (25-1-3).
	   Grant's fight, part of a doubleheader that also is expected to
include Andrew Golota, will come two weeks after Mike Tyson is
supposed to fight Francois Botha at Las Vegas and one week of the
George Foreman and Larry Holmes are to fight at Houston.
	   So the big guys _ and old guys, in the case of Foreman and
Holmes _ will get a lot of attention early in the year. And, of
course, there is the unification title fight between IBF-WBA
champion Evander Holyfield and WBC champion Lennox Lewis set for
March 13 at Madison Square Garden.
	   ``I want to become recognized as one of the best heavyweights in
the world,'' said Grant, who hasn't fought since May 30 because he
was knocked out of September bout by hepatitis.
	   Promoter Dino Duva said at a news conference Tuesday that he
wants Grant to fight at least four times in 1999. It also will be
an important year for Golota. The Polish fighter rebounded from his
first-round loss to WBC champion Lennox Lewis in 1997 by winning
four bouts in 1998.
	   A fight between Golota (32-3, 27 knockouts) and David Izon
(22-3, 19 knockouts) was supposed to be announced at the news
conference. Duva said the fight is not yet set but he thinks it
probably will go forward.
	   No one connected with the card would confirm it, but it is
believed both fighters want more money.

Judge throws out murder case in killing of Canadian teen tourist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAYMOND HAINEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A woman juror burst into tears, the
friend of a murder victim yelled threats and others cheered Tuesday
when a Supreme Court judge freed a man accused in the rape and
stabbing murder of a 16-year-old Canadian tourist.
	   Judge Vincent Meerabux indicated prosecutors had bungled the
case.
	   Rebecca Middleton, 16, of Belleville, Ontario, was killed the
night of July 3, 1996, after she got a ride from a party with two
strange men on a motorbike.
	   That is not considered dangerous in Bermuda, a British territory
that prides itself on its low crime rate with an average three
murders a year over the past decade.
	   The accused man, Justis Smith, 20, was led shaking from the
courtroom to cheers from his friends.
	   Rick Meens, a Middleton family friend, shouted threats as Smith
left and got involved in a shouting match with British defense
lawyer John Perry.
	   Smith was freed and went home, Perry said.
	   Judge Meerabux said the prosecution, led by Solicitor General
William Pearce, had failed to present evidence to link Smith to the
killing and had abused the legal system.
	   ``The process of the court has been abused and, in my view, the
prosecution has misused the processes of the court,'' Meerabux
said.
	   Prosecutors said they were considering an appeal.
	   Meerabux ordered the jury to find Smith innocent of premeditated
murder, a charge that carries the death sentence in this British
territory.
	   He noted that the only physical evidence pointed to Smith's
friend, 23-year-old Kirk Mundy, whose semen was found in
Middleton's body.
	   Mundy was tried in October 1996 and testified that he had
consensual sex with Middleton in a park before Smith attacked her.
	   In a plea bargain negotiated by then-Attorney General Elliott
Mottley, Mundy was sentenced to five years in jail as an accomplice
after the fact in the death.
	   Later, prosecutors wanted Mundy to stand trial for murder, but
two appeals court refused them, saying they could not try him
twice.
	   Mottley left Bermuda last week, after his three-year contract
expired, for his native Barbados.
	   Prosecutors had tried to argue there was enough circumstantial
evidence to convict Smith.
	   One witness testified that he saw Middleton accept a ride from
Smith and Mundy.
	   Another testified to seeing two men leave the area where the
attack took place shortly before Middleton's body was found.
	   Expert witnesses said that they believed two people were
involved in Middleton's killing.
	   And a knife believed to be the murder weapon was consistent with
an incomplete set of knives found in Smith's home.
	   But the only forensic evidence came from Mundy, and Meerabux
echoed the defense's questions about why prosecutors had not called
Mundy to testify against Smith, since their charge was based on his
evidence.

International team wants Thomson back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Not long after winning its first
Presidents Cup, the International team began a campaign to keep
captain Peter Thomson for the 2000 matches.
	   ``I would love to see him back,'' Greg Norman said.
	   Thomson, who stepped in two years ago when the International
team rebelled against David Graham, had said during the final day
of matches that this would be his last year, thinking it would be
``healthy'' to have a new captain.
	   Once the cup was clinched, he said it was premature to discuss
his future.
	   Thomson's role cannot be understated.
	   His pairings were brilliant, particularly the first set of
matches in which each of the five alternate-shot groups had at
least one player familiar with the nuances of Royal Melbourne.
	   While Thomson didn't play a single shot, he may have been the
biggest reason the International team won as it did.
	   ``He's the backbone of all of us,'' Norman said. ``No matter
what it was, we stood by him. The victory comes from the top down,
and Peter was very instrumental in that.''
	   It started two years ago when he took 12 players in disarray and
instilled in them a sense of unity. After its narrow loss in
Virginia, the International team held an emotional meeting in a
cabin at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club.
	   ``Peter didn't say very much, but what he did say was very
concise and to the point,'' Nick Price said. ``The whole complexion
of the Presidents Cup changed for me, because I realized that you
could take a group of 12 people from the four corners of the world
and make them a team. This trip, thanks to Peter, we were a team.''
	   Thomson also did a fabulous impersonation of Lou Holtz, building
up the opposition as world-beaters and rarely giving his team much
of a chance. When the lopsided victory was complete, Thomson was
asked this question: Since he said the U.S. team was the ``greatest
collection of golfers in the world,'' where did this leave the
International team?
	   ``Good question, isn't it?'' Thomson said. ``We're on virtual
home soil. I think we've got to recognize that. Until we beat that
team in the United States, I don't think we can crow too much.''
	   That's another reason for him to return as captain in 2000, when
the Presidents Cup returns to the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in
Virginia.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MELBOURNE MECCA: &LR;  For two years leading to the Presidents Cup,
Australians such as Craig Parry and Stuart Appleby touted Melbourne
as having the greatest collection of championship golf courses in
the world.
	   That's not just Aussie pride.
	   The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship will be played
in the Melbourne area in 2001, and Royal Melbourne Golf Club
probably won't even get the event.
	   According to PGA Tour sources, the leading candidates are
Kingston Heath and The National, with Victoria Golf Club and
Metropolitan close behind. Royal Melbourne, which drew rave reviews
from Presidents Cup players on both teams, is still being
considered.
	   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said a decision is expected by
the end of the year.
	   Asked for a short list of candidates, Finchem said only that the
premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, turned in a list of the golf
courses in Melbourne.
	   ``And that's our list,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SUTTON EXEMPTION: &LR;  PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem sees no
reason why Hal Sutton will be kept out of the NEC Invitational next
year.
	   The Invitational, which replaces the World Series of Golf, is a
World Golf Championship event for players from Ryder and Presidents
Cup teams. Sutton earned his way onto the Presidents Cup team, but
then withdrew when his father-in-law died. He was replaced by Lee
Janzen.
	   Finchem said the final decision will come from the International
Federation of PGA Tours, ``but I believe if a player has to
withdraw in a situation like Sutton's, he should be allowed to play
in the Invitational.''
	   The NEC Invitational will be played at Firestone Country Club in
Akron, Ohio, two weeks after the PGA Championship. Shigeki
Maruyama, the surprising star of the Presidents Cup, had his best
U.S. showing at Firestone _ a tie for 11th at the World Series this
year.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR; : A Solheim Cup postscript: Tammie Green, six months
pregnant during the U.S. victory, gave birth Dec. 3 to a girl, Tina
Marie Parker. Carin Koch, left off the European team because she
was six months pregnant, gave birth Nov. 27 to a boy, Oliver Micael
Ture Koch. ... Greg Norman was awarded an honorary doctorate from
Griffith University in Australia. ... According to the Darrell
Survey, Mizuno led the PGA Tour with the most sets of irons in play
(1,151) and top 10 finishes (71). ... Karsten Manufacturing Corp.
has turned Ping into a wholly owned subsidiary. All Karsten golf
operations will be transferred to the new company Jan. 1. ...
According to a National Golf Foundation survey, 64 percent of 800
people who responded said they routinely concede short putts during
stroke play. ... The 2001 U.S. Senior Amateur will be played at
Norwood Hills Country Club in St. Louis. The 2001 U.S. Junior
Amateur goes to Oak Hills in San Antonio.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAT OF THE WEEK: &LR;  Since losing to Christy O'Connor Jr. in his
first Ryder Cup in 1989, Fred Couples has never lost a Sunday
singles match in the Ryder or Presidents Cup _ a 4-0-2 record.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FINAL WORD: &LR;  ``Neither did Scott Hoch.'' _ Mark Calcavecchia,
when told that Bobby Jones didn't like St. Andrews the first time
he saw it.

UN says opportunities to rebuild Burundi shouldn't be lost
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Regional sanctions imposed on Burundi two
years ago are undermining recent political progress in the Central
African nation and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis, a U.N.
report said Tuesday.
	   The measures may have helped bring about some political changes
after they were imposed following a coup by military ruler Pierre
Buyoya but they have long outlasted their usefulness, said Kathleen
Cravere, the resident representative of the U.N. Development
Program in Burundi.
	   ``We believe there must be more effective ways to promote the
peace process now because the impact on the poorest in Burundi is
devastating,'' she said at a news conference to launch the report,
``Choosing Hope: The case for constructive engagement in Burundi.''
	   While singling out sanctions as one impediment to progress in
Burundi, the report also calls on the international community to
take on a larger role in rebuilding the nation.
	   The top U.N. humanitarian official, Sergio Vieira de Mello will
launch the annual appeal for Burundi in Geneva on Wednesday by
asking donor nations to target a quarter of the requested dlrs 83.6
million for programs to resettle refugees and rebuild villages.
	   The remainder would go for traditional emergency aid for the
estimated 1 million people displaced by fighting over the past five
years, Cravere said.
	   Burundi has been wracked by fighting since 1993, when
paratroopers belonging to the Tutsi minority killed the country's
first democratically elected president, a Hutu.
	   Hutu rebels are currently fighting to topple Buyoya, a Tutsi,
who overthrew a weak coalition government on July 25, 1996.
	   The humanitarian costs of the fighting are stark: Ninty-one
percent of the 600,000 people living in 300 refugee camps in
Burundi itself receive half of the minimum daily requirements for
drinking water, the report said. Every day, 345,000 people receive
food aid while 40,000 are treated for malnutrition.
	   Sanctions have resulted in the doubling of household costs
between 1996 and 1997, the report said. While humanitarian aid is
supposed to be exempt from the measures, delivery of basic relief
items such as seeds are routinely held up in neighboring countries,
forcing farmers to sow late and reap less.
	   The sanctions are affecting people vital to the political
progress. ``As such, they are thus actually undermining the
achievements of recent months,'' the report said.
	   Nevertheless, the report cited such political progress and
improved security and stability in 11 of Burundi's 16 provinces as
the reason governments should think beyond emergency aid when they
write checks to U.N. programs.
	   Cravere said the United Nations firmly believed that a real
improvement in the humanitarian situation in Burundi would only
come with peace.
	   ``But it's an equally strongly held view that the kinds of
community actions that we're suggesting in this report and some
sign of encouragement from the international community is
absolutely critical to the internal developments now under way in
Burundi,'' she said.

U.S. envoy warns Kosovo's warring factions

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks ending, more comments from Holbrooke, Hill;
UPDATES casualty count.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Warning Kosovo's factions that they
are playing with ``dynamite,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke sought
Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
newest violation of an informal cease-fire left 42 people dead.
	   On arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region.
	   But later, after a five-hour Belgrade meeting with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, both Holbrooke and Christopher Hill,
the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts to broker a peace,
acknowledged wide differences.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   Updating Monday's casualty count, the Yugoslav army said it
killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and wounded a dozen in a five-hour
gun battle near the border with Albania. The guerrillas use Albania
as a sanctuary and conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off border area. Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent
armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the remote region
and continued barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace verifier, who declined to be named, said denying the
verifiers access violated an October agreement reached between
Milosevic and Holbrooke, and a formal protest will be filed.
	   Verifiers who hiked to the site Monday said they saw 31 bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters
(yards) of the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns
and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
submachine-gun fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings
on the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Tuesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent a message of
condolences to the families of killed Serbs, saying, ``we will not
hesitate to prevent anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of
our citizens.''
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appaling beyond words.''
	   ``There is no excuse for this kind of action,'' he said.
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved (in fighting) that
they are playing with dynamite,'' he warned, in earlier comments.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The rebels
say they won't accept anything short of independence. Serbia,
meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Reflecting Western fears that the peace talks are deadlocked,
chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels are
``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands for
an independent Kosovo.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Conventional wisdom was that the
Americans had to lose for the Presidents Cup to become as
meaningful as the Ryder Cup. But a royal beating at Royal Melbourne
might have done just the opposite.
	   There's no shame in losing to an International team loaded with
some of the best players in the world. Nick Price, Ernie Els, Greg
Norman, Vijay Singh and Steve Elkington have won nine major
championships among them.
	   But to lose in the way they did _ it was the worst U.S. loss in
any cup, amateur or professional _ raises questions whether winning
the Presidents Cup means as much to the United States as it does to
the International team.
	   The final margin was 20 1/2-11 1/2. What was supposed to be a
closely contested Presidents Cup, resembled a Super Bowl from the
1980s. The last time Ryder Cup matches were that lopsided was when
the United States won 18 1/2-9 1/2 in 1981, the year Seve
Ballesteros didn't play and Nick Faldo didn't have a game.
	   ``I'm sure the Americans wanted to win just as much as we did,''
said Craig Parry of Australia, who never gave Justin Leonard a
chance in the first singles match on the final day. ``The hard
thing for the Americans is they play the Ryder Cup one year, the
Presidents Cup the next year, and they really don't have a break.
	   ``We've got something to really go out and play for. The
Presidents Cup means something to our team.''
	   Does it mean as much to the United States as the Ryder Cup?
	   Probably not.
	   Most Americans build every other year around making the Ryder
Cup team and bringing back the cup. The Presidents Cup fell at the
end of a long year that figures to get even longer with the World
Golf Championship series.
	   Consider Mark Calcavecchia, who blubbered on the beach after he
thought his Sunday collapse against Colin Montgomerie had cost the
Americans a victory in the 1991 Ryder Cup. Calcavecchia, like most
U.S. players, was in a state of shock after falling behind from the
start at Royal Melbourne and watching the score get even worse.
	   But he was nowhere near a state of tears.
	   ``It's never fun to lose,'' he said. ``But if you're going to
lose to anybody, I'd rather lose to these guys rather than the
Europeans.''
	   Ah, nothing like a grudge to create a war.
	   That's the last thing Jack Nicklaus wanted as captain of the
U.S. team. He always thought the Ryder Cup was about goodwill _ and
it was, at one time _ and he didn't see the need to put any more
pressure on his players than they put on themselves.
	   It wasn't a war, as the final score reflects. And Nicklaus did
not prepare for one.
	   For Peter Thomson, who grew up in Melbourne, winning the
Presidents Cup was ``the biggest thing I suppose I've ever done'' _
strong words from a five-time British Open champion.
	   Thomson treated it with such importance. When he decided the
pairings for the first round of five-alternate shot matches, he had
at least one player in every group who knew just about every side
of Royal Melbourne.
	   So give the International team homefield advantage. Does that
account for nine points?
	   Craig Parry, Frank Nobilo, Shigeki Maruyama and Ernie Els might
have as much to do with the lopsided victory as anything.
	   All of them took the fight out of the Americans _ Nobilo's
40-foot (12-meter) birdie on the last hole on Friday, Parry with a
chip-in from 50 feet (15 meters) on the same green, Maruyama with a
hot putter the minute he stepped off the plane, and Els with a
series of 20-foot (7-meter) putts that left Nicklaus speechless.
	   But it's not like the Americans didn't have their chances.
	   ``I said, 'Hey guys, you played on the same greens, you had the
same opportunity to do that,''' Nicklaus said. ``I'm sure they
didn't win all those tournaments by watching somebody else make
20-footers. They made a few themselves.''
	   But not at Royal Melbourne, not in the Presidents Cup.
	   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said the pressure was on the
United States, which had the better team on paper _ eight of its
players were in the top 15 in the world, none ranked lower than
25th.
	   ``That was the case in the last Ryder Cup, and that was the case
this weekend,'' Finchem said. ``The International team was hugely
focused on beating them.''
	   The result is another lost cup for the United States, minus the
agony of defeat.
	   ``Heck, it's almost Christmas time,'' Calcavecchia said. ``We'll
get over it.''

Scandal shadows Salt Lake's Olympics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Almost since skiing great Alf Engen and
his rowdy World War II mountaineers strapped wooden slats to their
boots and romped in Utah's pristine powder, Salt Lake City has
wanted an Olympics.
	   After 30 years and five heartbreaking losses, the city finally
prevailed and was awarded the 2002 Winter Games.
	   But now the event that residents had hoped would be a showcase
has been smudged by scandal.
	   ``I think if we won that way, then we shouldn't have won,'' said
Natalie Monger, a 23-year-old Salt Lake hairdresser. Many residents
were dismayed at the news.
	   ``The response we're getting has been mixed, but I'd say there's
a sense of shame out there,'' said Shelley Thomas, a spokeswoman
for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
	   The International Olympic Committee has begun an investigation
into admissions by Salt Lake officials that the now-disbanded bid
committee, separate from the organizing committee, gave
scholarships to relatives of IOC members and may have paid hundreds
of thousands of dollars in cash to agents professing to sell blocs
of IOC votes.
	   Directors of the organizing committee will meet Friday to start
an internal ethics investigation.
	   ``It's pretty appalling,'' sighed organizing committee member
Randy Dryer.
	   The scandal broke three weeks ago when a local television
station learned the bid committee had paid thousands of dollars for
a scholarship for Sonia Essomba, daughter of the late Rene Essomba,
an IOC member from Cameroon.
	   SLOC first insisted the scholarship was ``humanitarian aid,''
even though the senior Essomba was a wealthy and well-connected
professor of surgery, in addition to being secretary general of the
National Olympic Committees of Africa.
	   An audit revealed the bid committee had spent dlrs 400,000 on 13
scholarships _ six to relatives of IOC members, most from Africa.
	   Overall, the city's bid committee spent just under dlrs 13
million. Since it was all private money, there has been no public
accounting of where it went.
	   Organizing committee president Frank Joklik _ even as he seeks
distance from the bid committee he once chaired _ has continued to
insist the scholarships were humanitarian.
	   But a senior IOC member, Swiss lawyer Marc Hodler, was having
none of it.
	   Hodler on Saturday revealed what he said has been systematic
buying and selling of the Olympics, saying some IOC members were
little more than international grifters.
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always, been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' he said.
	   Hodler has described the Salt Lake scholarship fund as a bribe,
although he said the city deserved the Games and was more a victim
of blackmail than criminally complicit.
	   Hodler also said that shadowy ``agents'' _ including at least
one IOC member _ promised blocs of votes for cash payments. One
such agent, Hodler said, may have received dlrs 100,000 in cash and
free treatment for hepatitis after moving to Salt Lake while the
city was seeking the bid.
	   The scandal has produced immense disappointment in Utah.
	   The first Winter Olympics of the new millennium offered the
opportunity to prove that Utah had outgrown its cloistered,
small-town parochialism.
	   Engen, widely considered the grandfather of Utah skiing, founded
one of the first and most popular of Utah's ski resorts. He died
last year at 88.
	   Salt Lake's bid slogan was ``The World is Welcome Here,'' and it
was a point of pride among the 70 percent Mormon population that
they had already enlisted more than 10,000 volunteers.
	   It's been no secret that the IOC members who visited Salt Lake
through the years have been royally feted, fed and fawned over.
	   ``But this is different,'' Dryer said of the scandal. ``This is
corrupt.''

Japan to announce `Miyazawa' aid packages for Thailand, Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with aid packages for Thailand, Malaysia to
be announced &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Japanese government will announce on
Wednesday aid packages for Thailand and Malaysia during a summit of
Southeast Asian nations, an official said.
	   Sadaaki Numata, Japan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the aid
announcement will be made during the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations summit being held in Hanoi.
	   He did not provide details of the aid offer.
	   The aid for the two countries will come from Japan's Miyazawa
Fund, a dlrs 30 billion fund set up to bolster the economies of
Asian countries affected by the region's financial crisis.
	   Eligible countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
South Korea and Thailand.
	   Numata added that Japan would consider a request from Vietnam
for loans from the Miyazawa Fund, but that no formal application
has been received yet.
	   The aid plan, unveiled by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa in October, calls for Japan to provide dlrs 15 billion for
medium- and long-term financial needs for economic recovery in
Asian countries, and another dlrs 15 billion for possible
short-term capital needs during the process of implementing
economic reform.
	   In addition, Japanese media have reported that Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi plans to unveil approximately 600 billion yen
(dlrs 5.1 billion) in new loans to Asia during the summit, which
began Tuesday and ends Wednesday. The loans would be used to
finance public works projects and infrastructure development, with
priority given to projects that create business for Japanese
companies.
	   The loans are part of 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.5 billion) that
Tokyo has earmarked to help regional countries as part of a
recently announced 24 trillion yen (dlrs 204 billion) economic
stimulus budget.
	   Obuchi is also scheduled to meet with leaders from China, South
Korea and Cambodia during his four-day trip. He also will hold
talks with Vietnam's prime minister, Phan Van Khai.
	   Obuchi is to travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he is
to visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Autissier survives knockdown, keeps lead in solo sailing race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Isabelle Autissier's 60-foot (18-meter) yacht
was knocked down by an errant wave Tuesday in the southern Indian
Ocean, but the French sailor still kept her grip on the lead in the
second leg of the Around Alone race.
	   Autissier, the lone woman in the race that began last September
in Charleston, South Carolina, held a 29-mile (46-kilometer) lead
over Marc Thiercelin, also of France, as the 14-boat fleet surged
over waves as big as three-story houses. Giovanni Soldini of Italy
was in third, 36 miles (58-kms) behind Autissier.
	   By late Tuesday night, the leaders were nearly 3,000 miles
(4,800 kilometers) southeast of Cape Town, South Africa, and had
passed one of the two mandatory course marks en route to Auckland,
New Zealand. Strong westerly winds up to 50 mph (80 kmph) and icy
seas were testing both the racers and their equipment.
	   ``The waves are starting to get a little vicious, running every
which way,'' Autissier reported in a dispatch Tuesday. ``One of
them blindsided the boat while I was brewing a cup of tea.''
	   Mike Golding and Josh Hall, both of Britain, also had knockdowns
in the last few days.
	   In an unusual move during rough weather last week, the sailors
agreed among themselves that it was too dangerous to go south of
the Kerguelen Islands. Autissier supported the move, even though
she said cut into her lead.
	   In Class II, for boats under 50 feet (15 meters), Mike Garside
of Britain was 33 miles (53 kms) ahead of Jean-Pierre Mouligne of
France on Tuesday. Brad Van Liew of Santa Monica, California, was
in third, 240 miles (385 kilometers) behind Garside.
	   While most of the fleet left Cape Town on Dec. 5, Robin Davie of
Charleston was still in port Tuesday, frantically trying to wrap up
repairs to his boat. He hoped to leave in the next few days.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks moved to higher ground Tuesday, as
General Electric pushed the Dow up for the first time in a week. On
Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 127.70 points _
or by 1.5 percent _ at 8,823.30. Leading stocks higher was a report
from the Labor Department reaffirming that inflation is being held
in check. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Consumer prices barely budged last month as
moderation in food and energy costs kept inflation under wraps. In
good news for holiday shoppers, the price of computers, video
equipment and toys all declined. The Labor Department reported
Tuesday that its Consumer Price Index edged up just 0.2 percent in
November, matching the October increase. So far this year,
inflation is rising at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent, even
better than last year's 11-year low of 1.7 percent. (US-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ For tax purposes, Deutsche Bank plans
to form a separate unit for its industrial holdings, which are
worth more than 40 billion marks (dlrs 24 billion), according a
German magazine report released Tuesday. The holdings include
Deutsche Bank's 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler, its 9.4
percent stake in Allianz insurance and its 10 percent stake in
Muenchener Rueckversicherungs, also an insurance company, according
to the monthly ManagerMagazin. The magazine said the new unit would
allow Deutsche Bank eventually to sell industrial stakes without

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Citigroup announced 10,400 job cuts Tuesday,
more than had been expected, as part of a major restructuring that
will cost the company dlrs 900 million in lost earnings. The
announcement marks the first time the company has divulged details
of its huge restructuring program aimed at consolidating the
operations of Citicorp and Travelers Group, which merged in October
to create the financial services giant. The staff cuts represent
6.5 percent of the company's global work force of 160,000.
Citigroup said 35 percent of the cuts, or about 3,600 jobs, would
be cut in the United States. Citigroup's board of directors
approved a dlrs 900 million charge against earnings Tuesday, most
of which will be taken in the fourth quarter of this year.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Wim Duisenberg, president of the
European Central Bank, told a German newspaper that he wouldn't
rule out further rate cuts after the single currency project is
initiated Jan. 1. In an interview with the weekly Die Zeit released
Tuesday, Duisenberg noted that interest rates in the euro zone are
at historically low levels. But when price stability has been
reached, meaning there is no risk of inflation or deflation, ``we
must try to get rates as low as possible,'' he said. The central
banks of the 11 euro area countries cut rates on Dec. 3, making
clear that the euro will start with a short-term rate of 3 percent.
Many analysts expect the ECB to cut rates by another quarter of a
percent during the first half of 1999. (GERMANY-EURO RATES)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Western nations should avoid treating Russia as an
economic basket case and help it get back on its feet, according to
a U.N. survey released Wednesday. ``There's a general tendency to
despair of Russia and walk away from it at the moment, but that
doesn't seem to us very sensible or politically very wise,'' said
Paul Rayment, head of economic analysis at the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe. Uncertainty in Russia posed the greatest
potential risk to improving economies in East Europe, the
commission said in its 178-page Economic Survey of Europe. East
European exports to Russia are expected to drop by 20 to 25 percent
for 1998 on last year, Rayment said. (UN-RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Returning home to an
impeachment vote, President Bill Clinton ended his Mideast journey
on a disappointing note Tuesday as Israel refused to resume the
West Bank troop withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace
accord. Nonetheless, Clinton declared his three-day trip a success
and expressed hope the troop pullbacks would commence soon. ``I do
think we are back on track again,'' the president said. ``It's a
bumpy track, but it's on track,'' observed his national security
adviser, Sandy Berger. Clinton said the work would continue.
``We'll just keep at it,'' he said, and announced that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright will return to the Mideast in several
weeks. Albright made a quick trip to Jordan on Tuesday to report on
Clinton's talks. CLINTON-MIDEAST
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday gave its
conditional approval for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, saying the men cannot be freed unless several
outstanding hitches are solved. Western diplomats in Libya said the
parliament's statement appeared to be a major step toward a trial,
but the U.S. State Department and diplomats at the U.N.
headquarters in New York were less impressed. The General People's
Congress, Libya's parliament, expressed ``satisfaction with the
agreement of the Libyan, British and American sides on trying the
two suspects in the Lockerbie incident in a third country.''
LIBYA-LOCKERBIE
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Warning Kosovo's factions that they
are playing with ``dynamite,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke sought
Tuesday to revive peace efforts in the troubled province after the
newest violation of an informal cease-fire left 37 people dead. On
arrival in Pristina, capital of the Albanian-majority Serbian
province, Holbrooke said the latest bloodshed ``will not in any way
deter the international community from carrying out its
obligations'' to work for peace in the region. Holbrooke later
arrived in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav President Milosevic,
where he would ``emphasize the need to move ahead expeditiously''
on a Kosovo peace plan, the U.S. State Department said. Holbrooke
sought to dispel pessimism about Kosovo's future before going into
the meeting with Milosevic, saying, ``progress, very little but
progress'' had been made in trying to find a negotiated solution to
the Serb-ethnic Albanian conflict. YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers argued Tuesday that a judge who denied
Gen. Augusto Pinochet immunity from arrest was _ or certainly
appeared _ biased because of strong ties with Amnesty
International, a prime mover in a 25-year campaign to put the
former Chilean dictator on trial. South African-born Lord Justice
Leonard Hoffmann is the head of Amnesty's fundraising arm and his
wife, Gillian, has spent her working life with the human rights
organization. The return to the Lords marked a new move in the
83-year-old general's battle to avoid extradition to Spain to face
on charges of murder, torture and other heinous abuses of human
rights during his 1973-90 rule. BRITAIN-PINOCHET
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group promised Tuesday to start
disarming by Christmas, a gambit designed to pressure its Irish
Republican Army enemies into doing the same. The outlawed Loyalist
Volunteer Force _ which opposed April's peace accord but called a
cease-fire in May _ promised to hand over or destroy guns under the
supervision of a commission led by Canada's former army chief, Gen.
John de Chastelain. ``The ruling army council of the LVF have
assured the commission, through me tonight, that there will be
indeed a decommissioning event before Christmas,'' the group's
intermediary, paroled murderer and preacher Kenny McClinton, said
after meeting de Chastelain. NORTHERN IRELAND

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Carville, Jerry
Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, James
Cameron and Linda Hamilton; a screaming contest in Tokyo and subway
perfume in Paris &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Arnold Schwarzenegger said he'd be back.
	   The actor is in talks to reprise his cyborg role in a third
installment of the ``Terminator,'' with James Cameron planning to
write and produce the movie, Daily Variety reported Tuesday.
	   No deals have been signed, but enthusiasm is high, the industry
publication said.
	   Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Catherine Olim didn't immediately
return telephone messages Tuesday.
	   Cameron's not planning on directing, but sources speaking on
condition of anonymity told Daily Variety that could change.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ James Carville is helping Israel's Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak in his effort to defeat Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   ``I wouldn't have come this far if I didn't think he wouldn't
win,'' the Clinton stalwart and independent consultant told
reporters at the parliament building. ``I didn't take a flight this
far to lose.''
	   Elections are not due in Israel until 2000, but Netanyahu is
under political siege and might be forced to call early elections.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Shoshanna Lonstein says she and Jerry Seinfeld
broke up because he worked too hard and she played too much.
	   Seinfeld ``worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Lonstein
told Details magazine. ``And I wanted to run around and play.''
	   Now 23, Lonstein was only 16 when she met the former
``Seinfeld'' star in 1992. She enrolled at the University of
California, Los Angeles, to be near him, but they broke up in 1997.
	   ``I'm happy I got to have the relationship, but L.A. was a
really lonely existence for me,'' Lonstein said.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A tabloid photographer pleaded innocent to
charges that he sold a tape of a private cellular phone
conversation between Tom Cruise and wife Nicole Kidman.
	   Eric Ford, 27, entered the pleas Monday. He could get up to 15
years in prison if convicted at a trial that starts Feb. 9.
	   Ford was indicted last week on charges of illegally intercepting
a wire communication and disclosing its contents for financial
gain. He was arrested by FBI agents Thursday at his Studio City
home.
	   The indictment alleged that Ford used a modified radio scanner
to listen to the call between Cruise and Ms. Kidman on Feb. 5.
	   The material was published in the Globe supermarket tabloid,
which was not charged and has denied doing anything inappropriate.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The marriage of Linda Hamilton and James
Cameron appears to have sunk.
	   The actress cited irreconcilable differences in her divorce
petition filed Monday. She is seeking custody of their 5-year-old
daughter, Josephine, although she is willing to allow visits with
the Oscar-winning director of ``Titanic.''
	   The Los Angeles County Superior Court filing also seeks spousal
and child support, and requests their assets be divided.
	   The couple married June 24, 1997.
	   Hamilton starred in Cameron's 1984 ``The Terminator'' and the
1991 sequel ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' as well as the ``Beauty
and the Beast'' television series.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cacophony reigned more supreme than usual in
central Tokyo on Tuesday, as dozens of stressed-out people
screeched and bellowed in a contest with one simple rule: to be as
loud as possible.
	   Pent-up frustration over Japan's recession, the anguish of lost
love, and hostility toward smokers all found release as contestants
screamed messages into a decibel gauge at the 18th annual ``Big
Voice'' competition.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was the target of many of
the verbal assaults.
	   ``Heeey Obuchi, you listening? Abolish that consumption tax, got
it?'' belted out 64-year-old Kinshiro Toyama, whose deep baritone
suddenly cracked into a falsetto.
	   Another contestant, wearing a pink fuzzy sweater, appeared to
bid a bittersweet farewell to a partner.
	   ``Yodogawa-san! Sayonara! Sayonara! Sayonara!'' she screeched.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French are good at making perfume, but this one
may be a stretch: a scent for the subway?
	   That's what the Paris transit authority is offering soon at one
station in the French capital in order to make subway travel more
pleasant.
	   The floors of the Invalides station, near the Eiffel Tower, will
be washed and spread with the perfume, the RATP said Tuesday.
	   The scent to be used will be revealed Friday.

Japan's October current account surplus rises 21.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again in
October, increasing 21.5 percent from a year ago, the government
announced Wednesday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion) in October, the
Finance Ministry announced.
	   The rise marked the 19th consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.

Sri Lanka cracking down on pedophiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Despite an ethnic insurrection in the
north, tourists flock to Sri Lanka to enjoy its tropical landscape,
palm-fringed beaches, friendly people and inexpensive hotels.
	   But the island also has developed a darker reputation _ as a
place where adults can come for sex with children.
	   Now, after years of doing little, Sri Lankan officials appear
set to deal forcefully with the problem of child prostitution and
pedophiles.
	   ``We will ensure that there are no excuses,'' said Harendra de
Silva, chairman of the newly established National Child Protection
Authority.
	   Child sexual abuse is one of many problems that fall well behind
the 15-year-old civil war on the national agenda.
	   But President Chandrika Kumaratunga promised to restore normalcy
on taking office in 1995 and has been addressing problems of
everyday life. Increasingly adverse publicity around the world
about child sex in Sri Lanka also may have spurred the government
to act.
	   The Child Protection Authority has its own police officers,
lawyers and sweeping powers to investigate allegations of sexual
abuse, illegal adoption, use of children as domestic help and the
making of pornographic films using children.
	   The authority is headed by the country's president and includes
the deputy solicitor general, a deputy inspector general of police,
senior psychiatrists, pediatricians, experts on forensic medicine
and representatives of independent aid groups.
	   Agents of the authority have the power to enter any premises,
including hotels, where they have reason to believe child abuse is
taking place. Anyone obstructing the authority's work can be fined
1,000 rupees (dlrs 15) and jailed for six months.
	   ``Now we have more muscles and we are taking concrete steps,''
said O.K. Hemachandra, deputy inspector general of police.
	   With the new atmosphere, de Silva, the authority's chairman, is
attracting interest for a little noticed 1995 study he conducted
that indicated Sri Lanka's child sex problem isn't just with
foreign pedophiles.
	   De Silva surveyed 899 teen-age boys and found that much sexual
abuse begins at home.
	   ``It was an anonymous questionnaire and 18 percent of the boys
admitted having been sexually abused during childhood. And a
majority of them were abused by either a relative or a neighbor or
even by a priest,'' he said.
	   ``I am not saying that we do not have a problem with foreign
abusers. Indeed we have. But we need to set our own house in order
first.''
	   The government last year raised the maximum prison term for
having sex with a child to 20 years.
	   In August, a retired Sri Lankan soldier was sentenced to seven
years in prison and fined 1.2 million rupees (dlrs 18,000) for
taking nude pictures of his 6-year-old niece.
	   The judge ordered that the fine be paid to the victim as
compensation. The soldier also will have to spend an additional 12
years in jail if he fails to come up with money, a huge amount for
an army sergeant who earned 10,000 rupees (dlrs 150) a month.
	   Earlier this year, anti-child abuse campaigner Maureen
Seneviratne sent an investigator to the most popular beaches, where
the sight of young boys in the company of older tourists is common.
	   ``Most of the parents of the children know what is going on,''
said Chaminda Millawithanarachi, the investigator.
	   Millawithanarachi said parents are lured by the money a child
prostitute can earn.
	   ``In some cases parents themselves have sold their children. One
parent told us that they were not worried because their boys would
not get pregnant,'' the investigator said.
	   The Child Protection Authority plans to conduct a survey to
determine how many young Sri Lankans are involved in the sex trade.
A study 12 years ago estimated 36,000 young boys were in the sex
business in coastal districts, but De Silva and others fear the
number has increased.
	   Mrs. Seneviratne wants the authority to find a way to stop
foreign pedophiles from reaching Sri Lanka.
	   Tourists arriving at Sri Lanka's international airport are asked
only if they have enough money for their stay. Mrs. Seneviratne
said visitors should be much more closely supervised and
immigration authorities should maintain a dossier of known
pedophiles.
	   She contends the government has been reluctant to be stricter
with foreign visitors because it fears damaging a major economic
activity.
	   According to the government, 360,000 foreigners visited Sri
Lanka in 1997 and spent 14 billion Sri Lankan rupees (dlrs 225
million), a 50 percent increase over the 9.2 billion rupees (dlrs
148 million) spent the previous year. Tourism is the fourth largest
foreign exchange earner after textiles, tea and money sent home by
Sri Lankan expatriates.
	   Hemachandra, the police official, said the government is sincere
in promising a crackdown.
	   ``We know there are problems, but we are now determined to solve
them and get rid of this problem,'' he said.

Exposure to West prompts Poland's women to rethink roles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY304-305 &QL; 
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Her male colleagues read newspapers when
she first spoke at government meetings, so Industry Minister
Henryka Bochniarz decided she'd have to seize their attention.
	   She sharply criticized another Cabinet minister's talk, and the
men put their papers down, Bochniarz, now a business consultant and
president of the Polish Business Council, recalls with a smile.
	   With her short blonde hair, tailored pants suit and no-nonsense
gaze, Bochniarz represents a new breed of woman emerging in Poland
after decades of isolated communist rule.
	   Old customs and perceptions persist _ men still open doors for
women and kiss their hands _ but exposure to Western social
developments is beginning to challenge stereotypes in the home and
workplace.
	   ``It is not just about professionalism,'' Bochniarz says. ``It's
about state of mind.''
	   Today's Polish woman faces choices unheard of just 10 years ago,
when traditional roles of the pre-communist era _ the good mother
and strong woman behind her working, freedom-fighting man _ had
been skewed by communist principles of an inclusive working class.
	   Women worked alongside men in state-owned factories. Then they
returned home to the traditional jobs of fixing dinner, bathing the
kids and cleaning the house.
	   Now, more Polish women marry later, have fewer children, spend
most of their time away from home and generally assert their
independence.
	   ``There is no way back,'' says Krystyna Kofta, who meets with
women all over Poland to write articles for Twoj Styl (Your Style),
Poland's leading women's magazine. ``They want to break free. I can
see it. Even if mothers cannot do it now, their daughters will.''
	   Open borders since 1989 have given Poles a clear view West,
where they see women juggling family and career. And sweeping
reforms toward a market economy have meant shifting industries with
new opportunities.
	   Beata Stelmach began her career in 1991 when the Warsaw Stock
Exchange was created.
	   ``There were not many specialists. We all started from the same
level. Everybody was evaluated on merit. It was a chance for
everybody,'' says Stelmach, now spokeswoman for the government's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The new conditions didn't bring automatic change for women, says
Anna Achmatowicz, deputy editor in chief of Twoj Styl, which
started in 1990.
	   ``We had to make them realize their rights, that they don't have
to accept anything,'' she says.
	   The magazine's early stories explained ``everything from A to
Z,'' such as how to do self-examinations for breast cancer and how
to use the Internet, Achmatowicz says.
	   Advice also is coming from a growing array of international
women's magazines like Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and She, which
have started Polish-language editions.
	   ``We scream to them: You are great and you can do anything you
want,'' says Grazyna Olbrych, editor in chief of the Polish edition
of Cosmopolitan, which has been on the market since early 1997.
	   Not everyone likes the changes.
	   The Solidarity-led government, with strong links to the Roman
Catholic Church, wants to preserve the traditional model of large
families with women caring for the home and children.
	   Parliament is dithering over a proposed law on equal status of
sexes, which would allow women to sue employers for gender
discrimination. Women account for 61 percent of Poland's almost 1.7
million jobless adults.
	   The government also has resisted sex education programs for
teen-agers, and it cut subsidies for contraception pills that made
them cheaper. Instead, Family Issues Minister Kazimierz Kapera
proposed subsidizing Viagra ``to boost births in our homeland.''
	   A government report on families released in July condemned
modern women's magazines for promoting the ``model of individual
career instead of family culture which ... frustrates deeply Polish
women.''
	   Olbrych, the Cosmopolitan editor, responds: ``The main complaint
against us is: You tell women they should decide about
themselves.''
	   Some women have done just that. Since 1989, births have dropped
38 percent among urban women aged 20-24, while the marriage rate in
cities is down 22 percent, according to the government family
report.
	   The gap between men's and women's pay has narrowed from 35
percent in 1981-82 to 25 percent in the mid-1990s, says Henryk
Domanski, a professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences who has
studied the issue since 1992.
	   Leszek Wrobel, head of the Accord hiring agency in Warsaw, says
more women are seeking work.
	   ``They are better prepared each year. They look more
professional and know how to sell themselves,'' Wrobel says.
``Media show successful women who are well off and independent.
They have examples to follow.''
	   But stereotypes persist. The most popular television soap opera,
``Klan,'' portrays women in common roles _ the betrayed wife,
anguished mother searching for her son, inexperienced girl seduced
by a married man.
	   Kasia Uszak, a law school graduate who moved to Warsaw from
Szczecin to work for an investment firm last January, earns five
times what she did in Szczecin. But her new status makes little
impression back home.
	   ``Acquaintances say that I am already an old maid and that I aim
too high,'' she says. ``They say I should devote myself to husband
and kids, or at least to getting those.''

	   RUMBEK, Sudan (AP) _ His voice shaking with emotion, the former
teacher looked around at piles of rubble and recalled the days
before southern Sudan's 15-year-old war.
	   That heap used to be a school where children learned to read.
This was a church where a priest celebrated Mass. That hulk was the
hospital where doctors healed the sick.
	   ``This was a very beautiful town,'' said Nekemiah Ater Toric,
68.
	   He sat near a nunnery blown up by Sudanese government troops
before the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army captured Rumbek in
May 1997.
	   ``We are looking for anyone who can help us rebuild this town,
this country,'' Toric said.
	   He expectantly watched Roman Catholic Bishop John H. Ricard of
Pensacola, Florida, who is also president of the Baltimore-based
Catholic Relief Service and recently visited Sudan.
	   Eager for whatever help they can get, Toric and other rebel
officials treated Ricard like a celebrity.
	   The bishop came to inspect feeding centers run by Catholic
Relief Service for malnourished children and elderly people who
have no one to care for them.
	   But Paul Mayom Akech, the administrator of Rumbek county, had
more ambitious plans.
	   ``I'll first show you around, and then tell you what CRS can do
for us,'' Akech told the bishop and other Relief Service officials.
	   Bishop in tow, Akech displayed some of the damage from a war
that has claimed about 1.5 million lives.
	   ``All this devastation,'' Ricard said softly as he moved from
heap to heap. ``I'll see what we can do,'' he said repeatedly.
	   The people of southern Sudan, predominantly blacks who practice
Christianity or native religions, rebelled in 1983 against the
central government, which is dominated by the Muslim and Arabized
north. Since then, Rumbek has been ravaged by two major battles,
the last when the rebels chased out government troops in May 1997.
	   When the town's non-Muslim residents, who fled to the
countryside when the war started, returned, they found brush had
reclaimed the streets. Some red brick buildings still stood, but
most lacked roofs, windows, doors and plumbing.
	   A faded wall painting of Jesus and Mary holding a black woman's
hands stared forlornly at the ruins of the Roman Catholic church.
	   The high school, the first to be build in southern Sudan in
1948, survived because it had been used as a barracks and the
government troops left in a hurry, said Paul Deng, a rebel
commander. Abandoned artillery and mortar shells are stacked in an
unused classroom.
	   Although the hospital's buildings have roofs and some windows
and doors, there isn't a single piece of furniture, let alone
equipment and medicine.
	   ``The destruction was deliberate,'' Toric said. ``The enemy took
whatever he needed to build bunkers, and then blew up the
buildings.''
	   Rumbek, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Khartoum, the
national capital, is one of eight major southern towns captured by
the rebels last year.
	   When the rebels capture a town, they hand it over to civilian
administrators. But there is no economic activity and the officials
have no money. So they turn to private and United Nations agencies
for medical care, food and even agricultural tools.
	   Asked what his problems are, Akech, said simply: ``I have a very
long list of my difficulties. ... I have problems of rehabilitating
both the infrastructure and humans themselves.''
	   Priorities are reviving agriculture and educating children, he
said.
	   Beginning 1991, the rebels started to teach children in
makeshift classes held beneath shade trees in the countryside. They
used charcoal to practice writing the alphabet on goat hides, Toric
said. The 1,600 boys and girls now at Rumbek High School are a
product of those schools.
	   After driving to Mapuordit, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Rumbek on what was once a road but now no more than a
cattle track, Ricard celebrated Mass outdoors and prayed for peace.
	   ``The suffering of these people is severe and getting worse and
has been so prolonged that I believe strongly there is an
obligation for the international community to respond,'' Ricard
said.

Winning and losing in the Year of the Tiger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES J. HANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In the drowned villages of China and Central America, along the
stormy coasts of California and Peru, man met nature in 1998 and
came out a loser. It was, by one reckoning, the costliest year on
record for weather disasters.
	   But when it came to man vs. man in 1998, in the contest between
war and peace, right and wrong, mankind sometimes, in small ways,
looked like a winner.
	   That was the look on Good Friday in Belfast, when a new
beginning was found for Northern Ireland. It was the look one
midsummer midnight in Rome, when weary negotiators put the last
touches to a new global court for war crimes. And it was the look
after an October all-nighter beside Chesapeake Bay, where Israeli
and Palestinian nudged each other a few more steps down the road to
peace.
	   ``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste,'' Jordan's King Hussein said that day. ``... We are moving
in the right direction.''
	   The right direction _ in small ways, in some places. But in many
others in 1998, there seemed no limit to death and destruction.
	   One Friday in August, twin bombs struck at soft spots in
America's anti-terrorist armor, devastating U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, killing 224 people. Washington posted a dlrs 5
million reward for the alleged mastermind, Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden.
	   In the Balkans, in the eighth year of a bloody decade, it was
Kosovo's turn to bleed. Serbia went on the attack against Albanian
separatist guerrillas in that Serbian province, filling the forests
and hillsides with cowering refugees.
	   And in other sorrowful corners of the world, from Algeria to
Burundi to long-suffering Sri Lanka, the strife of religion or
``tribe'' tilted the balance once more, in 1998, against peace.
	   Death came, too, from man's failures in another arena, mastering
his own technology. Ninety-six people were killed in the crash of
Germany's fastest train, and 229 perished in the looping,
horrifying and unexplained plunge of a Swissair jetliner into the
chill sea off Nova Scotia.
	   The Year of the Tiger was to have been a year of ``optimism and
energy.'' But the forecast that mattered in 1998 came not from the
Chinese zodiac, but from the weatherman.
	   From the year's first days, severe storms spawned by the El Nino
phenomenon raked the eastern Pacific rim. In California, houses
slid down muddy hillsides and crops were total losses.
	   Peru was hardest hit. Floods and mudslides drove hundreds of
thousands of Peruvians from their homes and washed away vast swaths
of farmland. ``I'm waiting for the earth to open up and swallow
Peru. It's the only thing that hasn't happened,'' said one farmer.
	   Nature then shifted its fury to China.
	   Armies of sandbaggers could not hold back the Yangtze and other
flooded rivers as they inflicted catastrophic damage through the
summer: More than 5.6 million houses were destroyed and almost 64
million acres of land swamped, an area the size of Italy. More than
3,600 people were reported killed.
	   A deadlier event was still to come, halfway around the world,
where a hurricane dubbed Mitch meandered through the Caribbean and
finally settled over the Honduran coast, to sit and torment the
people of Central America with an unimaginable scourge of rain _ up
to 25 inches (62.5 centimeters) a day.
	   Swollen brown torrents flooded towns. Collapsing hillsides
engulfed villages. Bridges and highways vanished, and national
economies dissolved in the muddy runoff. More than 9,000 people
died.
	   ``In two days, we went backwards 50 years,'' lamented the
Honduran archbishop.
	   Even in Bangladesh, homeland of misfortune, 1998 was
extraordinary: Flooded rivers displaced one-quarter of its 124
million people. In India, a cyclone and tidal wave swept away up to
14,000 people, many of them destitute salt workers who lived _ and
died _ beside the Arabian Sea.
	   Weather-related disasters in 1998 caused at least dlrs 89
billion in economic losses worldwide, the Washington-based
Worldwatch Institute estimated. It was the most, by far, in two
decades of recordkeeping.
	   While weather afflicted the masses, climate troubled their
leaders.
	   Envoys from 160 nations, aware of projections that 1998 would be
the planet's warmest year on record, met in Argentina and took
further small steps toward carrying out a year-old accord to combat
global warming.
	   In other meetings in other conference halls, some of the
century's ``intractable'' problems grudgingly gave ground.
	   A negotiating marathon in Belfast produced ``a bloody miracle,''
in one participant's words, a deal to end decades of violence by
giving the Irish Republic a voice in governing Northern Ireland. In
Maryland, the bay-side Middle East talks, brokered by President
Bill Clinton, led to new Israeli withdrawals from Palestinian land.
	   But U.S. efforts elsewhere proved less satisfying. American
brinkmanship did force Iraq to back off, twice, in confrontations
over U.N. weapons inspections, and Serbia to pull back troops from
Kosovo. But both challenges seemed sure to flare anew in 1999.
	   And Washington stood by helplessly while the cap came off the
nuclear bottle, as first India, then Pakistan exploded test bombs
at secret desert sites, defying the U.S.-led nonproliferation
regime.
	   In other ways, however, 1998 was a year for cooperation _ for
building, brick by brick, structures for the next century.
	   In the U.S. Senate and elsewhere, NATO parliaments began giving
final approval to opening the alliance to Eastern Europe in 1999.
The European Union cleared the way for its new continental
currency, the euro, in the new year. And global powers teamed up,
through billions in new loans, to contain an economic crisis that
had impoverished millions, almost overnight, in East Asia and
Russia.
	   In Rome, the newly negotiated war crimes court was born with a
defect: The United States, wary of putting its soldiers under the
court's jurisdiction, refused to sign on. Kofi Annan, U.N.
secretary-general, hailed it nonetheless as a ``giant step
forward.''
	   For the human rights movement, the year was topped off with the
unexpected. A Spanish warrant alleging genocide and terrorism
snared the aged ex-dictator of Chile, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, as he
visited London. Depending on its outcome, the case could turn this
century's ``untouchables'' into wanted men in the next.
	   More of those untouchables fell in 1998, including one of the
most durable authoritarians, Indonesia's President Suharto, who
stepped down under the relentless pressure of economic collapse and
bloody rioting.
	   ``We don't know if this means democracy or freedom, but it means
change,'' said one happy Indonesian. ``And change is good.''
	   The right direction _ in small ways, in some places. Even, at
times, in the age-old contest of man and nature.
	   Some such steps were quiet _ when scientists, for example,
finally unlocked the genetic secrets of tuberculosis, one of the
great human killers.
	   And some were noisier _ like the blastoff of the first pieces of
the International Space Station, a 16-nation research platform that
should help define the coming age, and from whose lofty perch,
vintage 1998, man may someday look down and reflect: That had to be
a winning year.

More than 23,000 teachers strike for back wages in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 23,500 teachers in eastern Siberia and
northwestern Russia went on an indefinite strike Tuesday to demand
months of back wages.
	   About 100 of the striking teachers and parents of schoolchildren
picketed on railroad tracks in the northwestern region of Vologda,
prompting local authorities to send riot troops to the area, the
NTV television station reported. No violence was reported.
	   Around Vologda, 12,000 teachers at 443 schools and day care
centers went on strike, union officials said.
	   Vologda authorities said the government had given them no money
to pay back wages the teachers were demanding.
	   In the Siberian region of Buryatia, 11,500 teachers walked out
and classes were suspended at 245 schools, local officials told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The government has accumulated millions of dollars in wage debts
to state employees since the fall of the Soviet Union. Some workers
have taken desperate measures, including hunger strikes and
suicide, to protest their condition.

Thailand offers special visa to investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eager for cash from abroad to ease its
economic crisis, Thailand is offering a one-year visa to foreigners
who bring in 3 million baht (dlrs 83,000) in foreign currencies,
the government said Wednesday.
	   Long-term visas to Thailand are normally not easy to obtain.
Businessmen are issued with one-year renewable visas but must first
qualify for work permits.
	   A press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
applicants for the new visa will have to place the funds in a fixed
deposit at a government bank, purchase government bonds, buy a
condominium or invest in projects deemed beneficial to the country.

Leaders divided over economic crisis at Southeast Asian summit

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders have split over
how to battle the economic crisis, with some urging more open
markets to woo foreign investment and others defending the practice
of shielding their economies.
	   Despite claims of unity, the sixth annual summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations has opened with no clear
consensus on how to end the region's worst economic crisis in 50
years.
	   ASEAN foreign and economic ministers put together a list of
``bold measures'' such as tariff cuts and a free-trade area, and
the leaders were expected to endorse them at the two-day summit
that began Tuesday. But the plans failed to generate enthusiasm in
world markets.
	   Malaysia and Vietnam were at one end of the spectrum, warning of
the dangers of globalization, while Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines said it was inevitable and should be embraced.
	   As usual, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was the most
outspoken ASEAN leader, blaming world leaders for doing nothing
when ``predatory speculators'' set off the economic crisis in July
1997.
	   ``Instead of reining in the currency manipulators, they allowed
them to destroy the economic tigers in order to force them to seek
help and accept IMF-prescribed reforms,'' Mahathir said, referring
to the International Monetary Fund.
	   He called for currency and stock market controls like Malaysia
has imposed, saying: ``Until the international community agrees on
an international regime that will remove the kind of dangers we
have been exposed to, we will have to continue with our controls.''
	   Thailand's prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, urged members to
further integrate their economies with each other. ``We cannot stop
the process of globalization, but we can better prepare ourselves
to meet its challenges,'' Chuan said.
	   He emphasized that Thailand believes economic recovery is linked
to more democracy and respect for human rights.
	   That would not go over well in countries such as Vietnam, Laos
and Myanmar, which have been criticized for their human rights
records and have resisted any change in ASEAN's policy of
non-interference in members' internal affairs.
	   ``Globalization is an inevitable trend. It confers huge
benefits. But it also carries a price, particularly for countries
which are not ready for global competition,'' said Singapore's
prime minister, Goh Chok Tong.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada called for ASEAN to ``move
and move boldly'' on economic integration.
	   The Asian economic crisis has led to calls for affected
countries to open their markets more quickly. Vietnamese Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai said that creates both opportunities and
problems.
	   ``Rapid economic globalization is bringing about greater market
access and new partners for development, but also putting the
weaker economies in a more vulnerable and disadvantageous
position,'' Khai said.
	   Goh said ASEAN needs help from the international community to
deal with its economic problems.
	   ``Strictly speaking, it's beyond us,'' he said. ``ASEAN on its
own can't solve the problems.''
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

U.S. envoy warns Kosovo factions about playing with 'dynamite'

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke warned
Kosovo's warring factions that they were ``playing with dynamite''
Tuesday, a day after two shootouts left 42 people dead.
	   Arriving in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, Holbrooke said the
latest bloodshed ``will not in any way deter the international
community'' from working for peace in the region.
	   But later, after a five-hour Belgrade meeting with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, both Holbrooke and Christopher Hill,
the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily peace efforts,
acknowledged wide differences.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   Holbrooke brokered an Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians make up more than 90 percent of its 2
million residents, and most favor independence from Serbia.
	   The October deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought
time for diplomats to try to work out a political settlement for
Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke said NATO still has airstrike orders in place and
repeated that progress toward a peaceful settlement ``must be made
because we are concerned that the fighting may flare up.''
	   ``We want to tell all the people involved that they are playing
with dynamite,'' he said.
	   Before meeting Milosevic, Holbrooke said that ``progress, very
little, but progress'' had been made in trying to find a negotiated
solution.
	   ``The important thing to me is that both sides are engaged'' in
indirect negotiations through U.S. envoys, Holbrooke told
reporters.
	   Updating Monday's casualty count of 31, the Yugoslav army said
it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and wounded a dozen in a
five-hour gun battle near the border with Albania. The guerrillas
use Albania as a sanctuary and conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the area,
which has been sealed off by Yugoslav forces. Residents said the
army sent in armored vehicles and at least one helicopter and were
barring anyone from entering.
	   A peace monitor, who declined to be named, said the blockage
violated the two-month-old peace agreement.
	   Monitors who had hiked to the site Monday said they saw bodies,
all wearing camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred yards
of the border. They said they appeared to be Kosovo Liberation Army
rebels.
	   Later Monday, at least six Serbs, including five teen-agers,
were killed in the western Kosovo town of Pec when assailants
opened fire in a bar.
	   All Serb schools in Pec remained closed Tuesday to protest the
killings, which were blamed on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley assailed
the killings of both the ethnic Albanians and the Serb teen-agers.
	   ``We condemn in the strongest possible terms this wanton murder
of innocent civilians,'' he said. ``Actions like this can only lead
to a spiral of retribution that will make reaching a settlement for
the region all the more difficult.''
	   Kosovo Serbs demanded action against ``the terrorists'' and
urged a return of Serb security forces that partially withdrew from
the province following the U.S.-sponsored agreement, the state
Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent his condolences to the
families of Serb victims, saying, ``we will not hesitate to prevent
anyone from jeopardizing the peace and security of our citizens.''
	   Holbrooke also condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears that the fighting could worsen.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the
October agreement. That pact had sought to end the violence after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February
that killed hundreds and left an estimated 300,000 ethnic Albanians
homeless.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence
and Serbia refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo.
	   Chief rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said Tuesday that the rebels
are ``determined ... not to step back an inch'' from their demands
for an independent Kosovo.
	   He said ethnic Albanians are ``dissatisfied'' by the mediation
of Holbrooke and Hill because ``they are mostly passive
observers.''
	   ``The latest bloodshed in Kosovo is the best sign of the effects
of their work,'' Demaci said.

Strong earthquake hits southern Japan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.6 hit parts of southern Japan on Wednesday but
caused no injuries or damage, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   The quake was centered about 40 kilometers (25 miles) below the
ocean floor just off the southern coast of the island of Kyushu
some 900 kilometers (560 miles) southwest of Tokyo, the agency
said. It struck at 9:18 a.m. (0018 GMT).
	   There was no immediate danger of tsunami, or seismic waves
caused by undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity, resulting from
the temblor, the agency said.
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can damage homes if it occurs in a
residential area, while one of magnitude 6 can inflict widespread
damage in a populated area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
its sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Kelly declares innocence over Welsh FA loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's top soccer official has declared his
innocence over an alleged bribe scandal, quitting his job amid
suggestions that his chairman promised a loan to the Welsh Football
Association in order to gain a high-ranking FIFA position.
	   In a move that stunned English soccer, Graham Kelly resigned
after 10 years at the helm. Kelly made the move after the Football
Association's executive committee called for the resignation of
chairman Keith Wiseman.
	   Newspaper reports suggested that Wiseman unilaterally promised
the Football Association of Wales a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5.34
million) loan in order to gain its vote in a FIFA election.
	   The Mail on Sunday carried a report last month saying that
Wiseman had unilaterally pledged a loan to the Welsh FA and failed
to provide satisfactory explanations to the executive committee.
	   According to the paper, the move came shortly after he had
received the Welsh FA's backing to help his nomination as a FIFA
vice-president.
	   The FA scandal comes at a time when bribery allegations are rife
in Olympic circles. International Olympic Committee executive board
member Marc Hodler has alleged the practice of buying and selling
of votes in the election of host cities.
	   But Kelly issued a statement saying his resignation was purely
because he was unable to convince the executive committee of the
reason for the loan to the Welsh FA.
	   ``We had an issue where we couldn't take the executive committee
with us, notwithstanding that we'd acted entirely in the best
interests of the FA throughout and tried to do what was best for
the FA in every respect,'' he said.
	   ``We weren't able to convince our executive of that and the end
result is that I've resigned on agreed terms. I'm not embarrassed
but it's certainly a very big disappointment for me personally.''
	   The resignation announcement came from FA spokesman David Davies
after a meeting of the FA executive committee at its headquarters
at Lancaster Gate in west London.
	   ``The FA's executive committee met today to discuss the
positions of our chairman and chief executive,'' Davies said.
	   ``This followed contacts over recent months with the Football
Association of Wales and the actions in that connection of Keith
Wiseman and Graham Kelly.
	   ``The executive committee has this afternoon accepted the
resignation of Graham Kelly. They have thanked him for his 10 years
of dedicated work at Lancaster Gate and wished him well for the
future.
	   ``They have also passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the
chairman Keith Wiseman,'' Davies said. ``He was informed of this
personally by the vice-chairman, Geoff Thompson. He has declined to
resign.
	   ``The executive will seek endorsement for their action at a
special FA council meeting in early January. This vote of no
confidence, I stress, was taken unanimously by an executive
committee that represents all sections of the game.
	   ``It was taken with sadness and only after considerable
examination of all the circumstances, it was not taken lightly.
	   ``Contrary to some unfair speculation it wasn't part of any
personal campaign against any individual.'' Davies said. ``Such an
outcome has been painful for all those involved in taking the
decision.''
	   Davies then read out a statement from Wiseman.
	   ``The issue is one for the full Football Association Council,''
he said.
	   ``I do not intend to make any comment at all until I have shared
the full circumstances of this matter with them all _ save that the
version of events carried hitherto in the national press is a gross
distortion of the truth.''
	   At the time of the Mail on Sunday story, Wiseman said he always
acted ``in the interests of the FA.''
	   ``There is nothing wrong or unusual in helping smaller
footballing nations _ be they close neighbors or those further
afield _ in financial and other ways with their development plans
and youth programs,'' he said.
	   Welsh FA president John Hughes said there was ``nothing
sinister'' in the English FA's offer of financial help.
	   ``All that money was to go to charity, the Welsh football trust,
to help promote and develop our youth and women's football in
Wales,'' he said. ``There was nothing sinister in it and it
certainly had nothing to do with the senior side.
	   ``What has happened has upset me and I am quite shocked at the
news of Graham's resignation because he is a great friend. The FA
have lost a good man.''
	   Davies said the executive committee decided that he would take
over Kelly's position for the time being and that Thompson would
take Wiseman's position, pending the FA Council meeting.
	   ``It is the wish of the executive committee that the
vice-chairman Geoff Thompson should lead the FA in the immediate
future,'' Davies said.
	   ``They have also asked me to become executive director in
overall charge of everyday running of the FA for the time being. I
do so in the confidence that I have the backing of the staff.''

U.S. envoys acknowlege yawning gap between Serbs and Albanians

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging
a huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic Albanians on the
future of the province in the wake of violence that marred an
informal peace deal and left 42 people dead.
	   After a late-night meeting Tuesday with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, both senior envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts
to broker a peace, appeared pessimistic.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the sealed-off
border area. Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles
and at least one helicopter into the region.
	   International monitors said they saw 31 bodies, all wearing
camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters (yards) of
the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings on the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Tuesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appaling beyond words.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bosnia's top international mediator
appealed Tuesday for economic reform to help the struggling Balkan
nation wean itself from foreign aid.
	   Opening a two-day conference to review the Dayton accord that
ended the war in December 1995, Bosnia's top international mediator
Carlos Westendorp also said the international community would push
to help thousands of refugees and displaced persons return to their
homes in 1999.
	   Westendorp, who has sweeping powers over Bosnia's authorities
under the Dayton peace agreement, said the biggest hurdle to
stability is the economy.
	   ``The economy limps along. Bosnia is not yet an attractive place
for foreign investors,'' Westendorp told the third annual meeting
of the Peace Implementation Council. ``We have to change all that
if the economy is ever to act as the dynamo for growth able to
create the jobs that are so desperately needed.''
	   Westendorp said the billions of dollars in western aid Bosnia
depends on will soon end. He also urged stepping up the fight
against corruption and fraud.
	   The council includes representatives from some 40 countries. It
will issue a declaration Wednesday setting out steps aimed at
furthering post-war reconstruction in Bosnia.

Austrian tourist dies in extreme temperatures in Outback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ An Austrian tourist died but her
boyfriend survived an eight-day ordeal in scorching temperatures
after their campervan became stuck in sand dunes near a remote lake
in the Australian Outback, police said Wednesday.
	   The pair, in their mid-20s, started walking in temperatures of
over 122 F (50 C) to find help after the hired van became stuck on
Dec. 7 near Lake Eyre, about 435 miles (700 kms) north of Adelaide,
capital of South Australia state.
	   After two days walking the man felt ill and returned to the van
_ a decision which saved his life, police said.
	   But the woman, 28, continued on. Her body was found Tuesday by a
tourist 19 miles (30 kms) from the lake. She had apparently died of
heat exhaustion.
	   Police were alerted and later found the man alive in the
campervan, which was stuck in sand dunes near the Halligan Bay
campsite.
	   The man survived by drinking water from the van's 400-liter
(105-gallon) water tank.
	   Lake Eyre is a huge saltwater lake in the center of the state. A
tourist attraction, it lies in one of the country's most remote and
arid regions and rarely contains water.
	   The pair had been trying to reach the Oodnadatta Track, a former
camel-train trail which is now used by tourists.
	   Police said the man was in good physical condition, recovering
at the nearby township of William Creek.
	   The names of the pair were not released.
	   Helen Anderson from the William Creek Hotel said the man was
extremely distressed after learning of his girlfriend's death.
	   ``He is fine physically, he stayed with the car and the girl
kept walking, he tried to get her to go back but she wouldn't go
back,'' she said.
	   Hotel owner Mal Anderson told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio the woman had continued walking because she was the stronger
of the two.
	   ``She apparently had been a walker of some kind and was a lot
stronger than he was physically for walking and he decided he would
go back,'' Anderson said.
	   Police Senior Constable Tony Feltus said temperatures in the
region last week would have reached the mid-50s C (130 F).
	   He said many foreign tourists underestimated the dangers of the
Outback.
	   ``(The heat) can be very dehydrating very quickly and people
don't realize that,'' he said.
	   ``There's a lot of European tourists go through that area at all
times of the year.
	   ``But I think people in their own country should take some
responsibility and warn them a little bit more of the dangers they
can get themselves into in these isolated areas,'' he said.

Report: Pope says church in Australia should maintain doctrine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has warned Australian
bishops not to let an ``Australian sense of equality'' to degrade
the authority of parish priests or key Catholic ceremonies such as
confession, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   In a statement stemming from meetings of the Synod for Oceania
in Rome, the pope referred to ``weaknesses in'' and ``concerns
about'' the church in Australia, telling bishops not to tolerate
``error in matters of doctrine and morals or church discipline,''
The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
	   ``The Australian sense of equality must not be used as an excuse
for stripping the parish priest of the authority and duties that
pertain to his office, making it appear that the ministerial
priesthood is less essential to the local church community,'' the
statement said.
	   The paper reported that the statement said Catholics must be
reminded of the absolute importance of individual confession, their
priests should be encouraged to say the rosary and religious
brothers and sisters should be urged to return to monastic forms of
life and work.
	   The pope praised the ``profound strengths of the Catholic
community in Australia . . . in the midst of often disconcerting
change.''
	   But he deplored the use of the media ``as a kind of stratagem to
force the church into changes she cannot make.''
	   He said priests must exercise ``renewed vigilance'' on matters
of liturgical and sacramental practice so that innovations do not
depart from ``authentic tradition.''

South Korean scientists claim success in cloning human cells
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean medical team claims it
has succeeded in what it called the world's second cloning of human
cells.
	   The team, led by Lee Bo-yeon, a professor at Seoul's Kyunghee
University Hospital, said it cultivated a four-cell embryo by
removing a nucleus from a woman's ovum and inserting one from one
of her body cells.
	   But the scientists did not implant the embryo into a woman's
womb because the procedure is banned by a resolution adopted by
South Korean medical scientists in 1993, the team said.
	   ``The cloning of human embryos should be encouraged for
scientific research to create replacement hearts and other organs.
It will eventually help human beings,'' Lee said Tuesday.
	   A team of British researchers previously succeeded in a similar
experiment, the South Korean scientists said.
	   But no scientists in Britain are known to have successfully
cloned a human cell. Britain has laws banning research into human
reproductive cloning.
	   The Roslin Institute and the Center for Genome Research, both in
Edinburgh, have each expressed an interest in cloning human cells,
but it has not been achieved, or attempted, since no license has
been granted for such research.
	   Following the announcement by the South Korean scientists, about
two dozen religious and civic activists held a rally in front of
Kyunghee Hospital, shouting for discontinuation of the ``inhuman
research.''
	   One protest sign read: ``Who am I? I don't want to be a cloned
human being.''
	   The announcement comes as South Korea's Parliament is pushing
legislation banning cloning of human cells except for research on
cancer or other disease.

Uproar over Clinton comparison of prisoners, terror victims
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was meant as a reconciliatory moment: a
husky-voiced President Bill Clinton describing ``profoundly
emotional'' meetings with Palestinian children with fathers in
Israeli jails and Israeli children whose fathers were killed in the
conflict with Palestinians.
	   Instead, the comment touched a raw nerve in Israel, triggering
an outcry over what was perceived as too close a parallel drawn
between the sufferings of Israeli terror victims and Palestinian
attackers.
	   The uproar, which clearly caught the Americans by surprise,
illustrates how even someone who knows the Mideast minefield as
well as Clinton does can easily make a misstep.
	   On both sides, certain topics _ and the code words for them _
are so emotionally freighted that the simplest and most
well-meaning observation can ignite a firestorm.
	   ``I thought it was a very powerful way of making a point that
people here have suffered on both sides,'' Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, told reporters in response to the
Israeli criticism.
	   The incident occurred as Clinton appealed for Israel and the
Palestinians to press ahead with the land-for-security accord
signed Oct. 23 in Washington.
	   Addressing a historic session of the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile in Gaza City on Monday, he described separate
meetings with Palestinian children whose fathers were imprisoned
for anti-Israel activity and Israeli youngsters whose fathers had
been killed.
	   ``Those children brought tears to my eyes,'' Clinton said, his
voice nearly cracking. ``We have to find a way for both sets of
children to get their lives back and to go forward.''
	   Within hours, Israelis from across the political spectrum were
voicing objections. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assessment
_ though subdued compared to his broadsides of recent days _ was
nonetheless a rebuke.
	   ``I don't know what the president meant by it, but it came out
as though there's a comparison between the suffering of the
children of the murderers and the children of those who were
murdered,'' the prime minister said at a news conference.
	   Even former prime minister Shimon Peres, a strong supporter of
Clinton and the peace process, said the president had ``slipped up.
... He made a mistake in the comparison.''
	   Press commentary reflected the widely held Israeli view that
outsiders simply do not understand what it is like to live in a
country burdened by the daily threat of suicide bombings and other
attacks aimed at civilians.
	   Clinton's ``equation of children whose parents are in Israeli
prisons and children who lost their parents in acts of terror is
unjust,'' commentator Nahum Barnea, whose son died in a bus bombing
nearly three years ago, wrote in Tuesday's editions of the Yediot
daily. ``Clinton is too intelligent not to know that not all tears
are equal.''
	   Outside Clinton's hotel, relatives of the victims of Palestinian
attacks staged a protest Tuesday to denounce the remarks. West Bank
settler Yoel Tzur, whose wife and son were killed in a shooting
near the town of Ramallah two years ago, said the comparison
reflected a ``lack of balance.''
	   In talking about how the Israeli and Palestinian children
affected him, Clinton might have thought he was making a point
about common experience that few would quarrel with _ especially
his conclusion that ``neither side has a monopoly on pain or
virtue.''
	   In fact, throughout decades of conflict, both Israel and the
Palestinians have always resisted acknowledging the other's
suffering. Many Palestinians speak slightingly of the Holocaust;
Israel this year celebrated the 50th anniversary of its
independence with little mention that their new state spawned
hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees.
	   Some Israeli anger over Clinton's comments stemmed from the fact
that at least two of the imprisoned Palestinians with whose
children Clinton met were jailed for killing Israelis. Israel
opposes releasing any Palestinian prisoners with ``blood on their
hands,'' in Netanyahu's words.
	   For their part, the Palestinians see anyone jailed in the
struggle against the 30-year Israeli military occupation _ even
those who carried out killings _ as a fighter for the national
cause, not a criminal. Hardly a Palestinian family has not had a
relative jailed at some point during the Israeli occupation.

Stocks moderately higher in early trading, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rose in early trading Wednesday
following an overnight gain on Wall Street, while the U.S. dollar
was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 66.41 points,
or 0.47 percent, to 14,077.60 after the first hour of morning
trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei lost 100.43 points, or 0.71
percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.74 yen, down 0.84 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo but above its late New York level of 116.35 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, prices were higher with players encouraged
by the overnight gains in New York stocks.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 127.70 points, closing at
8,823.30.
	   More talk of tax cuts in Japan also improved market sentiment in
Tokyo, traders said.
	   The tax panel of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is to
propose more than 9 trillion yen (dlrs 77 billion) in tax cuts and
deductions, Kyodo News agency reported Tuesday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.84 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,093.11. The
TOPIX shed 11.04 points, or 1.00 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher than its levels in
late New York trading overnight following slower-than-expected
growth in Japan's October current account surplus, traders said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Japan's Finance Ministry announced that the
nation's current account surplus rose by 21.5 percent in October
from a year earlier to 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion).
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast on average
a surplus of 1.491 trillion yen (dlrs 12.8 billion).
	   Signs of a slowdown in the growth of Japan's external surpluses
are supportive for the dollar, as they allay concerns about trade
friction.
	   But market attention was mostly focused on pending impeachment
proceedings against President Bill Clinton, keeping the dollar from
rising further, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.300 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.260 percent, driving its price down to 104.22 yen from 104.57
yen.

Netanyahu hangs tough, but may not have impressed hard-liners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace
process forward has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered
the Palestinians _ and might not be enough to save his government
from collapse next week.
	   The Israeli prime minister refused Tuesday to stick to the
timetable for West Bank troop withdrawals outlined in the agreement
Clinton brokered at Wye River, Maryland, in October. The inertia
ended a three-day visit by Clinton on a low note.
	   Clinton had hoped that his visit would move Netanyahu to back
down from his freeze on the process _ especially after the
Palestine National Council met an Israeli demand and formally
renounced clauses in its charter that call for Israel's
destruction.
	   Netanyahu approved of the renunciation, but said he would not
move forward until the Palestinians meet six other demands. The
next withdrawal from territory was due Friday, according to Wye.
	   A prisoner release _ a highly emotional issue for Palestinians _
is also due Friday, but Netanyahu showed no sign of going ahead
with that either.
	   The prime minister is trying to shore up support from
hard-liners in his coalition who have threatened to vote against
the government in a no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   Despite his best efforts, his government is still shaky, with
some hard-liners in his coalition saying they will bolt on Monday.
	   Michael Kleiner said in a statement that Netanyahu's approval of
the PNC meeting infuriated him.
	   ``The fact that the prime minister is accepting this farce, is
only strengthening (Kleiner's) view that he has to act to bring
down the government,'' Kleiner's office said.
	   Hard-liners faulted Netanyahu for his part in initiating the PNC
meeting because it provided Clinton with an opportunity to visit
the Palestinian-held territories _ and hint at U.S. approval for
Palestinian aspirations to statehood.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, caucus chairman of the opposition Labor Party,
on Tuesday smelled victory.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor. There are 120
legislators in the Knesset.
	   Goldschmidt's boss, Ehud Barak, was already planning for an
election, and had flown in top U.S. political consultants to help
him, including James Carville.
	   ``I wouldn't have come this far if I didn't think he wouldn't
win,'' said Carville, who helped Clinton to two victories. ``I
didn't take a flight this far to lose.''
	   Clinton appeared frustrated with the Israeli prime minister's
apparent obsession with domestic worries. The president chatted
with Netanyahu for a few minutes on the tarmac Tuesday evening
before boarding Air Force One for its return flight to the United
States.
	   The Palestinians said Netanyahu was showing bad faith.
	   ``We're worried that the Israelis are trying to find excuses so
as not to implement the agreement,'' said top Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Compounding Netanyahu's woes, his finance minister, Yaacov
Neeman, has reportedly quit, according to an Israel TV report.
	   In what may have been a snowball effect, Netanyahu's defense
minister Yitzhak Mordechai _ known to support going ahead with Wye
_ said he would have his own announcement to make Friday. He did
not elaborate.
	   If Mordechai and others in Netanyahu's coalition who support the
peace process bolted, that would leave Netanyahu shorn of his left
and right wings by Monday's vote.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be unshaken.
	   ``We will go to the people if necessary,'' he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``I don't fear elections.''

Mitchell exonerated of doping violation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. Olympic track star Dennis Mitchell did not
commit a doping violation, a three-member panel unanimously agreed.
	   The USA Track and Field Doping Hearing Board's decision was
announced Tuesday. It had held a two-day hearing last week.
	   Mitchell had been suspended by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) in July after the world body concluded
Mitchell's urine sample from an out-of-competition test in April
had high testosterone and epitestosterone levels.
	   A member of the gold medal-winning 400-meter relay team and
bronze medalist in the 100 in the 1992 Olympics, Mitchell has been
the chairman of the Athletes Advisory Committee of USA Track and
Field for the last two years.
	   Under its rules, the IAAF may review the decision of the Doping
Hearing Board panel.
	   Neither Mitchell nor his lawyer could be reached for comment.
	   Reached by telephone, his mother, Lenora Mitchell, said:
``Because of all the legalities, we have been advised not to make
any comment.''
	   ``I have done nothing wrong, but I am not being permitted to
compete,'' Mitchell said in August. ``I will now proceed through
the hearing process. I can only hope that justice will prevail and
I will be rightfully exonerated.''
	   Mitchell, 32, was given a two-year suspension by the IAAF for
testing positive for testosterone in an out-of-competition test
April 1 at his home in Gainesville, Fla.
	   Mitchell called the suspension ``the darkest hour of my life.''
	   ``My dedication to this sport and to society would not and could
not allow me to do such a thing,'' Mitchell said. ``This is both
morally and ethically unacceptable to me. I would have never in my
wildest dreams thought this would happen to me.''
	   As the president of the USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee, the
athletes' voice in the national governing body, Mitchell has been
an outspoken advocate of keeping drugs out of the sport.
	   ``Overnight that has been taken away from me,'' Mitchell said.
``The things that have happened to me in the last few months will
forever affect all parts of my life. This can never be taken
away.''
	   Suja Thomas, Mitchell's lawyer, said Mitchell's appeal would
question the validity of the test on two grounds.
	   ``Experts will look at whether or not the test itself was
correct,'' Suja Thomas, Mitchell's lawyer, said in announcing the
athlete's appeal. ``And, two, if the test was correct, what could
have caused the testosterone to epitestosterone level to increase''
above the allowable ratio of 6:1.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's largest airline said Tuesday it
will suspend flights to the Falkland Islands beginning March 31 to
protest the detention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Britain.
	   In a brief communique, LanChile said the privately owned company
will heed the government's request to suspend all operations to the
South Atlantic archipelago.
	   Last Friday, the Chilean government announced a series of
reprisals against Britain in response to the former dictator's
detention, including a request that private airlines suspend
flights to the Falkland Islands.
	   Not all companies have complied. DAP, a small regional airline
based in Punta Arenas, will continue to fly its charter planes to
Mount Pleasant.
	   Pinochet has been in police custody in London since Oct. 16. He
is fighting extradition to Spain, where he faces charges of murder
and torture during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The government of
Chiapas state proposed Tuesday that armed pro-government vigilante
groups be allowed to turn in their weapons in exchange for food,
tools and pardons for weapons convictions.
	   The proposal, presented by Gov. Roberto Albores to the state
congress, is the first attempt to disarm the vigilantes since one
such group was implicated in the massacre of 45 Indian villagers in
Chiapas nearly a year ago.
	   The government has faced criticism over failing to act against
its armed supporters in Chiapas, especially in the wake of the 1997
killings, known as the Acteal massacre after the Chiapas hamlet
where unarmed supporters of the leftist Zapatista rebels were
gunned down.
	   The proposed law would pardon vigilantes and paramilitary group
members in prison or awaiting trial on weapons charges, if the
groups they belong to turn in their weapons within 90 days of the
law's passage.
	   However, the amnesty would not apply to other charges, such as
those pending against suspects arrested in the Dec. 22, 1997,
Acteal massacre.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund released
the first installment of a dlrs 41.5 billion economic aid package
Tuesday, the Brazilian Central Bank said.
	   The IMF deposited dlrs 4.79 billion in a special account at the
Federal Reserve Bank in New York, and the money is expected to stay
in the Brazilian government's account there. Although it will not
physically enter the country, it will be incorporated into Brazil's
foreign reserves.
	   The aid package, led by the IMF and announced Nov. 13, is aimed
at restoring investor confidence in Brazil and shoring up the
country's ailing economy. The funds will be available for Brazil to
draw on as deemed necessary, the Central Bank said.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Venezuela's President-elect Hugo Chavez
told Brazil's president Tuesday that his country wants to join the
Southern Cone common market, known as Mercosur.
	   The Mercosur trading bloc is made up of Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Argentina. Chile and Bolivia are associate members.
	   Chavez said he and Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
spoke about developing projects to improve navigation on the
Orinoco and Amazon rivers and the possibility of creating a new oil
company that would be jointly owned by Brazil and Venezuela.
	   ``We also spoke about the necessity of creating new economic
models for our people not based on communism or savage
neo-liberalism,'' said Chavez, without elaborating.
	   Chavez arrived Tuesday in Brazil. On Wednesday, he leaves for
Buenos Aires, where he will meet with Argentine President Carlos
Menem.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan oil prices that hit a
12-year low last week probably will remain low for the next several
years, Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said Tuesday.
	   Arrieta told reporters he expects the price of Venezuelan oil to
average dlrs 10 to dlrs 10.50 per barrel during the next three to
five years. Last week, it hit dlrs 7.66 a barrel, barely half the
average price in 1997.
	   Arrieta said prices probably will stay low partly because
worldwide oil inventories have grown to 8 billion barrels,
according to estimates by state oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela.
	   Venezuela is the No. 1 foreign supplier of oil to the United
States. Arrieta and oil ministers from Mexico and Saudi Arabia are
scheduled to meet Thursday in Madrid to discuss the worldwide slide
in prices.

White House nervous that House vote is beyond Clinton's reach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton was an ocean away from
the impeachment debate when the tide began to turn against him.
	   He was in Israel, the Gaza Strip, and, finally, aboard Air Force
One when a wave of Republican moderates announced they would vote
to impeach him. ``I wish he had stayed behind to wage this battle
himself,'' former White House counsel Lanny Davis lamented.
	   White House aides haven't given up, but they know the president
is in trouble. The ranks of pro-impeachment Republicans have
exploded since he left for the Middle East, leaving precious few
Republican lawmakers still undecided when he returned Tuesday
night.
	   If he had stayed home, some supporters said, he would have been
in a better position to influence the public and private debate.
	   Yet top White House officials argue the trip didn't matter.
There is little he could have done; so much is out of his hands.
	   For weeks, the president's advisers have tried without success
to find the key to peeling moderate Republicans away from the firm
embrace of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay. They floated the notion
of a stiff fine, a toughly worded censure and had the president's
lawyer say their boss may have ``crossed the line'' and lied under
oath.
	   Clinton himself offered to accept ``censure and rebuke'' and
said he agreed with his lawyer's remarks. Aides talked about a
dramatic congressional address. Maybe a statement by Hillary Rodham
Clinton. A White House meeting between moderates and Clinton may
still be in order.
	   So far, nothing has been good enough. Many Republicans say
Clinton must confess to perjury. Clinton says he won't confess to a
crime he doesn't believe he committed, and his political advisers
don't think it would win votes anyhow.
	   ``They're just baiting him. They just keep raising the bar every
time he offers something new,'' said Harold Ickes, a former White
House aide still advising Clinton.
	   Though there is still room for compromise, some advisers began
preparing for a Senate showdown _ resigned to impeachment in the
House. Many Democrats say they are finding some solace in the
belief that Republicans will pay for their actions in the 2000
election cycle.
	   ``This is not smart nor is it good for the country,'' Democratic
Party chairman Roy Romer said. He points to polls showing an
overwhelming percentage of Americans don't support impeachment or
the president's removal from office.
	   Mark Penn, the president's favorite pollster, said, ``I think
you're seeing the question fairly put: Why would you take the
country through something that country doesn't want to go
through?''
	   The answers, say Republicans, include:
	   _Republican lawmakers are gambling that voters will not care
about impeachment in 2000. ``Two years is an eternity,'' says
Republican consultant Ralph Reed.
	   _Republican lawmakers believe it would be a bigger risk to
assume their hard-line conservative base will forgive or forget if
they show Clinton mercy. Consultant Ed Gillespie said all voters
have long memories ``but our base voters _ their memories are
longer.''
	   Democrats promise to portray Republicans as ideological
extremists two years from now. ``They are captive to their right,''
Romer said. And even Reed said the biggest risk with this week's
vote is that Republicans ``will be identified in the minds of the
public with impeachment.''
	   _Impeachment is a proper punishment. ``The only risk in this
situation is for any politician to not do what he or she thinks is
right,'' said Ron Kaufman, a prominent Republican National
Committeeman from Massachusetts.
	   A growing number of Republican lawmakers seem to view
impeachment as sort of a souped-up censure: Brand him with
history's blemish, knowing that few think the Senate would convict
and remove the president from office.
	   Rep. Tom Campbell, who sided with his party leaders Tuesday,
called impeachment ``the most serious censure of which the House is
constitutionally capable.''
	   However, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, seemed to suggest nobody should
assume the saga would end with the president's impeachment. ``I
know of hardly any of my colleagues in the Senate who have said how
they will vote,'' Lieberman said.
	   It was a warning that may have been aimed at Republicans as much
as Clinton.

Japan announces extra dlrs 5 billion for Asian countries

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
announced Wednesday 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in new
low-interest loans to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their
devastated economies.
	   The loans, for projects such as roads, bridges, power stations
and airports, also will help Japan's sagging economy because the
contractors must be Japanese companies.
	   The money will go to ``countries of Asia who are doing their
utmost to reform their economic structures,'' Obuchi said.
	   It will be disbursed over three years and will be repayable in
40 years at an interest rate of 1 percent, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
	   The new loans were announced in speech delivered by Obuchi
during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. Japanese officials clearly hoped the speech would display
Japanese leadership in efforts to overcome the region's economic
crisis.
	   Other than money, however, Obuchi announced few new initiatives.
	   Japan has provided far more than other countries in assistance
to affected Asian countries _ a total of dlrs 44 billion to date.
	   It also has created a dlrs 30 billion fund unveiled by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in October for six Asian countries _
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea.
	   No specific projects have yet been announced for loans from the
Miyazawa Plan. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman said loans for
Thailand and Malaysia _ the first under the plan _ would be
announced later Wednesday.
	   Obuchi said Japan also will contribute 500 million yen (dlrs 4.2
million) to establish a new fund under the auspices of the United
Nations to support international organizations dealing with
problems such as environmental degradation, narcotics and organized
crime.
	   Instead of being praised for its largesse, however, Japan has
been frequently accused of dragging the region down economically by
failing to deal promptly with its own economic problems.
	   Obuchi acknowledged that Japan's recovery is vital for growth in
the region, but added that Asia's economic turnaround also is
important for Japan's recovery.
	   He said Japan also has been doing its utmost to be a driving
force for Asia's recovery, despite its economic problems.
	   ``I am confident that the Japanese economy will surely recover
and once again vigorously lead the Asian economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The prime minister stressed that dialogue and cooperation
between Japan and other Asian countries is vital to overcome the
economic crisis in the region. He proposed that Japan, China and
South Korea, as the three major countries in Northeast Asia,
increase their dialogue, with the goal of eventually forming a
``trilateral network.''
	   Obuchi is also scheduled to meet with leaders from Vietnam,
China, South Korea and Cambodia during his four-day trip.
	   He will travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he is to
visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Pinochet arrest backfires in highest court with charges of bias
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Court resumes 1030 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers acting for Gen. Augusto Pinochet are
arguing in Britain's highest court that a ruling against the former
Chilean dictator by a judge with strong ties to Amnesty
International looks bad _ at best.
	   At worst, Pinochet's lawyers say, Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann
was biased.
	   Lawyers for Spain counter that Pinochet's lawyers have reached a
try-anything stage by seeking to get the highest court in the land,
the House of Lords, to nullify its 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 that the
83-year-general has no immunity from arrest under British law.
	   Spain wants to extradite Pinochet to face charges of murder and
torture during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Pinochet's lawyers could have complained during the initial
hearing because they knew _ or should have known _ that Hoffmann
heads Amnesty's fundraising arm and that his wife has worked for
the human rights organization since 1977, said Alun Jones, the main
lawyer for Spain.
	   ``This petition is an abuse of the process of your lordships'
House,'' Jones said Tuesday, before a different five-judge tribunal
in the Lords. The hearing was expected to conclude Wednesday.
	   Pinochet's lawyers returned to the Lords after failing to
persuade the British Cabinet member with the final say on
extradition, Home Secretary Jack Straw, that Hoffmann was biased.
	   Straw ruled Dec. 9 that Spain can start extradition proceedings.
	   The process could take months as Pinochet, under police guard in
a rented mansion 20 miles (30 kms) west of London, fights every
legal step.
	   A regular visitor to Britain, he was arrested in a London
hospital Oct. 16 after back surgery.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were killed by
secret police after Pinochet overthrew an elected Marxist _ and
Amnesty contends that every nation has a duty to try to get him put
on trial.
	   Amnesty ``is a protagonist ... deeply opposed to any principle
of law that would grant him immunity,'' Clare Montgomery,
Pinochet's lawyer, said.
	   Amnesty has said that the Hoffmanns, opponents of apartheid who
left South Africa in the 60s, did not take part in its 25-year
campaign to get Pinochet brought to trial.
	   One argument in the current Lords hearing is that lawyers should
have known about Hoffmann's role with Amnesty.
	   In February, the head of the judiciary, Lord Irvine, sent a
letter to firms of attorneys and advocates in England endorsing an
Amnesty building fund appeal by Hoffmann, described as head of
Amnesty International Charity.
	   Kingsley Napley, Pinochet's London firm of attorneys, pledged
1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,600) but apparently made no connection when
Hoffmann was picked for the Pinochet tribunal _ where Amnesty
lawyers were allowed to argue the case against their client.

Anwar's old school friends turn up at trial to show solidarity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hoping to boost the spirits of an
old school chum, classmates of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim lined up Wednesday outside the court trying him on
sex and corruption charges.
	   Wearing the burgundy red with yellow, black and white striped
ties of their prestigious alma mater, Malay College, many of
Anwar's friends said they did not believe the sensational charges
against him.
	   ``We know the boys who played truant, who sneaked out to the
cinema and did unsavory things. Today they are still like that,''
said Raja Puteri, who has known Anwar for 35 years.
	   ``But Anwar was very religious. He was strict and he did not
like dirty jokes,'' said Raja, smoking a pipe outside the
courthouse.
	   The Malay College old boys network is a virtual who's who of
modern Malaysia. The prestigious school has produced some of the
nation's top diplomats, businessmen and many chief ministers.
	   Even Malaysia's present king is a product of the school, which
is located in the northern town of Kuala Kangsar.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in September,
faces abuse of power charges and will be tried separately for
allegedly having engaged in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   He has denied all the accusations against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Mahathir's
17-year-rule.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors provided startling new evidence and a
senior police official testified that his men had tried to
photograph Anwar's private parts in jail.
	   Anwar's lawyers rejected ``my request to conduct a thorough
examination of his private parts, and to have pictures taken of his
genitalia,'' Musa Hassan, the officer who investigated charges
against Anwar told the court.
	   The court was also told that police obtained a blood sample from
Anwar to test whether he was HIV positive. And without Anwar's
consent, the sample was analyzed as part of a DNA test of a
fingerprint.
	   Prosecutors also produced a gray mattress that police said had
semen stains from Anwar's alleged illegal sexual acts. They are
trying to prove that he had sex with the wife of his former
secretary and that he also tried to abuse his powers as deputy
prime minister to cover up sexual trysts.
	   The prosecution's case is based on accusations by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar,
a former driver in the politician's household.
	   While Ummi has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife, Shamsidar Taharin, driver Azizan has claimed he was
repeatedly sodomized by Anwar.
	   Sodomy is illegal in predominantly Muslim Malaysia.

Chief weapons inspector says Iraq did not fully cooperate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with one diplomat characterizing
Butler's report as negative &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler reported to Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Iraq did not
fully cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors as it promised a month
ago, according to a Western diplomat.
	   Annan delivered the report Tuesday to members of the U.N.
Security Council Tuesday night but it was not immediately made
public.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Butler's key finding was that Iraq had not provided the full
cooperation it promised on Nov. 14 under threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   Butler's conclusion was not surprising.
	   The U.N. weapons chief has already reported that Iraq's
compliance has been far from perfect: Baghdad denied the inspectors
access to two sites, refused to hand over several key documents,
buzzed a helicopter the inspectors were using, and imposed
unacceptable conditions during several inspections.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution says a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad
desperately wants _ would only go ahead if Butler reported that
Iraq had resumed full cooperation with inspectors.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to compel Baghdad to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   While Butler's report was ``fairly negative,'' the report by the
International Atomic Energy Agency on Iraq's nuclear disarmament
was ``fairly positive,'' according to a U.N. diplomat, also
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution at the end of the Gulf war in
1991, sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's
economy, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission which
Butler heads and the IAEA certify that Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been destroyed.
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting tough economic sanctions imposed after Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the United States insists
that there is no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs
to do to fully disarm.
	   Annan noted at a news conference Monday that there are
differences between the United Nations and the United States over
Iraq.
	   The U.N. Security Council has made it clear that once Butler
declares that Iraq has been disarmed, sanctions will be lifted, he
said.
	   ``American policy goes beyond that, but I am guided only by the
United Nations policy,'' Annan said.
	   He gave no specifics, but President Bill Clinton recently called
for the overthrow of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``The fact that there may be a conflict in the council because
one or two members may disagree does not mean that the council
should not move ahead and do what it has promised to do in its own
resolutions,'' Annan said.
	   While the secretary-general indicated that Baghdad's cooperation
had fallen short of his expectations, he indicated that he expects
the comprehensive review to go ahead even though the final decision
is up to the Security Council.
	   ``I am not sure that the comprehensive review is something that
Iraq deserves or does not deserve,'' he said. ``I think the council
itself would want to know, after eight years of sanctions, where it
stands, what has been achieved, what needs to be done, and within
what reasonable time frame it can be done.''

Lords force government to invoke rarely used power to pass voting
</HEADLINE>
bill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of Britain's unelected House of Lords
defeated the government for a record sixth time on plans to change
the voting system for European Parliament elections.
	   But the government immediately announced late Tuesday that it
would overturn the upper chamber's 167-73 vote by invoking the
little-used Parliament Act, created to ensure that the will of the
country's elected lawmakers prevails.
	   The elections bill will now become law in time for the European
elections in June.
	   The unprecedented show of defiance by the House of Lords comes
as Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair prepares to introduce a bill in
this session of Parliament calling for major reform of the chamber.
	   Blair wants to strip hereditary peers _ aristocrats who
overwhelmingly support the opposition Conservative Party _ of their
600-year-old rights to vote in the Lords. He plans to create a
commission to decide how to replace the 759 nobles.
	   At present, the aristocrats sit alongside some 500 peers with
lifetime titles, mostly former politicians.
	   Despite ultimately losing the fight to block the bill _ which
they charge gives too much power to party machines _ the
Conservative Party still declared a victory in its ''unprecedented
humiliation for the government.''
	   The Lords had rejected the bill five times during the last
parliamentary session, effectively killing it. But the government
reintroduced the measure in the new session and pushed it through
the House of Commons in just one day. The defeat Tuesday in the
Lords, however, means the government will have to force it through
_ powers that have only been used twice since World War II.
	   Lord Williams of Mostyn, a junior minister in the Home Office,
blamed hereditary peers for attempting to thwart the wishes of the
elected Commons.
	   ``There are 60 million people living in our country. The wishes
of the chamber elected by that country have been flouted by 700
families or their present representatives,'' he said.
	   The bill provides that instead of voting for a single candidate
in each district, voters choose a party. The party would then
allocate seats to its nominees, with the number of seats based on
the proportion of the overall vote won by each party.
	   The system is used by France, Germany, Greece, Spain and
Portugal. But British opponents say the measure deprives voters of
the right to choose a candidate and allows party apparatchiks to
control who gets elected.

 &UR; United Nations to investigate civilian deaths in alleged military
bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
	   Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The United Nations will investigate
charges that strafing and rocket fire from military planes pursuing
leftist rebels killed at least 16 villagers last weekend, a U.N.
human rights official said.
	   Almudena Mazarrasa, the departing representative in Colombia of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, gave no further
details Tuesday on the planned probe into the bloodshed Sunday in
Santo Domingo, a hamlet 200 miles (325 kilometers) from Bogota in
Arauca state.
	   Mayor Luis Ramon Marquez of Tame, the closest town, said the
villagers _ five of them children _ died when air force planes
fired rockets and machine guns at them as they fled their homes
during heavy fighting between rebels and government troops. Three
soldiers were killed and 13 wounded in combat which ended Monday.
	   Television cameras captured images of children bleeding from
shrapnel wounds being carted away on stretchers.
	   The air force has admitted to firing rockets into the town, but
it blames the guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, saying the rebels were using civilians as
shields.
	   Speaking at a military academy Tuesday, President Andres
Pastrana appeared to criticize the military's actions, saying that
security forces ``cannot respond to barbarism with barbarism'' in
their fight with insurgents and right-wing paramilitary groups.
	   ``Even if the enemies of the state and society torture,
massacre, and use arms and methods prohibited by civilization, the
men society and the state has charged with defendending them cannot
respond with the same methods,'' said Pastrana, who did not refer
directly to the fighting in Arauca.
	   Mazarrasa, a Spanish diplomat who completes a nearly two-year
stint this week heading the U.N. rights office in Colombia, told a
news conference that upcoming peace talks were the best hope for
improving the country's dismal human rights situation. ``The
country's problems can only be resolved through dialogue,'' she
said.
	   Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda agreed Monday to meet
on January 7 in a town in southern Colombia, formally initiating
peace talks to end the country's 34-year internal conflict.

Granik and Hunter agree: Deal could be done in less than 24 hours

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rather than speaking to each other, Russ Granik
and Billy Hunter stated their cases separately and discussed the
details of the National Basketball Association lockout, agreeing on
one thing _ a deal can be reached in less than 24 hours.
	   The hard part, as it has been for the entire 5 1/2-month-old
ordeal, will be getting to that point.
	   The chief negotiators from each side spoke at their respective
offices for about an hour apiece Tuesday with The Associated Press,
spelling out the movement they have made, discussing where the deal
currently stands and stating what they need from the other side to
reach closure.
	   ``They're not going to blow up the season. We're too close,''
Hunter said. ``They'd have to be deranged.''
	   Granik, as always, was the most pessimistic of the two.
	   ``They're speaking Chinese, we're speaking Greek,'' he said.
	   Although conciliatory statements were hard to come by, both men
admitted they are closer than previously disclosed on the main
factor separating them _ the percentage of revenues that will be
devoted to salaries. The owners, who have asked that the percentage
be cut to 52 percent, have told the players they are willing to go
higher. The players, who previously said they'd never drop below 57
percent, now say they'll go to 56.5.
	   The middle ground might be closer than ever, but each side wants
one more major move from the other.
	   The league wants an absolute maximum salary for all players
based upon years of service, and the union has offered such a limit
_ but only for players with less than seven years of experience.
	   ``After backing off the hard cap, that's the one we need,''
Granik said.
	   The union, meanwhile, wants two additional salary cap exceptions
to boost the number of players in the so-called ``middle class,''
as well as increased minimum salaries for veterans.
	   The league has proposed limiting the maximum player salary to a
percentage of the salary cap. Players with less than seven years in
the league could get about dlrs 8 million in the first year of a
new contract, players in years 7-9 could get about dlrs 10 million
and players with at least 10 years could get dlrs 12 million.
	   The union has offered a dlrs 10 million limit for players in
years 1-7, and a luxury tax for other players if their contracts
started above dlrs 15 million.
	   ``I'm not going to give up my high-end guys and then start
negotiating from there,'' Hunter said, explaining why he didn't
offer a bigger compromise at last Saturday's bargaining session.
	   The league has offered increased minimums _ although not as high
as the union would like _ and has already agreed to one of the
exceptions, the ``average salary'' exception. The league also has
taken its proposed timing rules changes, which would restrict free
agency movement, off the table.
	   On the other points of contention _ the length of a rookie
scale, the maximum annual raise, player conduct rules _ the
differences could be settled without much fuss. That's why Granik
and Hunter agreed that a deal could be reached in less that 24
hours.
	   But perhaps the biggest hurdle facing the union director and the
deputy commissioner is the atmosphere of mistrust in that neither
wants to make a move for fear the other won't reciprocate.
	   ``We want to pay less, they want us to pay more,'' Granik said.
``Just making the system more complex doesn't help.''
	   Maybe not. But a more complex system is what the sides will have
to end up with if they want to finalize a new collective bargaining
agreement and end the lockout that has wiped out the first 2 1/2
months of the season.
	   Both sides also outlined how they had already addressed the
other's ``Holy Grail'' issues.
	   When the lockout began July 1, the union said it would not
accept a hard salary cap or the elimination of the Larry Bird
exception. The league has yielded on both issues.
	   The league, in turn, said it needed cost certainty and wanted to
prevent players like Kevin Garnett, who had been in the league for
only two years, from receiving a contract extension worth dlrs 126
million.
	   The union complied by agreeing to a maximum salary for
less-tenured players and a complicated escrow tax system under
which players would forfeit up 10 percent of their paychecks if the
amount of revenues devoted to salaries exceeded a defined
percentage.

 &UR; SPCA constable calls skating bears ``sad'' &LR; 
	   EDMONTON (CP) _ The skating bears of the Great Moscow Circus on
Ice are getting legally acceptable treatment while in Alberta but
an SPCA constable wishes them better.
	   ``I generally think it's kind of a sad life, but that's getting
into policy rather than the law,'' Doug Rombough of the Alberta
SPCA said Tuesday.
	   The six European brown bears will be performing in Edmonton next
month.
	   They have already skated with three Russian-born members of the
Edmonton Oilers hockey team as a publicity stunt at Clive, Alta.,
and performed in a show last Sunday in Red Deer, Alta.
	   ``Their quarters are clean. The bears are healthy. They are fed
and watered and groomed and exercised,'' said Rombough.
	   ``They can stand in a natural position, they can lie down and
they can turn around.''
	   Rombough said they have less space than in a zoo. But
comparisons are difficult because zoo animals, unlike the bears,
don't get out of their enclosures, he said.
	   The circus's head trainer, speaking through an interpreter, told
Rombough he's a member of a bear protective association in Russia.
	   Rombough said SPCA would prefer to see wild animals displayed
only where they demonstrate natural behaviour: ``Skating is not
natural behaviour.'' (Edmonton Journal)

Japan announces extra dlrs 5 billion for Asian countries

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
announced Wednesday 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in new
low-interest loans to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their
devastated economies.
	   The loans, for projects such as roads, bridges, power stations
and airports, also will help Japan's sagging economy because the
contractors must be Japanese companies.
	   The money will go to ``countries of Asia who are doing their
utmost to reform their economic structures,'' Obuchi said.
	   It will be disbursed over three years and will be repayable in
40 years at an interest rate of 1 percent, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
	   The new loans were announced in speech delivered by Obuchi
during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. Japanese officials clearly hoped the speech would display
Japanese leadership in efforts to overcome the region's economic
crisis.
	   Other than money, however, Obuchi announced few new initiatives.
	   Japan has provided far more than other countries in assistance
to affected Asian countries _ a total of dlrs 44 billion to date.
	   It also has created a dlrs 30 billion fund unveiled by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in October for six Asian countries _
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea.
	   In the first loans under the plan, Japan's Foreign Ministry said
Obuchi told Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday
that his country will get up to 117 billion yen. Details on
Thailand's allocation were to be announced Wednesday.
	   Obuchi said Japan also will contribute 500 million yen (dlrs 4.2
million) to establish a new fund under the auspices of the United
Nations to support international organizations dealing with
problems such as environmental degradation, narcotics and organized
crime.
	   Instead of being praised for its largesse, however, Japan has
been frequently accused of dragging the region down economically by
failing to deal promptly with its own economic problems.
	   Obuchi acknowledged that Japan's recovery is vital for growth in
the region, but added that Asia's economic turnaround also is
important for Japan's recovery.
	   He said Japan also has been doing its utmost to be a driving
force for Asia's recovery, despite its economic problems.
	   ``I am confident that the Japanese economy will surely recover
and once again vigorously lead the Asian economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The prime minister stressed that dialogue and cooperation
between Japan and other Asian countries is vital to overcome the
economic crisis in the region. He proposed that Japan, China and
South Korea, as the three major countries in Northeast Asia,
increase their dialogue, with the goal of eventually forming a
``trilateral network.''
	   Obuchi is also scheduled to meet with leaders from Vietnam,
China, South Korea and Cambodia during his four-day trip.
	   He will travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he is to
visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

NFL rejects use of instant replays for playoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Football League decided Tuesday to
end the season the way it started, refusing to bring back instant
replay to help officials for the playoffs despite several recent
controversial calls.
	   The league's rule-making competition committee voted 7-1 against
the change in a conference call, although six of the eight members
said they would favor bringing it back next season. A seventh said
he would consider it.
	   ``Different people gave different reasons,'' said commissioner
Paul Tagliabue, who added that he agreed with the committee's
decision.
	   The vote was taken in response to a series of bad calls from
officials during a two-week period that started on Thanksgiving.
	   The bad calls even included the coin-toss at the start of
overtime in the Pittsburgh-Detroit game. The Steelers' Jerome
Bettis said he called ``tails,'' and referee Phil Luckett said he
heard ``heads.''
	   But while the use of instant replays to help officials was
rejected for the rest of this season, it will probably be approved
for the next.
	   Only Cincinnati's general manager Mike Brown, who has long been
against replay, said he would reject it for next season. Another
longtime opponent, Tampa Bay general manager Rich McKay, said he
might reconsider.

Confined spaces, bitter lives: Kosovo Serbs face grim future

	   ZOCISTE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting in Kosovo has consigned the
province's minority Serbs to a life of bitterness and a ghetto
mentality with grim prospects for the future.
	   Although they are not the worst victims of the war, Serbs are
increasingly aware that demographics are against them in the
province, which is located in Serbia but populated overwhelmingly
by ethnic Albanians.
	   ``We are trapped here in Kosovo _ there is no hope,'' Branko
Trpkovic, 25, said in Zociste, a remote southwestern village. ``If
I had the money, I'd pack up and leave.''
	   Most Serbs in Kosovo live in larger towns and the capital
Pristina; Serb villages are few and far apart. Villagers who were
able to sell their land did so long ago and headed elsewhere in
Serbia.
	   Zociste is a nutshell example of the tragic chain of events that
separated, perhaps forever, the province's Albanians and Serbs.
	   In a picture-postcard valley surrounded by rolling hills, it was
home to 100 ethnic Albanian and 50 Serb families before fighting
broke out this year.
	   Now only Serbs live here.
	   Zivko Blagojevic, 48, refers to his former Albanian neighbors as
``terrorists.''
	   ``If they free our people and get punished for their crimes,
then they can come back,'' he said.
	   His two nephews disappeared three months ago and Blagojevic,
like others here, is convinced they were captured by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for
Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared throughout the province,
including some 40 from the nearby town of Orahovac. Nothing is
known about their fate.
	   The KLA controls most of the terrain around Zociste and the
villagers rely on the protection of two dozen Serb policemen
deployed in the village. A truck arrives monthly with basic
necessities.
	   This year's crops have gone unharvested and nothing has been
planted for next season. Too afraid of snipers, they leave their
farms untilled. The little livestock they have is just enough to
get by.
	   Once a prosperous farmer, Blagojevic spent two months in a
refugee center, then returned to a looted house when the fighting
subsided.
	   ``I've lost 30,000 German marks' (dlrs 18,000) worth of property
_ I can never make that much money again,'' he says.
	   When battles between Serb forces and the rebels engulfed the
Orahovac region in August, the guerrillas overran Zociste first.
Most of its Serb residents fled through the forest to the next Serb
village, five kilometers (three miles) away.
	   The rebels captured 27 elderly men and women who were too weak
to make the escape, along with eight monks from a nearby Serb
monastery. They were detained for five days until the international
Red Cross mediated their release.
	   A month later, in a fierce counterattack, Serb troops
``liberated'' the village. Not a single Albanian remained behind
and none of their homes was left intact. The Serbs returned.
	   At the entrance of the village, a ghastly bombed-out ethnic
Albanian house has Serb nationalist graffiti sprayed on what's left
of the front wall.
	   ``My brother Predrag was shot and killed from there,'' says
Zrdavko Krstic, 22, pointing to the blackened shell of the house's
window. He denies any knowledge of who burned it later.
	   Despite a lull in the fighting, many are certain that war will
erupt again in the spring. The Serb men sit idle much of the time
in the village's only cafe, drinking beer and sharing their anger.
	   Branko Krstic, 60, one of the Zociste Serbs captured by the
rebels last summer, said he recognized four of his former neighbors
in guerrilla uniform.
	   ``One of them showed me a chain of bullets strapped across his
shoulder and told me all these bullets were meant for Serbs,''
Krstic recalled. But the KLA beat up only one of the monks, and we
were fed a portion of bread each day, he added.
	   ``If Kosovo becomes an independent Albanian state, we Serbs will
go to the slaughterhouse,'' Krstic said. ``It will be doomsday for
us.''
	   But no one can think of any likely way out of the Serbs'
predicament.
	   Further limiting their options is a law the government adopted
in 1983 to prevent a Serb exodus, prohibiting Serbs from selling
land to Albanians.
	   ``I can't move anywhere,'' Blagojevic lamented.

Japan's October current account surplus rises 21.5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with import and export figures, comments, other
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again in
October, increasing 21.5 percent from a year ago, the government
announced Wednesday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion) in October, the
Finance Ministry announced.
	   The rise marked the 19th consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure by its trading partners
to revive its sluggish economy to import more goods and cap the
ballooning surplus.
	   A Finance Ministry official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said, however, that there was no change in the upward
trend, in which a steep fall in imports is boosting both the
current account and trade surpluses.
	   In October, exports fell 6.5 percent from the same month last
year to 4.215 trillion yen (dlrs 36.34 billion). But imports
dropped further, falling 16.8 percent to 2.693 trillion yen (dlrs
23.22 billion).
	   As a result, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 19.9 percent to
1.522 trillion yen (dlrs 13.12 billion), while the trade and
services surplus jumped 27.5 percent to 816.9 billion yen (dlrs
7.04 billion) for the month.
	   The ministry official said the current account and trade
surpluses, however, are unlikely to show rapid growth in coming
months.
	   The recent strengthening of the yen should weigh on exports,
while a series of recent measures the government has taken to
stimulate the domestic economy is expected to support imports, he
said.
	   A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive
abroad, thus cutting into dollar-denominated earnings of export-led
Japanese companies when converted into yen.
	   Earlier this month, Parliament enacted a 5.67 trillion yen (dlrs
48.88 billion) supplementary budget, a measure designed to help
boost the country's moribund economy.
	   That special budget, the third of its kind for the current
fiscal year, earmarked funds to finance part of the government's
most recent economic stimulus package, which totaled a record 24
trillion yen (dlrs 200 billion).
	   Meanwhile, Japan's service deficit in October came to 704.8
billion yen (dlrs 6.08 billion), larger than the 628.2 billion yen
(dlrs 5.42 billion) deficit registered a year earlier, the ministry
said.
	   The widening in the service deficit partly resulted from a rise
in the tourism-related deficit. Although the number of Japanese
tourists going abroad fell from a year earlier, they spent more in
foreign nations in the reporting month, the official said.

window. He denies any knowledge of who burned it later.
	   Despite a lull in the fighting, many are certain that war will
erupt again in the spring. The Serb men sit idle much of the time
in the village's only cafe, drinking beer and sharing their anger.
	   Branko Krstic, 60, one of the Zociste Serbs captured by the
rebels last summer, said he recognized four of his former neighbors
in guerrilla uniform.
	   ``One of them showed me a chain of bullets strapped across his
shoulder and told me all these bullets were meant for Serbs,''
Krstic recalled. But the KLA beat up only one of the monks, and we
were fed a portion of bread each day, he added.
	   ``If Kosovo becomes an independent Albanian state, we Serbs will
go to the slaughterhouse,'' Krstic said. ``It will be doomsday for
us.''
	   But no one can think of any likely way out of the Serbs'
predicament.
	   Further limiting their options is a law the government adopted
in 1983 to prevent a Serb exodus, prohibiting Serbs from selling
land to Albanians.
	   ``I can't move anywhere,'' Blagojevic lamented.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Douglas Sidialo, who was blinded in the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, cringes when he
considers the shambles his life might have become.
	   ``When you have lost sight, people think you are destined to
become a beggar, shaking a plate in the streets for a few coins,''
the former salesman said.
	   Instead, Sidialo is contemplating a career as a psychologist or
a lawyer. ``It is my dream to learn a new profession, one where I
can talk to people, and help them,'' the 27-year-old said.
	   Rarely does a blind Kenyan get such a chance.
	   But remorse over the horrific bombing that killed 213 people and
wounded more than 5,400 has been so great that governments,
particularly the United States, and private donors have made dreams
possible. A nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania killed 11 people.
	   Still, the obstacles are many.
	   Kenya is an impoverished country beset by high-level corruption,
massive unemployment and a paucity of resources.
	   ``Life here is bad enough when you have your limbs, and nearly
impossible for the disabled,'' said Wambui Kairo of the Kenya Red
Cross Society.
	   When the bomb went off Aug. 7, Kenya didn't have a disaster
plan. The wounded were ferried to hospitals in buses and cars
because there were so few ambulances. Poorly supplied hospitals
swiftly ran out of sutures, surgical gloves and pressure bandages,
vital for the treatment of burn victims.
	   In the weeks that followed, another deficiency became clear:
Kenya did not have enough trained personnel, equipment or surgical
supplies to help those who need long-term care, rehabilitation or
reconstructive surgery.
	   Agencies dedicated to helping Kenya's disabled often had nothing
more than good intentions.
	   ``Some of these groups, particularly the groups that deal with
the disabled, are in tough shape,'' said Gregory Gottlieb, the U.S.
Agency for International Development's emergency coordinator in
Kenya.
	   Kenya Society for the Blind, for example, has helped the newly
sightless adjust to their disabilities for more than 40 years,
teaching them how to walk with white canes, attend to their
hygiene, cook, clean, care for children and read Braille.
	   But in the past year, despite diligent efforts, the society has
not found one job for a blind or visually impaired person.
	   ``I can't really blame the employers. Our training has not been
sophisticated,'' said Wilson Noreh, the society's director. In
addition, Kenya does not encourage employers to hire the disabled.
	   Knitting, basket-weaving and farming have been the only training
offered by the society, hobbled by an annual budget of just dlrs
530,000 in donations to serve Kenya's 280,000 partly or fully blind
people. With the bombing, its caseload increased _ at least 150
people were blinded or partially lost their sight.
	   ``I wouldn't mind learning these things, weaving or knitting or
farming, but this is not something that I would want to do as a
profession,'' Sidialo said.
	   Nor would such work pay the bills for him, his wife and their
2-year-old daughter. The women who use machines to knit up to 35
sweaters a month earn just dlrs 42 _a tenth of Sidialo's previous
salary as an aggressive salesman of motorcycles, generators and
other goods.
	   ``I have to eat, I have to pay rent, I have to take care of my
family,'' he said.
	   Like others who were blinded in the bombing, Sidialo received
dlrs 5,000 in compensation from a fund built from private
donations. ``I want to put my money into training. Training is very
important,'' he said.
	   Until now, even the wealthy couldn't buy training in Kenya _
nothing was offered. The blind society, for example, still doesn't
have a single computer equipped with a voice synthesizer or Braille
keys.
	   But the bombing has been a boon, of sorts, to local aid
agencies.
	   Noreh said government and private donors have given the blind
society an extra dlrs 139,000 in cash and equipment to cope with
fallout from the blast.
	   USAID has dlrs 37 million to help repair damage from the bombing
in Kenya alone. Some of that is earmarked to buy computers
specially equipped for the sightless. Because no Kenyan is trained
in teaching computer technology to the blind, a foreigner would
have to be hired to do the teaching, or Kenyan instructors would
have to be sent abroad to study.
	   Sidialo will be among the first students to use the new
equipment, which is expected in January. Adept at using computers
before the bombing, he would like to adjust to working blind.
	   Then, his goal is to go to university.
	   ``The support others are giving to make me productive in life is
very, very much appreciated,'' Sidialo said. ``Being visually
impaired is not the end of the world. It is the beginning of a new
world.''

Lords force government to invoke rarely used power to pass voting

 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in graf 8 that this is the second time a British
government has invoked the Parliament Act since World War II;
UPPICKS pvs graf 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of Britain's unelected House of Lords
defeated the government for a record sixth time on plans to change
the voting system for European Parliament elections.
	   But the government immediately announced late Tuesday that it
would overturn the upper chamber's 167-73 vote by invoking the
little-used Parliament Act, created to ensure that the will of the
country's elected lawmakers prevails.
	   The elections bill will now become law in time for the European
elections in June.
	   The unprecedented show of defiance by the House of Lords comes
as Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair prepares to introduce a bill in
this session of Parliament calling for major reform of the chamber.
	   Blair wants to strip hereditary peers _ aristocrats who
overwhelmingly support the opposition Conservative Party _ of their
600-year-old rights to vote in the Lords. He plans to create a
commission to decide how to replace the 759 nobles.
	   At present, the aristocrats sit alongside some 500 peers with
lifetime titles, mostly former politicians.
	   Despite ultimately losing the fight to block the bill _ which
they charge gives too much power to party machines _ the
Conservative Party still declared a victory in its ``unprecedented
humiliation for the government.''
	   The Lords had rejected the bill five times during the last
parliamentary session, effectively killing it. But the government
reintroduced the measure in the new session and pushed it through
the House of Commons in just one day. The defeat Tuesday in the
Lords, however, means the government will have to force it through
_ only the second time that Parliament Act has been used since
World War II.

Canadian, European Union leaders meet ahead of euro launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien meets European Union
leaders Thursday in talks that may help Canada gauge whether it
will benefit from the Jan. 1 launch of a common currency in 11 EU
nations.
	   Canadian officials and executives see both opportunity and
possible problems arising from the launch of the euro.
	   They hope the change will accelerate recent growth of
Canadian-EU trade, but they say Canadian companies will need to be
nimble in adjusting pricing, billing, sales and marketing policies
to cope with the euro.
	   The EU delegation is headed by Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima,
president of the European Council, and Jacques Santer, president of
the European Commission.
	   Also participating will be Austrian Vice Chancellor Wolfgang
Schnuessel and European Commission vice chairman Sir Leon Brittan.
	   They will meet Chretien and top Canadian Cabinet ministers to
discuss trade, technological cooperation, and joint efforts to
control the flow of small arms, according to Chretien's office.
	   On Friday, the Europeans will hold talks with U.S. officials in
Washington.
	   The meeting in Canada marks the second anniversary of the
signing of a Canada-European political declaration and action plan.
	   ``We are working together not only to advance peace and security
issues, but also to create an open and harmonized trading
environment in which people on both sides of the Atlantic can, with
more ease and confidence, do business and trade with each other,''
Chretien said in a statement.
	   New figures show Canadian investment in EU countries _ abg dlrs
27 billion U.S. _ has for the first time moved ahead of EU
investment in Canada _ about dlrs 24 billion U.S.
	   Annual two-way trade is close to dlrs 30 billion U.S., though
that is only a small fraction of the two-way trade between Canada
and the United States.
	   Some Canadian commentators predict Canada will be a long-term
loser as Europe becomes more tightly unified.
	   ``Almost by definition, a single-currency Europe is going to be
a different animal to deal with,'' wrote business columnist Peter
Cook of the Toronto-based Globe and Mail newspaper.
	   ``Since its purpose is to submerge the identities of its member
states in order to compete more equally with the United States, it
will have less in common with Canada.''
	   Thus far, Canada has not proposed a comprehensive free-trade
deal with the EU, instead concentrating on sector-by-sector
agreements.
	   On Tuesday, EU farm ministers gave the go-ahead to an agreement
with Canada aimed at making bilateral trade in live animals and
animal products easier.

Chief inspector says Iraq did not fully cooperate with inspectors

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report saying Iraq did not fully cooperate with
U.N. inspectors &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler said in a report Tuesday that Iraq did not fully cooperate
with U.N. inspectors as it promised a month ago and imposed new
restrictions on their work.
	   ``In spite of the opportunity presented by the circumstances of
the last month, including the prospect of a comprehensive review,
Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs,'' Butler said in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution says a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad
desperately wants _ would only go ahead if Butler reported that
Iraq had resumed full cooperation with inspectors.
	   Butler's conclusion was not surprising.
	   The U.N. weapons chief has already reported that Iraq's
compliance has been far from perfect: Baghdad denied the inspectors
access to two sites, refused to hand over several key documents,
buzzed a helicopter the inspectors were using, and imposed
unacceptable conditions during several inspections.
	   In a hard-hitting 10-page report, Butler concluded that in ``the
absence of full cooperation by Iraq'' the U.N. Special Commission
which he heads was unable ``to conduct the substantive disarmament
work mandated to it by the Security Council'' and assure the
council that Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been
eliminated.

SAfrica unveils new monument in campaign to end apartheid myths

<TEXT>
	   VRYHEID, South Africa (AP) _ The new South Africa is rewriting
its history in the rolling hills of Zululand.
	   The Battle of Blood River in 1838, where a small force of Boer
commandoes slaughtered 3,000 Zulu warriors, was long celebrated as
a symbol of Afrikaner power and entitlement and served as a
fundamental myth underpinning apartheid.
	   Now, the government is planning to unveil a new monument across
the river from the old Afrikaner memorial. This one commemorates
the Zulu sacrifice.
	   The new monument in KwaZulu-Natal province, 380 kilometers (240
miles) southeast of Johannesburg, is only one part of the
government's efforts to correct what it considers the unbalanced
history of South Africa, where white nationalism was celebrated and
Africans often denigrated as a savage people to be subdued.
	   The Culture Ministry has spent about 2 million rand (dlrs
340,000) on the monument, which lies across the river from the old
Afrikaner-celebrated monument _ a bronze reconstruction of the
circled ox wagons from which the Boers fired on the Zulu army. The
story goes that six days before, the Boer force took a vow that
they would render thanks to God if victory was theirs. The account
gave rise to the holiday known as the Day of the Vow, which is now
known as the Day of Reconciliation.
	   The Boers, later known as Afrikaners, are descendants of Dutch
settlers.
	   Other projects are planned. The house of Nobel Peace Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, an early ANC president, will become a
memorial. The ministry has set aside 17 million rand (dlrs 3
million) for a museum celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. A
theme park exploring the struggle to overcome apartheid is planned.
Ceremonies marking the anniversary of the Anglo-Boer war of
1899-1902 will focus on the suffering of blacks.
	   On Wednesday, Afrikaner representatives were holding their own,
separate ceremony and planned to join the government-sponsored
event, which was featuring speeches by the Zulu king, Goodwill
Zwelithini and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu nation

Astronauts streak toward rare nighttime landing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with NASA clearing Endeavour for launch,
shuttle beginning descent, Apollo 8 anniversary celebration,
quotes. No Pickup. Landing scheduled for 10:54 p.m. EST. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts streaked
toward a rare nighttime landing Tuesday following their triumphant
space station-building mission.
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
3-mile, xenon-lit runway. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission
Control gave the shuttle pilots the go-ahead for a 10:54 p.m.
touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Commander Robert Cabana and his crew were ready to come home
after an exhausting yet satisfying journey that spanned nearly 12
days and 4.6 million miles.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' Cabana said before heading home. ``It's been a
super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of

Stocks bounce back, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks bounced back Wednesday morning,
helped by an overnight gain on Wall Street and talk of tax
reductions in Japan. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 88.94 points,
or 0.63 percent, to 14,100.13 at the end of the morning session. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei lost 100.43 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.48 yen at late morning, down 1.10 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 116.35
yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, share prices started higher on buying of
high-technology issues as investors were encouraged by a rise of
127.70 points Tuesday in the Dow Jones industrial average, which
closed at 8,823.30.
	   Also helping the Tokyo market was talk of tax cuts among ruling
Democratic Party officials, traders said.
	   Kyodo News reported Tuesday that the tax panel of the ruling LDP
will soon propose around 9.3 trillion yen (dlrs 80.17 billion) in
tax cuts and deductions, including 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34.48
billion) in income taxes cuts and 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 19.82
billion) in corporate tax cuts.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.64 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,092.91. The
TOPIX shed 11.04 points, or 1.00 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar gained some ground from its
levels in late New York trading overnight following
slower-than-expected growth in Japan's October current account
surplus, traders said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Japan's Finance Ministry announced that the
nation's current account surplus rose 21.5 percent in October from
a year earlier to 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion).
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast on average
a surplus of 1.491 trillion yen (dlrs 12.8 billion).
	   Signs of a slowdown in the growth of Japan's external surpluses
are supportive for the dollar, as they allay concerns about trade
friction.
	   Traders said, however, that market attention was mostly focused
on pending impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton,
keeping the dollar from rising further.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.290 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.260 percent, driving its price down to 104.31 yen from 104.57
yen.

Astronauts streak toward rare nighttime landing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with NASA clearing Endeavour for launch,
shuttle beginning descent, Apollo 8 anniversary celebration,
quotes. No Pickup. Landing scheduled for 10:54 p.m. EST. &QL;

 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts streaked
toward a rare nighttime landing Tuesday following their triumphant
space station-building mission.
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
3-mile, xenon-lit runway. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission
Control gave the shuttle pilots the go-ahead for a 10:54 p.m.
touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Commander Robert Cabana and his crew were ready to come home
after an exhausting yet satisfying journey that spanned nearly 12
days and 4.6 million miles.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' Cabana said before heading home. ``It's been a
super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered
at the Kennedy Space Center for a 30th anniversary celebration.
	   Apollo 8's Jim Lovell and Bill Anders paid tribute to the
astronauts soaring overhead.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
flew to the moon on Apollo 13.

Hun Sen says ASEAN `marriage' only waiting for ceremony
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Wednesday that his country's ``marriage'' to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations is complete except for the ceremony.
	   He said leaders of the nine-nation grouping sought no further
assurances on Cambodia's stability at a one-hour meeting Wednesday
morning during their annual two-day summit.
	   But while ASEAN leaders have said the country definitely will
become a member, some have insisted that it first must fully
establish the credibility of a newly formed coalition government.
	   Hun Sen had to sit in the front row as ASEAN leaders took the
stage for opening ceremonies of the summit Tuesday. He said that
was only because the leaders had made their decision too late
Monday to arrange an induction ceremony.
	   ``This is the ASEAN way, which is different from the United
Nations,'' he said, referring to the fact that Cambodia was given
its seat back at the world body last week.
	   Hun Sen said he also did not want to take attention away from
the meeting's focus. The question of Cambodia's admission had
hijacked the spotlight at pre-summit meetings.
	   ``We do not want this ceremonial process to cause any problems
to leaders of ASEAN who have to focus their attention on the
financial and economic issues,'' Hun Sen said.
	   ``Cambodia is still very happy because we became a full member
of ASEAN. For us, we count it as an admission. The marriage
ceremony has been organized. Now we have to wait for the
registration.''
	   Asked when the ceremony will take place, he said: ``I don't
know. I hope very soon.''
	   In a face-saving concession to summit host Vietnam, which had
spearheaded lobbying on its neighbor's behalf, the ceremony will
take place in Hanoi.
	   In speech after speech Tuesday, Hun Sen was assured Cambodia
would soon become the final member of the Southeast Asian
brotherhood, as envisioned when ASEAN was founded in 1967.
	   Vietnam went so far as to insist by day's end that Cambodia had
already been admitted and the ceremony was only a formality.
	   ``Although the admission ceremony has not yet occurred,
everybody should consider Cambodia as the 10th member of ASEAN,''
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said.
	   Back home in Phnom Penh, political analysts weren't putting such
a good spin on Cambodia's entry.
	   ``A delay is a delay,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, executive director
of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a local think
tank. ``Membership has been delayed with an ASEAN way of
face-saving, but in the end it shows that there was no consensus.''

Fletcher beats French star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEND, Oregon (AP) _ Olympic snowboarder Rosey Fletcher of
Anchorage, Alaska rebounded from an unpleasant race last week to
win a World Cup super-G race Tuesday at Mount Bachelor by .11
seconds over French great Karine Ruby.
	   Fletcher's time of 1 minute, 6.25 seconds overtook Ruby, the
1998 Olympic giant slalom gold medalist and many-time World Cup
champion, who raced first.
	   Sondra Van Ert of Ketchum, Idaho, who won at Whistler, British
Columbia last Thursday when Fletcher failed to finish, completed
the podium in third place in 1:07.69. Betsy Shaw of East Dorset,
Vermont was ninth and Stacia Hookom of Edwards, Colo., was 10th.
	   ``Y'know, I figured out today that when I'm on the edge, when
I'm off balance, I'm usually going pretty fast and that's when I do
my best,'' Fletcher said on the first day of the meet.
	   ``I had a lousy time in Whistler but this was great _ perfect
weather and hard snow. It was really fast,'' Fletcher said.
	   In the men's super-G, Mark Fawcett of Canada led a sweep of the
top four places by North American riders. He won in 1:04.09 with
Jeff Archibald of Salt Lake City second in 1:04.17, Jeff Greenwood
of Granby, Conn., third in 1:04.20 and Ian Price of Manchester
Center, Vt., fourth in 1:04.23).
	   ``North American podium. It's good to be up here with Fawcett
and 'Greeny. ... Things are clicking for me lately,'' said
Archibald, who moved into the World Cup points lead. He won a giant
slalom last month in Sestriere, Italy.

Family battle to regain land roils east German suburb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BER501 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TELTOW, Germany (AP) _ Seehof, in the Berlin suburb of Teltow,
is a quiet neighborhood of well-tended homes, bordered by parks, a
nature preserve and a waterway.
	   Yet the calm belies a storm that has surrounded Seehof since
German reunification in 1990.
	   The 500 or so houses were built on the Seehof farm, once owned
by one of Berlin's wealthiest families, the Saberskys. They fled
Nazi Germany in the 1930s because they were Jewish, ending up in
the United States and elsewhere.
	   For decades, the family could not seek restitution because the
land was in communist East Germany. Now with the Wall gone and
Teltow looking like prime real estate, the heirs want to regain
title to the 84 hectares (208 acres), worth dlrs 170 million or
more.
	   The prospect frightens many of the 1,500 people who have lived
in Seehof for decades. With so much at stake, the battle has become
increasingly bitter, with accusations of anti-Semitism, greed and
dishonest politics.
	   Although several decisions have gone against them, the family is
pushing ahead. Their latest appeal was to be heard Wednesday by the
Federal Administrative Court in Berlin.
	   ``I don't shy away from a fight,'' said one American descendant,
Peter Sonnenthal, a former lawyer for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission who helped bring down Wall Street titans
Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky.
	   Sonnethal, 44, concedes he stands to make a lot of money but
insists he does not intend to force anyone from his home.
	   ``We're fighting a decision that says my family wasn't
persecuted,'' he said. ``But the truth is this property was owned
by my family and stolen by the Nazis and that's what must be
addressed.''
	   The family has won small victories, getting three parcels back
in 1995, including the grand, three-story villa where Sonnenthal's
grandfather, Albert Sabersky, once lived.
	   The villa quickly sold for dlrs 4.8 million. Sonnenthal and his
sister received half as sole heirs to Albert Sabersky; the rest was
divided among 16 other heirs.
	   Still, the state office charged with deciding restitution claims
denied the bulk of their claim. Deputy director Josefine Ewers says
the Saberskys ``without a question'' were persecuted by the Nazis _
but not when it came to selling their farm.
	   Both sides have spent years searching through old archives,
digging out maps, aerial photos and records. The case hinges on
whether the land was used as a farm or intended for development,
whether the Saberskys sold under pressure and what happened to the
money.
	   The Saberskys, mainly bankers and grain traders, bought Seehof
in 1878. They maintained it as a farm but drew up plans to develop
a strip along the water where other wealthy Berliners had started
building country homes.
	   But when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and started banning
Jews from professions _ including farming _ the family hired a Nazi
real-estate broker to begin selling all of Seehof.
	   ``They knew what was coming,'' Sonnenthal said. ``They sold it
off as fast as they could.''
	   The family claims the Saberskys sold the farm under pressure for
about half the market value, and that the broker charged them an
exorbitant commission _ reaching 50 percent after the 1938
anti-Jewish pogrom known as Kristallnacht.
	   They also say the Nazis confiscated the proceeds, and the family
never saw the money.
	   Ewers, of the restitution office, says records show the family
was not really farming the land but instead was preparing it for
development with intent to sell. If the family was not farming, she
argues, it would not have been under pressure from the Nazis'
banning the profession for Jews.
	   She says the broker's commission was reasonable considering all
they asked him to do. She also disputes Sonnethal's claim that the
family never saw any money from its financial agent, noting it used
the same man in the 1950s.
	   Sonnenthal says Ewers and the court acted under political
pressure, ignoring his evidence to protect homeowners _ and voters.
She denies it.
	   Charges that the family is only after money reflect shades of
anti-Semitism, he says, as do the swastikas that appeared in the
neighborhood during the seven-year court battle.
	   He has offered to drop claims to any home if the occupant pays
10,000 to 15,000 marks (dlrs 6,000 to dlrs 9,000) _ about 10
percent of the market value.
	   ``As a Jew returning to Germany, I will not make a victim out of
anyone who suffered under communism,'' he says. ``We set the price
intentionally low.''
	   About 120 people have accepted the offer or are in the process
of doing so. The majority are holding out _ taking their chances
with the courts.
	   Sonnenthal, now in private practice in Denver, will be in the
courtroom on Wednesday. If it rules against him, he's already
planning to take the case to the Constitutional Court, Germany's
highest.
	   ``It's been seven years and 20 trips'' to Germany, he said. But
for the sake of his grandparents, ``I carry on.''

	   Butler said the commission, known as UNSCOM, had ``clear
evidence that Iraq had taken advance actions at certain of the
locations planned for inspection in order to defeat the purposes of
inspection.''
	   As a result of this, Butler said he decided not to conduct the
full range of inspections the team had planned.
	   The report recounts unsuccessful attempts by UNSCOM to search
locations for materials related to banned weapons programs, to
obtain documents from the Iraqis, and to remove missile engine
components.
	   Butler said Iraq's current claims that it has fulfilled all of
its disarmament obligations and does not possess banned weapons or
the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   Documents and records available in Iraq detailed the country's
banned weapons program _ including production records, policy
decisions and records of claimed destruction of weapons _ ``would
be invaluable in helping to close remaining gaps and achieve
acceptable confidence in Iraqi declarations,'' Butler said.

China's Xinjiang region to close illegal mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Northwestern China's Xinjiang region will close
154 unlicensed, heavily polluting coal mines within the next year,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The shutdowns will reduce Xinjiang's coal output by 3.3 million
tons a year, but will not affect the normal coal supply, the report
cited local officials as saying.
	   Of the 1,457 coal mines in Xinjiang, 1,116 are collectively or
privately owned, and many are unlicensed, with backward equipment
and lax enforcement of safety standards. In the past decade, more
than 1,500 miners have died in accidents at small coal mines in
Xinjiang, the report said.
	   The regional government began a campaign to shut down illegal
mines early this month, it added.

Obuchi's support rate up, but disapproval still high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's popularity is rising,
but a majority of people still disapprove of his administration,
according to opinion polls released Wednesday.
	   Support for Obuchi's Cabinet stood at 26 percent, up from 21
percent in November, the daily Asahi Shimbun reported.
	   A similar poll released Wednesday by another major newspaper,
the Yomiuri, found Obuchi's approval rate to be 24 percent,
unchanged from last month.
	   In both polls, the disapproval rates for Obuchi's Cabinet
dropped, but remained high. According to the Asahi, disapproval of
Obuchi's Cabinet was 54 percent, down from 57 percent. The Yomiuri
found 60.9 percent were dissatisfied with his Cabinet, a drop of
2.1 percent.
	   Obuchi, head of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was
widely regarded as a clever, but lackluster, politician when his
administration came to power in July.
	   Since assuming office, however, he has overseen the passage of a
package of bank reform bills to fix the nation's bad debt problems,
and kept a high-profile with a series of summit meetings.
	   Meanwhile, support for the Democratic Party of Japan, the main
opposition force, continues to drop, Asahi reported.
	   Those who approve of the party stood at 9 percent, down from 10
percent in the November poll, with 31 percent of the respondents
saying they were disappointed with it.
	   The Democrats' popularity peaked in the July election, but fell
sharply in October as the opposition and ruling parties wrangled
over the passage of the bank reform bills, the paper reported.
	   The drop in the DPJ's popularity also follows recent rumors that
its leader, Naoto Kan, had an extramarital affair. Kan has denied
the rumors.
	   As is customary in Japan, the newspapers did not provide a
margin of error for their polls.

	   In contrast to Butler's report, the IAEA report concluded that
Iraq had provided ``the necessary level of cooperation'' to enable
its inspectors to complete their work ``efficiently and
effectively.''
	   Mohamed El Baradei, the IAEA's director general, said in a
letter to the secretary-general that an IAEA team had also visited
Iraq from Dec. 9-13 to discuss ``the few remaining questions and
concerns related to Iraq's clandestine nuclear program.''
	   ``During the discussions the Iraqi counterpart expressed its
intention to continue to cooperate with the IAEA in the resolution
of those matters,'' ElBaradei said.
	   In light of the IAEA report of cooperation and UNSCOM's mixed
report, secretary-general Annan suggested three possible options in
a letter to the the president of the Security Council, Bahrain's
Ambassador Jassim Mohammed Buallay:
	   _The council can decide that Iraq's performance ``does not
provide a sufficient basis to move forward with a comprehensive
review at this time.''
	   _The council can decide that ``Iraq has not provided full
cooperation but that it should be permitted additional time to
demonstrate its commitment to do so.''
	   _The council may wish to proceed with a comprehensive review
``on the premise that it is sufficiently important to know
precisely what has been achieved in the area of disarmament over
the entire period since 1991.''
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting tough economic sanctions imposed after Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the United States insists
that there is no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs
to do to fully disarm.

China to promote eco-tourism, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Mountain climbing and exploration, skiiing,
cycling and desert tours will be promoted by Chinese tourist
agencies as part of an effort to promote environmental protection,
the official newspaper China Daily reported Wednesday.
	   The China National Tourism Administration plans to feature
scenic landmarks in its ``'99 Eco-tour China'' program, the report
said.
	   ``We invite tourists to enjoy our country's natural sites and
visit famous Chinese scenic spots,'' it quoted Yang Wenzhen, the
administration's director of marketing and communications, as
saying.
	   The development of the tourism industry over the past decade has
led to the construction of hotels, cable cars and many other
facilities in China's most famous scenic areas.
	   The report did not specify what, if any changes, would be made
to help protect the environment from even greater flows of
tourists.

Police arrest suspect in murder of Real Sociedad supporter

Bastion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested a man suspected
of fatally stabbing a soccer fan before the Atletico de Madrid-Real
Sociedad match in Madrid a week ago.
	   The victim, 28-year-old Aitor Zabaleta, was knifed in the chest
outside Madrid's Vicente Calderon stadium before a UEFA Cup match.
He died after surgery.
	   Police chief Juan Cotino said that the suspect _ who was not
immediately identified _ belongs to TNT, a fascist splinter group
of of Atletico de Madrid's fan club, the Atletico Front.
	   Five Atletico fans, members of the Bastion group _ another
neo-fascist splinter group of the Atletico Front _ were arrested
Monday and last Friday. Two of them are jailed and other two remain
in custody pending further investigation. The other was released.
	   News of the stabbing death filled the first pages of Spanish
national and sports papers. The government, league officials and
soccer players from other teams called for stricter controls and
punishments for violent soccer fans.
	   On Sunday, Aitor's murder led to the decision by all of Spain's
first-division soccer teams to hold a moment of silence in his
memory before the 14th round games. Real Sociedad's players wore
jerseys with the victim's name on the back.

Chief inspector: Iraq did not fully cooperate with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous; UPDATES with comment from U.S. diplomat &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler said in a report Tuesday that Iraq did not fully cooperate
with U.N. inspectors as it promised a month ago and imposed new
restrictions on their work.
	   ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs,'' he said in a report to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes. Butler accused Baghdad of
blocking access to two sites and hindering inspection of others.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to compel Baghdad to cooperate _ and a U.S. diplomat said
that option remains open.
	   ``It's pretty serious and makes some strong conclusions,'' the
diplomat said of the report, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``We believe we have the authority we need under previous Security
Council resolutions to act and all options are on the table.''
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution says a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad
desperately wants _ would only go ahead if Butler reported that
Iraq had resumed full cooperation with inspectors.
	   Butler's conclusion was not surprising.
	   The U.N. weapons chief has already reported that Iraq's
compliance has been far from perfect: Baghdad denied the inspectors
access to two sites, refused to hand over several key documents,
buzzed a helicopter the inspectors were using, and imposed
unacceptable conditions during several inspections.
	   In a hard-hitting 10-page report, Butler concluded that in ``the
absence of full cooperation by Iraq'' the U.N. Special Commission
which he heads was unable ``to conduct the substantive disarmament
work mandated to it by the Security Council'' and assure the
council that Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been
eliminated.
	   Butler said the commission, known as UNSCOM, had ``clear
evidence that Iraq had taken advance actions at certain of the
locations planned for inspection in order to defeat the purposes of
inspection.''
	   As a result of this, Butler said he decided not to conduct the
full range of inspections the team had planned.
	   The report recounts unsuccessful attempts by UNSCOM to search
locations for materials related to banned weapons programs, to
obtain documents from the Iraqis, and to remove missile engine
components.
	   Butler said Iraq's current claims that it has fulfilled all of
its disarmament obligations and does not possess banned weapons or
the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   Documents and records available in Iraq detailed the country's
banned weapons program _ including production records, policy
decisions and records of claimed destruction of weapons _ ``would
be invaluable in helping to close remaining gaps and achieve
acceptable confidence in Iraqi declarations,'' Butler said.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution at the end of the Gulf war in
1991, sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's
economy, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission which
Butler heads and the International Atomic Energy Agency certify
that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed.
	   In contrast to Butler's report, the IAEA report concluded that
Iraq had provided ``the necessary level of cooperation'' to enable
its inspectors to complete their work ``efficiently and
effectively.''
	   Mohamed El Baradei, the IAEA's director general, said in a
letter to the secretary-general that an IAEA team had also visited
Iraq from Dec. 9-13 to discuss ``the few remaining questions and
concerns related to Iraq's clandestine nuclear program.''
	   ``During the discussions the Iraqi counterpart expressed its
intention to continue to cooperate with the IAEA in the resolution
of those matters,'' ElBaradei said.
	   In light of the IAEA report of cooperation and UNSCOM's mixed
report, secretary-general Annan suggested three possible options in
a letter to the the president of the Security Council, Bahrain's
Ambassador Jassim Mohammed Buallay:
	   _The council can decide that Iraq's performance ``does not
provide a sufficient basis to move forward with a comprehensive
review at this time.''
	   _The council can decide that ``Iraq has not provided full
cooperation but that it should be permitted additional time to
demonstrate its commitment to do so.''
	   _The council may wish to proceed with a comprehensive review
``on the premise that it is sufficiently important to know
precisely what has been achieved in the area of disarmament over
the entire period since 1991.''
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting tough economic sanctions imposed after Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the United States insists
that there is no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs
to do to fully disarm.

Anwar's old school friends turn up at trial to show solidarity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with arguments in court. ADDS byline
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hoping to boost the spirits of an
old school chum, classmates of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim Wednesday attended his trial as tempers flared in
court when the defense accused a police witness of lying.
	   Wearing the burgundy red with yellow, black and white striped
ties of their prestigious alma mater, Malay College, many of
Anwar's friends said they did not believe the sensational charges
against him.
	   ``We know the boys who played truant, who sneaked out to the
cinema and did unsavory things. Today they are still like that,''
said Raja Puteri, who has known Anwar for 35 years.
	   ``But Anwar was very religious. He was strict and he did not
like dirty jokes,'' said Raja, smoking a pipe outside the
courthouse.
	   The Malay College old boys network is a virtual who's who of
modern Malaysia. The prestigious school has produced some of the
nation's top diplomats, businessmen and many chief ministers.
	   Even Malaysia's present king is a product of the school, which
is located in the northern town of Kuala Kangsar.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in September,
faces abuse of power charges and will be tried separately for
allegedly having engaged in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   He has denied all the accusations against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Mahathir's
17-year-rule.
	   On Wednesday, a defense lawyer accused Assistant Commissioner of
Police Musa Hassan of giving inconsistent testimony, angering the
prosecution lawyers.
	   When Musa, who led the investigations against Anwar, said he did
not know about a report to Mahathir on the allegations of sexual
misdeeds by Anwar, Christopher Fernando, the defense lawyer,
pointed out that he had said the opposite on Tuesday.
	   The report by police last year exonerated Anwar. It was
conducted following a letter to Mahathir giving details of Anwar's
alleged extramarital affair and his acts of sodomy. The authors of
the letter retracted their charges, but now say they were coerced
into doing so by police acting on behalf of Anwar.
	   When Fernando, in an attempt to discredit Musa's testimony,
accused him of lying, deputy public prosecutor, Abdul Gani Patail,
jumped to his feet and objected.
	   ``He is the liar,'' Abdul Gani said, pointing to Fernando.
	   ``I think my learned friend should withdraw the remark or else I
will say something very derogatory about him,'' Fernando retorted.
Later the prosecutor apologized.
	   Prosecutors also submitted the result of a DNA test that proved
that Anwar was not the father of his former secretary's daughter.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors produced a gray mattress that police
said had semen stains from Anwar's alleged illegal sexual acts.
	   They are trying to prove that he had sex with the wife of his
former secretary and that he also tried to abuse his powers as
deputy prime minister to cover up sexual trysts.
	   The prosecution's case is based on accusations by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar,
a former driver in the politician's household.
	   While Ummi has accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife, Shamsidar Taharin, driver Azizan has claimed he was
repeatedly sodomized by Anwar.
	   Sodomy is illegal in predominantly Muslim Malaysia.

Mitchell exonerated of doping violation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Olympic track star Dennis Mitchell did not
commit a doping violation, a three-member panel unanimously agreed.
	   The USA Track and Field Doping Hearing Board's decision,
announced Tuesday after a two-day hearing last weekend in Chicago,
clears Mitchell for competition in the United States. He must be
cleared by the International Track and Field Federation, the world
governing body of the sport, to be able to compete outside the
United States.
	   ``I'm free!'' Mitchell said Tuesday night. ``It's been a long
uphill battle. Once I got to the peak of everything, I was happy it
was all over. I'm exhausted but I'm happy.
	   ``It's taken a lot of energy from me and everybody around me.
Going through the process, you never know what's going to happen,
but I had faith all along that I was going to be exonerated.''
	   Mitchell was suspended by the IAAF in July after it concluded
Mitchell's urine sample from an out-of-competition test in April
had high testosterone and epitestosterone levels.
	   A member of the gold medal-winning 400-meter relay team and
bronze medalist in the 100 in the 1992 Olympics, Mitchell has been
the chairman of the Athletes Advisory Committee of USA Track and
Field for the last two years.
	   Under its rules, the IAAF may review the decision of the Doping
Hearing Board panel.
	   ``Even going to practice is different now,'' he said. ``The
stress is off, I'm working toward next season and I'm working with
it now with a big ray of hope.
	   ``I thought the Goodwill Games (last July) would be my last
meet. Now I can continue to do what I plan to do, that is, compete
until 2001.''
	   ``I have done nothing wrong, but I am not being permitted to
compete,'' Mitchell had said in August. ``I will now proceed
through the hearing process. I can only hope that justice will
prevail and I will be rightfully exonerated.''
	   Because the case still must go before the IAAF, USA Track and
Field head Craig Masback would say only that he was happy for
Mitchell.
	   ``Athletes are innocent until proven guilty. Here is an athlete
who was exonerated,'' Masback said.
	   Mitchell, 32, was given a two-year suspension by the IAAF for
testing positive for testosterone in an out-of-competition test
April 1 at his home in Gainesville, Florida.
	   Mitchell called the suspension ``the darkest hour of my life.''
	   ``My dedication to this sport and to society would not and could
not allow me to do such a thing,'' Mitchell said. ``This is both
morally and ethically unacceptable to me. I would have never in my
wildest dreams thought this would happen to me.''
	   As the president of the USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee, the
athletes' voice in the national governing body, Mitchell has been
an outspoken advocate of keeping drugs out of the sport.
	   ``Overnight that has been taken away from me,'' Mitchell said.
``The things that have happened to me in the last few months will
forever affect all parts of my life. This can never be taken
away.''
	   Suja Thomas, Mitchell's lawyer,
	   said Mitchell's appeal would question the validity of the test
on two grounds.
	   ``Experts will look at whether or not the test itself was
correct,'' Suja Thomas, Mitchell's lawyer, said in announcing the
athlete's appeal. ``And, two, if the test was correct, what could
have caused the testosterone to epitestosterone level to increase''
above the allowable ratio of 6:1.

Japan's October current account surplus rises 21.5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with correction by Finance Ministry that year-on-year
increase is sixth, not 19th in a row in grafs 3, 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again in
October, increasing 21.5 percent from a year ago, the government
announced Wednesday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion) in October, the
Finance Ministry announced.
	   The rise marked the sixth consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus, said the ministry, which earlier said it
was the 19th in a row.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure by its trading partners
to revive its sluggish economy to import more goods and cap the
ballooning surplus.
	   A Finance Ministry official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said there was no change in the upward trend, in which a
steep fall in imports is boosting both the current account and
trade surpluses.
	   In October, exports fell 6.5 percent from the same month last
year to 4.215 trillion yen (dlrs 36.34 billion). But imports
dropped further, falling 16.8 percent to 2.693 trillion yen (dlrs
23.22 billion).
	   As a result, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 19.9 percent to
1.522 trillion yen (dlrs 13.12 billion), while the trade and
services surplus jumped 27.5 percent to 816.9 billion yen (dlrs
7.04 billion) for the month.
	   The Finance Ministry corrected its previous estimate of April
current account data to show a 0.1 percent fall instead of a 10.3
percent rise. As a result, the surplus in October has only risen
for six straight months instead of 19, the ministry said.
	   The ministry official said the current account and trade
surpluses, however, are unlikely to show rapid growth in coming
months.
	   The recent strengthening of the yen should weigh on exports,
while a series of recent measures the government has taken to
stimulate the economy is expected to support imports, he said.
	   A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive
abroad, thus cutting into dollar-denominated earnings of export-led
Japanese companies when converted into yen.
	   Earlier this month, Parliament enacted a 5.67 trillion yen (dlrs
48.88 billion) supplementary budget, a measure designed to help
boost the country's moribund economy.
	   That special budget, the third of its kind for the current
fiscal year, earmarked funds to finance part of the government's
most recent economic stimulus package, which totaled a record 24
trillion yen (dlrs 200 billion).
	   Meanwhile, Japan's service deficit in October came to 704.8
billion yen (dlrs 6.08 billion), larger than the 628.2 billion yen
(dlrs 5.42 billion) deficit registered a year earlier, the ministry
said.
	   The widening in the service deficit partly resulted from a rise
in the tourism-related deficit. Although the number of Japanese
tourists going abroad fell from a year earlier, they spent more in
foreign nations in the reporting month, the official said.

	   ``Thanks a lot for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure,'' Mission Control told the six astronauts.
	   ``It's great to be home after such an exciting mission,''
replied Commander Robert Cabana.
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
landing strip. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission Control
gave the shuttle pilots the go-ahead for an on-time touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras.
	   Cabana and his crew were glad to be back after an exhausting yet
satisfying journey that spanned nearly 12 days and 4.6 million
miles.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' Cabana said before rocketing out of orbit.
``It's been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a
space station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered
at the Kennedy Space Center for a 30th anniversary celebration.
	   Apollo 8's Jim Lovell and Bill Anders paid tribute to the
astronauts soaring overhead.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
flew to the moon on Apollo 13.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
returned to Earth in triumph late Tuesday, ending NASA's first

	   It was a rare nighttime landing.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The release of another dlrs 957 million to
Indonesia from an International Monetary Fund bailout package
should help to lift the rupiah, Indonesian Senior Economics
Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Wednesday.
	   The IMF approved the release of the funds Tuesday, after the
latest review of progress with the country's dlrs 43 billion
economic rescue package.
	   ``I think it should strengthen the rupiah. At least it will not
weaken it,'' Ginandjar told Dow Jones Newswires on the sidelines of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit here.
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 7,840 rupiah Wednesday morning in
Asia, up from 7,605 late Tuesday.

Japan announces extra dlrs 5 billion for Asian countries

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi inviting Vietnam to apply for Miyazawa
Fund in 9th graf; 10,000 Asians to receive training in 12th graf
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit

 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
announced Wednesday 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in new
low-interest loans to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their
devastated economies.
	   The loans, for projects such as roads, bridges, power stations
and airports, also will help Japan's sagging economy because the
contractors must be Japanese companies.
	   The money will go to ``countries of Asia who are doing their
utmost to reform their economic structures,'' Obuchi said.
	   It will be disbursed over three years and will be repayable over
40 years at an interest rate of 1 percent, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
	   The new loans were announced in speech delivered by Obuchi
during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. Japanese officials clearly hoped the speech would display
Japanese leadership in efforts to overcome the region's economic
crisis.
	   Other than money, however, Obuchi announced few new initiatives.
	   Japan has provided far more than other countries in assistance
to affected Asian countries _ a total of dlrs 44 billion to date.
	   It also has created a dlrs 30 billion fund unveiled by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in October for six Asian countries _
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea.
	   On Wednesday, Obuchi invited Vietnam to apply as well.
	   In the first loans under the plan, Japan's Foreign Ministry said
Obuchi told Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday
that his country will get up to 117 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion).
Details on Thailand's allocation were to be announced later
Wednesday.
	   Obuchi said Japan also will contribute 500 million yen (dlrs 4.2
million) to establish a new fund under the auspices of the United
Nations to support international organizations dealing with
problems such as environmental degradation, narcotics and organized
crime.
	   He also said Japan would provide training to an additional
10,000 Asian workers who might otherwise face layoffs at home.
	   Instead of being praised for its largesse, however, Japan has
been frequently accused of dragging the region down economically by
failing to deal promptly with its own economic problems.
	   Obuchi acknowledged that Japan's recovery is vital for growth in
the region, but added that Asia's economic turnaround also is
important for Japan's recovery.
	   He said Japan has been doing its utmost to be a driving force
for Asia's recovery, despite its economic problems.
	   ``I am confident that the Japanese economy will surely recover
and once again vigorously lead the Asian economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The prime minister stressed that dialogue and cooperation
between Japan and other Asian countries is vital to overcome the
economic crisis in the region. He proposed that Japan, China and
South Korea, as the three major countries in Northeast Asia,
increase their dialogue, with the goal of eventually forming a
``trilateral network.''
	   Obuchi is also scheduled to meet with leaders from Vietnam,
China, South Korea and Cambodia during his four-day trip.
	   He will travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he is to
visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Haitian senate certifies premier-nominee eligible to head
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In the first step towards what may
be the end of an 18-month political stalemate, the Haitian Senate
has certified premier-nominee Jacques-Edouard Alexis eligible to
head a new government.
	   In a 12-1-3 vote on Tuesday, the Senate declared the 51-year old
education minister's age, citizenship, and deeds to property in
conformity with the law.
	   However, the Senate did not rule on a controversial audit of his
management of public funds. The audit was favorable to Alexis.
	   It is likely the 83-seat Chamber of Deputies will certify his
eligibility when it votes, probably within a few days.
	   Alexis also has enough support in the lower house to win the
necessary 42 votes of confidence in his general policy statement,
the next step toward approval.
	   It is uncertain, however, whether Alexis can win the necessary
14 votes of confidence in the Senate.
	   Since June 1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned in
protest over elections allegedly slanted in favor of candidates
endorsed by former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the power
struggle between Smarth's majority party and Aristide's handpicked
successor President Rene Preval has blocked the installation of a
new premier.
	   The impasse has dashed hopes for stability fostered in 1994,
when 20,000 U.S. troops intervened to end three years of repressive
military-backed rule, restore Aristide to power, and stem the
exodus of Haitian boat people to Florida.
	   In the impasse, legislation has frozen, and there has been no
government budget for two consecutive years. Foreign and domestic
investors have shied away, and millions of dollars in foreign aid
are on hold.

Pakistan frustrated in talks with India: Foreign Minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Negotiations with its uneasy neighbor
India has been a frustrating process for Pakistan, marred by New
Delhi's intransigence and unbridled ambitions of being a ``regional
superpower,'' the foreign minister said.
	   Addressing Pakistan's retired ambassadors, Sartaj Aziz warned
Tuesday of a runaway arms race that will include a nuclear weapons
unless the international community can rein in India's ambitions.
	   In his prepared speech, Aziz said ``New Delhi's ambition to
become a regional superpower will impel it to continue with its
heavy expenditure on defense, with serious implications for our own
security.''
	   A weapons buildup in this region is particularly worrisome since
both Pakistan and India exploded underground nuclear devices last
May and declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   International pressure has been increasing for talks to pre-empt
a nuclear arms race between two neighbors who have fought three
wars in the last 51 years.
	   In October in Islamabad, they held their first high level
meeting between foreign secretaries in more than one year. The next
round is in February in New Delhi.
	   However, Aziz said he wasn't optimistic of progress and accused
India of dragging its feet on ``a meaningful dialogue.''
	   At the heart of India and Pakistan's antagonistic relationship
is the outstanding dispute over the ownership of a united Kashmir.
The Himalayan state was divided between the two countries when
British rule of the Asian subcontinent ended in 1947.
	   Since then, India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over
Kashmir.
	   ``India's nuclear tests in May 1998 . . . greatly destabilized
the South Asian region and converted Kashmir into a nuclear flash
point,'' Aziz said in his speech.
	   Pakistan will return to the negotiation table, not because it
expects India to move forward, but ``in order to expose India's
real intentions,'' he said.
	   Pakistan wants a vote be held on both sides of Kashmir, asking
Kashmiris to decide between union with India or Pakistan. India has
flatly rejected a vote, despite a 1948 United Nations resolution
calling for a vote.
	   India meanwhile accuses Pakistan of supporting militant Muslims
who have been waging a bitter secessionist movement in Indian-held
Kashmir for more than a decade, a charge Pakistan denies. Kashmir
is Hindu India's only Muslim dominated state.

	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ The Connecticut Legislature
approved building a dlrs 374 million downtown stadium for the New
England Patriots, a plan intended to invigorate the state's capital
city.
	   At mid-evening, Hartford Mayor Michael Peters held up a T-shirt
reading ``Connecticut _ 2001'' as the vote in the House of
Representatives was announced. The Patriots would play their first
game in Hartford in 2001.
	   The 97-49 vote in the House came after nearly five hours of
debate and repeated assurances from supporters that the stadium
would pay for itself through taxes.
	   About three hours later, the Senate passed the measure 27-8.
	   Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland, who negotiated the deal with
Patriots owner Robert Kraft, was expected to sign the bill in a
couple of days after his legal team gave it one last check.
	   Kraft said he was prepared to accept the offer Tuesday if the
carefully negotiated measure passed the Legislature unchanged.
	   Supporters said the plan would mean jobs and new vitality for
Hartford, a city of government offices and insurance companies that
a Boston sports columnist called ``America's filing cabinet.''
	   ``Today, we have an opportunity to open the file cabinet. Today
we have the opportunity to show that we have faith in the city of
Hartford and show that we indeed have much to offer, that it can be
much more than it is today,'' House Minority Leader Robert Ward
said.
	   The vote capped a five-year effort to bring the NFL from
suburban Boston to Connecticut. Secret talks between Rowland and
Kraft began when the team's negotiations with the Massachusetts
Legislature hit an impasse.
	   Opponents worried that it gave too much away to Kraft. Rep. John
Wayne Fox said not enough is known about the risk to the state if
cleanup of environmental contamination costs more than anticipated.
	   Fox also said the state should spend more on social services,
education and other programs that would benefit both needy people
and the state as a whole.
	   ``How do you go back to those people and say you did your job
when you spent that kind of money on a football team?'' Fox said.
	   Opponents also condemned a state guarantee on the sale of luxury
boxes and club seating and a provision that gives Kraft the
proceeds from the sale of stadium naming rights.
	   The proposal includes about dlrs 280 million to build a
68,000-seat stadium in Hartford, along the Connecticut River. The
stadium would be the anchor of a riverside development of a
convention center, housing, entertainment and shops called
Adriaen's Landing.
	   The state would spend about dlrs 55 million to build walkways,
improve roads and prepare the site, including a cleanup of coal tar
left from a coal gasification plant.
	   Also, the state would build a dlrs 15 million practice facility
for the Patriots somewhere in the state.
	   The cost is estimated at dlrs 350 million, but inflation could
push that to dlrs 374 million.
	   The NFL would still have to approve the move to Hartford from
Foxboro, Massachusetts.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
returned to Earth in triumph late Tuesday, ending NASA's first
space station-building mission.
	   It was a rare nighttime landing.
	   Endeavour swooped through the clear, chilly sky and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m.
	   ``Thanks a lot for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure,'' Mission Control told the six astronauts, calling out
each of their names, as soon as the shuttle rolled to a neat stop.
	   ``It's great to be home after such an exciting mission,''
replied commander Robert Cabana.
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
landing strip. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission Control
gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras.
	   Cabana and his crew were ready for a holiday break following
their exhausting yet satisfying journey, which spanned nearly 12
days and 4.6 million miles.
	   Before exiting the shuttle, they were warned it was a nippy 48
degrees outside. ``Must be getting close to Christmas,'' answered
Cabana.
	   Cabana had Christmas on his mind earlier in the day as well.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' Cabana said before rocketing out of orbit.
``It's been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a
space station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered
at the Kennedy Space Center for a 30th anniversary celebration.
	   Apollo 8's Jim Lovell and Bill Anders paid tribute to the
astronauts soaring overhead.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
flew to the moon on Apollo 13.

Leaders wrap up annual summit

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders signed agreements
Wednesday to liberalize their economies in an effort to encourage a
return by investors who have been scared away by the region's worst
economic crisis in a half-century.
	   But it was unclear how much impact that the measures would have.
Reports on the plans by the nine-nation Association of Southeast
Asian Nations have failed to generate much enthusiasm in world
markets.
	   The pacts include plans to speed up implementation of an ASEAN
Free Trade Area and provide incentives for investors over the next
two years.
	   The signing ceremony wrapped up a two-day summit, although ASEAN
leaders were to meet later in the day with Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Chinese Vice
President Hu Jintao.
	   Obuchi was expected to present details of 600 billion yen (dlrs
5.1 billion) in new low-interest loans he announced earlier in the
day to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their devastated
economies.
	   While the agreements stressed ASEAN's unity and cooperation in
fighting the economic crisis, there were obvious disagreements on
how best to do that.
	   In speeches that opened the summit Tuesday, some leaders urged
more open markets to woo foreign investment and others defended the
practice of shielding their economies.
	   Malaysia and Vietnam were at one end of the spectrum, warning of
the dangers of globalization, while Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines said it was inevitable and should be embraced.
	   The Asian economic crisis has led to calls for affected
countries to open their markets more quickly. Vietnamese Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai said that creates both opportunities and
problems.
	   ``Rapid economic globalization is bringing about greater market
access and new partners for development, but also putting the
weaker economies in a more vulnerable and disadvantageous
position,'' Khai said.
	   Thailand Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai urged members to further
integrate their economies with each other. ``We cannot stop the
process of globalization, but we can better prepare ourselves to
meet its challenges,'' Chuan said.
	   He emphasized that Thailand believes economic recovery is linked
to more democracy and respect for human rights.
	   That would not go over well in countries such as Vietnam, Laos
and Myanmar, which have been criticized for their human rights
records and have resisted any change in ASEAN's policy of
non-interference in members' internal affairs.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said ASEAN needs help
from the international community to deal with its economic
problems.
	   ``Strictly speaking, it's beyond us,'' he said. ``ASEAN on its
own can't solve the problems.''
	   As with the opening ceremony, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
once again watched the proceedings from the front row.
	   Although he has been assured that Cambodia will become the
group's 10th member, some leaders have insisted that it first must
fully establish the credibility of a newly formed coalition
government.
	   ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Judge throws out murder case in killing of Canadian teen tourist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAYMOND HAINEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A female juror burst into tears, the
friend of a murder victim yelled threats and others cheered Tuesday
when a Supreme Court judge freed a man accused in the rape and
stabbing murder of a 16-year-old Canadian tourist.
	   Judge Vincent Meerabux indicated prosecutors failed to present
evidence linking the defendant to the killing of 16-year-old
Rebecca Middleton, of Belleville, Ontario, who was killed the night
of July 3, 1996, after she got a ride from a party with two strange
men on a motorbike.
	   Her action was not considered dangerous in Bermuda, a British
territory that prides itself on its low crime rate with an average
three murders a year over the past decade.
	   The defendant, Justis Smith, 20, was led shaking from the
courtroom to cheers from his friends.
	   ``The process of the court has been abused and, in my view, the
prosecution has misused the processes of the court,'' Meerabux
said.
	   Rick Meens, a Middleton family friend, shouted threats as Smith
left and got involved in a shouting match with British defense
lawyer John Perry. Smith was freed and went home, Perry said.
	   Prosecutors said they were considering an appeal.
	   Meerabux ordered the jury to find Smith innocent of premeditated
murder, a charge that carries the death sentence. He noted that the
only physical evidence pointed to Smith's friend, 23-year-old Kirk
Mundy, whose semen was found in Middleton's body.
	   Mundy was tried in October 1996 and testified that he had
consensual sex with Middleton in a park before Smith attacked her.
	   In a plea bargain negotiated by then-Attorney General Elliott
Mottley, Mundy was sentenced to five years in jail as an accomplice
after the fact in the death.
	   Later, prosecutors wanted Mundy to stand trial for murder, but
two appeals court refused them, saying they could not try him
twice.
	   Mottley left Bermuda last week, after his three-year contract
expired, for his native Barbados.
	   Prosecutors tried to argue there was enough circumstantial
evidence to convict Smith.
	   One witness testified he saw Middleton accept a ride from Smith
and Mundy.
	   Another testified to seeing two men leave the area where the
attack took place shortly before Middleton's body was found.
	   Expert witnesses said they believed two people were involved in
Middleton's killing.
	   Also, a knife believed to be the murder weapon was consistent
with an incomplete set of knives found in Smith's home.
	   But the only forensic evidence came from Mundy, and Meerabux
echoed the defense's questions about why prosecutors had not called
Mundy to testify against Smith, since their charge was based on his
evidence.

Penguins 3, Lightning 2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Kevin Hatcher scored with 1:43 left in
overtime Tuesday night to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a 3-2
victory over the slumping Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Hatcher beat Corey Schwab with a wrist shot from the right
circle to hand the Lightning their 13th loss in 15 games. Tampa Bay
is 2-13 since a 6-2-1 streak ended Nov. 10.
	   Hatcher's fifth goal of the season came seconds after
Pittsburgh's Alexei Kovalev put a shot off a goalpost with an open
net. The Penguins had tied all seven of their previous overtime
games this season.
 &UR; Stars 7, Blues 3 &QC; 
	   In Dallas, Brett Hull scored twice in his first regular-season
game against his former St. Louis teammates as Dallas crushed the
Blues.
	   Hull's power play deflection late in the first period put the
Stars in front 3-2. He added his eighth goal on a breakaway late in
the second period to push Dallas' advantage to 6-3.
	   Brian Skrudland's second-period goal snapped a 3-3 tie to give
the Stars the lead for good as Dallas ran its unbeaten streak to
six (4-0-2) and improved to 11-2-2 at home.
	   Joe Nieuwendyk also had two goals as the Stars had their biggest
scoring outburst in exactly a year.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Oilers 0
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Glen Wesley scored his 100th
career goal and Arturs Irbe recorded his second consecutive shutout
as Carolina defeated slumping Edmonton.
	   The Southeast Division-leading Hurricanes are 6-1-2 in their
last nine games and opened up a season-high nine-point lead over
the second-place Florida Panthers. The Oilers are winless in their
last seven games and fell to 0-3-2 in the fifth of a seven-game
road trip.
	   Irbe, who blanked the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion
Detroit Red Wings 3-0 Saturday night, stopped 29 shots against
Edmonton for his 17th career shutout and fourth of the season,
matching his career best, set in 1994-95 with San Jose. It also was
the first time Irbe has posted consecutive shutouts in eight NHL
seasons.

Sri Lankan sports authority likely to probe Jayasinghe withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sri Lanka's sports authority is likely
to investigate sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe's abrupt withdrawal
from the Asian Games, which spoiled the nation's hope for women's
relay medals, officials said Wednesday.
	   The Sri Lankan sports officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a decision on whether to investigate the latest
controversy involving the world 200-meter silver medalist will be
taken after the games are over and the team returns home.
	   Jayasinghe had been counted on for medals not only in the
individual sprints, but in the 4 x 100 and 4 x 400 relays, which
she would have anchored.
	   But she left for home Monday, skipping the final of the 100
meters. She said she had injured a hamstring in Sunday's
semifinals.
	   On Tuesday, Sri Lanka's 4 x 100 women's relay team finished
sixth in 44.94 seconds, well behind the games record 43.36 by
winner China. Had Jayasinghe entered and run her best, the Sri
Lankan team including 400-meter gold medalist Damayanthi Darsha
would have been a likely medalist.
	   At her home in Colombo, Jayasinghe angrily denied media reports
that fear of losing to the Chinese runners had made her pull out of
the 100-meter final. She showed reporters a report from the doctor
on call at the Athletes Village in Bangkok, advising her to rest
her injury for a week.
	   ``How could I run, when I am injured?'' said Jayasinghe, 23.
	   But the reported injury wasn't the first of her problems at the
games.
	   The Sri Lankan officials said that after Jayasinghe arrived in
Bangkok Dec. 5 with other athletes, she had mostly kept to herself.
She did not turn up for practice for two days, saying she was
suffering from flu.
	   Sri Lankan team leader Daya Gunasekhara is likely to submit a
written report on the case, the officials said.
	   Last year, Jayasinghe accused unnamed Sri Lankan sports
officials of sexual harassment. Months later, she tested positive
for a steroid in an out-of-competition test. She then accused the
sports officials of trying to ruin her career.
	   The Sri Lankan track federation cleared her of the drug charges
after she said she used the drug to control her menstrual cycle.
	   But she now is awaiting an international arbitration ruling on
her drug case.

	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' he said before rocketing out of orbit. ``It's
been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space
station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered
at the Kennedy Space Center for a 30th anniversary celebration.
	   Apollo 8's Jim Lovell and Bill Anders paid tribute to the
astronauts soaring overhead.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
flew to the moon on Apollo 13.

Mexican soldiers help in search for missing reporter

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican soldiers traced the route of a
correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News who failed to return
from a mountain hike through western Mexico, while a colleague and
a friend searched the area in a chartered plane.
	   Soldiers went into the rugged Sierra Madre Occidental in Jalisco
and Nayarit states on Monday and on Tuesday to retrace the path of
Philip True, a spokesman for the office of President Ernesto
Zedillo said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The army initially thought it found True Tuesday, when soldiers
located a foreigner whose name sounded similar in the same remote
stretch of the Sierra Huichol mountains. However, the man was
identified as Philip Truhmpler, a Swiss citizen. Government sources
said Truhmpler also apparently lost his way in the mountains.
	   The army pledged to continue looking for True in three states,
including Zacatecas state to the east.
	   The Committee to Protect Journalists and International PEN, a
London-based group of writers, sent letters to Zedillo asking for
military assistance in the search for True, an experienced hiker.
	   ``Given the expertise of the Mexican military in
search-and-rescue operations, their familiarity with this rugged
terrain, and the sophisticated equipment available to them, they
stand the best chance of locating True and bringing him to
safety,'' wrote Joel Simon, the committee's Americas program
coordinator.
	   True, a 50-year-old reporter based in Mexico City has written
for the Express-News from Mexico since January 1996. He headed into
the Sierra Madre Occidental range on Nov. 29 to photograph and
write about the region's Huichol Indians. He planned to hike into
neighboring Nayarit state and to return to Mexico City last
Thursday.
	   He last was seen Dec. 4 in the village of Chalmotita, 12 miles
(20 kms) from his starting point in Tuxpan, 370 miles (590 kms)
northwest of Mexico City. He was reported missing on Sunday.
	   The spokesman for Zedillo's office said Mexican officials were
following the search effort and were keeping in close contact with
True's wife, Martha, and with local authorities across the search
area.
	   He did not know the number of soldiers involved in the search
effort.
	   A reporter from the Express-News and a friend of True's went up
in a chartered plane Tuesday to search the area, said Juanita
Serrano, a friend of the True family.
	   The U.S. consulate in Jalisco state also sent up a helicopter
Tuesday, she said.
	   ``Nobody seems to have seen him,'' Serrano said.
	   The Sierra de los Huicholes, as the area is known, is extremely
remote, with few roads and telephone service only in some larger
towns. The region is marked by deep canyons, some not adequately
marked on maps.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
returned to Earth in triumph late Tuesday, ending NASA's first
space station-building mission.
	   It was a rare nighttime landing.
	   Endeavour swooped through the clear, chilly sky and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m.
	   ``Thanks a lot for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure,'' Mission Control told the six astronauts, calling out
each of their names, as soon as the shuttle rolled to a neat stop.
	   ``It's great to be home after such an exciting mission,''
replied commander Robert Cabana, who along with his crew connected
the first two pieces of the international space station.
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
landing strip. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission Control
gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras.
	   Cabana and his crew were ready for a holiday break following
their exhausting yet satisfying journey, which spanned nearly 12
days and 4.6 million miles.
	   Before exiting the shuttle, they were warned it was a nippy 48
degrees outside. ``Must be getting close to Christmas,'' answered
Cabana.
	   Cabana had Christmas on his mind earlier in the day as well.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' he said before rocketing out of orbit. ``It's
been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space
station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered

Jets sign Meggett, expected to put Leon Johnson on IR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEMPSTEAD, New York (AP) _ David Meggett, a favorite of New York
Jets coach Bill Parcells, was signed by the team Tuesday as a free
agent.
	   Meggett, who also played for Parcells with the New York Giants
and New England Patriots _ helping both teams reach the Super Bowl
_ has not played this season while rehabilitating an ankle injury.
He was released by New England in May after he was charged with
sexually assaulting a woman in a Toronto hotel.
	   Meggett is expected to take the place of Leon Johnson, who has a
rib injury. The team would not confirm reports that Johnson will be
placed on injured reserve.
	   Parcells said late last month that he spoke with Meggett, urging
the 32-year-old kick returner-running back to make sure he is fully
healthy before attempting a return. Parcells apparently is
convinced that the NFL's career leader in punt returns (344) and
punt return yardage (3,668) can help the Jets, who are 10-4 and
already in the playoffs.
	   On Monday, Parcells lamented the lack of big plays turned in by
his special teams. He said something was bothering Johnson ``and
we'll find out what it is.''

Leaders wrap up annual summit

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders signed agreements
Wednesday to liberalize their economies in an effort to encourage a
return by investors who have been scared away by the region's worst
economic crisis in a half-century.
	   The pacts include plans to speed up implementation of an ASEAN
Free Trade Area and provide incentives for investors over the next
two years.
	   But it was unclear how much impact that they would have. Reports
on the plans by the nine-nation Association of Southeast Asian
Nations have failed to generate much enthusiasm in world markets.
	   The Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, who will host next year's
ASEAN summit, said in a speech that ``despite the differences in
the region, the ASEAN spirit is well and alive.''
	   ``We share a common understanding on the gravity of the crisis
afflicting the region and the urgency to address it,'' he said.
``We know that there are no soft options. The only way to pull
ourselves out of the crisis is to press ahead with the economic
reforms.''
	   When it was all over, the leaders came to the front of the stage
and clasped hands together in a show of unity.
	   The ceremony wrapped up a two-day summit, although ASEAN leaders
were to meet later in the day with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Chinese Vice
President Hu Jintao.
	   Obuchi was expected to present details of 600 billion yen (dlrs
5.1 billion) in new low-interest loans he announced earlier in the
day to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their devastated
economies.
	   A joint ASEAN declaration added a number of points from a
pre-summit draft, including a commitment to ``accelerating economic
and financial reforms'' and saying the ``international community
also has a responsibility to support our reform efforts through
bilateral and multilateral assistance.''
	   It also encouraged increased use of ASEAN currencies on trade
within the region and said an early-warning surveillance mechanism
has been put in place to encourage early action to avoid emerging
risks.
	   Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van Khai emphasized ASEAN's pledge
of regional cooperation.
	   ``Now we have sufficient grounds to say that the Hanoi summit is
a real bridge joining two centuries, reflecting our determination
to strengthen unity and cooperation for the future of peace,
stability, and sustainable development, responding to the
aspirations of our peoples and the world community,'' he said.
	   But there were obvious disagreements on how best to fight the
regional crisis.
	   In speeches that opened the summit Tuesday, some leaders urged
more open markets to woo foreign investment and others defended the
practice of shielding their economies.
	   Malaysia and Vietnam were at one end of the spectrum, warning of
the dangers of globalization, while Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines said it was inevitable and should be embraced.
	   As with the opening ceremony, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
again watched the proceedings from the front row.
	   Khai, who had pushed hard for Cambodia's entry into the
Southeast Asian brotherhood, reiterated that the nine-member
grouping had agreed to admit Cambodia, fulfilling its founding
pledge in 1967 to group all 10 Southeast Asian countries under the
ASEAN umbrella.
	   However, the timing of admission remains up in the air. Some
leaders have insisted that Cambodia first must fully establish the
credibility of a newly formed coalition government.
	   ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Pakistan takes kabaddi silver behind India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pakistan beat Japan 24-7 Wednesday and
won the Asian Games silver medal in the South Asian sport of
kabaddi, behind India.
	   Defending champion India already had completed its perfect 6-0
record Tuesday with victories over Sri Lanka and Japan, clinching
the gold. Pakistan finished with four victories.
	   In Wednesday's only other game, Bangladesh drew with Sri Lanka
24-24 and took the bronze medal.
	   In kabaddi, teams of 10 players each send raiders into each
other's territory. Raiders score points for each opponent tagged,
but must keep chanting ``kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi ...'' in one
breath. If the raider is held down long enough that he can't return
to his own territory in that one breath, the raider is out.
