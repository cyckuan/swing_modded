<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Up in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless in Ukraine
reached 1.2 million by the end of August, which accounting for
3.08 percent of the workforce, the Interfax news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the first eight months of 1998
increased by 50 percent over the same period of last year. The
rate in some states has reached five or six percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, 875,000 Ukranians have registered as unemployed, but
with only 47,000 job vacancies, an average 18 jobless people will
compete for each post.
</P>
<P>
Economists here attributed the soaring of the unemployment rate
to the decline in production. They said that the real number of
the jobless was much more than the official figure.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Calls for Support in Alergia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N.-organized panel
on Wednesday submitted a report to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
calling upon the international community to back Algeria in its
efforts to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Algeria deserves the support of the international community
in its efforts to combat" terrorism, and "we are satisfied that
Algerian society is capable of expressing political views and
discussing them within the framework of legality," said the
panel report.
</P>
<P>
While voicing its rejection of terrorism in all forms and
manifestations, the panel said that "Algerian terrorism was unique
in that it was not pursuing a specific objective."
</P>
<P>
"Although terrorism had its roots in Algeria, it also had
connections in other countries," said the report, which stopped
short of defining specific foreign source of terrorism in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
On September 30, 1992, the Algerian authorities had created
"special courts" to try cases of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In Algeria, a terrorist act was defined as "any violation of
State security, the territorial integrity of the country or the
stability and normal functioning of institutions by any act having
the object of sowing terror among the population and creating a
climate of insecurity by attacking persons or property."
</P>
<P>
In the light of experience with the struggle against terrorism
at the judicial level, judicial procedures had been standardized
in February 1995 through the abolition of the special courts and
abrogation of the decree on terrorism and subversion, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist and subversive crimes" are now legally defined and
are to be dealt with by the ordinary courts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, the U.N. secretary-general announced that he had
set up a Panel of Eminent Persons to visit Algeria in order to
gather information on the situation in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The panel is one of the most high-powered ever established in
the history of the United Nations, consisting of a former
president, two former prime ministers, a former state minister, a
serving attorney-general and a former permanent representative to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which spent two weeks in Algeria, was the first
international body to visit a prison and massacre sites in
Algeria, according to the 38-page report.

<HEADLINE> Hongkong Land Announced Lower Interim Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Property group Hongkong
Land announced here Wednesday an 18 percent decline in net profit
for the first half of the year to 169 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline is due largely to a general provision of 30 million
U.S. dollars against certain Southeast Asian assets, the value of
which has slumped since the beginning of the year, Chairman of the
group Simon Keswick said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Land is a property investment, management and
development group with a major portfolio in Hong Kong, and other
property and infrastructure interests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the group's balance sheet remains
strong with substantial cash and bank facilities at its disposal,
and net borrowing have fallen to 450 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Keswick noted: "The group will continue to focus on enhancing
the core office and retail properties in Hong Kong which are held
for long-term investment. Other projects are proceeding as planned
but further new commitments are being considered with caution."
</P>
<P>
"Increased competition in the group's core Hong Kong market and
the economic outlook in Asia will, inevitably, affect earnings and
property values. Nevertheless we remain confident of the long-term
attractions of both Hong Kong and regional markets," he said.

TIRANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of the opposition
Albanian Democratic Party Wednesday held another demonstration in
the Tirana's main Skanderbeg Square despite a police prohibition

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the European
open-border Schengen pact agreed here Wednesday to tighten
controls of their borders with non-member states in a bid to
combat illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the executive committee of the Schengen accord,
interior and justice ministers of the bloc pledged to step up
border checks in problem areas such as Italy's south coast which
has become a conduit for people trying to enter western Europe
from Africa, Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to fingerprint all those illegal
immigrants detained by police and to speed up their deportations,
a statement issued after the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"Many illegal immigrants are coming to Europe and every country
must take countermeasures," said German Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther, who hosted the meeting at Koenigswinter near Bonn.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that given the unstable situation in the
Serbian province of Kosovo, the Schengen states must do everything
to prevent another refugee storm like the one triggered by the
Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Under the Schengen accord, nine of western European states --
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- have already scrapped their
normal interior border controls to allow freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Greece has adopted the treaty and hopes to become a full member
later this year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Stresses Political Means to Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Wednesday stressed that priority should be
given to political and peaceful means rather than military
actions against the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"Before taking military actions against the Taliban, a chance
should be given to political and peaceful approaches in order to
protect the country's national interests," Kharrazi told the
official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Tuesday ordered the armed forces to be on the
alert and the Iranian army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC), security and Basij (volunteer) forces announced
their readiness to carry out military actions against the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Observers here regard Kharrazi's remarks as a signal that the
moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami preferred
political means to solve the tension between Iran and the Taliban
following the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the Iranian Foreign Ministry has launched
intensive diplomatic efforts at international and regional level
and the results have been sensed in terms of some pressures
exerted on the Taliban to stop massacre in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far exercised restraint, but its patience has
limits, he said, expressing hope that the Taliban would not lose
the chance which would pass like a cloud.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that as recommended by Khamenei,
all avenues would be utilized to protect the country's national
interests and the enemies would not be allowed to reach their
ominous goals.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) is in charge of
adopting plans and the staff members of the Foreign Ministry would
carry out their duties to secure stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on Tuesday called on officials of the country,
including the armed forces, to be ready for "speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior
political and security authorities deem necessary and right for
the country."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's call was echoed throughout the country by
statements of readiness to carry out his order.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC and the Iranian army have deployed over 200,000
troops along the 850-kilometer border with Afghanistan following
the tension between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army is scheduled to launch its biggest maneuver
along the border later this month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Surges in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial
production surged 1.7 percent in August, the biggest growth in
more than 14 years, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the robust growth was largely attributed to increased auto
output following the end of the General Motors strike at the end
of July. Except the production of autos and auto parts, factory
production was up a much more modest 0.1 percent in August, less
than the 0.2 percent July gain, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the U.S. economy will grow much more slowly
in the second half of this year than it did at the beginning of
1998, held down by a worsening world-wide financial crisis that
has cut sharply into the ability of American manufacturers to sell
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the 1.7 percent jump in industrial production was
the largest gain since a 2.1 percent surge in January 1984.
</P>
<P>
The August increase followed back-to-back dip in production of
1.1 percent in June and 0.4 percent in July, the biggest setbacks
in nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in factory output reflected a 3.8 percent surge at
manufacturing plants and a smaller 0.4 percent rise in output at
the nation's utilities. Output in the mining sector, which
includes coal production and oil and gas drilling, dropped 0.6
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The big rise in output at auto plants meant that U.S. factories
were operating at 81.7 percent of capacity in August, up from 80.6
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The report said production of new cars and trucks, which had
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 8.2 million
units in July, jumped to an annual rate of 13.2 million units in
August as General Motors sought to replenish stocks depleted by
the strike.

ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The joint sitting of the
Parliament completed debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) Wednesday with a pledge not to become a signatory, till all
sanctions against Pakistan are lifted.
</P>
<P>
The four-day debate, first of its kind to seek opinion of the
parliamentarians on the issue of national importance by both the
houses, remained controversial for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In his winding up speech, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz claimed
that his country would sign the treaty only if all sanctions
against it are lifted. He reiterated that the government will not
compromise on national integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that becoming a signatory to CTBT will not take away
Pakistan's nuclear deterrence and its capability.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that in case India goes for further
nuclear test Pakistan too can withdraw from the treaty and go for
more tests.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan acquired its nuclear capability with great effort and
determination and no country of the world can now take it back,"
the foreign minister said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz will make a visit to Iran Thursday to promote
conciliation and avert the dangers inherent in an escalation
between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Foreign Ministry Wednesday said that
"Pakistan is deeply concerned over the heightening of tension
between Iran and Afghanistan" which could pose a serious threat to
the peace and security of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz will be carrying a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
for Iranian president Mohammad Khatami. He will reassure the
Iranian leadership of Pakistan's commitment to the abiding
friendship between Pakistan and Iran which transcends all
vicissitudes, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
It said that the foreign minister will also emphasize the
allegation of Pakistan's interference in Afghanistan was "a
fabrication of the enemies of Pakistan-Iran friendship."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been in constant touch with the afghan leadership
as a part of its peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted the several visits by Pakistan's
delegations to Kandahar which resulted in the release and
repatriation of five Iranian prisoners, and the efforts by
Pakistan which led to the location and transport to Iran of seven
dead bodies of the 11 Iranian personnel in the northern afghan
town of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan hoped that Iran and Afghanistan will resolve their
difference through peaceful negotiations, and will continue to
cooperate closely with the two countries to defuse the present
crisis, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also urged the United Nations to play its role in
averting a potential conflict and helping the cause of peace and
security in the region.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Threaten to Ignore U.N. Embargo on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are considering
to bypass the U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya if its demand for a
fair trial for the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie
bombing is not met.
</P>
<P>
Libya has rejected a new U.S.-British decision to accept the
trial in the Hague before Scottish judges without ensuring the
safety of the accused during transit and after the trial should
they be convicted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, who had been demanding extradition of the
two Libyan suspects to either of them, insisted that their offer
is non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The two were accused of blowing up an American plane in 1988
over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. The
U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on the country in
1992 after it failed to hand over the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers meeting at the Arab League (AL)
headquarters Wednesday are discussing a draft resolution on
supporting Libya's demand for necessary guarantees for the two
Libyans before the trial, according to the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposes stopping compliance with the sanctions
unless the "parties concerned" agree to negotiate with Libya on
these guarantees.
</P>
<P>
It also asserts the commitment of Arab states to ending the
enforcement of the embargo on Libya as soon as agreement is
reached on the guarantees and arrangements involved between the
sides.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution supports Libya's right to claim damages
for human and material losses, sustained as a result of the
seven-year U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This development is widely viewed by observers as an attempt by
the 22-member Arab forum to court back Libya.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli on Sunday decided to disband its Ministry of Arab Unity
in the coming few weeks, a move revealing its grudge against Arab
failure to have the U.N. sanctions against the Afro-Arab country
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The AL last week reaffirmed its support for Libya's request for
"guarantees" on the fate of the two Libyan suspects before
Tripoli delivers them for trial. AL chief Esmat Abdel Meguid
Sunday proposed that Libya and the Netherlands sign a pre-trial
agreement spelling out details surrounding the prosecution of
the Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
In a recent TV interview, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has
rapped Arab countries for not showing enough support to Libya,
while praising the Organization of African Unity for backing its
demand for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and
Britain fail to make compromise.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian MP Asks Israel to Apologize for Raiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Abbas Zaki, member of the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), demanded Wednesday the
Israeli government to apologize for raiding his house by Israeli
troops near Hebron, according to Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of the Israel Defense Force conducted a raid on
Zaki's house in Sa'ir Village in the Hebron District Tuesday
night. They said weapons were recovered from the house.
</P>
<P>
Two body guards of Zaki were also arrested by the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between security departments of
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), PLC members,
PNA Cabinet ministers and certain other senior Palestinian
officials should be provided special treatment as VIPs and they
even can travel freely through Israel.
</P>
<P>
Zaki strongly denounced the raid on his house and the arrests
of his two body guards by the Israeli soldiers and asked the PNA
to take counter measures.
</P>
<P>
This act of Israel was a total violation of the signed
agreements and the Israeli government should apologize for that,
Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA also criticized on Wednesday the action
taken by the Israeli side against a PLC member.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the preventive security in the West
Bank, also voiced his strong criticism about the raid.
</P>
<P>
"The dignity of any Palestinian regardless of his position is
a sacred issue. I believe what took place affected us all and
reflects the range of the occupation's silliness. Raiding the
house of a Palestinian official is a rejected act and this gives
the proof the level of moral degradation among the leaders of the
occupation," Rajoub said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Armenia Signs Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Armenia Wednesday
signed four cooperation agreements concerning tourism, high
education and preventing dual taxation, the Lebanese National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Armenian Prime Minister Armen Darbinyan and his
Lebanese counterpart Rafik Hariri attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said at a news conference later that commercial exchange
between the two countries is limited and hoped bilateral ties will
be boosted through the agreements signed and to be signed in the
near future and visits by two countries' businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the positive role played by Lebanese of
Armenian origin in constructing Lebanon, a country which is
recovering from a 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can make more efforts for promoting ties between
Lebanon and Armenia," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
Some 110,000 Armenian emigrants are living in Lebanon, and
18 percent of Lebanese industrial enterprises are owned by
them.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Darbinyan expressed hope that the two
countries further develop their relations, especially in the
economic sector, adding the agreements signed with Lebanon will
pave the way for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Lebanon's economy ministry, trade
between Lebanon and Armenia stood at about 1 million U.S. dollars
each year.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian premier came to Lebanon Wednesday morning for
a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he will also meet with Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berry.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader to Visit UK, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State,
General Abdulsalami Abubakar will visit Britain later this month,
where he will leave for New York of the U.S., the official News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A source at the presidency in Abuja, however, told Xinhua that
the visit can not be confirmed until next Monday.
</P>
<P>
NAN quoted diplomatic sources in London as saying that
Abubakar will arrive in London on September 22 and go to New York
the following day.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar will meet with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and other government officials during his stay in London, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said recently that he is
interested in meeting with Abubakar during the general's visit to
the New York to attend the 53rd session of the United Nations
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian military officials have been banned from visits to
both Britain and the United States, as part of the sanctions
imposed on Nigeria since 1995, when the then military government
of late General Sani Abacha hanged author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority activists on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's relations with the West have improved since Abubakar
took office in June after the death of Abacha. The new leader's
liberal policy and commitment to democratization has won him the
understanding and support of world leaders.

<HEADLINE> Robertson: S-300 Missiles to Aggravate Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Defense
Secretary George Robertson said here Wednesday that the planned
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in
Cyprus would aggravate the tension on the divided island republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Greek counterpart, Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Robertson said that the S-300 missiles did not add
anything to the security of Cyprus, but added to the existing
tension, and the priority now was to reduce tension there.
</P>
<P>
But Tsohatzopoulos did not agree with Robertson's such views,
saying that Britain should look at the wider picture of reducing
armaments with the final aim of fully demilitarizing Cyprus, which
has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Athens believed that a ban on military flights over Cyprus
could be the first step in reducing armaments, and this first step
could then be expanded to other areas, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has rejected the proposal of imposing a military
flight ban over Cyprus, has threatened to use force to prevent the
installation of the missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has insisted that it has the right to strengthen its
defense capacity to deal with Turkey's threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has a joint defense pact with Cyprus, has warned
that such strikes by Turkey would be a cause for war.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Crown Prince Calls for Progress in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, Wednesday urged the United States` Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross to reactivate the long-stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hassan called for collective efforts by all the concerned
parties to overcome the obstacles facing implementation of the
U.S. proposal, which asks Israel to further evacuate from 13.1
percent of the occupied West Bank in order to enliven the peace
process that has been deadlocked since last March.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after his meeting with Hassan and Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh, Ross said that the meeting was fruitful,
adding that "We really try to change the atmosphere in the
region, especially when it comes to making peace."
</P>
<P>
Ross in his statement admitted that he achieved some progress
with the Palestinians and Israel over the implementation of the
U.S. proposal, but "there remain differences and we have to find
ways to overcome those differences."
</P>
<P>
He added that he will stay in the region for a couple of days
for this aim.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here earlier Wednesday to brief Hassan on the
results of his current visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last Wednesday in a new effort to
break the differences between Israel and the Palestinians on a
host of issues contained in the U.S. proposal. He met Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat respectively during the past days.
</P>
<P>
However, both Palestinian and Israeli government officials have
 said that Ross failed to realize his aim of the current mission
which has been his first since May.
</P>
<P>
Jordan supports the Palestinians to establish an independent
state with its capital in Jerusalem, but it also sticks to a
policy of normalizing ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been the second and last Arab country that signed peace
treaty with Israel. The first one is Egypt.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send Relief Mission to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
agreed to send an assessment mission to Afghanistan on condition
that the Taliban guarantee safety of the U.N. personnel in the
Asian country, and the condition was accepted by Taliban, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, which does not hold Afghanistan's United Nations seat
even though it controls most of the country, also asked the United
Nations to mediate to defuse tensions with Iran over the recent
killings of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has agreed, on an exceptional basis, to
send an assessment mission to Bamiyan," which fell to Taliban on
Sunday, he said, adding that "this is conditional on the Taliban
authorities guaranteeing the safety of U.N. personnel."
</P>
<P>
The conditional agreement was reached following a Tuesday
meeting in New York between senior U.N. officials and Taliban
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, and Kieran Prendergast,
under-secretary-general for political affairs, met with Taliban
representatives to discuss a number of important issues.
</P>
<P>
The conditions cover direct flights by U.N. planes into and
out of Bamiyan, the escorts by Taliban for the U.N. mission
during its duration in Afghanistan, security constraints to
prevent U.N. personnel from staying overnight, the free
utilization of U.N. communication equipment and the mission's
unfettered access to all affected populations in the Bamiyan
area, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the senior U.N. officials made it clear
to the Taliban representatives that the proposed mission "is
being undertaken on an exceptional basis and does not imply a
full scale return of United Nations international staff to
Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For this to occur certain conditions have to be met," he
said, referring to earlier U.N. decision to withdraw its workers
from Afghanistan for security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, the Taliban representative in New York informed
the U.N. that he had got agreement from his authorities in
Kandahar, Afghanistan, to all these points," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general will undertake further high-level
consultations in the margins of the General Assembly meeting next
week," the spokesman, adding that "the secretary-general is also
currently considering other measures to help reduce tension in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Tuesday condemned the killing of the
Iranian diplomats and said the act had seriously increased
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has maintained a buildup of some 70,000 troops and a lot
of military equipment in its borders with Afghanistan while
Iranian leaders said that Iran would use whatever means they saw
fit to respond to the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan
following the Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UN Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday recommended that the Security Council
extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) through the end of October
to allow time for negotiations on the issues of "contested
tribes."
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan welcomed
the completion of the identification of 147,000 applicants for
participation in the referendum, which will allow the people of
Western Sahara to choose between independence or integration
with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General expressed concern that the question of
the identification of applicants from three "contested groups"
remains outstanding.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be dealt with in talks brokered by the
Secretary-General's Personal Envoy James Baker III which are
expected to begin by late September or early October.
</P>
<P>
"My personal envoy is pursuing his contacts with the parties
so that he may assess whether the Settlement Plan can be carried
out in its present form or whether there may be adjustments to
it, acceptable to the parties, that would improve the chances of
implementing it," the U.N. chief said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"If he concludes that, even with such adjustments, the Plan
cannot be carried out, he would advise me on other courses of
action that could be pursued," he added.
</P>
<P>
 Western Sahara was a Spanish colony until 1976 when Spain
withdrew and released itself from international responsibility
over the territory, which was subsequently occupied by Morocco,
a move opposed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia
el-Hamra and Rio de Oro POLISARIO Front. The POLISARIO took up
arms against Moroccan forces.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, the Security Council approved a
settlement plan for Western Sahara in 1990, under which there
would be a ceasefire, and a transitional period during which the
Special representative of the Secretary-General would be in charge
of all matters relating to the referendum, assisted by MINURSO.
</P>
<P>
 The plan was eventually bogged down by the two parties's
differences on certain groups of people to be included in the
referendum.

JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Wednesday warned Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) not to harm Israeli citizens, noting that Israel's
response will be harsh.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during his inspection of Israeli Army
central command, Mordechai said that Israel is aware of the
terrorist threats and the defense establishment is prepared in
Israel, the occupied territories and along the borders.

said that on the eve of Jewish new year, which will begin
on Sunday, the army has significantly boosted its forces in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel will continue its activities against
terrorist groups and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces killed two Hamas military wing
leaders near the West Bank city of Hebron last Thursday. And
Hamas leaders have threatened to avenge the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said on
Wednesday that those who ordered the killing of Hamas members
should be afraid of their safety.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Hamas will continue its attacks against
Israeli targets until all of Palestine is liberated.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Solicits Support for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy
to Angola Issa Diallo made an appeal Wednesday to diplomatic
missions of various countries in Angola, hoping that they will
continue their effort in helping the country realize a lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Diallo briefed reporters on
what he had done since he assumed his post on August 28 this
year. He has made contacts and consultations mainly with the
diplomatic missions concerning the current peace process
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Angola is "very difficult", he
admitted, adding that since the Angolan government has severed
relations whth opposition leader President Jonas Savimbi of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and
regards the breakaway group "the UNITA Renovation Committee" as
the only dialogist, the Peace Process United Commission meeting
is no longer able to be held, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy pointed out that at a time when Angola peace
process has come to a deadlock and the relations between the two
warring sides are becoming increasingly strained, he can not but
ask the international community, the various diplomatic missions
in particular, to continue their effort and help remove the
obstacles on the road to peace process.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the resolution on Angola adopted by the United
Nations Tuesday which extends the term of office of the U.N.
observers group for an extra 30 days, Diallo held that so long as
the various sides who signed the Lusaka Peace Protocol show a
sufficient political will, the peace process can surely be
completed during this period.
</P>
<P>
However, Diallo still refused to give any comment on such
issues concerning the suspension of UNITA members in the
government and parliament and Angolan government's request for
the U.N. to recognize the breakaway "UNITA Renovation Committee".
</P>
<P>
The special envoy has over the past few days conducted
intensive secret talks with the diplomatic missions. He met
Tuesday with U.S. ambassador Donald Steinberg and Germany's
ambassador Hendrik Done who is also European Union representative
in Angola. Hendrik Done expressed European Union's pledge to give
Angola assistance.

<HEADLINE> Romania Joins EU Stance on Banning Yugoslav Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania Wednesday decided
to join the European Union (EU) joint stance on the ban on flights
carried out by the Yugoslav airlines.
</P>
<P>
According to the Foreign Ministry of Romania, the decision was
made in accordance with the resolutions adopted within the U.N.
Security Council and it wants to make more sensitive Yugoslavia's
leadership against the requirement to use the dialogue and find a
peaceful solution to diffuse the crisis over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Ministry thinks that being in line with this
sanction is a clear political sign of an undoubtful blame for the
escalation of violence and discriminations in the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, stated the ministry, such an association with
the objectives of a joint stance established by the Council of the
EU is in harmony with the provisions of the Agreement on Romania's
association with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers decided in Salzburg, Austria, ten days
ago to ban flights by Yugoslav airlines to EU airports as part of
the sanctions against Belgrade crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the total population. For years, ethnic Albanian
separatists have been engaged in a violent campaign intended to
separate Kosovo from Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MP Urges Withdrawal of Troops From DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan member of
parliament has said that he will table a motion on September 17
to urge the government to withdraw its troops from the Democratic
Repubic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
After the conference at which President Yoweri Museveni
addressed the Parliament about the Congo issue Wednesday
afternoon, Hon. Aggren Awori, a MP from the Busia district, told
Xinhua that he will table the motion at the next session of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
He listed three main reasons for the withdrawal of troops.
</P>
<P>
First, it is against international laws. Uganda's involvement
is not respect for other countries' integrity and sovereignty.
Second, Ugandan troops do not have wide support and lastly, if
the Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked Ugandan districts,
Ugandan troops should be deployed on Ugandan territory, not on
the soil of DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hon, Muyonga Samuel, a MP from the eastern district
of Mbale, said this motion will not be passed because it will not
win the support of the majority of MPs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Awori tabled a motion calling for ceasefire and peace
talks between the rebels and Museveni.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Involvement in Congo (K) Involuntary: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that his country's involvement in the crisis in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is involuntary.
</P>
<P>
This is forced on Uganda, the president said while addressing
Parliament about this issue Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kampala's involvement in Congo, indirectly last year and a bit
more directly this year, is mainly because of the threats to
Uganda's security that emanate from there in the form of National
Army for the Liberation of Uganda in the past and more recently,
Allied Democratic Forces, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's two involvements in Congo in recent times started
with its involvement in Rwanda, he pointed out, explaining that
this involvement is only to prevent genocide.
</P>
<P>
"We are in Congo primarily for our security. We have not yet
taken part, in any serious way, in the fighting that has been
going on there. If we were to do so in future, it would be
because the region has failed to solve the problem, especially,
the problem of our security," he said.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, he also expressed his opposition to
invitation for foreign involvement, arguing that foreign
involvement in Congo is due to the internal weaknesses of the
Congolese leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the time of National Resistance Movement, we have faced
a lot of problems, both internal and with our neighbors, but we
never call on neighbors or distant friends to help us with
troops, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
To ask foreigners to defend one is to promulgate a motion of
no confidence in oneself, Museveni said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Intercontinental Ballistic Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday launched
an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk cosmodrome
in northern Russia, the Strategic Missile Force said.
</P>
<P>
The PC-12M missile, launched at 15:10 local time (11:10GMT),
hit an exercise target in the area of Kamchatka in the Far East,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The success of the launch meant that the missile, commissioned
more than 10 years ago, remained intact in terms of its technical
and military qualities.
</P>
<P>
"The launch once again convincingly proved the high combat
readiness of the force and the reliability and technical readiness
of intercontinental ballistic missiles of this type," the press
service of the Strategic Missile Force said.
</P>
<P>
"All the previous 57 launches of Topol systems were successful
after the completion of joint flight tests," the press service
added.
</P>
<P>
The launch was part of Russia's efforts to prolong the service
life of the Topol missile system, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel: EU Wants to Preserve Privileged Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel pledged Wednesday that the European Union would continue to
support Russia on its difficult path to democracy and market
economy despite its current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We Europeans do not want a fair-weather partnership with
Russia. We want rather to continue and deepen the privileged
partnership between the EU and Russia also during difficult
times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's statement was made before a EU troika trip to Moscow
on Thursday to be made by foreign ministers of Britain, Austria
and Germany, which hold the previous, current and upcoming EU
presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel, he and his Austrian and British
counterparts would focus their discussions with Russian leaders on
how the EU could help Russia in overcoming the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
While pledging continued support for Moscow, Kinkel also stress
that nobody could now spare the painful decisions that must be
made by Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Russian issue, the three EU foreign ministers
would also seek coordination with Russian leaders on the Kosovo
crisis, Kinkel said.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Recaptures 4 Villages in Northern S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has recaptured four villages in northern Sierra
Leone earlier this week, killing at least 10 rebels, a report
from Freetown said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local missionaries as saying that heavily
armed ECOMOG troops from Guinea recaptured the villages of
Kanathortor, Kakula, Kathiteneh and Yabaha in Kambia district in
northern Sierra Leone Monday.
</P>
<P>
No civil casualties were reported, as most residents had fled
after rebel troops attacked and seized the villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Kambia is part of ECOMOG's efforts to mop up
the rebels, which were chased out of Freetown in February but has
since held out in the northern and eastern parts of the country,
where difficult terrains are hampering ECOMOG's operations.

<HEADLINE> Syria Supports Ending Embargo on Libya, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa Wednesday called for lifting the U.N. sanctions against
Libya and Iraq, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa, addressing the inaugural session of the Arab League
Foreign Ministerial Council here Wednesday, underlined the
necessity of ending the Libya-West crisis over the 1988 Lockerbie
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's backing of the resolutions adopted
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on
ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and
Britain fail to make compromise.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa voiced support for the Libyan requests for guarantees
that ensure a fair trial of the two Libyan suspects accused of
blowing up an American plane in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya's failure to extradite them incurred the U.N. air, arms
and diplomatic embargo on the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa also called for lifting the international embargo imposed
against Iraq "according to a specific schedule." Meanwhile, he
urged Baghdad to comply with the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions against Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of neighboring Kuwait, which can be removed only after
Iraq fully complies with U.N. resolutions and destroys its weapons
of mass destruction.

ADDIS ABABA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Ethiopian
Government Spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said Wednesday that
Ethiopians are still suffering great hardship in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Addis Ababa, the office said more
Ethiopians are being tortured, abused and expelled from Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The office quoted 27-year-old Desta Atsbaha, one of the

beaten at a police station and his 8,000 Nakfa (about 1,100 US
Dollars) in a bank had been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Over 15,000 Ethiopians have been expelled from Eritrea since a
border dispute between the two countries erupted last May,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea said earlier up to 17,000 of its nationals had been
expelled from Ethiopia since the border dispute. However,
Ethiopia said those deported for security reasons were only
around 4,000.

<HEADLINE> Museveni: Security in Uganda Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni told Parliamentarians Wednesday afternoon that security
in the country has been improved.
</P>
<P>
In a speech which briefed the MPs on the crisis of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Museveni said insecurity is
diminishing as the capacity of the state grows.
</P>
<P>
"Ugandans should be grateful to the National Resistance
Movement for building a powerful and cohesive national army which
is the base of all the growing security. It is a remarkable
achievement bearing in mind the starting point following the
collapse of the old Ugandan army," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in the north cannot establish a zone of control as
the Sudan People's Liberation Army has done in Sudan or the
Congolese rebels are doing in eastern Congo. This demonstrates
the capacity of the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF).
</P>
<P>
That is why the rebels resort to terrorist attacks on
defenseless civilians rather than bon the barracks of the UPDF, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The security task now is to stop these cowardly attacks on
civilians, he said, arguing that to compromise with terrorism is
to invite more of it.
</P>
<P>
With the support of MPs for the army and security in general,
he said he is confident that terrorism will eventually be
eliminated from his country.

<HEADLINE> Surviving Iranian Diplomat Appears on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The only Iranian diplomat
who survived the massacre by the Afghan Taliban militia appeared
on Iran's state-run television Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Allahdad Shahsavan Qare-Husseini, head of the secretariat of
the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif and in charge of the
refugee affairs, was shot and wounded in the massacre on August
8, but survived the killing.
</P>
<P>
Qare-Husseini said that the Taliban forces entered the Iranian
consulate by force around 1200 local time and confined all the
10 Iranians, including nine diplomats and a correspondent of the
official news agency IRNA, in the consulate to a basement.
</P>
<P>
He said that three Taliban soldiers opened fire on the
Iranians inside the basement, but fortunately he stood beside a
table and fell under the table and survived the killing.
</P>
<P>
Qare-Husseini fled the city after disguising himself as a local
Afghan citizen and entered Iran through Herat, western
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of six iranian diplomats and a correspondent of IRNA
were flown to Tehran Monday night, but the fate of another two
Iranian diplomats were not known. Iran believes that they are
still alive and are in the hands of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been massing troops along Iran-Afghan borders for
military manoeuvres, apparently getting ready for a show-down with
the Afghan Taliban regime which has seized almost 90 percent of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths of the diplomats while the
Taliban has denied direct involvement of the killing.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Stresses Political Means to Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Wednesday stressed that priority should be
given to political and peaceful means rather than military
actions against the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"Before taking military actions against the Taliban, a chance
should be given to political and peaceful approaches in order to
protect the country's national interests," Kharrazi told the
official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Tuesday ordered the armed forces to be on the
alert and the Iranian army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC), security and Basij (volunteer) forces announced
their readiness to carry out military actions against the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Observers here regard Kharrazi's remarks as a signal that the
moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami preferred
political means to solve the tension between Iran and the Taliban
following the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the Iranian Foreign Ministry has launched
intensive diplomatic efforts at international and regional level
and the results have been sensed in terms of some pressures
exerted on the Taliban to stop massacre in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far exercised restraint, but its patience has
limits, he said, expressing hope that the Taliban would not lose
the chance which would pass like a cloud.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that as recommended by Khamenei,
all avenues would be utilized to protect the country's national
interests and the enemies would not be allowed to reach their
ominous goals.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) is in charge of
adopting plans and the staff members of the Foreign Ministry would
carry out their duties to secure stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on Tuesday called on officials of the country,
including the armed forces, to be ready for "speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior
political and security authorities deem necessary and right for
the country."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's call was echoed throughout the country by
statements of readiness to carry out his order.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC and the Iranian army have deployed over 200,000
troops along the 850-kilometer border with Afghanistan following
the tension between Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army is scheduled to launch its biggest maneuver
along the border later this month.

<HEADLINE> NATO Again Turns Heat on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The NATO allies flexed their
muscles again on Wednesday by drafting a resolution to be put to
the United Nations for its mandate for intervention in the
crisis-ridden Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official told the press that the draft resolution,
co-sponsored by France and Britain, would be introduced to the
U.N. Security Council within a few days.
</P>
<P>
The resolution will blame the violence by Serbian security
forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and set certain demands
for Belgrade to meet, according to the official who asked to
remain unnamed.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the resolution, the official added, is to show that
there were limits to the patience of the international community
and that NATO stands ready to use military options if need be to
reinforce conditions for a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has been studying a full range of
options in an effort to help solve the crisis that has reportedly
killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands of people
living in makeshift shelters in Kosovo forests and mountains with
Winter fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official said that Russia, that previously warned to
veto a U.N. resolution threatening the use of force in Kosovo,
showed its deep concern after its ambassador was briefed on
Wednesday on the status quo in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, French President Jacques Chirac told Russian
President Boris Yeltsin that he wanted the six-nation Contact
Group to meet on Kosovo next week with a new U.N. resolution.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arabs Threaten to Ignore U.N. Embargo on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are considering
to bypass the U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya if its demand for a
fair trial for the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie
bombing is not met.
</P>
<P>
Libya has rejected a new U.S.-British decision to accept the
trial in the Hague before Scottish judges without ensuring the
safety of the accused during transit and after the trial should
they be convicted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, who had been demanding extradition of the
two Libyan suspects to either of them, insisted that their offer
is non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The two were accused of blowing up an American plane in 1988
over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. The
U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on the country in
1992 after it failed to hand over the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers meeting at the Arab League (AL)
headquarters Wednesday are discussing a draft resolution on
supporting Libya's demand for necessary guarantees for the two
Libyans before the trial, according to the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposes stopping compliance with the sanctions
unless the "parties concerned" agree to negotiate with Libya on
these guarantees.
</P>
<P>
It also asserts the commitment of Arab states to ending the
enforcement of the embargo on Libya as soon as agreement is
reached on the guarantees and arrangements involved between the
sides.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution supports Libya's right to claim damages
for human and material losses, sustained as a result of the
seven-year U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This development is widely viewed by observers as an attempt by
the 22-member Arab forum to court back Libya.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli on Sunday decided to disband its Ministry of Arab Unity
in the coming few weeks, a move revealing its grudge against Arab
failure to have the U.N. sanctions against the Afro-Arab country
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The AL last week reaffirmed its support for Libya's request for
"guarantees" on the fate of the two Libyan suspects before
Tripoli delivers them for trial. AL chief Esmat Abdel Meguid
Sunday proposed that Libya and the Netherlands sign a pre-trial
agreement spelling out details surrounding the prosecution of
the Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
In a recent TV interview, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has
rapped Arab countries for not showing enough support to Libya,
while praising the Organization of African Unity for backing its
demand for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and
Britain fail to make compromise.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian MP Asks Israel to Apologize for Raiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Abbas Zaki, member of the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), demanded Wednesday the
Israeli government to apologize for raiding his house by Israeli
troops near Hebron, according to Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of the Israel Defense Force conducted a raid on
Zaki's house in Sa'ir Village in the Hebron District Tuesday
night. They said weapons were recovered from the house.
</P>
<P>
Two body guards of Zaki were also arrested by the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between security departments of
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), PLC members,
PNA Cabinet ministers and certain other senior Palestinian
officials should be provided special treatment as VIPs and they
even can travel freely through Israel.
</P>
<P>
Zaki strongly denounced the raid on his house and the arrests
of his two body guards by the Israeli soldiers and asked the PNA
to take counter measures.
</P>
<P>
This act of Israel was a total violation of the signed
agreements and the Israeli government should apologize for that,
Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA also criticized on Wednesday the action
taken by the Israeli side against a PLC member.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the preventive security in the West
Bank, also voiced his strong criticism about the raid.
</P>
<P>
"The dignity of any Palestinian regardless of his position is
a sacred issue. I believe what took place affected us all and
reflects the range of the occupation's silliness. Raiding the
house of a Palestinian official is a rejected act and this gives
the proof the level of moral degradation among the leaders of the
occupation," Rajoub said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and Armenia Wednesday
signed four cooperation agreements concerning tourism, high
education and preventing dual taxation, the Lebanese National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Armenian Prime Minister Armen Darbinyan and his
Lebanese counterpart Rafik Hariri attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said at a news conference later that commercial exchange
between the two countries is limited and hoped bilateral ties will
be boosted through the agreements signed and to be signed in the
near future and visits by two countries' businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the positive role played by Lebanese of
Armenian origin in constructing Lebanon, a country which is
recovering from a 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can make more efforts for promoting ties between
Lebanon and Armenia," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
Some 110,000 Armenian emigrants are living in Lebanon, and
18 percent of Lebanese industrial enterprises are owned by
them.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Darbinyan expressed hope that the two
countries further develop their relations, especially in the
economic sector, adding the agreements signed with Lebanon will
pave the way for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Lebanon's economy ministry, trade
between Lebanon and Armenia stood at about 1 million U.S. dollars
each year.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian premier came to Lebanon Wednesday morning for
a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he will also meet with Lebanese President

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader to Visit UK, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State,
General Abdulsalami Abubakar will visit Britain later this month,
where he will leave for New York of the U.S., the official News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A source at the presidency in Abuja, however, told Xinhua that
the visit can not be confirmed until next Monday.
</P>
<P>
NAN quoted diplomatic sources in London as saying that
Abubakar will arrive in London on September 22 and go to New York
the following day.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar will meet with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and other government officials during his stay in London, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said recently that he is
interested in meeting with Abubakar during the general's visit to
the New York to attend the 53rd session of the United Nations
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian military officials have been banned from visits to
both Britain and the United States, as part of the sanctions
imposed on Nigeria since 1995, when the then military government
of late General Sani Abacha hanged author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority activists on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's relations with the West have improved since Abubakar
took office in June after the death of Abacha. The new leader's
liberal policy and commitment to democratization has won him the
understanding and support of world leaders.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Public Opinion Favors Censuring Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Public opinion after the
release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report remains in
favor of censuring President Bill Clinton rather than impeaching
him or seeking his resignation.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News-New York Times poll released Tuesday and a CNN/USA
Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday show Clinton maintaining a
robust job approval rating above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
A majority of Americans still oppose ousting Clinton from
office, with the CBS-Times poll finding 58 percent against
beginning impeachment hearings over his affair with a White House
intern and effort to cover it up, and 64 percent saying they do
not think Clinton should resign. But 57 percent believe Congress
should censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today poll found 45 percent favoring a reprimand or
censure, but allowing Clinton to remain in office. However, 50
percent favored congressional hearings to investigate the charges
in the report and, among likely voters, 58 percent favored
hearings.
</P>
<P>
The public remains critical of Clinton's personal behavior.
Sixty-six percent of those polled in the CBS-Times survey said
Clinton does not share the moral values that most Americans try to
live by, and 45 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
And the CNN-USA Today survey found a statistical dead heat over
who people preferred to have more influence over the direction the
nation takes in the next year: 44 percent Clinton and 43 percent
the Republicans in Congress. Among likely voters, 50 percent
wanted the Republican to have more influence and 38 percent
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The same survey of likely voters found 48 percent are likely
for vote Democratic in the upcoming congressional elections and 47
percent Republican.
</P>
<P>
The CBS-Times telephone poll of 1,813 adults conducted between
September 12-14 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today survey of 1,028 adults September 14-15 had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The subgroup
of 401 likely voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Crown Prince Calls for Progress in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, Wednesday urged the United States` Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross to reactivate the long-stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hassan called for collective efforts by all the concerned
parties to overcome the obstacles facing implementation of the
U.S. proposal, which asks Israel to further evacuate from 13.1
percent of the occupied West Bank in order to enliven the peace
process that has been deadlocked since last March.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after his meeting with Hassan and Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh, Ross said that the meeting was fruitful,
adding that "We really try to change the atmosphere in the
region, especially when it comes to making peace."
</P>
<P>
Ross in his statement admitted that he achieved some progress
with the Palestinians and Israel over the implementation of the
U.S. proposal, but "there remain differences and we have to find
ways to overcome those differences."
</P>
<P>
He added that he will stay in the region for a couple of days
for this aim.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here earlier Wednesday to brief Hassan on the
results of his current visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last Wednesday in a new effort to
break the differences between Israel and the Palestinians on a
host of issues contained in the U.S. proposal. He met Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat respectively during the past days.
</P>
<P>
However, both Palestinian and Israeli government officials have
 said that Ross failed to realize his aim of the current mission
which has been his first since May.
</P>
<P>
Jordan supports the Palestinians to establish an independent
state with its capital in Jerusalem, but it also sticks to a
policy of normalizing ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been the second and last Arab country that signed peace
treaty with Israel. The first one is Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Wednesday warned Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) not to harm Israeli citizens, noting that Israel's
response will be harsh.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during his inspection of Israeli Army
central command, Mordechai said that Israel is aware of the
terrorist threats and the defense establishment is prepared in
Israel, the occupied territories and along the borders.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he also demands that Palestinian National
Authority do what is necessary to help Israel prevent terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Army Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz
said that on the eve of Jewish new year, which will begin
on Sunday, the army has significantly boosted its forces in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel will continue its activities against
terrorist groups and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces killed two Hamas military wing
leaders near the West Bank city of Hebron last Thursday. And
Hamas leaders have threatened to avenge the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said on
Wednesday that those who ordered the killing of Hamas members
should be afraid of their safety.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Hamas will continue its attacks against
Israeli targets until all of Palestine is liberated.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Solicits Support for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy
to Angola Issa Diallo made an appeal Wednesday to diplomatic
missions of various countries in Angola, hoping that they will
continue their effort in helping the country realize a lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Diallo briefed reporters on
what he had done since he assumed his post on August 28 this
year. He has made contacts and consultations mainly with the
diplomatic missions concerning the current peace process
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Angola is "very difficult", he
admitted, adding that since the Angolan government has severed
relations whth opposition leader President Jonas Savimbi of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and
regards the breakaway group "the UNITA Renovation Committee" as
the only dialogist, the Peace Process United Commission meeting
is no longer able to be held, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy pointed out that at a time when Angola peace
process has come to a deadlock and the relations between the two
warring sides are becoming increasingly strained, he can not but
ask the international community, the various diplomatic missions
in particular, to continue their effort and help remove the
obstacles on the road to peace process.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the resolution on Angola adopted by the United
Nations Tuesday which extends the term of office of the U.N.
observers group for an extra 30 days, Diallo held that so long as
the various sides who signed the Lusaka Peace Protocol show a
sufficient political will, the peace process can surely be
completed during this period.
</P>
<P>
However, Diallo still refused to give any comment on such
issues concerning the suspension of UNITA members in the
government and parliament and Angolan government's request for
the U.N. to recognize the breakaway "UNITA Renovation Committee".
</P>
<P>
The special envoy has over the past few days conducted
intensive secret talks with the diplomatic missions. He met
Tuesday with U.S. ambassador Donald Steinberg and Germany's
ambassador Hendrik Done who is also European Union representative
in Angola. Hendrik Done expressed European Union's pledge to give
Angola assistance.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia to Increase Cooperation in Conversion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Russian-Chinese
Conversion and Cooperation Forum opened here on Wednesday at the
initiation of the intergovernmental Russian-Chinese commission on
trade- economic and scientific-technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 experts from the Russian and Chinese sides take part
in the forum sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Russian International
Center for Scientific- Cultural Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The forum is aimed at boosting cooperation between Russia and
China in converting military enterprises into civilian use and
establishing direct links between the two countries' enterprises
and organizations interested in effectively using leading
technology and advanced products.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent the forum a congratulating
telegram, noting that military-civilian conversion is becoming an
important part of the world's peace and disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese and Russian experts made an important
step by probing new ways for the conversion cooperation, and that
the peaceful use of military technology would promote world peace,
social development and human progress in the world.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in his congratulating letter,
said the purpose of the big forum held by Chinese and Russian
experts in Moscow is to expand areas of cooperation, establish
long-term and steady relations between the two countries, and to
cooperate in major projects of military- to-civilian conversion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening forum, Mikhail Titolenko, chairman of
the Russia-China Association of Friendship, pointed out that there
is still a huge potential in bilateral cooperation in the
scientific-technical, economic-trade areas, to be tapped by the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chinese charge d'affaires ad interim in Russia Wang Fengxiang
noted that this forum is a serious attempt to search for new areas
of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. It shows that the
Chinese-Russian strategic partnership is being strengthened and
developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, headed by Qi Huaiyuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
Countries, consists of more than 80 experts from various fields,
including aviation and space, shipping, electronics, nuclear
industry, petrochemistry and metallurgy and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening ceremony, Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yury Maslyukov met with Qi Huaiyuan and other leaders of
the Chinese delegation in the government building.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MP Urges Withdrawal of Troops From DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan member of
parliament has said that he will table a motion on September 17
to urge the government to withdraw its troops from the Democratic
Repubic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
After the conference at which President Yoweri Museveni
addressed the Parliament about the Congo issue Wednesday
afternoon, Hon. Aggren Awori, a MP from the Busia district, told
Xinhua that he will table the motion at the next session of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
He listed three main reasons for the withdrawal of troops.
</P>
<P>
First, it is against international laws. Uganda's involvement
is not respect for other countries' integrity and sovereignty.
Second, Ugandan troops do not have wide support and lastly, if
the Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked Ugandan districts,
Ugandan troops should be deployed on Ugandan territory, not on
the soil of DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hon, Muyonga Samuel, a MP from the eastern district
of Mbale, said this motion will not be passed because it will not
win the support of the majority of MPs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Awori tabled a motion calling for ceasefire and peace
talks between the rebels and Museveni.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Involvement in Congo (K) Involuntary: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that his country's involvement in the crisis in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is involuntary.
</P>
<P>
This is forced on Uganda, the president said while addressing
Parliament about this issue Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kampala's involvement in Congo, indirectly last year and a bit
more directly this year, is mainly because of the threats to
Uganda's security that emanate from there in the form of National
Army for the Liberation of Uganda in the past and more recently,
Allied Democratic Forces, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's two involvements in Congo in recent times started
with its involvement in Rwanda, he pointed out, explaining that
this involvement is only to prevent genocide.
</P>
<P>
"We are in Congo primarily for our security. We have not yet
taken part, in any serious way, in the fighting that has been
going on there. If we were to do so in future, it would be
because the region has failed to solve the problem, especially,
the problem of our security," he said.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, he also expressed his opposition to
invitation for foreign involvement, arguing that foreign
involvement in Congo is due to the internal weaknesses of the
Congolese leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the time of National Resistance Movement, we have faced
a lot of problems, both internal and with our neighbors, but we
never call on neighbors or distant friends to help us with
troops, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
To ask foreigners to defend one is to promulgate a motion of
no confidence in oneself, Museveni said.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Recaptures 4 Villages in Northern S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has recaptured four villages in northern Sierra
Leone earlier this week, killing at least 10 rebels, a report
from Freetown said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local missionaries as saying that heavily
armed ECOMOG troops from Guinea recaptured the villages of
Kanathortor, Kakula, Kathiteneh and Yabaha in Kambia district in
northern Sierra Leone Monday.
</P>
<P>
No civil casualties were reported, as most residents had fled
after rebel troops attacked and seized the villages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Kambia is part of ECOMOG's efforts to mop up
the rebels, which were chased out of Freetown in February but has
since held out in the northern and eastern parts of the country,
where difficult terrains are hampering ECOMOG's operations.

UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N.
Secretary-General's Special Representative on the Situation of
Children in Armed Conflict said today that more than half of the
persons displaced by the conflict in Kosovo were children.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Olara Otunnu, who visited Kosovo
province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia over the weekend,
described the plight of some 300,000 people who have been
displaced by military operations in the last several months. Of
these people, he said, approximately 50,000 were presently in
the open in the mountains and forests.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said to avoid the present catastrophe from degenerating
into an even more dramatic tragedy, there should be at least a
ceasefire and a halt to hostilities. That, Otunnu said, could
allow the beginning of serious discussions about educational
institutions and how to return the displaced children to school.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for a significant international presence
on the ground to serve as a confidence building measure for people
to return to their homes.

<HEADLINE> Syria Supports Ending Embargo on Libya, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa Wednesday called for lifting the U.N. sanctions against
Libya and Iraq, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa, addressing the inaugural session of the Arab League
Foreign Ministerial Council here Wednesday, underlined the
necessity of ending the Libya-West crisis over the 1988 Lockerbie
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's backing of the resolutions adopted
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on
ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The OAU in its summit meeting in June adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the U.S. and
Britain fail to make compromise.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa voiced support for the Libyan requests for guarantees
that ensure a fair trial of the two Libyan suspects accused of
blowing up an American plane in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya's failure to extradite them incurred the U.N. air, arms
and diplomatic embargo on the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa also called for lifting the international embargo imposed
against Iraq "according to a specific schedule." Meanwhile, he
urged Baghdad to comply with the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions against Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of neighboring Kuwait, which can be removed only after
Iraq fully complies with U.N. resolutions and destroys its weapons
of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Declare Palestinian State in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat Wednesday stressed his determination to
declare an independent Palestinian state in 1999 and called for a
new Arab summit to tackle the Mideast peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the opening of the 110th Arab League Foreign
Ministerial Council meetings, Arafat appealed to Arab and Islamic
countries to buttress up the Palestinian aspiration for setting up
their own state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the declaration of the Palestinian state
will get recognition and support from the Arab and Islamic world,"
Arafat told the Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has threatened to declare the
Palestinian state on May 4, 1999 when the deadline set by the 1993
Oslo agreement for final settlement expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said an Arab summit that involves all Arab leaders
should be convened to unify stances on the Arab-Israeli peace
process and confront various challenges and threats from the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have languished for 18 months
over Israeli settlement building and long-delayed withdrawal from
the West Bank. U.S. mediation attempts have been frustrated by
Israel's rejection of a 13 percent redeployment plan.
</P>
<P>
Arafat blamed Israel for "playing tricks and stalling for time"
to avoid implementing its signed agreement with the Arab sides and
further redeployment from the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Washington to go public with the details of its
peace initiative to pressure Israel into fully accepting it.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
earlier Wednesday in Egypt's northern coastal city of Alexandria,
Arafat said the U.S. is still trying to extract an Israeli yes on
its initiative to break the Mideast peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"But it was still far for the U.S. to obtain this Israeli
approval despite that the Palestinians agreed on this initiative
six month ago," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Alexandria Tuesday evening for a two-day
visit to Egypt for talks with Mubarak and to attend the Arab
League meeting in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Trial Re-Opens on Agusta/Dassault Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the
Agusta/Dassault corruption case, dubbed "trial of the century",
re-opened on Wednesday after a delay of eight days.
</P>
<P>
The Appeals Court of Belgium, the highest court in the country,
rejected all but two procedural demands put forward by the defense
that caused the delay after the trial went underway on September
2.
</P>
<P>
The court finally allowed separation of trials of two
defendants, Johan Delanghe and Serge Dassault.
</P>
<P>
The 10 other defendants, including former NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, will continue to sit in the dock of
the appeals court through the trial in a multi-billion franc
bribery case that also involved two other former Belgian cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Claes was forced to resign from the top NATO post in October
1995 when allegations rose that the Belgian foreign minister, who
had previously served as economy minister and was then responsible
for comparing rival bids among helicopter manufacturers, received
bribery.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that is expected to last well into December, will
investigate cash gifts allegedly given by the Italian company
Agusta and the French company Dassault in the late 1980s after
they won multi-billion franc contracts to supply Belgium with 46
A-106 helicopters and to refit the electronic systems in the
country's F-16 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
The death of Socialist Party politician Andre Cools in 1991 led
to the discovery of irregularities in party funds that in turn led
to a report alleging that the granting of the 1988 contract to
Agusta was tainted with illegal acts and suggesting that technical
evaluations of the rival bids were handled by Belgian cabinet
members to make the Agusta bid more favorable.
</P>
<P>
The Agusta probe then led to allegations over Dassault
contract.
</P>
<P>
All the 12 accused, including ex-Belgian defense minister Guy
Coeme and former Socialist Party Chairman Guy Spitaels, have
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
One key defendant, former Agusta President Raffaelo Teti, died
from a heart attack late last month.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Upbeat about German Growth Despite Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank,
Bundesbank, said Wednesday that despite the financial crises in
Asia and Russia, Germany is still on course for solid growth
thanks to rising domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
In its September economic report, the Bundesbank noted that
risks faced by the German economy in foreign business had been
offset by positive development at home such as an increasing
willingness of companies to invest as well as rising private
consumption buoyed by an improving outlook for more jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthened economic activities stand at the moment on a
broader basis compared with 1997 when Germany's growth was
supported first of all by the strongly increasing exports," the
Bundesbank report said.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank also did not see Germany's slowdown in the
second quarter as a negative signal for the economy, noting that
this had been largely expected given the extremely strong growth
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1998 as a whole, Germany's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by 1.5 percent from the level of the second
half of last year, the central bank said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Calls for Support in Alergia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N.-organized panel
on Wednesday submitted a report to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
calling upon the international community to back Algeria in its
efforts to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Algeria deserves the support of the international community
in its efforts to combat" terrorism, and "we are satisfied that
Algerian society is capable of expressing political views and
discussing them within the framework of legality," said the
panel report.
</P>
<P>
While voicing its rejection of terrorism in all forms and
manifestations, the panel said that "Algerian terrorism was unique
in that it was not pursuing a specific objective."
</P>
<P>
"Although terrorism had its roots in Algeria, it also had
connections in other countries," said the report, which stopped
short of defining specific foreign source of terrorism in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
On September 30, 1992, the Algerian authorities had created
"special courts" to try cases of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In Algeria, a terrorist act was defined as "any violation of
State security, the territorial integrity of the country or the
stability and normal functioning of institutions by any act having
the object of sowing terror among the population and creating a
climate of insecurity by attacking persons or property."
</P>
<P>
In the light of experience with the struggle against terrorism
at the judicial level, judicial procedures had been standardized
in February 1995 through the abolition of the special courts and
abrogation of the decree on terrorism and subversion, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist and subversive crimes" are now legally defined and
are to be dealt with by the ordinary courts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, the U.N. secretary-general announced that he had
set up a Panel of Eminent Persons to visit Algeria in order to
gather information on the situation in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The panel is one of the most high-powered ever established in
the history of the United Nations, consisting of a former
president, two former prime ministers, a former state minister, a
serving attorney-general and a former permanent representative to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which spent two weeks in Algeria, was the first
international body to visit a prison and massacre sites in
Algeria, according to the 38-page report.

<HEADLINE> Schengen States Agree to Tighten External Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the European
open-border Schengen pact agreed here Wednesday to tighten
controls of their borders with non-member states in a bid to
combat illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the executive committee of the Schengen accord,
interior and justice ministers of the bloc pledged to step up
border checks in problem areas such as Italy's south coast which
has become a conduit for people trying to enter western Europe
from Africa, Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to fingerprint all those illegal
immigrants detained by police and to speed up their deportations,
a statement issued after the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"Many illegal immigrants are coming to Europe and every country
must take countermeasures," said German Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther, who hosted the meeting at Koenigswinter near Bonn.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that given the unstable situation in the
Serbian province of Kosovo, the Schengen states must do everything
to prevent another refugee storm like the one triggered by the
Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Under the Schengen accord, nine of western European states --
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- have already scrapped their
normal interior border controls to allow freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Greece has adopted the treaty and hopes to become a full member
later this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Surges in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial
production surged 1.7 percent in August, the biggest growth in
more than 14 years, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the robust growth was largely attributed to increased auto
output following the end of the General Motors strike at the end
of July. Except the production of autos and auto parts, factory
production was up a much more modest 0.1 percent in August, less
than the 0.2 percent July gain, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the U.S. economy will grow much more slowly
in the second half of this year than it did at the beginning of
1998, held down by a worsening world-wide financial crisis that
has cut sharply into the ability of American manufacturers to sell
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the 1.7 percent jump in industrial production was
the largest gain since a 2.1 percent surge in January 1984.
</P>
<P>
The August increase followed back-to-back dip in production of
1.1 percent in June and 0.4 percent in July, the biggest setbacks
in nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in factory output reflected a 3.8 percent surge at
manufacturing plants and a smaller 0.4 percent rise in output at
the nation's utilities. Output in the mining sector, which
includes coal production and oil and gas drilling, dropped 0.6
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The big rise in output at auto plants meant that U.S. factories
were operating at 81.7 percent of capacity in August, up from 80.6
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The report said production of new cars and trucks, which had
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 8.2 million
units in July, jumped to an annual rate of 13.2 million units in
August as General Motors sought to replenish stocks depleted by
the strike.

<HEADLINE> Robertson: S-300 Missiles to Aggravate Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Defense
Secretary George Robertson said here Wednesday that the planned
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in
Cyprus would aggravate the tension on the divided island republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Greek counterpart, Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Robertson said that the S-300 missiles did not add
anything to the security of Cyprus, but added to the existing
tension, and the priority now was to reduce tension there.
</P>
<P>
But Tsohatzopoulos did not agree with Robertson's such views,
saying that Britain should look at the wider picture of reducing
armaments with the final aim of fully demilitarizing Cyprus, which
has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Athens believed that a ban on military flights over Cyprus
could be the first step in reducing armaments, and this first step
could then be expanded to other areas, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has rejected the proposal of imposing a military
flight ban over Cyprus, has threatened to use force to prevent the
installation of the missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has insisted that it has the right to strengthen its
defense capacity to deal with Turkey's threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has a joint defense pact with Cyprus, has warned
that such strikes by Turkey would be a cause for war.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send Relief Mission to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
agreed to send an assessment mission to Afghanistan on condition
that the Taliban guarantee safety of the U.N. personnel in the
Asian country, and the condition was accepted by Taliban, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, which does not hold Afghanistan's United Nations seat
even though it controls most of the country, also asked the United
Nations to mediate to defuse tensions with Iran over the recent
killings of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has agreed, on an exceptional basis, to
send an assessment mission to Bamiyan," which fell to Taliban on
Sunday, he said, adding that "this is conditional on the Taliban
authorities guaranteeing the safety of U.N. personnel."
</P>
<P>
The conditional agreement was reached following a Tuesday
meeting in New York between senior U.N. officials and Taliban
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, and Kieran Prendergast,
under-secretary-general for political affairs, met with Taliban
representatives to discuss a number of important issues.
</P>
<P>
The conditions cover direct flights by U.N. planes into and
out of Bamiyan, the escorts by Taliban for the U.N. mission
during its duration in Afghanistan, security constraints to
prevent U.N. personnel from staying overnight, the free
utilization of U.N. communication equipment and the mission's
unfettered access to all affected populations in the Bamiyan
area, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the senior U.N. officials made it clear
to the Taliban representatives that the proposed mission "is
being undertaken on an exceptional basis and does not imply a
full scale return of United Nations international staff to
Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For this to occur certain conditions have to be met," he
said, referring to earlier U.N. decision to withdraw its workers
from Afghanistan for security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, the Taliban representative in New York informed
the U.N. that he had got agreement from his authorities in
Kandahar, Afghanistan, to all these points," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general will undertake further high-level
consultations in the margins of the General Assembly meeting next
week," the spokesman, adding that "the secretary-general is also
currently considering other measures to help reduce tension in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Tuesday condemned the killing of the
Iranian diplomats and said the act had seriously increased
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has maintained a buildup of some 70,000 troops and a lot
of military equipment in its borders with Afghanistan while
Iranian leaders said that Iran would use whatever means they saw
fit to respond to the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan
following the Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UN Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday recommended that the Security Council
extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) through the end of October
to allow time for negotiations on the issues of "contested
tribes."
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan welcomed
the completion of the identification of 147,000 applicants for
participation in the referendum, which will allow the people of
Western Sahara to choose between independence or integration
with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General expressed concern that the question of
the identification of applicants from three "contested groups"
remains outstanding.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be dealt with in talks brokered by the
Secretary-General's Personal Envoy James Baker III which are
expected to begin by late September or early October.
</P>
<P>
"My personal envoy is pursuing his contacts with the parties
so that he may assess whether the Settlement Plan can be carried
out in its present form or whether there may be adjustments to
it, acceptable to the parties, that would improve the chances of
implementing it," the U.N. chief said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"If he concludes that, even with such adjustments, the Plan
cannot be carried out, he would advise me on other courses of
action that could be pursued," he added.
</P>
<P>
 Western Sahara was a Spanish colony until 1976 when Spain
withdrew and released itself from international responsibility
over the territory, which was subsequently occupied by Morocco,
a move opposed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia
el-Hamra and Rio de Oro POLISARIO Front. The POLISARIO took up
arms against Moroccan forces.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, the Security Council approved a
settlement plan for Western Sahara in 1990, under which there
would be a ceasefire, and a transitional period during which the
Special representative of the Secretary-General would be in charge
of all matters relating to the referendum, assisted by MINURSO.
</P>
<P>
 The plan was eventually bogged down by the two parties's
differences on certain groups of people to be included in the
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Romania Joins EU Stance on Banning Yugoslav Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania Wednesday decided
to join the European Union (EU) joint stance on the ban on flights
carried out by the Yugoslav airlines.
</P>
<P>
According to the Foreign Ministry of Romania, the decision was
made in accordance with the resolutions adopted within the U.N.
Security Council and it wants to make more sensitive Yugoslavia's
leadership against the requirement to use the dialogue and find a
peaceful solution to diffuse the crisis over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Ministry thinks that being in line with this
sanction is a clear political sign of an undoubtful blame for the
escalation of violence and discriminations in the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, stated the ministry, such an association with
the objectives of a joint stance established by the Council of the
EU is in harmony with the provisions of the Agreement on Romania's
association with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers decided in Salzburg, Austria, ten days
ago to ban flights by Yugoslav airlines to EU airports as part of
the sanctions against Belgrade crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the total population. For years, ethnic Albanian
separatists have been engaged in a violent campaign intended to
separate Kosovo from Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Intercontinental Ballistic Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday launched
an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk cosmodrome
in northern Russia, the Strategic Missile Force said.
</P>
<P>
The PC-12M missile, launched at 15:10 local time (11:10GMT),
hit an exercise target in the area of Kamchatka in the Far East,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The success of the launch meant that the missile, commissioned
more than 10 years ago, remained intact in terms of its technical
and military qualities.
</P>
<P>
"The launch once again convincingly proved the high combat
readiness of the force and the reliability and technical readiness
of intercontinental ballistic missiles of this type," the press
service of the Strategic Missile Force said.
</P>
<P>
"All the previous 57 launches of Topol systems were successful
after the completion of joint flight tests," the press service
added.
</P>
<P>
The launch was part of Russia's efforts to prolong the service
life of the Topol missile system, Interfax said.

BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel pledged Wednesday that the European Union would continue to
support Russia on its difficult path to democracy and market
economy despite its current crisis.

times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's statement was made before a EU troika trip to Moscow
on Thursday to be made by foreign ministers of Britain, Austria

presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel, he and his Austrian and British
counterparts would focus their discussions with Russian leaders on
how the EU could help Russia in overcoming the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
While pledging continued support for Moscow, Kinkel also stress
that nobody could now spare the painful decisions that must be
made by Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Russian issue, the three EU foreign ministers
would also seek coordination with Russian leaders on the Kosovo
crisis, Kinkel said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Again Turns Heat on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The NATO allies flexed their
muscles again on Wednesday by drafting a resolution to be put to
the United Nations for its mandate for intervention in the
crisis-ridden Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official told the press that the draft resolution,
co-sponsored by France and Britain, would be introduced to the
U.N. Security Council within a few days.
</P>
<P>
The resolution will blame the violence by Serbian security
forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and set certain demands
for Belgrade to meet, according to the official who asked to
remain unnamed.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the resolution, the official added, is to show that
there were limits to the patience of the international community
and that NATO stands ready to use military options if need be to
reinforce conditions for a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has been studying a full range of
options in an effort to help solve the crisis that has reportedly
killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands of people
living in makeshift shelters in Kosovo forests and mountains with
Winter fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official said that Russia, that previously warned to
veto a U.N. resolution threatening the use of force in Kosovo,
showed its deep concern after its ambassador was briefed on
Wednesday on the status quo in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, French President Jacques Chirac told Russian
President Boris Yeltsin that he wanted the six-nation Contact
Group to meet on Kosovo next week with a new U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Hill, United States peace envoy to Kosovo, also
briefed NATO ambassadors the same day on the ongoing intense
diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia to Increase Cooperation in Conversion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Russian-Chinese
Conversion and Cooperation Forum opened here on Wednesday at the
initiation of the intergovernmental Russian-Chinese commission on
trade- economic and scientific-technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 experts from the Russian and Chinese sides take part
in the forum sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Russian International
Center for Scientific- Cultural Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The forum is aimed at boosting cooperation between Russia and
China in converting military enterprises into civilian use and
establishing direct links between the two countries' enterprises
and organizations interested in effectively using leading
technology and advanced products.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent the forum a congratulating
telegram, noting that military-civilian conversion is becoming an
important part of the world's peace and disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese and Russian experts made an important
step by probing new ways for the conversion cooperation, and that
the peaceful use of military technology would promote world peace,
social development and human progress in the world.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in his congratulating letter,
said the purpose of the big forum held by Chinese and Russian
experts in Moscow is to expand areas of cooperation, establish
long-term and steady relations between the two countries, and to
cooperate in major projects of military- to-civilian conversion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening forum, Mikhail Titolenko, chairman of
the Russia-China Association of Friendship, pointed out that there
is still a huge potential in bilateral cooperation in the
scientific-technical, economic-trade areas, to be tapped by the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chinese charge d'affaires ad interim in Russia Wang Fengxiang
noted that this forum is a serious attempt to search for new areas
of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. It shows that the
Chinese-Russian strategic partnership is being strengthened and
developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, headed by Qi Huaiyuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
Countries, consists of more than 80 experts from various fields,
including aviation and space, shipping, electronics, nuclear
industry, petrochemistry and metallurgy and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening ceremony, Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Yury Maslyukov met with Qi Huaiyuan and other leaders of
the Chinese delegation in the government building.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N.
Secretary-General's Special Representative on the Situation of
Children in Armed Conflict said today that more than half of the
persons displaced by the conflict in Kosovo were children.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Olara Otunnu, who visited Kosovo
province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia over the weekend,
described the plight of some 300,000 people who have been
displaced by military operations in the last several months. Of
these people, he said, approximately 50,000 were presently in
the open in the mountains and forests.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said to avoid the present catastrophe from degenerating
into an even more dramatic tragedy, there should be at least a
ceasefire and a halt to hostilities. That, Otunnu said, could
allow the beginning of serious discussions about educational
institutions and how to return the displaced children to school.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for a significant international presence
on the ground to serve as a confidence building measure for people
to return to their homes.

<HEADLINE> Trial Re-Opens on Agusta/Dassault Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the
Agusta/Dassault corruption case, dubbed "trial of the century",
re-opened on Wednesday after a delay of eight days.
</P>
<P>
The Appeals Court of Belgium, the highest court in the country,
rejected all but two procedural demands put forward by the defense
that caused the delay after the trial went underway on September
2.
</P>
<P>
The court finally allowed separation of trials of two
defendants, Johan Delanghe and Serge Dassault.
</P>
<P>
The 10 other defendants, including former NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, will continue to sit in the dock of
the appeals court through the trial in a multi-billion franc
bribery case that also involved two other former Belgian cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Claes was forced to resign from the top NATO post in October
1995 when allegations rose that the Belgian foreign minister, who
had previously served as economy minister and was then responsible
for comparing rival bids among helicopter manufacturers, received
bribery.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that is expected to last well into December, will
investigate cash gifts allegedly given by the Italian company
Agusta and the French company Dassault in the late 1980s after
they won multi-billion franc contracts to supply Belgium with 46
A-106 helicopters and to refit the electronic systems in the
country's F-16 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
The death of Socialist Party politician Andre Cools in 1991 led
to the discovery of irregularities in party funds that in turn led
to a report alleging that the granting of the 1988 contract to
Agusta was tainted with illegal acts and suggesting that technical
evaluations of the rival bids were handled by Belgian cabinet
members to make the Agusta bid more favorable.
</P>
<P>
The Agusta probe then led to allegations over Dassault
contract.
</P>
<P>
All the 12 accused, including ex-Belgian defense minister Guy
Coeme and former Socialist Party Chairman Guy Spitaels, have
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
One key defendant, former Agusta President Raffaelo Teti, died
from a heart attack late last month.

WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Wednesday that Americans want to put the Lewinsky
matter behind them and want him to go on.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's joint news conference with visiting president of the
Czech Republic Vaclav Havel Wednesday was dominated by questions
about Clinton's relation with former White House intern Monic
Lewinsky.
</P>

Clinton said Americans "want to put it behind them and they

</P>

Asked whether he still had the moral authority to lead, the
president said firmly, "That is something you have to demonstrate
every day."
</P>
<P>
"I think that the right thing for our country and the right
thing for all people concerned is not to get mired in all the
details here but for me to focus on what I did, to acknowledge it,
to atone for it and then to work on my family, where I still have
a lot of work to do -- difficult work -- and to lead this
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his legal defenses "should not obscure" the fact that
he is sorry for his acts.

<HEADLINE> First U.S. Web-Only Bank Set to Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The first nationally
chartered bank in the United States to operate exclusively over
the World Wide Web is scheduled to go on line later this month or
early October, Computerworld reported on its online news
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CompuBank, a Houston-based bank backed by 6 million U.S.
dollars in private funding, will offer several advantages over
existing Web-based banks or PC-based banking service. It will
charge no monthly fee and require no minimum balance for its basic
checking account, although a deposit of 200 U.S. dollars will be
required. Customers will be able to pay an unlimited number of
bills electronically for a flat fee of 5.5 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Web-only bank will also offer customers the ability to view
their statements and images of processed checks online. Customers
can also view their accounts from any browser that supports
128-bit encryption. There is no need for the proprietary PC
software many banks require online customers to use.
</P>
<P>
One downside is that, because of its small size, CompuBank owns
no automatic teller machines (ATM) of its own, forcing many
customers to pay fees if they use ATMs owned by other banks. But
the bank is looking for ATM networks that don't charge a fee to
outsiders and recommends its customers do withdrawals by using
their CompuBank ATM cards as debit cards at stores.
</P>
<P>
CompuBank also has to prove that its back-office systems can
handle hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of customers,
Computerworld said. Currently, its Web site boasts only a static
billboard that says the service is "coming soon."
</P>
<P>
According to Computerworld, CompuBank has got approval to
operate as a bank in the country's all 50 states and the U.S.
territories from the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency in July. At
the same time, it qualified for coverage by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, which means the federal government insures
each customer's savings up to 100,000 dollars.

HANOI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has exported 2.98
million tonnes of rice so far this year, according to reports on

Traders have quoted 25 percent broken grade rice at 280

There are almost no orders for the five percent broken grade

country late this year and in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia wants to import rice on deferred payment
which is almost unacceptable for Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Meet Housing Construction Goals, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China can meet its goals for
housing construction this year, Vice-Minister of Construction Song
Chunhua said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident about meeting this year's goals for housing
construction and believe that this sector will help boost the
national economic growth rate by more than one percentage point,"
he said at a meeting on China's economy and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build 212 million square meters of efficiency
residential housing this year, with a total investment exceeding
170.3 billion yuan, according to Song.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's total investment in real
estate rose 15 percent on a yearly basis in the first seven months
this year, with investment in residential housing development
during the period surging 22.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Housing sales in terms of floor space for the January-July
period jumped 51.3 percent from a year ago, while
sales volume for the seven-month period soared 65.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Song said China's housing market has huge potential and the
market potential for efficiency housing, greatly needed by medium-
and low-income families, is still greater.
</P>
<P>
"Housing consumption will continue to rise in the time to
come," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's per capita living housing space for urban residents
will reach nine square meters by the end of this year, up from 8.8
square meters last year, according to Song.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Grain Output to Reach 30 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's grain yield this year
will reach 30 million tons, five million tons fewer than last
year, Minister of Agriculture-Industry Complexes Boris Supikhanov
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Supikhanov told the Ukraine parliament that the figure was
higher than what was previously forecast by economists.
</P>
<P>
According to Ukrainian Interfax News Agency, Supikhanov
attributed this year's reduction in grain output to droughts in
eastern and central regions and excessive rains in the west and
north. Meanwhile rains and storms destroyed one million hectares
of crops, and dramatically reduced the output of two million
hectares of fields.
</P>
<P>
Supikhanov also said more than 14 million tons of winter wheat
have been harvested so far, ensuring this year's bread supply.
Last year's winter wheat output was 18.4 million tons, Supikhanov
added.

<HEADLINE> President: Invitation to Turkish Cypriots to Join </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides
said here Thursday that the Greek Cypriot side's invitation to
the Turkish Cypriots to join the negotiating team for Cyprus'
European Union (EU) membership talks remains open.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks when he received the credentials of
new head of EU delegation in Cyprus Donato Giovanni Chiarini.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of relations with the EU, he said
that "the road toward accession offers us new possibilities and
new avenues for cooperation between the two communities of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest desire that our Turkish Cypriot compatriots
share with us the task of preparing Cyprus for EU membership," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clerides extended the invitation to Turkish Cypriots last
March to nominate representatives to join as full members of the
negotiating team for Cyprus' accession.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts of the EU presidency and the European Commission
to convince the Turkish Cypriot community to accept our invitation
did not succeed. The invitation remains in any case, open," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for the full EU membership in 1990. The EU
started accession talks with the Cypriot government in March this
year. The Turkish Cypriot side refused to join the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the process and prospect of accession
is an important stimulus which should facilitate the efforts of
finding a solution to the political problem which has tormented
my country and its people for so many years," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "our primary goal is to find a peaceful
solution to the Cyprus problem based on the bizonal, bicommunal
federation, in accordance with the U.N. resolutions and the High
Level Agreements reached between the two sides in 1977 and 1979."
</P>
<P>
"Membership to the EU is a natural choice, dictated by the
history and culture of the island and constitutes one of the main
pillars of our foreign policy," Clerides noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace talks,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar FM to Attend U.N. General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw left here Thursday afternoon for the United States to attend
the 53rd session of the General Assembly of the United Nations
opened at the U.N. Headquarters in New York last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U Ohn Gyaw will join the two-week long general debate of the
General Assembly beginning next Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended 12th Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Durban,
South Africa, the Myanmar minister expressed that his country
agrees to the UN reform proposal initiated by Secretary General
Kofi Annan, saying that the U.N. should be strengthened and
restructured in such a way that it responds to the needs and
aspirations of its membership, particularly of developing member
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of expansion and reform of the U.N. Security
Council, Myanmar objected the move to exclude the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) countries, claiming that the Council should be
enlarged by not less than 11 new members and that such an
enlargement should be based on the principles of sovereign
equality of states, equitable geographical distribution and
rotation.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the question of veto, Myanmar called for limited
use of it, welcoming the proposal of total annihilation of veto
power, presented by Nelson Mandela, chairman of the last 12th NAM
Summit and president of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his attendance at the general assembly, U Ohn Gyaw is
also expected to continue his dialogue with the Kofi Annan on the
current situation in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Annan proposed to Myanmar leader Senior-General Than Shwe last
month to send a special U.N. emissary shortly to look into the
current political development in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Than Shwe responded that there was no reason for such
a rushed visit, saying that the dialogue between the Myanmar
government and the Secretary General could continue in New York in
September when his Foreign Minister joins the General Assembly's
general debate.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government and the U.N. had maintained the dialogue
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Envoy of the U.N. Secretary General
Alvaro de Soto visited Yangon and met with Than Shwe.
</P>
<P>
He then had discussions with the Myanmar foreign minister on
matters of mutual interest and also met with leaders of the
National League for Democracy (NLD) including Aung San Suu Kyi,
the party's general secretary.

<HEADLINE> Germany Leaves Interest Rates on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, announced Thursday that the country's key interest
rates would remain unchanged as market expectations indicated
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark discount rate and Lombard rate have been
unchanged at 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent respectively since April
1996. The third key rate, the repurchase rate (repo), has stood at
3.3 percent since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Many financial experts in Frankfurt had expected that the
Bundesbank would also keep the interest rates on hold until the
transfer of power to the European Central Bank (ECB) in January
next year.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development on Thursday, ECB President Wim
Duisenberg rejected suggestions that the ECB would seek to
establish its credibility by imposing excessively high interest
rates in the single European currency zone.
</P>
<P>
The ECB would be no more restrictive than necessary in terms of
setting interest rates, said Duisenberg at a German bank
conference in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ECB chief has called on countries which are due
to launch the single European currency, the euro, next January to
introduce more structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely a stable euro could be maintained in the long
run without a solid financial and economic policy, he said.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Updates with president's plans hke091765 --Philippine President Vows to Save Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada vowed Thursday to do his best to avoid the closure of
Philippine Airlines, saying the shutdown would affect the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
The closure would affect not only the 8,000 employees of the
airlines and their families but also the country, Estrada said
after a late night meeting with the labor union of the airlines.
</P>
<P>
"I will go everything that I can in order to keep Philippine
Airlines going. The fate of thousands of workers rests on this...I
am worried about the thousands of workers who will be affected,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will talk with Lucio Tan, the major owner of
the airlines, on Friday to convince the two parties to agree on a
"middle ground" to save the 57-year-old national flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
However, the president is opposed to any government bailout for
the strike-bound firm, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines announced that the company will close next
Wednesday following the breakdown of talks between the management
and the labor union which represents the pilots and employees who
went on strike in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The airlines has offered the labor union a 20 percent ownership
of the airlines and three seats in the 15-member board of
directors. It also proposed to give each employee 60,000 shares of
stock worth 300,000 pesos (6,849 U.S. dollars at current rate).
</P>
<P>
The union first accepted the proposal, but then reversed its
stand, sending the negotiations to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines, born on March 15, 1941, was the first
airlines in Asia. It became the first Asian carrier to fly across
the Pacific in 1946.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Rejects PM Nomination for Sixth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagabandy on Thursday rejected the ruling union's
nomination of Galsanputsagiin Ganhuyag as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the sixth time for the president to reject
a nomination since the dismissal of the government led by Prime
Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj on July 24 as a result of its decision
in May to merge the state-owned Renovation Bank with private
Golomt Bank.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman said that the president did not agree
to submit Ganhuyag's nomination to the Great Hural (parliament)
because he had been prosecuted for twice driving after drinking.
</P>
<P>
The ruling union comprises the Mongolian National Democratic
Party (MNDP) and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP).
Ganhuyag is a member of the general committee of the MNDP and the
Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
Ganhuyag's nomination had already been rejected by the
political committee of the MSDP on September 11 for the same
reason as the president.
</P>
<P>
But the MNDP also foiled the MSDP's attempt to present its own
candidate. Later, through consultation between the two parties'
presidents and vice-presidents, the MNDP and the MSDP adopted
Ganhuyag's nomination and wrote to Bagabandy on Tuesday seeking
presidential approval.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolian law, the ruling union nominates a candidate for
prime minister first and then must consult with the president. If
the president accepts the nomination, he must submit it to the
Great Hural for a vote.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman said that President Bagabandy had
urged the ruling union to nominate a new candidate as early as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Autonomy Bill Passed in Nepal With 7 MPs Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of Nepali
Parliament Thursday passed the crucial Local Autonomy Bill by a
majority after seven opposition MPs were injured in manhandling.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which aims to empower the local bodies, was passed by
voice voting with the support of the ruling Nepali Congress (NC),
the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) and the
opposition National Democratic Party (RPP, Chand), which have a
total of 138 MPs in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Local Development Keshav Lal Shrestha could not go
to the rostrum to propose the passage of the bill due to the
obstruction of MPs from the opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and RPP (Thapa). He had to do
so in his seat.
</P>
<P>
RPP was split early this year into two groups led respectively
by former prime ministers Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Surya Bahadur
Thapa.
</P>
<P>
MPs from the ruling parties and the opposition began to
manhandle each other when Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel presented the
bill for voting.
</P>
<P>
After the passage of the bill, MPs of the opposition parties
smashed chairs and microphones to vent their anger. They also
smashed the window glass of Speaker Poudel's chamber in the house.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel were mobilized to bring the situation under
control.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML claimed at a press conference called later that
seven MPs from it and RPP (Thapa) were injured in the house by the
MPs of ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
It alleged that the bill was passed in an undemocratic way
which was against the parliamentary norms and values.
</P>
<P>
The party said that it would take the issue to the people and
generate awareness about any undemocratic activities of the NC and
the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
The NC countercharged in a press release that the behavior of
the opposition MPs was undemocratic and unparliamentary.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML demanded that a provision which automatically
terminates one's post if a local elected official defects to
another party be added into the Local Autonomy Bill, tabled in
parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
It fears that if the bill is passed, thousands of local party
workers may defect to the CPN-ML, which broke away from it in
March this year and joined the NC's minority government in late
August.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mayors, deputy mayors, district development
committee chairmen, vice chairmen and members elected from the
CPN-UML during the local elections in May and July last year have
joined the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
More local elected members are said to be wishful to join the
CPN-ML, but are waiting for the bill to be passed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and RPP (Thapa) had blocked the Lower House
proceedings for four days before Tuesday over the bill.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that the NC minority government
submitted an autonomy bill in parliament about five months ago
prohibiting defections at the local level but amended it after the
entry of CPN-ML into the government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the CPN-ML aimed to get the bill
passed in order to win over more workers for the local elections
in 11 districts in the mid-western region, which could not take
place last year due to violence and are rescheduled for Friday,
and more importantly, for the general elections due to be held
before November 1999.

guidelines to 2005, some 54,000 interior troops will be discharged
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said his troops, to serve
on contract, would include three mobile groups composed of "four
to five divisions", Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
A slimmer interior force would enable it to concentrate on
civil conflicts within the country, Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
The reforms also call for the transfer of the penitentiary
system, which employs about 300,000 people, from the Interior
Ministry to the Justice Ministry, Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry has already taken over 731 prisons, 191
detention centers and 63 juvenile correctional centers together
with about one million prisoners and detainees.

<HEADLINE> News Photo Show On China's Anti-flood Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of
approximately 300 news photos recording China's fight against
severe flooding that has been completed, opened at the China
Revolutionary Museum here today.
</P>
<P>
The works of nearly 100 Chinese journalists and free lancers
depict how Chinese leaders, ordinary Communist Party members,
officers and men of the People's Liberation Army, as well as
civilians joined hands to combat devastating floods in the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and along the Nengjiang
and Songhua rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
There are also some photos showing the civilians' enjoyable,
orderly, and contented life despite the fact that floodwaters
were pounding at river banks and dykes. They were arranged side by
side with other exhibiting photos that depicted how huge floods in
1931 devoured thousands upon thousands of innocent people while
more others went hungry and were practically starving.
</P>
<P>
The photo show will run through September 28 at the joint
sponsorship of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, Ministry of Water Resources, Xinhua News Agency, the
People's Daily and the Liberation Army News.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Comprehensive Review of Iraqi File </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf Thursday urged the United Nations to make a
comprehensive review of its polices toward Baghdad, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf made the remarks following his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in his capacity as personal envoy of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in the northern coastal city of
Alexandria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the Iraqi foreign minister urged the
U.N. to continue dialog with Iraq and then undertake a
comprehensive review of the inspection works as recently proposed
by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"Annan's proposal for the comprehensive review for the Iraqi
file is intended to have the U.N. Security Council verify that
Iraq does not any longer possess weapons of mass destruction and
to make it clear that the work has actually been completed,"
Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that both conditions are "true," he said that "thereby
the embargo on Iraq shall have to be lifted."
</P>
<P>
"The technical details have shown that Iraq had delivered on
its commitments imposed by the U.N. resolutions," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 decided not to allow U.N. arms inspectors to
visit new sites in Iraq until U.N. Special Commission on Iraq
(UNSCOM), in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, was restructured to eliminate American
influence. This has prompted the U.N. to suspend its periodical
review of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, can be lifted only when the U.N. Security Council is
satisfied that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Security Council would possibly change its recent
decision on suspending the periodical review of the economic
sanctions imposed on Baghdad, Sahhaf gave no direct answer, but
pressed for removing the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The sound trend is to seek the lawful explanation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions and to discuss lifting the ban,"
he said, adding that this is not only an Iraqi demand but also one
sought by the U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Mubarak, Sahhaf said he updated the
president on the latest developments between Iraq and the U.N. and
their impact on the works of the Security Council and the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Mubarak on his country's stance in this
connection, which calls for lifting the U.N. sanctions against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Senior Lesotho Officers Flee to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Some senior Lesotho
army officers had fled their country, the South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted Foreign Affairs Department sources
as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department predicted that the fleeing
officers including colonels and lieutenants are likely to
apply for political asylum abroad.
</P>
<P>
Police in Ladybrand, a South African border town, confirmed
earlier in the day that 13 Lesotho officers fled across the
border into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known why the Lesotho army officers fled
their country.
</P>
<P>
SAPA Thursday also quoted ousted Lesotho Defense Force chief
Lieutenant-General Makhule Mosakheng as saying that he was not
among the officers who had reportedly fled the mountainous kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Mosakheng said that one of the fled officers phoned him from
South Africa, noting that "my impression is that they are not
seeking asylum."
</P>
<P>
The departure of the Lesotho army officers occurred following
reports that South Africa, together with Botswana and Zimbabwe,
are due to release Thursday an investigation report into the
alleged fraud in the Lesotho general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties reportedly threatened Wednesday
night to reject the report after long expecting the release of
it.

<HEADLINE> Sam Rainsy Party Agrees to Join Assembly Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The leader of one
of Cambodia's two main opposition parties, Sam Rainsy, said
Thursday that his party would take part in the convention of a new
parliament and the three-party summit hosted by King Norodom
Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a four-hour meeting between Sam
Rainsy and the King, which he described as "cordial and
satisfactory".
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) supported the King's
decision to host the summit. He believed that the King could play
an important role as a coordinator.
</P>
<P>
"But we did not touch upon the formation of the new
government," Sam Rainsy said.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy said he placed great hope in the summit which is
scheduled to open on September 22 in Siem Reap. If the three
parties reach an agreement, the situation in Cambodia might
then return to normal.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by Royal Palace Thursday showed that the
National Assembly was scheduled to be convened on September 24,
after which the members of parliament are expected to be sworn in
at the famous Angkor Wat temple nearby.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the three main parties agreed to participate in
the summit. They are Chea Sim and Hun Sen, President and
Vice-President of the Cambodian People's Party, Prince Ranariddh,
President of Funcinpec, and Sam Rainsy of the SRP.
</P>
<P>
"The SRP is a small party in the Assembly," Sam Rainsy said.
"So we can not resist two other main parties in principle. We are
not strong enough to have any influence over them.
</P>
<P>
"But we will stick to the election complaints and seek for them
to be resolved fairly. I will also ask to discuss civil rights at
the meeting such as the freedom of movement of opposition leaders
and members of Parliament which was banned by the Government," he
added.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by Funcinpec on the same day appealed to
all governments, particularly members of Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), friends of Cambodia, and the European Union
to immediately intervene on behalf of those whose fundamental
right of movement had been violated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sam Rainsy expressed his concern that if the crisis
could not be solved satisfactorily, the protesters would take to
the streets again.
</P>
<P>
"The Funcinpec party has agreed to participate in the new
National Assembly's first session scheduled on September 24
presided over by the King in Siem Reap," Prince Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prince confirmed that Funcinpec has not altered
its demand that the discrepancy between the printed ballots (nine
million) and registered voters (5.4 million) be accounted for and
a seat allocation formula that appeared in the early version of
election documents be adopted.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to meet Chea Sim as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He then warned the continuation of demonstrations will depend
on the outcome of the three-party summit although the Funcinpec
party had decided to call off protests in order to pave the way
for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition parties Funcinpec and the SRP have been
protesting what they call election violations in the polls of July
26.
</P>
<P>
At least two people have been killed in clashes with the police
and many more injured since the government clamped down on
unauthorized protests last Monday.

BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it had approved a humanitarian aid package, worth
10.9 million ECUs (11.99 million U.S. dollars), for Palestinian
communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and refugees in
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes assistance to Lebanese affected by
the Palestinian refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel closed its border to Palestinians seeking jobs,
many Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been out of
employment and lived in poverty. Some have sought refuge in
neighboring countries, such as Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office,
will enable United Nations' agencies and European non-governmental
organizations to implement aid programs for the next six to nine
months.
</P>
<P>
The aid programs will focus on providing medicines, medical
supplies, specialized equipment, emergency rehabilitation, and
emergency food aid. They also include the training of specialist
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation

ECUs (5.5 million dollars) for Mali and 1.4 million ECUs (1.54
million dollars) for Honduras to ease the poverty.

<HEADLINE> HK Market Is Still Free and Open: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong market is still
free, open and well regulated, and the government's incursion in
the market in August was a defense of Hong Kong's economic
interest, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has long been praised by objective commentators as
the freest market in the world," Tsang told reporters at a
stand-up session at the Central Government Offices.
</P>
<P>
"For that reason, our incursion in the market in August was a
very difficult but serious one," he said, adding that "we were in
the circumstances that we believed we had absolutely no other
option."
</P>
<P>
"We had to defend the linked exchange rate of Hong Kong,
otherwise it would have triggered off another round of devaluation
in the whole of the Asian region and probably greater disasters
outside the region," Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
Tsang's remarks came after the action was criticized by U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan late Wednesday. Greenspan
said the consequences of the intervention "erode some of the
extraordinary credibility that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
has achieved."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government intervened massively in the stock and
futures markets in August in a bid to squeeze out international
speculators who were engaged in a "double play" in stocks and the
currency.
</P>
<P>
Tsang told reporters that the intervention and the adoption of
a series of follow-up regulatory measures would "help us deal with
speculators more effectively in the future."
</P>
<P>
Tsang reiterated that it was not the government's intention to
sustain the equity of the securities market at any level.
</P>
<P>
"What we had done over the last few weeks have demonstrated
that it is not our intention and that is not our aim at all," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he would write to Greenspan explaining the decision,
saying "we have to be very patient about it."
</P>
<P>
"We do understand that from an idealistic position of a free
market, what we did is probably rather exceptional," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang himself will leave Hong Kong at the end of September for
a three-week mission to Europe and the United States, reassuring
international business circles of Hong Kong's commitment to free
markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A free trade zone in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is the best way to help
Ukraine, Russia and their neighboring countries to shake off
economic crisis, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He is to discuss the proposal for the CIS, covering the
countries which formerly made up the Soviet Union, with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on Friday night in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma emphasized the importance of removing all obstacles to
the plan, appealing for the scrapping of the customs union
created by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
The free trade zone proposal was based on the fact that the CIS
countries had closely linked national economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said the economic crisis would be the main priority in
his discussions with Yeltsin and new Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Russia's future course and its economic policies would have a
major influence on Ukraine, he noted.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government Making Sustained Efforts to Ease Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Education and
Manpower Joseph Wong of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China said here Thursday that the SAR government
continued to be very concerned about the high and rising
unemployment and was deeply sympathetic towards those facing
employment difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the SAR government's determination to spare no
effort in helping the unemployed to rejoin the workforce as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest labor force statistics released
Thursday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong, the
provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the period
June to August 1998 was 5.0 percent, and the provisional
underemployment rate was 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the period May to July 1998, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate was 4.8 percent, while the underemployment rate
was 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the period June to August 1998 with May to July 1998,
the increase in unemployment rate occurred mainly in the
foundation and superstructure sector of the construction industry,
business services and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
As for the underemployment rate, the decrease was concentrated
in the decoration and maintenance sector of the construction
industry, and in clothing and footwear, which more than offset the
increase seen in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the statistics, government economist K.Y. Tang said
that the continued setback in economic activity had dampened the
demand for labor. However, the entry of more school graduates into
the labor market recently had added to the labor supply. Taken
together, both factors lifted unemployment further.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wong said that as Hong Kong is still in the midst of a
difficult economic adjustment and consolidation period brought
about largely by external economic factors, high unemployment will
"inevitably remain with us for some time."

Despite the general economic downturn, there are also positive

MACAO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- New teaching material on the
Chinese language was released here Wednesday to facilitate the
study of Chinese by civil servants in the Macao government.
</P>

Chinese as an official language toward Macao's return to the
motherland in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative and Civil Service Department of the Macao
government and the Macao Institute of Engineering supported the
publication of the teaching material.

<HEADLINE> Time Right for Boosting U.S.-African Trade Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley said Thursday that the time is right for Africa and
the United States to forge a much stronger trade partnership as
the U.S. is developing "an African Commercial Strategy."
</P>
<P>
"American companies are very interested in the continent,"
Daley said at the American Business Association luncheon in the
Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Daley held talks with Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi on bilateral issues concerning trade, investment,
Kenya's textile exports to the U.S. and the east African state's
privatization process and anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary said that he will visit Nairobi and other
four African capitals in December with the accompany of more than
20 American business leaders.
</P>
<P>
At present, just one percent of American exports goes to the
African market on which the U.S. has only a seven percent share,
far less than Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We can do better. We must do better," said Daley.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho said that he
believes the shifting focus by the United States toward trade and
investment in Africa would create "a very big chance" for further
economic growth of the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi was Daley's third and final leg of his four-day
African tour which began Monday. Daley also visited South Africa
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Daley laid a wreath at the site of the August 7
bombing aimed at the U.S. embassy here, which killed some 250
people, including 12 Americans, and wounded nearly 5,000. An
almost simultaneous blast killed 11 Tanzanians at the U.S.
embassy in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Secretary pledged that Washington will grant
Kenya and Tanzania aid for recovery from the bomb blasts but
failed to reveal more details.
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, the secretary was scheduled to sign a
grant worth three million U.S. Dollars for the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) over the COMESA region's
peacekeeping and conflict prevention.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Drug dependents in

<HEADLINE> China's Major Policy Bank Expands Lending Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China (SDB) will raise its lending program to more than
150 billion yuan for all of 1998 to help spur national economic
growth, the bank's vice president Yao Zhongmin said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year that the policy-oriented bank
has hiked its lending portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The SDB budgeted its annual lendings for 1998 at 95 billion
yuan at the beginning of this year, and then lifted the amount to
122.8 billion yuan some months later.
</P>
<P>
This latest adjustment accounts for about 40 percent of China's
investment in fixed assets this year, Yao said at a meeting on
China's economy and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the newly increased loans will be mainly used as
matching funds for infrastructure projects financed by money raised
through bond issues by the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
To increase fiscal spending, the Ministry of Finance earlier
issued 100 billion yuan in special bonds targeting the country's
big-four state-owned commercial banks -- the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank
of China, and the China Construction Bank.
</P>
<P>
Increasing investment, especially in infrastructure facilities,
is an important measure to boost economic growth in China this
year, and that is why the SDB is expanding its lending program,
Yao said.
</P>
<P>
To raise funds, the SDB will issue another 20 to 30 billion yuan
in financial bonds, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bank figures show that the SDB issued 71 billion yuan in loans
in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Display in HK to Celebrate China's National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A splendid fireworks
display will light up the sky of Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor on
the night of October 1 to celebrate the 49th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China, it was announced at a
press conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both the organizers and sponsors of the 23-minute, three-act
show admitted that they also hoped this could bring the local
residents to enjoyment and hope, and boost their confidence at a
time when Hong Kong is suffering from an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
This is the second National Day fireworks display since July 1
last year, when Hong Kong became a special administrative
region of China.
</P>
<P>
"This event shows our commitment to the Hong Kong financial
services industry. We have every confidence that the people of
Hong Kong will continue to work together to maintain Hong Kong's
status as a financial center in the Asia Pacific region," said
Andrew Tang, Associate Director and General Manager of the event's
sponsors, Hong Kong-based financial company Hantec Holdings
Limited.
</P>
<P>
The 22,000 pieces of fireworks to be launched to mid-air are
all from China's mainland and thus have strong Chinese
characteristics, said Christina Ting Yuk-chee, chairman of the
Provisional Urban Council's Entertainment Select Committee. And
the fireworks show will be accompanied by Chinese music which will
be broadcast on local radio to entertain the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The shells will be fired from six barges to be located in a
triangular lay-out in the Victoria Harbor waters so that the
fireworks could be displayed in the air in a pyramid shape,
according to Annie Bentley, Managing Director of Bentley
Communications, the event's promoters.

<HEADLINE> Arab World Voice Support for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers voiced
their support Thursday to the Palestinian stance in the ongoing
negotiations with Israel, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also urged the U.S. to pressure Israel to
implement the agreements it had signed with the Palestinians, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
They made clear their position at the ongoing 110th session of
the Arab League Ministerial Council in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The direct talks between the Palestinians and Israel, which
began on July 19, have made no headway due to their wide gaps on
security cooperation and the scope of Israeli troops withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Israel to accept a U.S. proposal to hand
over 13 percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Israel demanded 3 percent be turned into a "nature
reserve," which its has full security control, and required
tougher measures in crackdown on Islamic militants by the
Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The council denounced Israel's policy as being based on
"procrastination and maneuvers to impose new facts on the final
status negotiations with the Palestinian party."
</P>
<P>
The final status talks will tackle the thorniest issues in the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, including the refugee problem
and the status of Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to be the
capital of their future state and Israel regards as its eternal
and undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
The council also berated Israel's rejection to restart
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon from where they were left off
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks with Syria came to a stop after Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu came to power and refused to hand back the
occupied Golan Heights as promised by the previous government for
a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, a close ally of Syria, has insisted on an
unconditional of Israeli troops from its south.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Rolls out New Information Pager in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc. announced here
today that its latest information pager is now available in China
to provide Chinese stock investors with more timely and
comprehensive information.
</P>
<P>
According to Albert Lam, vice president of Motorola Greater
China Paging Subscriber Division, the new product called
"InfoMaster Plus," has a larger memory than any other information
pager on the market.
</P>
<P>
It is able to store information on up to 3,000 individual
stocks. It also incorporates graphic display functions allowing
the user to view the real-time price variations of 10 stocks.
</P>
<P>
Most individual stock investors in China have no access to
stock analysis tools which are almost exclusively accessible to
large investors at the exchanges, said Li Sen, security analyst
with the Hua Xia Security Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
She said most average investors cannot afford computers that
are installed with real-time stock trading software such as "Money
Dragon."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," Li said, "a pager at a relatively low price with
fast transmission speed and basic stock-analysis capability has
potential in the Chinese market."
</P>
<P>
The first information pager was offered to the world by
Motorola in December 1997, said Lam, and stock traders account for
80 percent of its users.
</P>
<P>
He added that some of the functions of the new pager were
designed specially for Chinese traders.
</P>
<P>
There are now 30 million investors registered at the Shanghai
and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, of which 95 percent are individuals
with less than 100,000 yuan invested.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal Discuss Int'l Conventions Applied in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here on
Thursday that China and Portugal have reached consensus on the
continuation of international conventions which are currently
applied in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, Chinese representative in the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group (JLG), made the remarks following a two-day JLG
meeting on Macao's participation in international conventions.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China and Portugal began discussions on
the issue last year. Portugal submitted to the JLG a list of 205
international conventions, 78 of which have been applied in Macao.
The Portuguese side wants them to remain after Macao's return to
the motherland after 1999.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principles of current application,
Macao's practical conditions and the guideline of "one country,
two systems," China basically agrees to the continuation of the
conventions, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the conventions are applied in Macao, they are
components of Macao's current laws, and the continuation is
conducive to Macao's prosperity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days' discussion, the two sides also talked
about conventions which are not applied in Macao but the
Portuguese side thinks can be applied and retained after Macao's
return.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the work is more complex. The two sides will
have to work harder so as to have it completed by the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Wants to Save Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is ready to make his best efforts to save the 57-year-old
Philippine Airlines from closing shop, but is opposed to any
government bailout for the strike-bound firm, Presidential
Spokesman Jerry Barican said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Philippine government has the money or the
taxpayers have the money, especially under this great economic
hardship, to bail out any large corporation," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He said the president intends to call officials of the
Employees Association and the management of the airlines to a
meeting in the Presidential Palace "to find out if there is still
a way to save the airlines."
</P>
<P>
However, the necessary steps the president will take do not
include "opening the coffers of the government and using the
hard-earned taxes of the people to bail out the corporation,"
Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines has announced that it will close on
September 23 following the breakdown of talks between the
management and the pilots and employees who went on strike in July
this year.
</P>
<P>
The management has offered the strikers 20 percent ownership of
the airlines and three seats in the 15-member board of directors.
It also proposed giving 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos
(about 6,849 U.S. dollars at current rate) to each employee.
</P>
<P>
The strikers first accepted the proposal, but then reversed
their stand, plunging the negotiations into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the airlines' losses caused by the strike and the
burden of cumulative losses over many years have reached at least
2 billion U.S. dollars which are "too heavy for the company to
bear."
</P>
<P>
"Closure is inevitable because this is the only way to preserve
the company's assets to ensure their orderly liquidation and
disposition to creditors and other claimants," the airlines said
in a notice.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines, which first took to the skies on March 15,
1941, was the first airline in Asia. On July 31, 1946, it became
the first Asian carrier to fly across the Pacific.

</P>
<P>
Liuzhou is known as "the home of stones," where stones are
divided into nine categories of more than 50 varieties. The
festival will exhibit some 2,000 stones with a wide array of
features to carry forward China's traditional stone culture and
promote tourism, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Academic exchanges, auctions, and trade negotiations will also
be held during the festival.
</P>
<P>
China has a host of local products with special characteristics
of interest to tourists, such as Liuzhou stones. When this market
is developed, these products will give a strong lift to the
nation's tourism industry, according to CNTA authorities.

<HEADLINE> China Can Achieve Eight Percent Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The goal of eight-percent
growth for China's economy can be attained this year, in spite of
the Asian financial crisis and the devastating floods in many
provinces, said a senior official from the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunzheng, vice-minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, said at an economic symposium here today that a good
harvest, a stable increase in industrial output, and rapid growth
of the service sector will be achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has taken forceful measures to increase
investment on fixed assets in the past several months. The
construction of a number of infrastructure programs is proceeding
smoothly, Wand said, adding that this will contribute a great deal
to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The fulfilment of China's economic growth goal will play an
important role in stablizing the Asian and global economies, and
will also pave the way for sustained economic growth in China in
the coming years," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang called for the deepening of reform in
state-owned enterprises and the adjustment of economic structures
to ensure high quality and rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 delegates from more than 50 international
fund-management corporations were represented at the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Recession in Japan Dampens German Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- German exports to Japan dropped
by 11.7 percent in the first half of this year, mainly because of
Japan's recession and the weak Japanese Yen, the German Federal
Statistics Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that exports to Japan in the first half year
fell to 9.2 billion marks (5.4 billion U.S. dollars), while
imports from Japan increased by 17.4 percent to 20.8 billion marks
(12.3 billion dollars), leading through to a trade deficit of 11.6
billion marks (6.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Japan remained the second largest trading partner of
Germany, following the United States. It bought 1.9 percent of
Germany's total exports and 5.1 percent of Germany's total imports
came from Japan, the statistics office said.
</P>
<P>
It was also estimated that Germany's trade deficit with Japan
for 1998 could reach the highest level since 1992 when the deficit
was 23.3 billion marks (13.8 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Women's Rights Protected by Basic Law in HK: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The rights of women to be
treated equally with men are protected in Hong Kong by the Basic
Law, the constitutional law in the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference jointly organized by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the International Women's
Forum, Chan said the theme of the conference, "Women in Business
Make a Difference," makes a very positive statement about women's
ability to contribute to the world of business, whether it is in
the public sector or in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Chan, the first woman to win the most prominent position in
public service in the history of Hong Kong, said it is hard to
believe today that even in the 60s and 70s, women were still being
paid less than men for doing exactly the same job.
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way since then. Today, all jobs in the
civil service are open to both sexes," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Women now make up 33 percent of all public officials and female
colleagues are taking up "traditional men's jobs" such as fire
officers in Hong Kong, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Female civil servants now make up 19 percent of all officers at
the directorate level in the government, she noted. "This figure
is still low but it is already 89 percent higher than five years
ago."
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the number of women joining the
Administrative Officers Grade, which is the backbone of the civil
service, has consistently exceeded that of men, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the civil service, women are increasingly more prominent
in business, public affairs, community service and politics, Chan
continued.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, only one member in the Executive Council was a woman.
Now four out of 14 members are female.
</P>
<P>
In the first Legislative Council elections of the HKSAR held in
May this year, female voters and candidates took an active part
in the process and compared with the 1995 LegCo elections, the
number of female candidates increased by 60 percent while the
number of those elected went up by about 43 percent.

<P>
Chan attributed these changes to several factors, but she said
that "perhaps the single most important factor is the opening up
of educational opportunities for all."
</P>
<P>
In addition, sustained economic growth over the past decades in
Hong Kong has also played an important role in improving the
status of women, Chan noted.
</P>
<P>
"Another agent of change has, I think, been the attitude of
women themselves," she added. Education in its broadest sense has
helped correct bias based on gender stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
Several laws and organizations have played important roles in
protecting women from discrimination, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
She said the SAR government has forwarded the first report on
its application of the International Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which was
extended to Hong Kong in 1996, to the Central People's Government
of China for inclusion in its report to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
When the relevant U.N. committee examines the report, probably
early next year, representatives of the SAR government will form
part of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to
present its record to the world at large, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the undoubted strides that have been made in recent
years on raising the status of women, I believe that much still
remains to be done -- at the workplace, in the home and in the
community at large, particularly amongst those women who have
received limited education and work in less well-paid jobs," Chan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
One reason is that women are still mostly in a minority at the
top of their chosen career. The fact is that it takes a long time
for equal opportunity employment policies to work through the
system to produce equal representation at the top of a particular
profession, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we must all join hands in a common enterprise, an
enterprise that seeks to achieve nothing less than the elimination
of all forms of discrimination based on a person's gender. And we
look forward to a day when every woman can exercise her full
citizen's rights, when to be a successful woman in business is not
something that is considered remarkable but is just as natural and
commonplace as being a successful man," Chan concluded.
</P>
<P>
Among other speakers at the one-day conference were local and
overseas business and government leaders. They discussed the
opportunities and challenges women face in the tough, competitive
world of business.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Bars Entry of Singapore Air Force Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Air Force
planes will be barred from entering Malaysia's air space from
Friday, Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All special arrangements and waivers now granted to Singapore
air force planes to use the Malaysian air space would be
withdrawn, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's decision was taken in view of the increasing
congestion over the country's air space and concerns expressed by
the general public, the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an easy decision...it was taken in the best interest
of Malaysia," Malaysia's national news agency Bernama quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Singapore air force planes wishing to use
Malaysian air space from Friday would have to apply for individual
clearance from the Malaysian authorities and it would be up to
Malaysia to grant such clearance.
</P>
<P>
At present, Singapore air force planes are given several types
of special waivers from applying for such clearance and normally a
blanket clearance was given, he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the Singapore government was informed
of the decision through its High Commission here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that Malaysia's decision was taken after Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs was published, which was
alleged to contain critical remarks about Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few days, several Malaysian leaders including
Syed Hamid have criticized Lee.
</P>
<P>
But Syed Hamid said the decision was based on security reasons
and the country's interest and was not a reaction to the critical
remarks about Malaysia in Lee's memoirs.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iraq Hold Trade-Booster Meeting in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Egyptian-Iraqi
Committee will convene here in November under the co-chairmanship
of trade ministers from both countries, aiming to shore up trade
and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Middle East News Agency Thursday,
Chairman of the Egyptian Trade Office in Baghdad Ahmed Hosni said
the committee meeting was agreed upon by Egyptian Trade Minister
Ahmed Goweili and his Iraqi counterpart Mohamed Mahdi Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The committee is to study ways to enhance bilateral trade
relations in the light of a memo of understanding reached by the
two sides in June, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the gathering in Cairo, Egypt will take part in
Baghdad International Exhibition to be staged on November 1-10.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian exports to Iraq under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food
program stood at 230 million dollars during the period from
January till the end of August, according to the chairman of the
Egyptian Trade office in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cairo and Baghdad have witnessed noticeable
improvement recently when high level visits were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
Goweili paid a visit to Iraq in June to attend the inauguration
of the Egyptian Products Exhibition and signed with his Iraqi
counterpart Saleh a memo of understanding for bilateral economic
and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Health Minister Ismail Sallam visited Baghdad last
month leading a medical team during which they operated on some
Iraqi patients.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the official interaction, some Egyptian firms
have been doing a robust business with Baghdad, exporting food,
medicine, and other daily necessities, while others have offered
to participate in schemes to develop Iraq's dilapidated oil
facilities and prospect for new fields.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal struck in 1996, Iraq is
allowed to sell a limited amount of oil every six months to import
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception of the crippling economic sanctions
the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Payments Surplus under Current, Capital Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China continues to have an
international payments surplus under both current and capital
accounts, allowing its currency to remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoling, director of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, said at an international seminar called "China's
Economic and Investment Perspective" held in Beijing today that
China's decision to maintain a stable exchange rate is not a
political commitment.
</P>
<P>
She said it is based on the country's international payments
and its own interests. Moreover, it is an international
obligation that China shoulders.
</P>
<P>
Though the Asian financial crisis exerts great pressure on
China's exports, Chinese products are still quite competitive on
the international market, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu predicted that China will not have a trade
deficit under its capital account this year because direct
investment constitutes a majority of the funds coming from abroad.
</P>
<P>
China, with a market of 1.2 billion people and political
stability, will be able to absorb even more investment from other
countries in the future, she said.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a positive attitude toward investment by
transnational companies, and increased investment from Europe and
the Unites States will counteract a decline of investment from
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
She said that a pressing task for China at present is to
prevent and clamp down on the illegal flow of foreign exchange. A
certain amount of foreign exchange has gone to other countries
beginning last April after China cut interest rates on the yuan
twice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has taken a series of measures to insure
its development is adaptable to the new international situation
which has arisen since the start of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China is working to improve management of the
resettlement and sale of foreign exchange to increase its foreign
exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
China will also distinguish foreign-exchange revenue and
expenditure under the current account from that under the capital
account, keeping strict tabs on the latter to ensure the legal
flow of foreign exchange and crack down on illegal exchanges.

<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines, the
national commercial flag carrier, announced here Thursday that it
would close effective midnight of September 23 following the
breakdown of talks between the management and the labor union.
</P>
<P>
The airlines said that the closure was recommended by the
Interim Receivership Committee to the airlines' board of
directors, which then approved the measure during an emergency
closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The company said the management exhausted all efforts to keep
it operational pending the outcome of the negotiations with the
labor union who represents the pilots and employees who went on
strike in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The burden of cumulative losses over many years and the losses
caused by the strike during the ongoing Asian financial crisis
have run into billions of pesos and become too heavy for the
company to bear, the airlines said.
</P>
<P>
It added that it apologizes to all its passengers and customs
who are most affected by the closure and advises the riding public
to make necessary alternative arrangements to minimize the
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines, which first took to the skies on March 15,
1941, was the first airline in Asia. On July 31, 1946, it became
the first Asian carrier to fly across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The closure ends the airlines' 57 and a half years of service
to the nation during which it contributed significantly to the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The management of Philippine
Airlines issued here Thursday a notice of closure of the airlines
after the management and the labor union failed to reach an
acceptable arrangement to keep it operational.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply saddened to announce that on September 23, 1998,
Philippine Airlines will close following the breakdown of
negotiations between the management and the airlines' labor union
to forge an acceptable arrangement to ensure continuing industrial
peace," the notice said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the management has exhausted all efforts to keep
the company operational pending the outcome of its negotiations
with the labor union, which represents the pilots and employees
who went on strike in July this year.
</P>

"Unfortunately, the insurmountable burden of continued losses
has become too heavy for the company to bear. With no fresh
capital infusion, the company can not operate viably in the face
of enormous losses and the harsh business environment," the notice
said.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the debt the airlines has
accumulated over the past 57 years has run into at least two
billion U.S. dollars. As a result of the losses and the ongoing
Asian financial crisis, the airlines downsized its domestic and
international flights and laid off some 5,000 employees and
pilots.
</P>
<P>
The airlines apologizes to all its passengers and customs who
are most affected by the closure, advising the riding public to
make necessary alternative arrangements to minimize the
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate your understanding and patience during this
difficult period. Closure is inevitable because this is the only
way to preserve the company's assets to ensure their orderly
liquidation and disposition to creditors and other claimants. We
urging our riding public to make the necessary alternative travel
arrangements," the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the airlines said the Interim Receivership Committee
sent to the airlines by the government recommended the closure to

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
resolved to eradicate vaccine preventable diseases suffered by

Nigerian Health Minister Debo Adeyemi said recently that a
successful implementation of the plan would save thousands of
children in the country, The Guardian reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Opens Women's Crisis Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Women's Crisis
Center was officially opened by first lady Hasri Ainun Habibie
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Ainun expressed the hope that the center would
be able to help solve cases of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
She said harassment against women, occurring both at home and
in their places of work, are rarely exposed.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the women could do nothing but to let them happen.
The victims could not find the right solutions either," she said,
adding that problems faced by women should not be disregarded as
they affect practically half of the Indonesian population.
</P>
<P>
Ainun said it would be better to prevent the damage from being
done than to start a healing process after the damage is done.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Indonesian Women for Development Kemala said the
crisis center was formed to address the rising incidence of
harassment against women.
</P>
<P>
The crisis center will tackle sexual harassment cases, marriage
problems, and the protection of women's rights, Kemala added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Women's Affairs Minister Tuti Alawiyah
urged the country's women organizations to sit together and seek
solutions to problems that women face.

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. Still Differ on CTBT: Jashwant Singh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An Indian senior official
said Thursday that India and the United States still have
different perceptions over the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the economic editors' conference here, Planning
Commission Deputy Chairman Jaswant Singh, who is also the special
emissary of the prime minister, said that he would strive to
narrow the gap when he again meet U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Strobe Tolbott in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Jaswant Singh and Strobe Tolbott has held four rounds of talks
since June 11 this year over India's nuclear tests conducted in
May 1998 and CTBT. It was reported that the United States has time
and again urged India to stop nuclear development programme and
sign CTBT with no conditions. India, however, has insisted that it
would not stop its nuclear development programme and it should
have a minimum nuclear deterrence. Furthermore, it wants the
United States to recognize its de facto nuclear power state, lift
its economic sanctions imposed on it following its nuclear tests
and agree to transfer advanced technology to India if it wants
India to sign CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Jaswant Singh refused to give any details of the his several
talks with Tolbott on CTBT issue. He said that he was committed
not to reveal the outcome of his secret talks with Tolbott.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said Wednesday that
India would not sign the CTBT in its present discriminatory form.
"We would like some changes to be made, particularly regarding
transfer of high technology. We are having talks on this and other
points," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I know the treaty itself is not going to be amended, but
certain other arrangements should be made to create conditions for
India to sign CTBT," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's National Carrier on Privatization Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's debt-ridden national
carrier, the Royal Jordanian (RJ), has pinned financial and legal
advisors for its privatization, sources from the RJ said.
</P>
<P>
The RJ has initialed preliminary agreements with France's Bank
Paribas and the international Clifford Chance company to authorize
them to deal with the financial and legal affairs in restructuring
and stakes sale, the Jordan Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government has decided to implement a World
Bank-prescribed blueprint to privatize the RJ and Bank Paribas
will help evaluate the airline's assets, restructure its balance
sheet and recommend ways to handle its debts, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The RJ is straddled with 700 million Jordanian dinars (about
990 million U.S. dollars) of debts, due to years of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The bank will eventually market the main parts of the RJ,
including the aviation and technical support sectors, said the
sources. The remaining duty-free shops, engineering and catering
services will be run by a state-owned company.
</P>
<P>
The Clifford Chance will help improve management in the RJ,
make clear the RJ's legal liabilities and establish reasonable
relationship between the RJ and the Civil Aviation Authorities,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will fund part of the financial and legal work,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of the RJ is part of a government campaign,
launched in 1989, to tap the potential of the private sector, draw
foreign investment and finally streamline and privatize
large-scale public companies.
</P>
<P>
The plan met strong opposition from the parliament and has not
been legalized.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Lower on Renewed Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Renewed weakness in the
Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar weighed on the Australian
dollar Thursday and pushed it to a sub 59.00 U.S. cents close for
the first time in a week.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was undermined by large U.S. investor
selling overnight in the wake of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony.
</P>
<P>
Strength in the U.S. dollar, also a result of Greenspan's
speech, shoved the Japanese yen down which in turn damaged the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 58.97 U.S. cents from
59.61.
</P>
<P>
"This morning we saw a bit of a sell down from 59.30 towards
59.00 on the back of the weaker yen," St. George Bank manager of
foreign exchange trading Stuart Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"Last night Greenspan came out and said that the G-7 (Group of
Seven) won't be moving towards a coordinated rate cut and that put
the U.S. dollar under a bit of support and the Aussie under a bit
of pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony to a committee of the House of
Representatives, Greenspan said there was no intention, at
present, to make a coordinated G-7 interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said weakness in the gold price and commodity prices
had also adversely impacted on the traditionally commodity-driven
currency.
</P>
<P>
Moore said he believed there was support for the Australian
dollar at these low levels and it was likely the currency would
bounce in offshore overnight trade.
</P>
<P>
"Right at this stage I think we might bounce a bit, but in the
next week or so I think the Aussie has some risk of downside," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the domestic currency could fall as far as 58.20 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
At the close here the local currency was trading at 79.34
Japanese yen from 80.05 and 0.9944 German marks from 1.0091.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Water Pollution Inquiry to Be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The investigation of a water
pollution scandal which in part led to the resignation of Jordan's
last government, will be over in two weeks, the prosecutor in
charge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Harahsheh, who led the probe, confirmed that seven
government employees in connection with the water incident have
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
"Investigation proved they were involved in the water crisis
and they were arrested for further investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor did not rule out more arrests with the deepening
of the probe.
</P>
<P>
Those proved responsible will be prosecuted when the
investigation ends, the semi-official Jordan Times newspaper
quoted Harahsheh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two of the detained were officials taking charge of quality
control and laboratory affairs in water departments and the other
five were from the Zai Water Treatment Plant.
</P>
<P>
The water plant, which supplies most of Amman's running water,
is believed to be the source of contamination for a whole week in
July.
</P>
<P>
In early July, extra algae were spotted in the water of the
Zai plant, but it failed to make efforts to reduce the volume of
water passing through the filters, nor did it increase the carbon
used to treat the algae.
</P>
<P>
The residents in west Amman soon complained that the water
flowing out of their taps had an odor and contained worms, and a
number of citizens were hospitalized for diarrhea and
nausea-related diseases in the subsequent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Though part of the plant was closed shortly after the incident,
the water scandal stirred a political storm in Jordan, which
forced the resignation of the whole cabinet, led by former Prime
Minister Abdul-Salam Majali.

<HEADLINE> Indian, Pakistani Troops Exchange Fire in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian and Pakistani border
troops Wednesday exchanged heavy artillery and mortar fire in
Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, the long-standing disputed
area between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of shelling continued for at least three hours
from 1600 (local time) Wednesday, a Defense Ministry spokesman
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Three barracks on the Indian side suffered extensive damage in
the cross-border firing on the outskirts of Kargil, but there was
no report of any casualty as troops had already taken positions at
safer areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not give any reason for the new exchange of
fire between India and Pakistan. Since this year, especially after
the nuclear tests conducted by the two countries in May, more and
heavier exchanges of fire between the two sides' border troops
have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have fought three wars since 1947 and two out
of them were over Kashmir. India maintains that Kashmir is an
integrate part of its territory while Pakistan insists that it is
a disputed area. Because of their big difference over the issue,
they have failed to reach any agreement so far through various
talks.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court's New Measures to Curb Judicial Corruption (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- In order to maintain justice
and strengthen internal supervision, China's Supreme Court today
issued regulations on disciplinary penalties for court personnel,
and decided to appoint supervisors for the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Mingshan, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court,
revealed the two measures to the press here today.
</P>
<P>
"These moves are concrete steps by the Supreme Court in
implementing top-legislator Li Peng's directive on the ongoing
judiciary shake-up," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, said yesterday that "the violation of regulations in
the profession, and the neglect of work ethics by some officials
in judicial departments, are so serious that it has endangered
fair trial and posed a threat to social stability, and must be
halted immediately."
</P>
<P>
He warned judicial bodies not to take the "educational
rectification campaign" as a temporary movement, but to further it
by formulating relevant rules and set up new codes of conducts for
law enforcement personnels.
</P>
<P>
The methods of court discipline spelled-out 48 activities by
court personnel that are punishable by disciplinary warning,
demerits, demotion, dismissal from judgeship or expulsion from
judicial departments.
</P>
<P>
These activities include accepting offer of money, gift or
dinners from litigants, secretely handling lawsuits without
complying with legal procedures or refusing to open a trial that
should be opened, introducing lawyers to litigants or privately
meeting with a litigant and his attorney.
</P>
<P>
An on-duty intoxicated judge may be dismissed from office if
"serious consequences occur," according to the methods.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices dipped on the
Singapore Stock Market Thursday as the benchmark Straits Times
Index (STI) shed off 12.30 points to end at 934.45 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said market attention was focused on property stocks
after the recent prime rate cuts by leading Singapore banks.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said investors locked in their profits after the
market's massive gains over the last three days, which were
largely fueled by hopes of easing global interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, buying activity faltered as disappointment crept after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had denied that the
G-7 were drafting a co-ordinated policy that favors lower interest
rates, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The total volume was 267.86 million units worth 361.57 million
Singapore dollars (about 210.55 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outnumbered gainers by 215 to 63 with 145 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KepLand remained the most active stock of the day as it had a
turnover of 23.96 million stocks traded. It was followed by Wing T
that had 14.73 million units done. OUB F was next with 12.11
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH was the top gainer of the day as it gained 30 cents to
close at 13.80 Singapore dollars. OUB moved up 26 cents to finish
at 2.28 Singapore dollars. OUB F was up 24 cents to end at 2.60
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 again was the biggest loser of the
day as it lost 100 cents to close at 16.70 Singapore dollars. GE
Life slid 50 cents to finish at 6.70 Singapore dollars. Venture
shed off 40 cents to end at 5.00 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court's New Measures to Curb Judicial Corruption (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the second method, the Supreme Court will appoint
seven to nine senior and prestigious judges as "superintendents of
the Supreme Court." With authorization from the Supreme Court,
they will be empowered to supervise and offer guidance in major
and difficult trials, and in cases that are mishandled or stir
public dissent.
</P>
<P>
They will also be empowered to investigate major issues
concerning judicial corruption and cases involving parties from
different jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said these two measure are important moves in standardizing
the procedures of internal checks and balances, and in
strengthening the leadership of the Supreme Court over lower
courts.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also announced several steps the courts will take to curb
irregularities. For example, special efforts should be made to
stop the practice of overdue detention and delays in handling
cases, because these situations are major factors
affecting judicial fairness.
</P>
<P>
Public participation is necessary in stamping out injustice,
this is why all preliminary trials, except those excluded by law,
shall be open to the public, and a new jury system should be
instituted by selecting a large number of high quality,
knowledgeable, honest and fair jurors, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stock Market Drifts Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
drifted lower Thursday as investors remained on the sidelines
while key global economic and political matters remained
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index dropped 10.4 points to 2542.8, with
national turnover figures showing just 249.31 million shares
traded at a value of only 670.88 million Australian dollars
(395.81 million U.S. dollars), with 517 falls, 420 rises and 396
steady.
</P>
<P>
Brett O'Donovan from Henderson Charlton Jones said some of
Thursday's fall could be attributed to a drop in Japan, but mostly
it was due to lack of buying interest.
</P>
<P>
He said a minor fall on Wall Street overnight was not enough to
bring activity into the local market.
</P>
<P>
"Investors just aren't looking at this low volatility at the
moment, it virtually means nothing in the context of what we have
seen in the past few months," O'Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of clear direction on interest rates and the
continuation of the local election campaign were seen as
contributors to buying hesitancy.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 12.6 points to 4471.3, with
banking and insurance stocks generally firmer.
</P>
<P>
ANZ got some support from bargain hunters after its steady
decline since May, adding 11 cents. Of the other major banks,
National Australia was down 17.6 cents, Commonwealth fell 1.5 and
Westpac finished 8.9 cents down.
</P>
<P>
In the insurance sector, major AMP lost 18.1 cents while its
takeover target GIO was up five cents.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications major Telstra was down two cents, while the
shares of media giant News Corp lost six and its preferred shares
closed down 12 cents.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 9.7 points to 986.4, with mining
stocks markedly weaker.
</P>
<P>
Resources heavyweight BHP was down 23.8 cents, Rio Tinto fell
three.The gold index was 8.6 points lower at 1000.2 as the
bullion price slipped 2.05 per ounce to 287.05 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hand Grenades Detected in Vehicle in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Police were conducting a
top-level inquiry following the detection of four hand grenades in
a vehicle parked in the basement of a twin-tower building in
Colombo-Fort Wednesday night, police sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The detection was made around 10 p.m. Wednesday on a tip-off,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They quoted a senior police officer as saying that as soon as
the information was received, police searched all vehicles parked
within the basement of the twin-tower building.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle had been driven by two youths. The police were
surprised that the vehicle could pass the check point with all the
stringent security in force in the area. It is suspected that
those who manned the check point were lax in their duties.
</P>
<P>
Colombo-Fort is considered a high security zone and is on
24-hour vigil. Tamil rebels exploded two powerful car-bombs in the
zone in January, 1996 and in October last year respectively.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Rules out Possibility of Interest Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of
China's central bank today ruled out the possibility of an
interest rate cut in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingkang, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, told
an international seminar on China's economy and investment
prospects which opened here today, that there is little room for a
rate cut considering the present rate level.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that the Chinese government has cut
interest rates twice this year after concluding that real interest
rates had been too high.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the growth rate of the broad money supply is
approaching the 16 percent level set by the central bank, while
the increase of the narrow money supply is also expected to
rebound in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the country's economy is going in the
direction of the set macro-control target, with the growth of
fix-assets investment to exceed 15 percent for the year,
which will play a big role in boosting the general economy.
</P>
<P>
He expects the country's commodity price index to soon return
to a normal level from the present negative growth, which will
trigger changes in the real interest rate level.
</P>
<P>
The vice governor believes the government must take into
consideration the exchange rate factor when formulating interest
rate policies in order to avoid the pressure of big interest
rate drops on the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
At present, the nominal rate for one-year savings deposits
stands at 4.77 percent. In August, the national retail price index
dropped 3.3 percent on a year-on-year basis, making the real
interest rate level higher than eight percent.

<HEADLINE> Recession in Japan Dampens German Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany' exports to Japan
dropped by 11.7 percent in the first half of this year, mainly due
to Japan's recession and a weak Japanese Yen, the German Federal
Statistics Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Latest data released by the office showed that Germany's
exports to Japan in the first half year dropped to 9.2 billion
marks (about 5.4 billion U.S. dollars), while imports from Japan
rose by 17.4 percent to 20.8 billion marks (about 12.3 billion
dollars), with a trade deficit of 11.6 billion marks (about 6.9
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Japan remained Germany's second largest trading
partner after the United States, absorbing 1.9 percent of German
exports worldwide and accounting for 5.1 percent of Germany's
total import value, the statistics office said.
</P>
<P>
It also estimated that Germany's trade deficit with Japan for
the whole year could surge to the highest level registered since
1992 when the deficit ran up to 23.3 billion marks (about 13.8
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Keep Commitment on Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government should
keep their commitment on Tibet and not do anything that interferes
in China's internal affairs or hurts Chinese feeling.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
here this afternoon in response to a media report.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the United States provided various
forms of aid to Tibetan splittists in India and that this support
is still going on.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Tibet, an autonomous region of China, is an
inalienable part of the Chinese territories.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibet issue is a pure internal affair of China and the
Chinese government and people oppose any attempt from foreign
force to interfere in the country's internal affairs by putting a
hand in Tibet," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has time and again reaffirmed that Tibet is
part of China and the United States does not support the
"independence" of Tibet, the spokesman pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Commemorates Indian Medical Relief Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A meeting to commemorate the
60th anniversary of an Indian Medical Relief Mission to China in
1938 was held here today at the sponsorship of the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
(CPAFFC).
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC Vice-President Su Guang and Indian Ambassador Vijay
Kunhinandan Nambiar presided over the ceremony. Family members and
friends of Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, a member of the mission,
attended the event.
</P>
<P>
The team of five doctors, including Dr. Kotnis, arrived in
China in 1938 during the War of Resistance to Japanese
Aggression. Dr. Kotnis worked as a surgeon in Eighth Route Army
hospitals in Yan'an and northern China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kotnis joined the Communist Party of China in 1942 and
later served as president of the Bethune International Peace
Hospital following the death of Dr. Norman Bethune. Dr. Kotnis
died of an unspecified illness while working in China.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that China and India are major powers which face
common responsibilities for safeguarding world peace and promoting
economic growth. He also expressed China's desire to further
develop friendly relations with its close neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Nambiar presented a moving speech which he concluded
in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian Medical Relief Mission to China fully displayed the
enthusiasm and earnest desire of the people of both nations to
develop good relations. We have unremittingly pursued further and
better bilateral relations based on mutual understanding and
respect.
</P>
<P>
"Friendly Sino-Indian ties will be a key for ensuring peace and
stability of the region, Asia and the world as a whole," Nambiar
said.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Demands Apology From State-funded Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Thursday accused Australia's state-owned broadcaster
of having a bias against his government and demanded an apology
over his treatment by its interviewer.
</P>
<P>
Simmering tension in the ruling Australian Liberal Party and
National Party coalition over the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation's (ABC's) election campaign coverage boiled over when
Howard appeared on Perth ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reminded interviewer Verity James that the
ABC had a responsibility to provide balanced political coverage in
an election.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was quoted Thursday by the Australian
Associated Press as saying the ABC's coverage of this election
campaign has not been balanced.
</P>
<P>
Howard and the interviewer had some sharp exchanges over the
Liberal Party's decision to accept cigarette sponsorship of its
federal conference and whether he was stressed by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
But the real fireworks began when James asked a question which
wrongly implied the opposition party, the Australian Labor Party,
had suggested that the government's tax reforms would make heroin
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
"Is it cheaper under a GST (goods and services tax), or is it
just cheaper?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pins his election victory on public
acceptance of his taxation reform plan, of which 10 percent GST is
the central piece.
</P>
<P>
Howard was clearly angered by the question, which came shortly
before he was abruptly cut off for a morning news bulletin, the
AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
James promised to clear up the confusion over the question
before the bulletin but did not do so.
</P>
<P>
Howard's advisers and ABC staff exchanged heated words as soon
as the interview finished.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a very odd line of questioning," he later
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that in some way the GST is linked to heroin is
about the most bizarre thing I've heard."
</P>
<P>
"I want an apology from the ABC without qualification, and I
expect to get it."
</P>
<P>
The AAP said Howard's ruling party and the ABC have been waging
a behind-the-scene battle about election coverage over the past
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Howard camp has claimed that their policy launches are
going largely ignored by ABC Television while many of its
mid-evening newsbreaks make no mention of the election.
</P>
<P>
Government figures claimed their complaints were justified this
week when the conservative Institute of Public Affairs released an
analysis of TV news coverage showing ABC reports were four times
more critical of the coalition than of Labor.
</P>
<P>
Caught up in the furor is the issue of ABC funding. The
government made a deep cut into the ABC funding soon after the
last election.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Tumble in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Thursday as the Japanese government's efforts to fix the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) failed to erase worries over the
country's ailing financial system and weakening economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 338.56 points, or 2.38
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 13,859.14.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 18.44 points or 1.70 percent to
1,069.06.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went slightly up to an estimated
410 million shares from Wednesday's 385.94 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The LTCB was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of telecommunications, all 33 TOPIX sectors
declined as a broad range of issues fell to their lowest levels
ever.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei advanced nearly 100 points in the early going and
traders suspected that George Soros, the high-profile hedge fund
manager, has begun to actively buy back Japanese shares.
</P>
<P>
Those gains, however, were wiped clean by the end of the
morning session and shares fell throughout the afternoon as
investors groped for a reason to buy, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, losers
surpassed gainers 912 to 239, with 130 issues remaining
unchanged.

the three-party summit hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with King Sihanouk here, Sam Rainsy told
reporters that the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) supported the king to
host the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
He, who described his four-hour audience with the king as
"cordial and satisfactory", believed that the king can play an
important role as a coordinator.
</P>
<P>
"But we did not touch upon the formation of the new
government," Sam Rainsy added.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy said he places great hopes on the summit meeting. If
agreement can be reached among the three parties, the situation in
Cambodia will return to normal.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released by Royal Palace Thursday
morning, the three-party summit meeting is set on September 22 in
Siem Reap and the National Assembly will be convened on September
24. Then the members of parliament will go to the famous Angkor
Wat temple nearby to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
So far, the three main party leaders have all agreed to
participate in the summit meeting. They are Chea Sim and Hun Sen,
President and vice President of the Cambodian People's Party,
Prince Ranariddh, president of the Funcinpec party and Sam Rainsy
of the SRP.
</P>
<P>
Although the SRP is a small party in parliament, which
could not resist other two main parties in principle, "we will
stick to the election complaints and seek a fair resolution of
them. I will also ask to discuss the civil rights at the meeting
such as the freedom of movement of opposition leaders and members
of Parliament which is banned by the government," Sam Rainsy said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sam Rainsy expressed his concerns that if the current
crisis cannot be solved satisfactorily, the protesters will go to
the street again.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition parties -- the Funcinpec party and the
SRP -- have been protesting against July 26 "election violations."
At least two people have been killed in clashes with the police
and many more injured since the government clamped down on
unauthorized protests in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China appreciates and
welcomes the decision made by Madagascar cabinet on September 9 to
abolish the Madagascar-Taiwan Special Arrangement signed in 1990,
said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the decision at a regular press conference
here this afternoon, Zhu said that the decision will certainly
benefit the smooth development of the friendly and cooperative
relations between China and Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
"The acts of splitting the motherland by the Taiwan authorities
are becoming more and more unpopular in the international
community," Zhu noted, adding that the practise of the "pragmatic
diplomacy" of the Taiwan authorities "has been boycotted and
opposed" by many countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
These facts fully demonstrated that the attempts and activities
of the Taiwan authorities, which run counter to the "one China"
policy, are doomed to fail, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Local Authority Workers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli local authority
workers called off their strike on Thursday, citing "substantial
progress" in talks with the Finance Ministry over their demands
for wage increase.
</P>
<P>
Trade Union of Israeli Local Authorities told Israel Radio
that it hold an over-night negotiation with the Finance Ministry
in an effort to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the ministry still insisted that it would
accept a wage increase not more than 27.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But it agreed to continue discussions with the trade union on
their demand for a 30 percent wage rise.
</P>
<P>
Leon Morozovsky, head of the trade union, said after the talks
that "we will be able to sign an agreement within a few days and I
therefore see no reason to continue the strike."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the strike was "worthwhile" and the trade
union "achieved substantial benefits for the workers".
</P>
<P>
The trade union launched the strike on Tuesday, which kept
some 100,000 employees of the local authorities throughout the
country from their work.
</P>

The strike shut down most of the municipal departments,
hospitals and kindergartens.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Rehabilitation to Cost 900m Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The post-flood rehabilitation
in Bangladesh will cost more than 900 million U.S. dollars, The
Financial Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cost estimate for the rehabilitation program was made on
the basis of primary findings, the report quoted a source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
A concrete rehabilitation plan will incorporate repair and
rehabilitation of surface infrastructure, supply of various kinds
of relief materials, support to farmers and other aspects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Income-generating activities, health and education, repair of
roads and railways and support for agriculture will receive
priority, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The formulation of the rehabilitation program is already under
way, and a move has already been taken to mobilize funds
internally for the program, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The government has already received commitments of over 170
million dollars' worth of materials from donor countries and
international organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the road infrastructure was extensive, with the cost
of restoring the road network estimated at around 20 billion taka
(about 425.5 million dollars), he stated.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Ministry has finalized paper work for diverting at
least 4 billion taka (about 85.11 million dollars) to the
post-flood rehabilitation program, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is also working on how to release funds
from the annual budget for the rehabilitation work, he added.

<HEADLINE> Government Troops Massing for Offensive in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua)-- President Laurent Kabila said
government forces were massing to attack rebel-held towns in the
east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Adressing a rally of about 30,000 people in Kinshasa on
Wednesday, Kabila that despite the war, Congo would go to the
polls next year as planned, said a report reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila called on Kinshasa residents to form civil defence groups
that would be given arms to wage a "people's war" against rebels
and their backers to create a peaceful atmosphere for elections.
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget that the Ugandans are still in Kisangani and
Bunia (in the northeast), and in the east the Rwandans are in
Goma and Bukavu," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But all these towns are being encircled and our forces are
massing up. The local inhabitants, who are following the example
of Kinshasa are arming themselves to take on the enemy," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading in
support of the rebels, but both countries deny direct
involvement. Uganda said it had troops in Congo but only to fight
Ugandan rebels operating from there.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi-led rebels, who took up arms on August 2 in a bid to
topple Kabila, hold a vast swathe of eastern Congo including the
towns of Uvira, Bukavu and Goma.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said 25,000 youths in Kinshasa alone had been recruited
into the army for a planned counter-attack in the east.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to fight
alongside Kabila's forces. The allies have routed the rebels in
the west, driving them out of the towns they held there.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers reported signs of a continuing loyalist
buildup in the central twon of Kindu, the likely springboard for
a push for Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, rebel commander Jonas Padiri said that at
kabila's request hutu fighters from neighbouring burundi had
joined in the war.
</P>
<P>
So far efforts by regional leaders to broker a ceasefire in
the conflict have ended in failure, largely over Kabila's refusal
to meet the rebels and insistence that Rwanda and Uganda first
withdraw their troops.

"At first, it was a little embarrassing for me to sit in the
classroom with teenagers, but gradually I got along with them very
well. They often helped me complete my notes during the break,"
Grandma said.
</P>
<P>
"Grandma" has become the nickname of Dong in the school. Not
only do her young classmates call her so, but also the teachers
and the principal.
</P>
<P>
"Grandma is always the first to arrive at school and her
notebook is often shown as a model in the class," one of the
teachers said.
</P>
<P>
The major subjects of the vocational high school are computer
skills, accounting and English. None of them is easy for an elderly
lady of 71 to learn.
</P>
<P>
"I would have no chances to learn new technology like computers
without the new schooling experience for Wang Li," Grandma said.
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Wang Li had a big operation. With
the help of Grandma, she practised Chinese typing on a keyboard
in bed. Now she can write both English and Chinese articles on the
computer.
</P>
<P>
Wang Li has won several national awards for her strong will as
a handicapped child. But she owes all her achievements to Grandma.
</P>
<P>
Her favorite song is Mariah Carey's "Hero", which goes,"There's
a hero if you look inside your heart...and the sorrow that you
know will melt away." She said," Grandma is my heroine."

CHONGQING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- When the new semester began,
students in the Computer Vocational High School of Chongqing
in Southwest China was surprised to find a hoary-headed old woman
sitting with them in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old woman is called Dong Shizhi, who has been
attending the school for her paralytic granddaughter in the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
Every day, she takes notes in the classes, repeats the lessons
at home to her granddaughter, Wang Li, and then hands in the
girl's homework to the teachers the next day.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the 16-year-old girl has finished junior middle
school and received top scores in the entrance examination to a
vocational high school this year.
</P>
<P>
The age of 16 to a girl like Wang means youth, vigor and
happiness, but life is harsh to Wang Li. She was born with
congenital spinal bifida and has never been able to stand, let
alone walk.
</P>
<P>
"I carried her on my back to school before she was ten, but
then her condition worsened and she had to drop out of school,"
said Wang's father.
</P>
<P>
To comfort the girl, Grandma Dong, who graduated from a
university in the early 1950s, decided to build a bridge between
Wang Li and the school herself. At the age of 64, she appeared in
the primary school classroom.

<HEADLINE> SI To Continue Dialogue With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Pierre Mauroy, visiting
chairman of Socialist International (SI), a world-wide
organization for parties advocating socialist democracy, has said
that SI is willing to continue its dialogue and co-operation with
the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Mauroy's current visit is the first by a SI chairman since
1984 when his predecessor, chancellor of the former Federal
Republic of Germany, Willy Brandt, visited China and reached an
agreement with the CPC to open up regular dialogues. Mauroy said
during a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua that his current
visit is aimed at discussions on issues of common interest and at
continuing cooperation with the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The SI and the CPC share common points and also have
divergences, and he came here this time for candid dialogues on
the basis of mutual respect,
 Mauroy said, adding that cooperation is beneficial to all parties.
</P>
<P>
The chairman has exchanged views with Chinese leaders on
ideology, the market economy, democracy, legislation, and other
issues during his stay in Beijing. He said he believes his talks
with president Jiang Zemin were very fruitful, expressing the
conviction that this meeting, which proceeded in a
 cordial atmosphere, were indicative of sound contacts and
dialogues in the future.
</P>
<P>
Mauroy visited China in 1985 as prime-minister of France and
mayor of Lille. China has witnessed dramatic changes during the
past 13 years, he said when recalling his former visit.
</P>
<P>
The SI, established in 1951 and headquartered in London, has
139 member parties. It advocates a market economy under
macro-control, supports North-South dialogue and cooperation, and
upholds disarmament and peace.

<HEADLINE> Sand Dunes Eyed as Source of Wealth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Decades ago, many farmers left
their homes in Yulin Prefecture in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province because of the invasion of sand dunes. Today, most of them
have come back as the dunes continue to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Just as an American journalist wrote in a recent "Time"
magazine article, it is amazing to see how this place, a desert
land in the past, has turned into an area covered with green grass
and trees.
</P>
<P>
Many people agree that the people of Yulin have achieved much
in their desert-control efforts. Hundreds of foreign experts have
visited the area to discuss desert control methods during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
A 1,500-kilometer-long forest belt now surrounds the moving
sand dunes, and most of the desert area has been covered with
poplar and willow trees as well as other plants; and on both
sides of the Wuding and Yixi rivers, high-yield paddy fields have
replaced barren beaches.
</P>
<P>
Yulin Prefecture, located at the southern border of the Muus
Desert, includes seven cities, counties and 95 townships in a
sandy area covering 24,400 square kilometers, more than 50 percent
of the prefecture's total area.
</P>
<P>
In earlier times, Yulin was a place with a developed agriculture
and animal husbandry. But over the centuries, continuous wars,
blind farming and the excessive felling of trees seriously damaged
the land and it eventually became a desert.
</P>
<P>
By 1949, the moving dunes had surmounted the Great Wall and
moved southward for more than 50 kilometers, burying tens of
thousands of hectares of arable land and pastures, six townships
and more than 400 villages.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li Junzhi, director of the Yulin Prefectural Forestry Bureau,
said that sand storms often hit the area just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the people of Yulin have made great efforts to fight
against desertification for generations. However, there were still
over 533,000 hectares of unimproved desert in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers left their homes and settled down in other
places because of the threat of the desert.
</P>
<P>
This situation has changed greatly since the implementation of
reform and opening up to the outside world. A series of policies
adopted by the local government, under which people who plant
trees can make a profit of their own, has lured many farmers
back.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, more than 10,000 rural families have
contracted for desert land to plant trees and have turned more than
333,000 hectares of desert into green land.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers have established desert control companies and
achieved the twin purposes of stopping the expansion of the desert
and and realizing good economic returns by developing irrigated
farmland and raising domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that this successful desert control should
also be attributed to technical guidance provided by experts and
support from China's Air Force which has conducted aerial
planting for years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997 Yulin had planted trees
on 793,000 hectares, with the forest coverage rate rising to 39.8
percent from the former 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1970s, annual sand storm days have dropped to
22 from 66, and the annual moving speed of the dunes has slowed to 1.6
meters from 7 meters. And the amount of soil and sand washed into
the Yellow River has dropped by 76 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
At present, the area has developed 6,667 hectares of grain land
with an output of 15,000 kilograms, and more than 6,666.7 hectares
of high-yield paddy land. In 1997, the per capita income for local
farmers reached 1,400 yuan (168.7 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local people now regard the sand dunes as a source of wealth,
and some 10,000 farmers have moved into the sandy areas in the
past several years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Violent Turmoil Ebbs, But Tension Persists in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Violent turmoil in Tirana is
apparently on the ebb after it shook the Albanians and even the
world in the past few days, but tension persists and threatens to
reach far into the future.
</P>
<P>
The swirl of violence was touched off by the assassination last
Saturday of Azem Hajdari, a leading opposition deputy in
parliament and one of the founders of the Democratic Party (DP)
led by former president Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The DP reacted with immediate and fierce lashes at the
government as Berisha accused Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano
of masterminding the murder and police agents of pulling the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
Berisha's speech incited hundreds of DP members and supporters
to armed attacks the next day on the Public Security Ministry and
the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
They opened fire at the buildings, burnt several offices on the
first floor and left nothing intact in nearby parking lots.
</P>
<P>
The unrest grew more bloody on Monday morning when Hajdari's
funeral procession escalated into an armed riot involving
thousands of supporters of Berisha who shot or threw grenades at
the Prime Minister's Office building.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported deafening roars of gun fires and billows of
smoke filling the air throughout the street.
</P>
<P>
In the following hours, protesters seized five tanks from the
army, occupied several state institutions including the
parliament, the government building, the constitutional court and
the Finance Ministry and wreaked havoc in places they passed.
</P>
<P>
They broadcast Berisha's speech at the state radio and
television and announced their full control of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 12 opposition parties led by the DP issued an
ultimatum to the government demanding Nano's resignation within 24
hours and establishment of a technical cabinet to prepare new
elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also sent representatives for talks with
President Rexhep Mejdani.
</P>
<P>
However, events did not take their expected course as police
and special army units intervened in the afternoon, arresting some
of the rioters and seized many weapons.
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the police had brought under control an
"armed coup d'etat", as was charged by the parliament and
government.
</P>
<P>
At least three people were killed and dozens injured in the
clashes which also caused unestimatable economic losses, according
to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday evening, Nano said at a cabinet meeting that "the
state will not protect the lives of criminals" and "the security
forces will strike out at crimes without mercy."
</P>
<P>
While affirming the determination to punish murderers of
Hajdari, the Albanian government ordered the DP to hand over
hidden weapons and announced it would prosecute all those involved
in the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the parliament called for early government
efforts to restore social order and normal lives of citizens.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the state prosecutor, a parliamentary
commission met on Wednesday to consider stripping Berisha of his
parliamentary immunity along with five other DP officials and
leaving them open to investigations under law.
</P>
<P>
DP leaders are continuing to defend their roles in the Monday
riot, rejecting accusations of a coup attempt and insisting on
Nano's resignation.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of a police ban, the opposition staged what they
called "peaceful demonstrations" in Tirana on Tuesday and
Wednesday, which passed off without incidents.
</P>
<P>
Although the turbulence in Albania has started to show signs of
easing, analysts warned that the ensuing political conflict would
die hard and its aftermath would have deep-going impact on the
country's future developments.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Restricts Itinerant Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
plans to strengthen the management of some two million itinerant
workers, according to reports presented in Tuesday's fifth meeting
of the Standing Committee of the 11th Beijing Municipal People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li Quanfu, director of the itinerant population management
program, said that 2.86 million itinerant workers account for
almost 20 percent of the capital's total population.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the large influx of itinerant workers has
promoted the development of various sectors, but has also created
problems in terms of sanitation and security.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Public Security Bureau has instituted strong
measures to combat crimes committed by itinerants. Law enforcement
departments had arrested some 3,600 itinerants for alleged
involvement in criminal acts by the end of July this year, with
the figure accounting for 56.6 percent of the total number of the
suspects detained.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation restricts the number of itinerants working
in the industrial and commercial sectors and will limit the total
related workers in the city to 1.81 million by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has pledged to provide better services
and protection for itinerant workers. The city also plans to
establish a professional training center for the itinerant
population.

<HEADLINE> Leeches May Hold Cure for Rheumatoid Arthritis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Leeches could hold clues
for
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Thursday that
a
team composed of scientists at Auckland University's School of
Biology has discovered that a chemical found in European leeches
may
slow the growth of cells in joints affected by rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
The team hopes its research can tell them how the leech-based
chemical reduces arthritis so it can be turned into a drug to beat

the crippling condition.
</P>
<P>
The European leech has long been used for its medical
properties
and more recently for treating people whose limbs have been
severed
or crushed.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to anti-coagulants in its saliva, the European leech has

also been found to benefit heart patients by reducing the risk of

blood clots.
</P>
<P>
Doctors here have already been using a New Zealand leech
variety
to restore blood flow to severed limbs.
</P>
<P>
The NZPA quoted Auckland University biochemist Ken Scott as
saying he is now examining the Kiwi variety to establish whether
it
has healing properties similar to its European cousin.
</P>
<P>
Scott has been awarded a grant by the Auckland Medical Research

Foundation to carry out the project.

<HEADLINE> Britain Joins EU Flight Ban Against Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain has joined a
European Union (EU) ban on flights by the Yugoslav carrier to the
union member states, according to European Commission sources.
</P>
<P>
Britain had said that it could not implement the ban in that it
has to give a year's notice to the Yugoslav national carrier JAT
due to a 1959 bilateral aviation agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the British move annoyed its EU partners.
</P>
<P>
The ban, first agreed upon unanimously in June and finalized
earlier this month, went into effect on September 8.
</P>
<P>
Now only one of the 15 EU member states, Greece, still has not
decided how to move. Greece cited the same excuse as Britain's for
not applying the flight ban.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer said earlier that
a decision made by the 15 (member states) should be implemented by
the 15 and the commission president saw the incident of
non-implementation as a failure on the part of the union.
</P>
<P>
Britain told the weekly commission meeting Wednesday that it
was changing position after British Prime Minister Tony Blair
called Santer to indicate that his country was on the point of
changing position.
</P>
<P>
The commission meeting, held at Strasbourg, was scheduled to
discuss the possibility of taking Britain and Greece to the
European Court of Justice over their non-application of the EU
decision.

<HEADLINE> Debt Removal Key to Africa's Growth: UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A rapid removal of the
current debt burden is vital for Africa's long-term economic
growth, a latest report from a United Nations agency said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's external debt is the highest in the developing
region, said the 1998 report of the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
"There is now ample evidence that Africa's external debt
burden is having a severe adverse impact on investment and
renewed growth," the Daily Nation Thursday quoted UNCTAD chief
Rubens Ricupero as saying in the report.
</P>
<P>
External debt has impeded public investment in physical and
human infrastructure, as well as growth-enhancing spending on
health and education.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero noted that the extent of the debt is indicated by
accumulated arrears which, by 1996, reached more than 64 billion
U.S. Dollars, amounting to more than a quarter of the total debt
in the whole of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Of the greatest concern, according to Ricupero, is that
"two-thirds of the increase in debt since 1988 has been due to
arrears."
</P>
<P>
The debt burden has created a problem of policy credibility
and uncertainty for Africa's private investors whose gains from
investments could be taxed away to service debts, said the UNCTAD
report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Africa has much growth potential "but
it needs fresh policies, institutional reforms and a swift
solution to the debt problem if it is to fully exploit this
potential."
</P>
<P>
The report warns that there would be no growth in Africa
unless appropriate domestic policies is put in place to overcome low
productivity and heavy dependence on a small number of
commodities.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Company Builds Polder in Hangzhou Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) --A Shanghai company will use
silt deposited in the Yangtze River estuary to build a polder in
the Luchaogang area near suburban Nanhui county on the shores of
Hangzhou Bay.
</P>
<P>
Li Tanglong, general manager of the Shanghai Polder
Construction and Development Co. Ltd, said the company has
invested 50 million yuan to construct a 4.5-km diversion dike to
promote silting in 300 sq.km. tidal area east of Nanhui.
</P>
<P>
Li said the company will invest another 50 million yuan to
extend the dike by an additional six km. during second phase
construction. The project will create over 3,533 ha of
cultivatable land by the year 2,000, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The polder will also provide land to support construction of
deepwater port facilities at Dayangshan and Xiaoyangshan which are
located in the eastern section of Hangzhou Bay. The polder will
offer ideal conditions for building auxiliary port facilities,
according to said experts.
</P>
<P>
They added that the planned polder will not only provide
Shanghai with reserve land for developing agriculture, animal

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's two ministries are
starting the work of post-flood rehabilitation, press reports here
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Repair and reconstruction of the roads damaged by the deluge
will cost the government about 13.7 billion taka (291.5 million
U.S. dollars), The Daily Star quoted officials of the
Communications Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cost has been estimated on the basis of damage caused by
the floods up to September 15, they added.
</P>
<P>
"The donor agencies have already been approached for necessary
funds for the repair work," they said, adding that the funding
organizations had already responded positively.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would soon finalize the issue of disbursement of
necessary funds for immediate repair of the roads, they disclosed.
</P>
<P>
About 3,800 kilometers of various roads have been badly damaged
while 4,000 kilometers have been partially damaged during the
over-two-month-long floods this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated that 35 percent of the roads in the
country including national and regional highways as well as feeder
roads have been affected by the deluge, with the total length at
2,862, 1,564 and 15,858 kilometers respectively and 546 culverts
and 562 bridges damaged or washed away.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Agriculture Ministry has taken adequate measures
to recover the losses in the agricultural sector caused by the
devastating floods, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Considering the commitments and responses from the donors, the
government's massive post-flood rehabilitation program and courage
and fortitude of the people in facing the calamity, Agricultural
Minister Begum Motia Chowdhurry said Wednesday, "We are sure to
overcome the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The government has already decided to launch a massive
post-flood agricultural rehabilitation program under which 32.7
billion taka (695.7 million dollars) agricultural loan would be
provided for the flood-affected farmers on easy terms, she stated.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary estimates by the ministry, the
floods have damaged 562,950 hectares of crops causing a shortage
of at least two million tons of grains.
</P>
<P>
The government would also try to distribute vegetable, wheat
and maize seeds free of cost among the poor and marginal farmers,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government had taken some administrative measures
to help rehabilitate the farmers, and it had already withdrawn the
duty on the import of farm tools, she added.

<HEADLINE> E-Business Manifests More Importance in Chinese Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese businesses,
especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, should readily
accept rather than treat electronic business as a new concept.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Department of Small- and Medium-Sized
Enterprises under China's Economic and Trade Commission voiced the
assertion during today's solutions fair jointly organized by the
commission and Intel Corporation. He said the major challenge for
Chinese companies is how to gear their management systems to
computer and networking technology.
</P>
<P>
Wee Theng Tan, chief operations officer and managing director
of Intel (China), said the company, the world's largest chip
manufacturer, will offer state-of-the-art networking technology to
fulfill the needs of Chinese businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The sales volume for the global electronic business will hit
200 billion US dollars by the end of the century," said Wee,
adding that "upgrading information technology is not simply a
luxury, but instead a demand of business competition."
</P>
<P>
The fair featured two seminars in which entrepreneurs and
engineers introduced their experiences in using information and
networking technology.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Wang, president of Hong Kong-based China Infobank Ltd.,
said networking "places small companies on the same footing with
larger companies in terms of the use of information resources."
</P>
<P>
A senior commission official told participants in a recent
conference on policies regarding the introduction of foreign
investment policies that will seek more foreign funds to
accelerate an information revolution in its enterprise sector.
</P>
<P>
Intel has sponsored seminars in a number of Chinese cities,
including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Various other multinationals, including IBM and Microsoft, have
also launched plans to expand cooperation with small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The number of online companies and individuals is expected to
grow from 1.17 million to over seven million over the next few
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has just launched two
telecommunications services linking the Chinese capital with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The project, sponsored by the Beijing Municipal
Telecommunications Bureau and Telstra Corp. Ltd. of Australia,
will provide telecommunications services using frame relay and the
Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN).
</P>
<P>
Frame relay is an exchange service featuring the rapid

capacity to handle emergency data.
</P>
<P>
ISDN, a versatile service which offers voice, data and visual
images via the same telephone line, can be connected to
telephones, fax machines, data terminals and multimedia
computers. The network also offers visual phones, long-distance
medical consulting and teaching services.
</P>
<P>
The network also links Beijing with the United States, Japan,
Germany, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Britain,
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Poland Customs Seize 7 Kilograms of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Polish customs officers on
Sunday seized seven kilograms of cocaine in a town near Germany,
the Polish Press Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The illegal drug was found in a car owned by two Polish men
from northern city Gdansk, who were apparently heading into
Germany. They were arrested on drug trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
Among recent drug seizures, a customs official was quoted as
saying, this is the biggest in the country's western border area.
</P>
<P>
As cocaine is the most expensive drug in Poland, where a gram
could sell for 200-400 zlotys (56-116 U.S. dollars) on the street,
the latest seizure may worth one million zlotys (280,000 dollars)
for drug wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
It might have come from South America, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen Poland being turned into a major transit
place for narcotics targeting West Europe and North America. In
1997, 16 kilograms of cocaine were seized in Poland, about 10
percent of the total seized in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Water-Borne Diseases Likely to Attack 20 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 million people are
feared to be attacked by water-borne diseases such as diarrhea
after the recession of waters in flood-hit areas in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in
a primary estimate, the Bangladesh Observer daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Health officials are now apprehending an outbreak of epidemics
in the flood-affected areas if necessary measures are not taken on
emergency basis to prevent the proliferation of the water-borne
diseases in the post-flood period, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 to 70 percent of the flood victims may face serious
health hazards including diarrheal diseases, fungal, malaria,
scabies, jaundice, acute respiratory track infection and
pneumonia, a medical university associate professor said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from diarrhea has so far risen to 195 while the
number of affected people has reached over 229,000, according to
the Health Department Control Room.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,108 doctors have been working with 4,409 medical teams
across the country to provide medical services to the flood
victims, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-fourths of the country and about two-thirds of the
capital city Dhaka were under water at a certain period during the
over-two-month-long floods, directly and indirectly affecting
about half of the country's 127 million people, with about 30
million seriously hit in 52 of the 64 districts.

ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Satarj Aziz Thursday morning left for Tehran on a special visit to
promote conciliation and avert the dangers of a military
confrontation between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is deeply concerned about the heightening of tension
between Iran and Afghanistan which could pose a serious threat to
the peace and security in the region, said a press release issued
by the Foreign Ministry Wednesday announcing Aziz's visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan hoped that Iran and the Taliban regime will resolve
their difference through peaceful negotiations and Pakistan will
continue to cooperate closely with the two countries to defuse the
present crisis, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz will be carrying a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
for Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. He will assure the Iranian
leadership of Pakistan's commitment to the abiding friendship
between Pakistan and Iran which transcends all vicissitudes.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister will also emphasize the allegation of
Pakistan's interference in Afghanistan was "a fabrication of the
enemies of Pakistan and Iran friendship."
</P>
<P>
Tension between Iran and the Taliban has been arising following
the killing of nine Iranian diplomats by the hard-line militia in
its capture of the northern Afghan city Mazar-e-Sharif early last
month. Iran has vowed to take revenge by any means and already
deployed about 200,000 troops along the Afghan border.

<HEADLINE> Weaker Australian Dollar Contributes to Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A weaker Australian dollar
helped increase Australia's mineral and energy export earnings by
13 percent to a record 40.8 billion Australian dollars (one
Australian dollar to 0.59 U.S. cents) in the past financial year
ending June 30, according to official figures released here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brian Fisher, executive director of the Australia Bureau of
Agriculture of Research Economics (ABARE), said Thursday the
"stronger performance (by the nation's mineral and energy sector)
reflected both higher Australian prices because of the 13 percent
depreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar and
increased export volumes for most minerals and energy
commodities".
</P>
<P>
A weaker Australian dollar as a result of the Asian financial
crisis has made Australian products more competitive on the world
market if they are traded in U.S. dollars and imported goods more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
The major commodities to exhibit rises in export earnings in
value term during the past financial year were gold, increasing by
33 percent, or 14.36 million Australian dollars; coking coal,
lifting by 19 percent, or 935 million Australian dollars;
aluminum, up 36 percent, or 748 million Australian dollars;
steaming coal, jumping 22 percent, or 671 million Australian
dollars; iron and steel, increasing 16 percent, or 223 million
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian mineral resource export price index rose by 6.2
percent in the past financial year compared with the previous
year. Increases mainly occurred in the metals and other minerals
component, which increased by 8.4 percent, while the energy
minerals component rose by 2.8 percent, the bureau said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Fisher said mineral resource imports also reached a new high in
the past financial year of 8.537 billion Australian dollars, an
increase of 16 percent, or about 1.178 billion Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of gold scrap from South Korea and Indonesia were one
of the main contributors to a record level of mineral imports,
with gold imports surging by 238 percent to 1.402 billion
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, imports of petroleum products fell by 14 percent,
or 741 million Australian dollars.

BUCHAREST, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Foreign
Ministry decided Wednesday to streamline its organization in a bid
to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
To make full use of its limited manpower and money, Foreign
Minister Andrei Plesu announced that the ministry will cut the
number of state secretary posts from four to two, and close its
embassies in the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mozambique, Namibia and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its determination to help resolve the Kosovo
crisis, the ministry has decided to increase the number of
Romanian diplomats in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also decided to open embassies in Armenia and
Azerbaijan in a hope to further strengthen its diplomatic
activities in the Caucasus and make sure it will continue to
receive its much-needed petroleum and natural gas from the region.
</P>
<P>
In a sluggish economy and with limited funds, how to
concentrate manpower and money on priorities is a major problem
for the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Creating favorable conditions for joining NATO and the EU and
developing friendly relations with neighboring countries are
important elements in Romania's foreign policies that cry out for
structural reform within the ministry, experts say.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish authorities
will step up cooperation with the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) to clamp down organized crimes and
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Swedish journalists on Wednesday, FBI Director
Louis Freeh said that the first step of bilateral cooperation will
be information sharing and criminals chasing.
</P>
<P>
The major target will be crimes originated in Russia and other
East European countries, including money laundering, drug
trafficking, gambling and blackmail.
</P>
<P>
Organized crimes usually expand across countries, Freeh said,
international cooperation is thus needed to fight them.
</P>
<P>
He said the FBI has rich information on organized crimes in the
Baltic region, which the FBI hopes to share with other nations.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that terrorists are possible to act anywhere
any time, as proved by the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
a month ago. But he did not mention whether Sweden is threatened.
</P>
<P>
Freeh arrived here on Wednesday and has met Swedish Minister
of Justice Laila Freivalds, Junior Minister of Foreign Affairs

<HEADLINE> 680,000 Thai School Children Have Eyesight Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 680,000 primary school
children have been found to be suffering from eyesight problems,
the Bangkok Post said Thursday, quoting the Office of Primary
Education Commission (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The office has decided to make eyesight tests obligatory for
primary school children.
</P>
<P>
Kasama Voravan na Ayudhya, the OPEC's secretary-general, said
she has ordered all primary education offices to conduct basic
eyesight checks on school children and provide them with
spectacles if needed.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's move came after an initial survey by a hospital's
Eye-glasses Bank, which found some 680,000 children, or about 10
percent, at primary schools nationwide have eyesight or other
visual problems.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who have eye problems are suffering from
short-sightedness or myopia, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
A coordinator at the Eye-glasses Bank said visual problems in
these children have worsened due to lack of care from parents and
teachers, as well as lack of proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
She said that unless these problems are detected and treated at
an early stage, they will be impossible to correct.
</P>
<P>
Visual impairment directly affects children's learning ability.
Children with eyesight problems, especial myopia, usually develop
headaches when they try to focus their eyes, and in some cases
they simply give up their studies, she said.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator suggested that teachers be trained to perform
basic eyesight tests so that eye problems in children can be
detected early and corrected properly.

five years before becoming head coach on February 19, 1989. He

<HEADLINE> Don King's Lawsuit Can't Stop Chavez-Hoya Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Promoter Don King failed
to stop Julio Cesar Chavez to fight with Oscar De La Hoya when he
used his contract dispute to accuse the boxer, an appeals court
ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
King and Chavez are entangled in a battle over an exclusive
contract the boxer signed with Don King Productions Inc. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
After he signed with King, Chavez agreed to a two-bout deal
with Top Rank Inc. and sued over his agreement with King.
</P>
<P>
King countered with his own suit, accusing Chavez of breach of
contract and asking a judge to keep Chavez out of the ring for
the Top Rank bouts.
</P>
<P>
King canceled a hearing to prevent Chavez's first fight in
June, but renewed the request in August for the De La Hoya fight.
Chavez and De La Hoya meet in rematch in Las Vegas on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
A Broward County judge said there was no reason to prevent
Chavez from fighting because King could not show the company had
suffered irreparable harm. The 4th District Court of Appeal
Wednesday agreed with the trial judge.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Campaign Against German Measles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a
national immunization campaign to eliminate German measles,
according to Health Ministry sources Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Minister of Health Nimal Siripala de Silva
as saying at a seminar Wednesday that German measles had earlier
contributed to the birth of disabled children causing pain of mind
and depression to parents and families.
</P>
<P>
The campaign named "Rubella Immunization Program", will
initially cover the female population of 3.1 million in the 11 to
44 age group in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Already 4 million doses of Rubella vaccine costing 90,000 U.S.
dollars had been imported by the government.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 900 disabled children are born each
year in Sri Lanka. The immunization project is expected to reduce
the number considerably.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the danger of German measles is that its
 symptoms are so light that many who are affected do not know that
they have the disease, and that the best way to tackle the problem
is immunization.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Panama's banana export
registered a 28 percent decrease in the first eight months of
1998, according to statistics published on Wednesday by the
Industry and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Panama exported 15.875 million boxes of bananas (18.14
kilograms per box) during the period, 28 percent down from the 22
million mark in the same period of 1997.

<P>
Banana export earns the country more than 120 million dollars
every year, the second largest earner after shrimp export, which
also lost 30 million dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the decrease to the 57-day strike of
1,500 workers for salaries increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi voiced satisfaction Wednesday that the Albanian situation
appeared to be returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, Prodi admitted that "for a while" he
feared the repetition of last year's anarchy that spurred Italy to
lead an international mission to restore order and pave the way
for elections.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he was in constant touch with Albanian leaders,
urging them to end the violence and resume political talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy and the international community were entitled to
make such calls because of their action in bolstering Albania's
fledgling democracy and aiding its economic and civic
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In Tirana, opposition leader and ex-president Sali Berisha was
acclaimed by thousands of supporters in another peaceful
demonstration Wednesday in the main Skanderbeg Square.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference later, Berisha rejected suggestions that
Monday's disturbances had been a coup attempt. He said they were
the result of a "trap" laid by Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Wednesday named Austrian diplomat Herbert
Grebmayr as its special envoy to Albania.

<HEADLINE> Central America Tourism Revenues Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Central America's tourism
revenues are expected to be up 14 percent this year from the 1.7
billion U.S. dollars reaped last year, said a regional trade group.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here on Wednesday, the Central America
Tourism Integration System (CATIS) put the number of people
visiting countries in the region at about 2.8 million a year.
</P>
<P>
By countries, tourist visits to Nicaragua increased the most
quickly by 21 percent in 1997 compared with 10 years ago, to Costa
Rica, up by 11 percent, and El Salvador, by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the tourism income, the report said, Nicaragua
registered a 21.9 percent growth over that of 10 years ago, Costa
Rica 11 percent, and El Salvador 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is the most frequently visited country, because
citizens from other countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras do not need a passport to travel within the region,
instead they only use an identification (ID) card.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is not part of this ID agreement, so it is the least
country, said the CATIS report.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by 5.1 percent during the first half of this
year, the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP in real terms went up by 4.4 percent during the second
quarter of 1998 in contrast to the 5.8-percent growth in the first
quarter.

services sector accounted for 51 percent of the overall growth
while the manufacturing sector grew by 25.6 percent, construction

percent.
</P>
<P>
The transport services and communication sub-sector increased
by 37 percent. The factory industry which accounts for 80 percent
of the manufacturing industry grew by 8.1 percent. The impetus was
mainly from the textile and wearing apparel industry which
achieved a 10.9-percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The food and beverages sector also grew by 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
External trade in July recorded a surplus of 9 million U.S.

<HEADLINE> Key Ally of Italian Government Unhappy with Budget Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government's left
ally, the Communist Refoundation, said Wednesday it was "very
worried" about plans for the 1999 budget, raising the prospect of
an imminent break with Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in which Prodi outlined the new budget bill to
party leaders from his parliamentary majority, the Communist
Refoundation Secretary Fausto Bertinotti said it failed to meet
his calls for a drastic shift in policy.
</P>
<P>
"The change isn't there," said Bertinotti, who has been
demanding for months that this year's budget do more to promote
jobs and support the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
He has made it plain that if the budget fails to satisfy
demands he will withdraw his party's support and bring the
government down.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is a repeat of last autumn when, in return for its
continued support, the party forced Prodi to concede a commitment
on a 35-hour week and the creation of a southern jobs agency.
</P>
<P>
Referring to budget plans he had been shown Wednesday night,
Bertinotti said that at times there seemed to be an attempt to
meet his demands, but then it became clear that "substance was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to the actual spending, there's always money for
supporting business, but if its for pensioners or for the
unemployed, then it becomes very tight," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti noted that the meeting was the first of several and
hence there was still time for an agreement to be reached.
</P>
<P>
Franco Marini, leader of the People's Party, said there would
be another meeting next week, but that Wednesday's meeting had
gone "rather well."
</P>
<P>
Massimo D'Alema, head of the biggest party in the ruling Olive
Tree coalition, downplayed the difference between the Communist
Refoundation and other parties in the government's majority.
</P>
<P>
"The differences aren't such as to imply a break," he said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema noted that there were several elements in Prodi's
package that should appeal to the Communist Refoundation. He
pointed in particular to the extra 5.5 trillion lire (3.24 billion
U.S. dollars) set aside to promote employment.
</P>
<P>
After explaining the budget to political leaders, Prodi met
with the employers' association Confindustria, which is also being
consulted on the package. He is expected to meet labor unions for
the same purpose on Thursday.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts warned today that the
Yarlung Zangbo River, which sits at the highest elevation of any

<P>
Yang's 21-member team is undertaking a rafting expedition to
collect ecological data about the region. The mission was delayed
several weeks ago due to inclement weather in Tibet, but was
resumed earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Yang reported that the team arrived at the source of the river
last week and found that many wild species have either faced
extinction or have otherwise moved to other areas because of the
lack of water and dry climate.
</P>
<P>
Zhongba County, the county closest to the river's source, its
seat has been relocated three times due to desertification. The
existing county seat, established in 1996, will quite likely have
to be relocated again in 20 years, according to Puchong, secretary
of the Zhongba county Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot exclude the possibility that the river will become
either a seasonal or inland river if the current trend continues,"
said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a telephone interview with Xinhua News Agency, Yang
attributed the dangerous situation to global climate changes,
including the greenhouse effect and human activities depleting
forest resources.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the immediate implementation of an afforestation
project to hold back the encroaching desert and improve the
ecology.

BELGRADE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Dry weather conditions are
likely to cut deep, probably by over one-third, into the year's
maize harvest in the Yugoslav federation.

<P>
The official Tanjug news agency said the country's total maize
output this year, by estimation, would be 5.55 million metric
tons, down three million tons from last year.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said the country, with a surplus of 1.5
million tons from last year, still has the ability to export one
million tons of maize after meeting the domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
In the same report, Tanjug said the output of sunflower seeds

respectively this year, more than enough for the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
As a result, said the report, the country would be able to
export 10,000 tons of cooking oil made from the two crops.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania has decided to join
the European Union countries in placing sanctions on the Yugoslav
Federation and banning Yugoslav airlines from landing in its
airports, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is a clear political signal to the Yugoslav
authorities, a statement by the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The statement strongly condemned the escalation of fighting in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, and extended a hope that Yugoslav
leaders would seek a peaceful solution through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Romania, as a liaison country of the EU, will focus on
coordinating its foreign policy and security standards with those
of the EU, the statement noted.

Ten days ago, an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Austria made
the decision to ban Yugoslav airlines from landing in EU
countries, as part of a series of sanctions against the Yugoslav
Federation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, almost half of Yugoslav air routes have been
forced to close.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Treasurer Peter Costello Wednesday challenged
wide-spread fears that Australia is heading for a crippling
economic slump, suggesting the economy could pick up speed as
early as next year after a temporary slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard has conceded that tax
reform may cost his government the election to be held on October
3 as he was forced to defend his tax package against a scathing
assessment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, whose party
represents farmers, Wednesday tried to avoid a face-to-face
meeting with a leading member of One Nation Party after being
jeered and heckled by 200 angry farmers in Yass, a small town in
the New South Wales state.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian-New Zealand airline Ansett has launched a
three-year drive to revive the company's earnings with plans to
radically overhaul its regional operations, acquire 180 million
U.S. dollars' worth of new jets and exit its fourth Asian market.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona Refuse to Lie down at Old Traffo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United had
midfielder Nicky Butt sent off and conceded a two-goal lead to
draw 3-3 with Barcelona in their opening European Champions
League match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Italian referee Stefano Braschi sent Butt off for deliberate
handball in the 70th minute and ten-man United were never going
to come back when Luis Enrique converted the resultant penalty.
</P>
<P>
It had all started so well for United. David Beckham and Ryan
Giggs ran rings round Barcelona in the first half and the Red
Devils surged into an effortless 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
In the 10th minute Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was denied by the
woodwork after latching onto a Giggs cross.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later Beckham beat Sergi for pace down the right
and his deep cross found Giggs, who headed superbly past Ruud
Hesp.
</P>
<P>
In the 24th minute Beckham sent over another great cross and
Dwight Yorke connected with an overhead kick, which Hesp parried
and Enrique tapped into the path of Paul Scholes who buried the
ball from eight yards.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona might had pulled a goal back in the 32nd minute when
Luis Figo deflected Boudewijn Zenden's shot past Schmeichel, but
the Barcelona captain was inexplicably ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel made a point-blank save from Sonny Anderson two
minutes before the break but in the 47th minute the Brazilian
made amends.
</P>
<P>
Rivaldo ran at the United defence and when the ball broke to
Anderson, he fired home.
</P>
<P>
United brought on Butt for Solskjaer in a bid to stem the tide
but in the 58th minute the visitors levelled the tie from the
penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
Jaap Stam was harshly adjudged to have fouled Rivaldo and
Giovanni netted the spot kick.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later United were in the ascendancy again when
Beckham restored their lead with an exquisite 25-yard free kick,
a carbon copy of his wonder goal for England against Colombia in
France 98.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona were not finished though and Anderson hit the post
in the 70th minute and from the ensuing scramble Butt handled on
the line. The England midfielder headed for the Old Trafford
dressing room as Enrique dispatched the penalty.
</P>
<P>
United were forced to hang on for a point at the end of this
rollercoaster match but Alex Ferguson will be cheered by news of
Bayern Munich's defeat in Group D's other match in Denmark. End

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission said Wednesday that Italy's
air traffic distribution plan between the two airports near Milan
violates European Union (EU) law.
</P>
<P>
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said that the
commission, the executive arm of the 15-nation EU, agreed that the
redistribution of air traffic between Linate and Malpensa airports
went against EU laws on fair competition.
</P>
<P>
The decision was originally postponed for a week so the Italian
government could reconsider its decree on moving almost all other
European countries' airlines out of the convenient Linate airport
to newly-built Malpensa. (Italy-Airport-EU)

STOCKHOLM -- Swedish inflation fell by 0.5 percent in August,
bringing the annual inflation rate to about zero, down from nearly
two percent at the end of last year.

in tobacco tax, was the largest in a single month since November
1992. (Sweden-Inflation)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and Czech President

<P>
Welcoming Havel at a South Lawn ceremony by the White House,
Clinton praised the Czech president for his role in his country's
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"It owes a very great deal, in our time, to the inspiration
provided by a single man, Vaclav Havel, who for years spoke when
it mattered and often at enormous personal cost," Clinton said.

KIEV -- The number of jobless in Ukraine reached 1.2 million by
the end of August, which accounting for 3.08 percent of the
workforce, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the first eight months of 1998
increased by 50 percent over the same period of last year. The
rate in some states has reached five or six percent.

WASHINGTON -- The "Gulf War syndrome" are not only common among
Gulf War veterans, they are also frequently reported by soldiers
who never went to the region, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The syndrome, such as fatigue, moodiness, memory problems and
muscle pain, that many Gulf War veterans complain of are not
likely to be explained by toxic exposures, exotic infections or
other risk factors peculiar to the war, said a report by a team of
epidemiologists in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association. (US-Gulf-War-Illness)

<HEADLINE> Olano Stays ahead in Tour of Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Abraham Olano held off tough
challenge to stay ahead at the Tour of Spain on Wednesday after a
spectacular 11th stage from the Andorran frontier to Cerler,
Spain.
</P>
<P>
While the Spaniard's lieutenant Jose Maria Jimenez foiled the
plans of Fernando Escartin for a second day to score his third
stage win in six days, 1995 Tour of Spain winner Laurent Jalabert
struck in the closing kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Attacking in the last kilometer, the Frenchman finished sixth,
13 seconds behind Jimenez, and trimmed six seconds from Olano's
overnight advantage of 41 seconds.
</P>
<P>
He is now 35 seconds behind Olano overall.
</P>
<P>
Escartin was third behind teammate Roberto Heras after the
186km race, and closed to within 51 seconds of the race leader in
third place overall.

<HEADLINE>   Champions League Openers Witness Dramatic Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The opening matches of the
European Champions' League were added with the flavour of
dramatic finale with four games having their results changed in
the dying seconds.
</P>
<P>
Sinica Gogic of Olympiakos scored in the last minute to snatch
a 2-2 draw at Portuguese side Porto when the Greeks had trailed
2-0 with four minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Brondby's Allan Ravn scored in the final minute to give his
Danish side a 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich, who had led 1-0
with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
PSV Eindhoven's Arnold Bruggink was the hero to score in the
dying seconds to earn a 2-1 fightback win at home to HJK Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
And Lens striker Tony Vairelles, who won his first French cap
against Austria last month, earned a 1-1 draw against England's
Arsenal as the referee was about to blow his whistle.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Clarence Seedorf also hit a last minute goal for Real
Madrid who won 2-0 against Inter Milan, but the competition's
holders were set for victory anyway with Fernando Hierro
converting an 80th minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
And goals were flying in during the evening with 32 in the 12
matches.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United and Barcelona served up a feast of football
at Old Trafford as United threw away a 2-0 lead to draw 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Welsh wizard Ryan Giggs gave United a dream start by netting
after 17 minutes from a David Beckham cross from the right.
</P>
<P>
But once Giggs had opened the scoring it looked as if that
would open the floodgates and when Paul Scholes scored the second
on 24 minutes after Ruud Hesp had saved Dwight Yorke's overhead
kick that appeared to confirm that a runaway victory was on the
cards.
</P>
<P>
But after half-time it all started to go wrong for United,
with referee Stefano Braschi in their eyes the villain of the
piece.
</P>
<P>
First of all Sonny Anderson pulled one back with a neat finish
on 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
And then the Italian official awarded Barcelona two penalties
in the second period -- the first of which was questionable --
with Giovanni and Luis Enrique finding the net.
</P>
<P>
Braschi sent off Nicky Butt for handling the ball for the
second spotkick.
</P>
<P>
Vairelles celebrated his recent arrival on the international
scene by stealing a point with an last-gasp header for Lens to
deny Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
All looked lost for the French until Vairelles, who made his de
but for France a month ago, nodded home from close range
following a Daniel Moreira left-wing corner almost three minutes
into injury time to spike the Gunners' hopes in a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal had earlier seemed to be coasting to victory after
Marc Overmars fired to put the Premiership champions ahead in the
51st minute.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich made a disastrous start to their Champions
League program here, going down 2-1 at Denmark's Brondby, who
came back with two late goals after going behind.
</P>
<P>
Bayern looked to have wrapped up an important smash-and-grab
win when Markus Babbel scored with a close-range header in the
77th minute following a Stefan Effenberg freekick.
</P>
<P>
But in a calamitous final three minutes for the Bavarians,
center back Thomas Helmer put through his own goal Helmer and
Allan Ravn netted a long-range winner seconds from time.
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos of Greece earned a 2-2 draw from Porto with two
goals in the final four minutes.
</P>
<P>
Zlatko Zahovic and Mario Jardel had given the Portuguese side
the lead before Stylianos Giannakopoulos, in the 86th minute and
then Sinica Gogic in the dying seconds brought Olympiakos a point.
</P>
<P>
French referee Gilles Veissiere was a busy man during the
night putting three players from each team into his notebook as
well as logging the four goals.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid opened their title defence with a convincing 2-0
victory over 10-man Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
Inter had defender Salvatore Fresi sent off just before
half-time but held out until the 80th minute, when Fernando
Hierro drove home a penalty. Dutchman Clarence Seedorf then
sealed victory in injury-time.
</P>
<P>
Real fully deserved their win after outclassing Inter in every
department, giving Ronaldo no chance to show his skills in the
Group C tie.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish side took charge right from the whistle, with not
only forwards Raul and Pimentel Savio but also overlapping
wingbacks Roberto Carlos and Christian Panucci all causing
trouble for the Inter defence.
</P>
<P>
A 65th-minute scorcher from Roar Strand secured a 1-1 draw for
Norwegian champions Rosenborg Trondheim at Athletic Bilbao at a
packed San Mames stadium here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spanish international Joseba Etxeberria scored after just five
minutes for Bilbao following a mistake by Eric Hoftun but the
expected goalrush never materialised.
</P>
<P>
And Bundesliga champions Kaiserslautern had a Martin Wagner
goal to thank for a precious 1-0 win over Portugal's Benfica as
they launched their bid for glory in Group F.

<HEADLINE> UK's Unemployment at Lowest since 1980 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's unemployment has
continued to fall despite the recent spate of high profile
redundancy announcements.
</P>
<P>
Government figures show that in the three months to July the
main measure of unemployment dropped by 55,000 to 1,790,000, a
jobless rate of 6.2 percent. The older measure of unemployment,
which counts the number of people out of work and claiming
benefits, fell by 16,400 in August to 1.3 million, the lowest
level since May 1980.
</P>
<P>
The jobless figures were better than London's financial City
experts had predicted, with most forecasters expecting only a
modest fall, or even a rise, in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Worries about the impact of the strong pound and fears of a new
recession in manufacturing left some analysts predicting that
unemployment had bottomed out and that dole queues were set to
rise again.
</P>
<P>
There have been a series of high-profile redundancy
announcements recently at Siemens and Fujitsu in the north east.
</P>
<P>
Britain's employment minister Andrew Smith welcomed the buoyant
labour statistics, saying that "The rate of employment in the UK
rose to 73.5 percent, the highest in Europe apart from Denmark,
and 8 percent higher than Germany and 13 percent higher than
France."
</P>
<P>
"Whilst these figures demonstrate government employment policy
success, there are some sectors of industry facing difficulties
and we are redoubling efforts to help people facing redundancy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the overall picture is encouraging and the
government's drive for sustainable growth, investment in skills
and high employment in place of boom and bust, is on course," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"That is why it is important to view the recent job losses
reported in the media in the wider context of what is happening in
the labour market as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith also welcomed the fall in average earnings figures,
noting that "The second successive fall in average earnings is
another factor in ensuring that we continue to have a healthy
labour market with low inflation.
</P>
<P>
"It is important, therefore, that employers continue to make
sure that increases in wages are in line with improvements in
productivity and what they can afford," he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Boost Arms Embargo Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution, calling
upon all member states to make efforts to outlaw the violations of
arms embargoes in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "encourages each member state, as
appropriate, to consider the adoption of legislation or other
legal measures making the violation of arms embargoes established
by the Council a criminal offence," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested the Security Council Committees
established by resolutions imposing arms embargoes in Africa to
include in their annual reports a substantive section on the
implementation of the arms embargoes, on possible violation of
measures reported to the Committee and with recommendation as
appropriate for strengthening the effective of the arms embargoes.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urged member states, relevant United
Nations bodies and agencies and other international agencies to
consider the provision of technical and other assistance, in
consultation with the states concerned, to facilitate the
implementation of arms embargoes.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed that "arms embargoes established by
the Security Council should have clearly established objectives
and provisions for regular view of the measures with a view to
lifting them when the objectives are met."
</P>
<P>
The resolution came following the Security Council's formal
consideration of a report by Kofi Annan, the United Nations
secretary-general, which devoted details to the causes of
conflicts in Africa and the ways to ensure sustainable development
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, together with a presidential statement on how
to strengthen peacekeeping capacity in Africa, coincided with
international and African efforts to bring an end to conflicts in
the Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Growth of World Economy Expected to drop 1.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Growth in the world
economy is expected to be 2 percent this year, a drop of 1.2
percentage points from 1997, according to U.N. Trade and
Development Report 1998 released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the Asian economic crisis which is more serious
in terms of its scope and repercussions, than any other such
crisis in the past three decades, and its full effects have yet to
be felt, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the crisis in East Asia is about 1 percent of
global output this year or some 260 billion U.S. dollars,
equivalent to the annual income of sub-Saharan Africa, it added.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in many years, growth in the developing
world will fall bellow that in the developed economies, to less
than 2.5 percent, half that of 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis will reduce both Gross Domestic Product and
export growth in the European Union by over 0.5 percentage points
this year while growth in Japan is expected to be negative for the
year.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the excess of private spending over
incomes which has driven recent growth cannot continue, and "a
rougher landing than currently foreseen" is a distinct
possibility, the report continued.
</P>
<P>
Unless East Asia switches from deflation to reflation, and the
European countries and Japan boost global demand for goods and
services, there could be a full-blown global recession, the UNCTAD
warned.
</P>
<P>
The report said trade has been a key factor in spreading the
crisis and the growth of world trade in volume terms in 1998 will
drop well below the 1997 figure of 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The major industrial countries have to date gained more from
declining commodity prices and improving terms of trade than they
have lost from cuts in exports to Asia, UNCTAD argued.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China today
issued the market exchange rates in RMB yuan against three major
currencies. The middle price of RMB against convertible currencies
is mainly based on the closing price of the preceding interbank
trading.
</P>
<P>
The designated foreign exchange trading banks will decide the
exchange rates in RMB yuan against other convertible currencies

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Strengthen Africa's Peacekeeping  Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday released a presidential statement, echoing
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's viewpoints that efforts should be
made to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "affirms that strengthening Africa's
capacity to participate in all aspects of peacekeeping operations,
including their military, police, humanitarian and other civilian
components, is a key priority," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council encourages increased bilateral and
multilateral cooperation in the field of peacekeeping, especially
capacity-building, between member states, the United Nations and
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as well as subregional
organizations in Africa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council encourages contributions, financial and
in kind, aimed at enhancing Africa's peacekeeping capacity," the
statement said, "in particular, it urges member states to
contribute to the trust funds established by the United Nations
and the OAU to improve preparedness for conflict prevention and
peacekeeping in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also welcomes the proposal of the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to establish an informal working
group composed of African and non-African states directly involved
or interested in the provision of training assistance, the
presidential statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council underlines the importance of the
availability of appropriately trained personnel and relevant
equipment for all components of peacekeeping operations," the
statement said, adding that "The council further encourages the
use of the United Nations Training Assistance Teams as a useful
tool in support of national peacekeeping training."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "also encourages the exchange of lessons
learned from previous operations," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council also asked the U.N. chief to
study ways to improve the availability of logistics for
peacekeeping efforts in Africa, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council issued the presidential statement
following its formal consultations on a report by Annan, which
analyzed the root causes of conflicts in Africa and how to
achieve sustainable development in the war-ravaged continent.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement coincided with international and
African efforts to bring an end to conflicts in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Angola and the Republic of Central Africa.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Public Opinion Favors Censuring Clinton  Rather than Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Public opinion after the
release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report remains in
favor of censuring President Bill Clinton rather than impeaching
him or seeking his resignation.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News-New York Times poll released Tuesday and a CNN/USA
Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday show Clinton maintaining a
robust job approval rating above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
A majority of Americans still oppose ousting Clinton from
office, with the CBS-Times poll finding 58 percent against
beginning impeachment hearings over his affair with a White House
intern and effort to cover it up, and 64 percent saying they do
not think Clinton should resign. But 57 percent believe Congress
should censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today poll found 45 percent favoring a reprimand or
censure, but allowing Clinton to remain in office. However, 50
percent favored congressional hearings to investigate the charges
in the report and, among likely voters, 58 percent favored
hearings.
</P>
<P>
The public remains critical of Clinton's personal behavior.
Sixty-six percent of those polled in the CBS-Times survey said
Clinton does not share the moral values that most Americans try to
live by, and 45 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
And the CNN-USA Today survey found a statistical dead heat over
who people preferred to have more influence over the direction the
nation takes in the next year: 44 percent Clinton and 43 percent
the Republicans in Congress. Among likely voters, 50 percent
wanted the Republican to have more influence and 38 percent
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The same survey of likely voters found 48 percent are likely
for vote Democratic in the upcoming congressional elections and 47
percent Republican.
</P>
<P>
The CBS-Times telephone poll of 1,813 adults conducted between
September 12-14 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today survey of 1,028 adults September 14-15 had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The subgroup
of 401 likely voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Robertson: S-300 Missiles to Aggravate Tension in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Defense
Secretary George Robertson said here Wednesday that the planned
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in
Cyprus would aggravate the tension on the divided island republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Greek counterpart, Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, Robertson said that the S-300 missiles did not add
anything to the security of Cyprus, but added to the existing
tension, and the priority now was to reduce tension there.
</P>
<P>
He would make one "differentiation" to the right of each
government to determine its defense program and asked whether it
was wise for the Cypriot government to purchase and deploy the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
But Tsohatzopoulos did not agree with Robertson's such views,
saying that Britain should look at the wider picture of reducing
armaments with the final aim of fully demilitarizing Cyprus, which
has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Athens believed that a ban on military flights over Cyprus
could be the first step in reducing armaments, and this first step
could then be expanded to other areas, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has rejected the proposal of imposing a military
flight ban over Cyprus, has threatened to use force to prevent the
installation of the missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has insisted that it has the right to strengthen its
defense capacity to deal with Turkey's threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which has a joint defense pact with Cyprus, has warned
that such strikes by Turkey would be a cause for war.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also described the Turkish side's proposal of
establishing a confederation of two states on Cyprus as
"impossible", saying that it ran counter to 25 years of United
Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also stressed the need of seeking a political
solution to the Kosovo problem.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Dives by Nearly 23 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ruble tumbled
again Wednesday, with the Central Bank's official rate shedding
22.8 percent amid fears of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
The official rate, based on the average of trading on the
Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX), fell to 12.45 to the
dollar from 9.6 to the dollar the day before.
</P>
<P>
Trading on MICEX, Russia's main trading floor, showed an even
steeper drop. The ruble fell to 12.59 rubles to the dollar at the
close of trade Wednesday, down from Tuesday's high of 7.3 rubles.
</P>
<P>
At exchange booths, dollars were being sold for over 15 rubles
to the dollar. But many banks ran out of dollars and closed down
exchange operations.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate on MICEX hit a low of 20.83 to the dollar a
week ago, but bounced back to 7.3 mid-Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the brief improvement in the ruble rate
before Tuesday was due to manipulation by Russian banks who owed
foreigners billions of dollars for forward contracts.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said that the Central Bank had also helped this
process by selling dollars and pushing up the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has refused to comment on the allegations.

<HEADLINE> U.S., S.Korea Reach $2 Billion Export Credit Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import
Bank and South Korea reached an agreement on a two billion U.S.
dollars export credit program, allowing South Korean companies to
purchase U.S. goods and services.
</P>
<P>
"This important agreement represents Ex-Im Bank's critical role
in assisting U.S. exporters and should help to maintain trade
flows to (South) Korea, especiallys in response to the financial
situation in Asia," said Chairman James Harmon of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the bank may make available as much as two
billion U.S. dollars to support exports of U.S. capital goods and
services to South Korea with repayment terms of up to five years.
</P>
<P>
The program is structured in two tranches, each for one billion
U.S. dollars, and financing extended will carry the sovereign
guarantee of the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
The financing support in the program will be in the form of
direct loans to the Korean Development Bank, which will then use
loan to finance the purchase of U.S. capital goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank is an independent U.S. government agency. In
fiscal year 1997, it supported 15 billion U.S. dollars of U.S.
exports.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates Stand on Cyprus' Missile Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey reiterated Wednesday
that it will not allow the Russian-made S-300 missiles to be
deployed in Cyprus, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
To postpone the deployment of the missiles on the island is by
no means a substantial step to end the crisis created by Cyprus,
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a weekly
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Arbitrary decisions for postponement will not bring a
solution to the present problems, will not change the essence
of the issue and will even cause the present situation to
deteriorate," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while commenting on recent press
reports that the Cypriot government has decided to put off
deployment of the S-300 missiles till December. The deployment
was scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that neither Turkey nor Turkish Cypriots can
tolerate the utilization of the S-300 missiles which is a constant
element of threat, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia early last year to buy
the surface-to-air S-300 missiles to boost its defense capacity.
</P>
<P>
Annoyed by the act, Turkey has vowed to take all necessary
measures to deter the missiles from being deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish General Staff has urged Russia to give up
this arms contract with Cyprus. But this was turned down by
Moscow which said that Cyprus has the right to buy conventional
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a supporter of the Cypriot government, has also
said that it will stand firmly by the Greek Cypriots if they
are attacked by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops intervened and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed
in northern Cyprus to provide security protection to Turkish
Cypriots there.

<HEADLINE> UK Police Uncover Child Abuse Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Four men pleaded guilty to the
sexual abuse of children Wednesday after British police cracked
a paedophile ring connected to a breakaway scouting group.
</P>
<P>
The trial of four men had led police to disclose their
discovery of a "huge network" of child abuse, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were now trying to trace more than 50 boys who
may urgently need help.
</P>
<P>
The two scout groups involved -- both part of the UK Baden
Powell Scouting Association -- are nothing to do with the
mainstream Scout association.
</P>
<P>
One of the four men who pleaded at the Old Bailey was Brian
Turner, 60, a convicted paedophile who was a member of child
killer Sidney Cooke's "dirty dozen" gang.
</P>
<P>
Turner and three others -- Dennis Ward, 66, Keith Spratt, 50,
and Robert Kearns, 50 -- admitted sexually abusing the boy after
being introduced to him by a scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
The boy was 10 years old when he joined one of the self-styled
scouting groups, which was run by scoutmaster Douglas Braithwaite,
who died last year.
</P>
<P>
Police have discovered thousands of pictures and videos hidden
in Kearns' home and are desperate to trace the children in the
pornographic images.
</P>
<P>
Some of these films were recovered abroad and showed some of
the men violently assaulting young children.
</P>
<P>
Five police forces are now involved in the inquiry, which has
spread to France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain, and could
involve as many as 300 victims.

interest of their people first and agree to negotiations for
durable peace.

<HEADLINE> UK Pledges to Honor Flight Ban on Yugoslav Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government said
Wednesday that it would impose an immediate ban on all Yugoslav
carriers amid increasing verbal attacks from its European Union
(EU) partners.
</P>
<P>
Last week, EU countries agreed to impose an air ban on
Yugoslavia to punish Belgrade's alleged crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, but Britain originally said a 1959 bilateral
agreement with Belgrade meant it had to give a year's notice
before it could halt flights.
</P>
<P>
London's refusal to implement the EU flight ban has drawn angry
reactions from the other members of the 15-nation bloc and is
considered as an embarrassment for the EU foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
However, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Wednesday
that Britain would change its position and ordered an immediate
ban on Yugoslav carriers in a bid to give the "continued
repressive activities" of Yugoslav troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"In the changed circumstances, we have concluded that it would
be right to proceed the immediate flight ban," Cook said. "The UK
is determined to strengthen the sanctions regime."
</P>
<P>
Cook also made it clear that Britain would press for "a U.N.
Security Council resolution, which would include a worldwide
flight ban on the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)."

<HEADLINE> Surviving Iranian Diplomat Appears on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The only Iranian diplomat
who survived the massacre by the Afghan Taliban militia
appeared on Iran's state-run television Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Allahdad Shahsavan Qare-Husseini, head of the secretariat of
the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif and in charge of the
refugee affairs, was shot and wounded in the massacre on August
8, but survived the killing.
</P>
<P>
Qare-Husseini said that around 1200 local times, a group of
seven or eight armed Taliban troops entered the Iranian consulate
in Mazari Sharif by force and confined all the 10 Iranians,
including nine diplomats and a correspondent of the official news
agency IRNA, in the consulate to a room.
</P>
<P>
One of the Taliban forces, apparently a Pakistani national,
asked for permission from the Iranians to make a call to Pakistan,
Qare-Husseini said, "we told him that he could use the telephone
to contact with Pakistan, however, he was prevented from making
the call by other Taliban members."
</P>
<P>
"Although we received them very well with water and fruits,
the Taliban forces transferred us to a small basement, putting us
behind a table," he said, then three Taliban soldiers opened fire
on the Iranians inside the basement.
</P>
<P>
Qare-Husseini said, "after one or two shots, I decided to lie
down on the ground to seek shelter under a table and fortunately
the table protected me from three sides, but my friends were
gunned down one by one."
</P>
<P>
"The consul general fell on my feet and was killed instantly,"
he said, "but I tried to control my breathing and closed my eyes
and waited to be martyred."
</P>
<P>
Qare-Husseini said that maybe the Taliban wanted to keep him
alive and left the basement.
</P>
<P>
"After the Taliban forces left the basement, I tried to stand
up, but found I was shot on the leg," the Iranian diplomat said,
however, the wound was not serious and he walked out of the
basement and found no one in the consulate.
</P>
<P>
Qare-Husseini said that he tried to make call twice to Iran but
failed.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, he found two of the Iranians were alive and
decided to go out to find help for the two injured Iranians, he
said, one of the consulate guards who hid inside the kitchen told
him to change his clothes to go out.
</P>
<P>
After disguising himself with Afghan clothes, Qare-Huseini
left the consulate and headed for the region controlled by
the Shiite group, however he was arrested by the Taliban with a
group of Afghans but later was released by a Taliban judge.
</P>
<P>
After fleeing from Mazari Sharif, Qare-Hussein said, he
traveled towards the Iranian border and succeeded to return to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of six iranian diplomats and a correspondent of IRNA
were flown to Tehran Monday night, but the fate of another two
Iranian diplomats were not known. Iran believes that they are
still alive and are in the hands of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been massing troops along Iran-Afghan borders for
military manoeuvres, apparently getting ready for a show-down with
the Afghan Taliban regime which has seized almost 90 percent of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths of the diplomats while the
Taliban has denied direct involvement of the killing.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Supports Iraq's Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Wednesday that
any arrangement to solve northern Iraq issue must be based on
the respect of territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan called on all parties involved in
the negotiations should adopt a cautious attitude in dealing with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The whole problem is to fill the authority vacuum in northern
Iraq. An ultimate settlement should definitely be based on Iraq's
territorial integrity," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the ongoing talks in the United States between
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Massoud Barzani and his
rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
The forces of Barzani and Talabani have been engaged in fierce
fighting for the control of northern Iraq since the Saddam
Hussein government lost the effective control of the area
following the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The KDP has maintained a closer relationship with Ankara
due to its cooperation in fighting Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party militants. The PUK, however, is allegedly backed
by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Utkan stressed that any new plan to be outlined should
not obstruct Turkey's struggle against the PKK which he said
uses northern Iraq as a base to launch terrorist attacks on
Turkey's military and civilian targets.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Seeks Peace Settlement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Wednesday that the United States is pursuing a
negotiated settlement on the Kosovo crisis while doing everything
to avert a humanitarian disaster there.
</P>
<P>
"On Kosovo, the American people should know that we have,
looming there right next door to Bosnia, a significant
humanitarian problem," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The United States is doing "everything we can" to avert the
humanitarian disaster, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton added that the U.S. is also pursuing a "negotiated
settlement" on the crisis in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the U.S. is also doing military
planning with other members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in case diplomatic efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
"While the political and legal situation is not identical to
what we had in Bosnia, the humanitarian issue is similar. And we
don't want a repeat of Bosnia. We don't want another round of
instability there," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"And I think it is imperative that we move forthrightly with
our allies, as firmly as possible, to avert the humanitarian
tragedy, and then to get a political solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, more than 200,000 Kosovo Albanians
have reportedly been displaced from their homes, and Clinton said
that the humanitarian situation is becoming increasingly
precarious as cold weather approaches.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Department spokesman James Foley said there is
"a growing sense of urgency" about NATO planning and increasing
resolve among NATO members to act if the Kosovo situation
deteriorates further.
</P>
<P>
"All options, including the air option, are open," Foley said.
While diplomacy is the best solution, he said, NATO is prepared to
use force if Belgrade "forces us to do so."

<HEADLINE> Annan: UN to Facilitate Implementation of Anti-Landmine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
will facilitate the implementation of the anti-landmine
convention, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remark after Burkina Faso this afternoon became
the 40th State to ratify the "Convention on the Prohibition of the
Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personal Mines
and on Their Destruction", allowing its entry into force in six
months time.
</P>
<P>
"The entry into force of the Convention will have far-reaching
implications for both mine-affected and mine-producing countries.
It will provide the international legal framework upon which
governments who bind themselves to the Convention will be required
to take measures to break the chain of anti-personal landmine
use," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"As called for in the Convention, the United Nations will
facilitate its implementation. Also, through the UN Voluntary
Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance, the United Nations
will continue to play a key role in coordinating the response to
combat landmines," The U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope that all of the world's nations will
promote universal adherence to the principles of the Convention.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Okay 250 Mln Dlrs in Debt Relief for Mali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Wednesday agreed to provide Mali
a total of 250 million U.S. dollars in nominal debt service relief
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's contribution is about 95 million dollars, the
IMF provides about 18 million dollars and the remainder is being
shared by other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the net present value of assistance to be provided
at the completion point in December 1999, HIPC assistance will be
128 million dollars. The stock of debt in the net present value
terms will be reduced to a target of 200 percent of exports, which
represents a 10 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC debt relief committed now by the World Bank and the
IMF will be delivered at a completion point in December 1999,
based on Mali's continued good progress in carrying out its
macroeconomic and structural reform program.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC was launched in September 1996 by the two
international financial institutions as a means of dealing
comprehensively with the debt burdens of the world's poorest
countries. Mali is the 7th country to qualify for assistance under
the initiative following Uganda, Burkina Faso, Bolivia, Guyana,
Cote d'Ivoire and Mozambique. Total debt relief for the seven
countries is expected to amount to almost 6 billion dollars in
nominal terms.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Rise But Off Highes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended
the day on a positive note but off early highs as investors waited
to see how Wall Street would respond to U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended cautiously higher Wednesday, closing
10.0 points up at 5,291.7 as traders waited anxiously for news of
U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Traders were waiting eagerly for a speech by Alan Greenspan,
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, which could give a signal that U.S.
interest rates will be cut.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the French CAC 40 index grew 0.9 percent while
Spanish shares did better, rising 2.7 percent on the back of
extraordinary gains on Latin American markets.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones was 13 points ahead at 8,037 by the London close.
But UK data released Wednesday revealed a mixed picture on the
state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
A bigger than expected fall in average earnings was seen as
good news for inflation, but another fall in unemployment could
prompt the Bank of England to hold off cutting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Traders took heart from comments made by Bank of England
governor Eddie George at the Trade Unions Congress conference,
where he promised to cut rates if inflation fell below government
target levels.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed slightly higher despite a
subdued early performance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax closed at 4,872.18, up 20.62 points from
Tuesday's close. The Dax closed floor trade up 26.75 at 4,857.97.
</P>
<P>
One trader said, "I feel much more confident today as I think
all the bad news has now been priced into shares. I think we will
now start to see the market making a steady climb back up,
reaching the 5,000 level by the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed higher but off their highs as
investors took profits towards the end of the session following
Wall Street's lukewarm opening.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 index finished 31.32 points higher at 3,729.32,
after rising as high as 3,771.78 in early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
One Paris trader said, "Like all European markets, we moved
with Wall Street. Some sector movements kept us higher, however,
like the banks coming up after being so low lately."

<HEADLINE> Angola Wants to Maintain Current Coffee Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola will make a proposal
to maintain the current coffee prices in the international market
during a meeting of African Organization of Coffee in Britain, an
Angolan official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan secretary of state for coffee Gilberto Buta Lutucuta
said this before leaving for London to attend the meeting
scheduled on September 21-25.
</P>
<P>
Lutucuta said Angola hopes to maintain the current world
coffee prices, particularly of the Angolan-produced Robusta
coffee.
</P>
<P>
At present, one kilogram of the Robusta coffee fetches 1.60
U.S. Dollars in the international market while one kilogram of
the Arabian coffee is sold for 3.20 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The price of any kind of product must be fixed properly," the
secretary of state noted. "To make profit from international
trade, they have to fetch practical and fair prices."
</P>
<P>
During the coming coffee conference, export quota will be
reset for each coffee producing country in order to maintain and
even raise the prices of coffee.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said coffee output in Angola is
expected to reach 10,000 tons, but due to many unpredictable
factors, Angola might gather in only 5,000 tons of coffee this
year.
</P>
<P>
Angola boasts of a century-long history of coffee growing. In
1974, its coffee output hit a record of 225,000 tons, ranking the
second in Africa and the fourth in the world.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Pay Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) were urged Wednesday to
pay their contributions to the regional body's court of justice
so that iu could begin to function properly.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first session of the Lusaka-based COMESA court of
justice, Alfeyo Hambayi, acting minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, said out of the 20 member states only three have paid
their contributions to the court's budget, Zambia News Agency
ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi also urged the international community to extend its
assistance to the court of justice to ensure its smooth
operations.
</P>
<P>
"The court largely needs financial resources for capacity
building, equipment, furniture and transport," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi further called on the judges of the court to maintain
independence on the bench and adjudicate fairly on matters before
them if the COMESA community is to have confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, COMESA acting secretary general
Sindiso Ngwenya said the court of justice will ensure the
adherence to the rule of law in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the court of justice shall benefit the process
of economic integration as it would provide one integrated strong
judicial body with one registry.
</P>
<P>
"As COMESA moves toward the establishment of a free trade area
by the year 2000, there will be increasing demand for proper
interpretation of the COMESA trade regime," Ngwenya said.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA court of justice which comprises 11 judges was
established two months ago. It offers a means to redress unfairly
disadvantaged producers and traders in the region.
</P>
<P>
The progress to establish such a court was made at the COMESA
summit held in Lusaka last year. The court which has never been
operational siCOMESA came into being in 1994 will arbitrate
and preside on cases involving unfair trade practices,
interpretation of the COMESA treaty provisions and ensure that
member states implement and comply with agreed decision.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Public Opinion Favors Censuring Clinton  Rather than Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Public opinion after the
release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report remains in
favor of censuring President Bill Clinton rather than impeaching
him or seeking his resignation.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News-New York Times poll released Tuesday and a CNN/USA
Today/Gallup poll released Wednesday show Clinton maintaining a
robust job approval rating above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
A majority of Americans still oppose ousting Clinton from
office, with the CBS-Times poll finding 58 percent against
beginning impeachment hearings over his affair with a White House
intern and effort to cover it up, and 64 percent saying they do
not think Clinton should resign. But 57 percent believe Congress
should censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today poll found 45 percent favoring a reprimand or
censure, but allowing Clinton to remain in office. However, 50
percent favored congressional hearings to investigate the charges
in the report and, among likely voters, 58 percent favored
hearings.
</P>
<P>
The public remains critical of Clinton's personal behavior.
Sixty-six percent of those polled in the CBS-Times survey said
Clinton does not share the moral values that most Americans try to
live by, and 45 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
And the CNN-USA Today survey found a statistical dead heat over
who people preferred to have more influence over the direction the
nation takes in the next year: 44 percent Clinton and 43 percent
the Republicans in Congress. Among likely voters, 50 percent
wanted the Republican to have more influence and 38 percent
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The same survey of likely voters found 48 percent are likely
for vote Democratic in the upcoming congressional elections and 47
percent Republican.
</P>
<P>
The CBS-Times telephone poll of 1,813 adults conducted between
September 12-14 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today survey of 1,028 adults September 14-15 had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The subgroup
of 401 likely voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Double Trade Experts in Africa: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States
plans to double its trade specialists in Africa and triple the
number of countries with commerce offices in the continent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan was unveiled by U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Daley, who arrived here Wednesday for a brief visit to
bring a positive commercial message against the backdrop of the
tragic bombings last month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Sheraton Hotel in Dar es
Salaam, Daley said the plan includes opening a Foreign Commerce
Service in Dar es Salaam to be staffed with one American and two
Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
"I will fight to make that happen," said Daley, who has been
the third senior government official who visited Tanzania since
the bombing of the U.S. embassy, following Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and the Director of the Federal Bureau of
Ilvestigation (FBI) Louis Freech who came here last month.
</P>
<P>
"We are developing an African Commercial Strategy at the
Commerce Department," he said, adding that he wishes every agency
under his leadership to tighten ties with Africa and all people
in the society to lend support.
</P>
<P>
Daley said: "I want every agency at Commerce to ask: how can
we strengthen our partnership with Africa? I want our weather
forecasters, our patent lawyers, our telecommunication experts,
our scientists, our economists to help."
</P>
<P>
The United States is ready to be a full partner in Tanzania's
-- and this region's -- economic development. Last year, two-way
trade reached 92 million U.S. Dollars, compared with 65 million
in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Daley said this year he will spend more time in Africa than
Latin America, Europe, Asia or any other part of the world. "This
is very different from past years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on August 7, he said, the Commerce Department lost two
employees -- both Kenyans. Four others were injured, two very
seriously. Altogether it has 48 employees in Africa stationed in
five countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the terrorist attacks, which killed more than 260
people and injured 5,000 others, have interrupted his planned
trade mission to Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said he has come to Dar es Salaam to see the situation
first-hand, and convey the message that the Clinton
administration is committed to help "rebuild both lives and
property."
</P>
<P>
Daley disclosed that the U.S. Congress is studying a proposal
for aid to help Tanzanians rebuild after the August 7 bombing of
the U.S. embassy in Dar Es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Before flying to Nairobi, Kenya Wednesday afternoon, Daley had
held talks with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Iddi
Simba, the Minister of Industries and Commerce, and toured the
bombed embassy site where he laid a wreath.
</P>
<P>
Daley had earlier visited South Africa, where a bomb blast
ripped through U.S.-franchise Planet Hollywood restaurant on
August 26.
" He will return to Africa in December for a five-nation tour
accompanied by a large group of U.S. business leaders seeking to
promote links and investments in the chemical, car,
telecommunications and energy sectors.

<HEADLINE> Museveni: Security in Uganda Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni told Parliamentarians Wednesday afternoon that security
in the country has been improved.
</P>
<P>
In a speech which briefed the MPs on the crisis of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Museveni said insecurity is
diminishing as the capacity of the state grows.
</P>
<P>
"Ugandans should be grateful to the National Resistance
Movement for building a powerful and cohesive national army which
is the base of all the growing security. It is a remarkable
achievement bearing in mind the starting point following the
collapse of the old Ugandan army," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in the north cannot establish a zone of control as
the Sudan People's Liberation Army has done in Sudan or the
Congolese rebels are doing in eastern Congo. This demonstrates
the capacity of the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF).
</P>
<P>
That is why the rebels resort to terrorist attacks on
defenseless civilians rather than on the barracks of the UPDF, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The security task now is to stop these cowardly attacks on
civilians, he said, arguing that to compromise with terrorism is
to invite more of it.
</P>
<P>
With the support of MPs for the army and security in general,
he said he is confident that terrorism will eventually be
eliminated from his country.

<HEADLINE> Angola Wants to Maintain Current Coffee Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola will make a proposal
to maintain the current coffee prices in the international market
during a meeting of African Organization of Coffee in Britain, an
Angolan official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan secretary of state for coffee Gilberto Buta Lutucuta
said this before leaving for London to attend the meeting
scheduled on September 21-25.
</P>
<P>
Lutucuta said Angola hopes to maintain the current world
coffee prices, particularly of the Angolan-produced Robusta
coffee.
</P>
<P>
At present, one kilogram of the Robusta coffee fetches 1.60
U.S. Dollars in the international market while one kilogram of
the Arabian coffee is sold for 3.20 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The price of any kind of product must be fixed properly," the
secretary of state noted. "To make profit from international
trade, they have to fetch practical and fair prices."
</P>
<P>
During the coming coffee conference, export quota will be
reset for each coffee producing country in order to maintain and
even raise the prices of coffee.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said coffee output in Angola is
expected to reach 10,000 tons, but due to many unpredictable
factors, Angola might gather in only 5,000 tons of coffee this
year.
</P>
<P>
Angola boasts of a century-long history of coffee growing. In
1974, its coffee output hit a record of 225,000 tons, ranking the
second in Africa and the fourth in the world.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Pay Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) were urged Wednesday to
pay their contributions to the regional body's court of justice
so that it could begin to function properly.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first session of the Lusaka-based COMESA court of
justice, Alfeyo Hambayi, acting minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, said out of the 20 member states only three have paid
their contributions to the court's budget, Zambia News Agency
ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi also urged the international community to extend its
assistance to the court of justice to ensure its smooth
operations.
</P>
<P>
"The court largely needs financial resources for capacity
building, equipment, furniture and transport," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi further called on the judges of the court to maintain
independence on the bench and adjudicate fairly on matters before
them if the COMESA community is to have confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, COMESA acting secretary general
Sindiso Ngwenya said the court of justice will ensure the
adherence to the rule of law in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the court of justice shall benefit the process
of economic integration as it would provide one integrated strong
judicial body with one registry.
</P>
<P>
"As COMESA moves toward the establishment of a free trade area
by the year 2000, there will be increasing demand for proper
interpretation of the COMESA trade regime," Ngwenya said.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA court of justice which comprises 11 judges was
established two months ago. It offers a means to redress unfairly
disadvantaged producers and traders in the region.
</P>
<P>
The progress to establish such a court was made at the COMESA
summit held in Lusaka last year. The court which has never been
operational since COMESA came into being in 1994 will arbitrate
and preside on cases involving unfair trade practices,
interpretation of the COMESA treaty provisions and ensure that
member states implement and comply with agreed decision.

<HEADLINE> Earth Citizens Urged to Buy Ozone-Friendly Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Every citizen on earth
can help preserve ozone layer by buying only ozone-friendly
products, said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the International Day for the
Preservation of the Ozone Layer, Annan said this year's theme is
"For life on earth: Buy ozone-friendly."
</P>
<P>
"Such choices can not only prod industries to switch to
ozone-friendly technologies, but can also help reduce illegal
trade and ensure that countries fulfill their obligations under
the Montreal Protocol," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a reduction of over 80 percent in the production and
consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals in the last 10 years, the
risk to tomorrow's health and well-being remains acute as mankind
faces many challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the ozone layer will begin in a few years and
will take up to the year 2060 to complete due to the long lifetime
of the chemicals in the atmosphere, Annan said, calling the
depletion of ozone layer "the first major global environmental
issue to be tackled by the U.N. system."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. system first took the issue of ozone depletion in
1976 and the 1987 Montreal Protocol set up phase-out schedules
for different countries according to their development levels.
</P>
<P>
Due to the fact that developed nations are responsible for the
bulk of total emissions into the atmosphere, developing countries
have been given a grace period of 10 years and will begin their
phase-out in 1999.

<HEADLINE> 85 Percent Zambian Children in School: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Education Minister
Godfrey Miyanda said Wednesday that only 85 percent Zambian
school-age children are accepted in schools, according to Zambia
News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
While opening an appraisal mission here on the Basic Education
Sub-sector Investment Program (BESSIP), Miyanda said a
significant number of those Zambian children who enroll in grade
one are unable to go to higher grades especially in grades four
and five while 37 percent of the grade seven le};2rs are unable
to progress further.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda pointed out that out of the country's population of
9.5 million people, 1.5 million were school-age children between
seven and 13 years and of this number over 650,000 including
250,000 orphans are not in school.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the number of orphans in Zambia will reach
600,000 by the year 2000 with the associated problems of an
increasing number of child-headed households brought about by the
problem of HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The education minister also noted that quality of education
has been affected by a lack of adequate teaching and learning
materials at all levels of education while at primary level the
system is characterized by double and triple sessions leading to
short learning time.
</P>
<P>
According to Miyanda, the Education Ministry has received
between 1990 and 1996 an average of 13 percent of the total
budget allocation which is far below the regional average of 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said a chronic underfunding of the education sector due to
the country's overall poor economic decline is a main factor that
hinders the development of education. Enditfm

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Opposition May Reject Poll Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's opposition
parties have threatened to reject the report on fraud allegations
in Lesotho's general election, which South Afric!$said would be
released Thursday, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Frank Chikane, secretary-general of South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's office, told reporters Wednesday that the
report would be finally handed over to the Lesotho people
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki failed to release the report last Wednesday. Instead, he
withheld it so that the presidents of the troika guarantors of
Lesotho's democracy -- South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe --
could view the contents first.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that Lesotho opposition parties may reject the
report.
</P>
<P>
Bosotholand Congress Party leader Malapo Qhobela told South
Africa's SABC television that he was on the verge of telling the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders who delayed
the report's release that it was no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
"Very soon we shall take a decision that these people, who are
running up and down with the property of this nation (the
report), can keep it... we no longer need it. Very soon we shall
say so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qhobela accused the SADC leaders of sidelining the report to
plan military action against Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Chikane explained that the delay in releasing the report had
been caused by the logistical problems of getting the leaders of
the troika countries in the same place at the same time. There
was nothing sinister in the delay. The report was intact and it
had not been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
He accused protesters of using the delay as an excuse for
further agitation.
